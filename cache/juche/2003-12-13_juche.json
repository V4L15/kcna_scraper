            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Arbitrary Practices in 2003\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The year 2003 witnessed more arrogant arbitrary practices for hegemony on the part of the United States and intensified contradiction, conflict and struggle between the U.S. and the forces opposed to it.\r\n The Bush administration launched a war of aggression against Iraq in March after setting out the conception of an \"axis of evil\" and the theory of \"preemptive attack\" and disclosing its undisguised attempt at aggression against sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war which was the focus in the international situation this year was a crime and arbitrary practice the U.S. committed in violation of international justice, principles and laws and regulations concerning the war in view of the pretext under which the war was launched, its purpose, its ways and process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the end of the Persian Gulf War, the U.S. had systematically weakened the state power of Iraq by putting strong political and economic pressure and sanctions on it and mounting frequent military attacks on it under the pretext of its possession of weapons of mass destruction (WMD). It urged the UN weapons inspection teams to scour even the presidential palace and completely disarmed the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. finally provoked a war against this country under the pretext of eliminating WMD despite strong opposition of the international community including the UN and its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which had cried out for the elimination of WMD massively used during the war such WMD as cluster bombs and depleted uranium shells whose use is prohibited from a humanitarian point of view, killing many peaceable civilians and destroying cities and major objects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. arbitrary practices were not limited to Iraq only.  Last year the U.S. listed the DPRK, Iraq and Iran as an \"axis of evil\" and sparked a new nuclear crisis on the Korean peninsula. This year it deteriorated the situation under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" and escalated its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and provoke a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuant to the strategy of \"preemptive attack\" of the Bush administration, aggressor forces including a flotilla of carriers were additionally deployed in Asia-Pacific and new \"arms buildup plan\" was made public under the pretext of the \"reorganization of the U.S. forces\" and the preparations for the relocation of the U.S. troops in south Korea and the transfer of their military bases have been stepped up in real earnest this year under the simulated conditions of \"emergency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. instigated anti-governmental forces of Iran to create a political chaos under the signboard of \"democratization\" and the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" and worked hard to bedevil its cooperation with Russia and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington's arbitrary practices found a clear manifestation in the trite double-dealing tactics it employed through \"aid\" and \"sanctions\" to engineer political coups and rally its stooges in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large anti-governmental demonstration in Georgia in November and regime change in the wake of the resignation of Shevardnadze and a political coup staged in Venezuela to remove its President Chavez from office were all planned and engineered by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. limited military aid to six European countries including Bulgaria for the mere reason that they failed to prevent international criminal court from trying Americans and enforced an appeasement policy of partial withdrawal from Iraq and Afghanistan to bring the unfavorable situation under control. All this eloquently proves the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices against sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist arbitrary practices were, however, rebuffed by the international community advocating independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tens of millions of people staged anti-U.S. demonstrations against the Iraqi war from the outset of this year and even Americans from all walks of life joined in this campaign against the Bush administration's war moves. This struggle continued all the year round. This movement for peace against war has developed to be worldwide anti-war actions despite the U.S \"war against terrorism\" since the \"September 11 incident\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deplorable developments in 2003 in which the U.S. arbitrary practices for hegemony brought disastrous consequences to humankind in the 21st century are casting a shadow on the Bush administration's chance of success in the next year's presidential election.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
