He underscored the need to establish the \"Missile Defense\" system (MD) to force the DPRK, etc. to \"abandon their missile development.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing this as sophism intended to justify the U.S. moves to establish MD censured and rejected worldwide under the pretext of the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK, the commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is, in fact, the world's biggest nuclear and missile possessor and exporter. \r\n It is none other than the U.S. which develops and produces more missiles than any other powers in the world and it is again the U.S. which is hell-bent on threatening and blackmailing other countries with missiles after massively stockpiling them in different parts of the world. \r\n The hue and cry persistently raised by the U.S. hawkish quarters over the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK are intended to attain a more sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plans to deploy in the waters close to the DPRK \"aegis\" ships equipped with sophisticated interceptor system capable of detecting and striking several targets simultaneously under the absurd pretext of repelling \"missile attacks\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is its true intention to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK any time with a huge missile force after deploying it in areas near the DPRK under the pretext of \"coping with the threat\" from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. hawkish forces do not stop letting loose sheer sophism as part of its shameless anti-DPRK smear campaign, this will only further aggravate the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n"
