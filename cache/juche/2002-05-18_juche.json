As a counter-measure, the anti-DPRK forces are trying to work out and open to the public a \"list of anti-U.S. and pro-north forces\" after forming the \"committee for the promotion of the work to open to the public a list of pro-north leftist forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman in a statement issued on May 18 said this is the last-ditch effort of the pro-U.S. and anti-reunification elements to incite the confrontation between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland bitterly denounces the moves of South Korea's vicious anti-communist elements to work out the \"list of anti-U.S. and pro-north forces\", branding this as an unpardonable anti-national and anti-reunification criminal attempt to block the patriotic advance of the South Korean people for the independent national reunification and perpetuate the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule over South Korea and the division of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We express belief that the people from all walks of life in South Korea will firmly unite and carry on their valiant anti-U.S., anti-Japanese patriotic struggle to achieve the independent reunification of the country at an early date by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n"

This cannot be construed otherwise than a trite ruse intended to tarnish the image of the DPRK and destabilize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the commission is truly concerned about the religious issue, it should do something to straighten out the deplorable religious situation in the U.S. before talking about religious practices in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. deny the fact that Islam and other religions are regarded as heretic and many religionists are subject to constant watch, persecution and crackdown by the authorities there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the last Korean War, U.S. forces severely destroyed all religious facilities in Korea and took many lives of Korean religionists. How can the DPRK tolerate accusations made by the U.S. against the DPRK, far from apologizing for the above-said criminal suppression of religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S dishonest forces should deeply repent of their behaviour before clamouring about the non-existent religious issue in the DPRK.\r\n"

Lurking behind the call made by the Japan defense agency chief for the use of force, claiming that the appearance of a \"mysterious ship\" etc. should be considered as an event of \"armed attack,\" is their intention to mount a military attack on the DPRK.\r\n\r\n"

However, they have not yet been freed from the shackles of the U.S. colonial slavery nor achieved their cherished desire for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Owing to the vicious moves of the U.S. war hawks and the conservative forces, a touch-and-go situation where a nuclear war may break out anytime is prevailing in the Korean peninsula and the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration is facing a grave challenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article called for carrying forward the noble spirit of the Kwangju Popular Uprising to open up a fresh phase of independent national reunification this year under the uplifted banner of the joint declaration.\r\n"

They had defended the city for ten days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The uprising was quelled by bloody suppression and at least 5,000 patriots were killed and many innocent people were wounded in that period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a singed article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was chiefly responsible for the brutal crackdown upon the uprising. But it has not yet admitted its responsibility but pursued a policy of occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military presence in South Korea has been harmful to the socio-political life of the South Korean people and national reunification. Inestimable is the damage they have suffered due to the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is leaving no means untried to obstruct the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reality goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is a heinous aggressor and the sworn enemy of the Korean people as it seeks to meet its interests at the sacrifice of the Korean nation and it is impossible to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and national security and achieve the reunification of the country unless an end is put to the u.s. policy of military occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The departed soul of martyrs in Kwangju calls upon the South Korean people to launch an anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean people will surely turn out in a massive struggle for independence and national reunification against the U.S. and thus punish the aggressors and traitors and force them to pay a thousand times for the blood shed by the Kwangju Uprisers.\r\n\r\n"
