Particularly, the present chief executive and ruling forces of Japan visited the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" several times and are attempting to revise the pacifist constitution and revealing their ambition for overseas expansion in a bid to step up their moves for militarization. They are openly revealing their territorial ambition and aggressive attempt by compiling history textbook beautifying the history of aggression and claiming dominium over Tok islet, which shows that Japanese politicians have no remorse of conscience on their crimes of having not liquidated the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, Japan's attempt to have a cardinal seat at the UN the purpose of which is to promote world peace and security and economic and cultural cooperation among countries is an impudent act and a challenge to the world people aspiring after world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not accidental that as regards Japan's move to advance into permanent nations of the UNSC a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry said in a press conference on September 21 that Japan should have a clear understanding of the issue of history if it is to play a role of a responsible country in the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The liquidation of the past is the issue of legal and moral responsibility of the Japanese government and only doing so is a just behavior of Japan to play its role as a UN membership and a member of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to clearly liquidate its past crimes it committed against the Korean and Asian peoples and get trust from these countries, before coveting a responsible seat of the UN.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was prompted by a heinous intention to stifle the DPRK at any cost by all wicked and base means, the spokesman said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the crime-woven history of the U.S. stained with aggression and war and the present complicated international situation prove, the U.S. is the worst state of suppressing religion in the world and the ringleader of obliterating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous that the U.S., bereft of elementary qualification to say of the freedom of religious belief, is talking about the religion policy of the DPRK as if it were an \"international judge of religion\" and it is ignorance of religious idea and mockery of religionists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the religionists in the DPRK will consolidate its single-hearted unity as firm as a rock and fulfill their honorable responsibility and role in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and in the era of the independent reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, with the high degree of consciousness and pride of being citizens of the socialist country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman called upon the world progressive people and international religious communities aspiring after love, justice and peace to see through the real nature of the U.S. base religious moves and anti-DPRK moves and extend positive support and encouragement to the just voices of the Korean people against them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Truth of South Korea-U.S. Alliance Disclosed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Friday 51 years after the conclusion of the south Korea-U.S. \"defence treaty.\" It disclosed the truth about the \"alliance\" between the U.S. and south Korea which the U.S. and pro-U.S. flunkeys and traitors in south Korea paint as relations between the friendly nations and those of partnership.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The alliance between south Korea and the U.S. is the master-servant relationship: The U.S. dominates political, economic, military and all other fields of south Korea and it serves its American master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After setting its feet in south Korea on September 8, 1945 the U.S. forcibly dismantled people's committees organized by south Koreans according to their own will and proclaimed its military rule. After bringing pro-U.S. stooge Syngman Rhee to south Korea  the U.S. staged the traitorous \"separate election\" on May 10, 1948 to install the first puppet regime with him as president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 16 presidential elections and 17 National Assembly elections have taken place in south Korea since then but all of them proved to be politicalfarces orchestrated by the U.S. according to its scenarios. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the U.S. which engineered the May 16 military coup, the December 12 army purge coup and the June 29 bloodless coup that gave rise to the military fascist dictatorial rule in south Korea. Pro-U.S. stooge Kim Young Sam also became its president under the backstage manipulation of Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"agreement on the transfer of prerogative of supreme command over the army\" signed between the then UN Forces Commander McArthur and traitor Syngman Rhee on July 15, 1950 resulted in transferring this prerogative to the U.S. The prerogative has since been in the hands of the U.S. forces ommander in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"defence treaty\" concluded between the U.S. and south Korea on October 1, 1953 was a traitorous treaty as it proclaimed south Korea as a permanent colony and military base of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"agreement on economic and technological assistance \" or \"new agreement on economic assistance\" which was signed between south Korea and the U.S. on February 8, 1961 stipulates that the U.S. shall decide on the nature and scope of assistance and directly supervise and control the processes of consumption and sale of aid goods and south Korea unconditionally obey the U.S. allegedly with a view to ensuring an effective use of aid materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As early as in the mid-1960s the U.S. put under its control the large portion of financial budget and capital of south Korea and monopolized 70-80 percent of raw materials to be supplied and 80 percent of foreign trade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities, yielding to the U.S. pressure to open markets, cut down an average of 5-20 percent of tariffs on 278 items of imports including vehicles, computers, building equipment, tools, tobacco, etc. on four occasions in the year 1987 alone. From January 1988 they decided to reduce the same percentage of tariff on 194 items of imports including all kinds of films and printing papers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The latter half of the 1990s when south Korea was placed under the IMF mandate were years when the U.S. disclosed its black-hearted intention by driving the south Korean economy into serious bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to official information available after the conclusion of the south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" in July 1966, more than 2,000 cases of crimes were reported to have been committed by GIs every year but none of them were subject to criminal jurisdiction of the south Korean authorities according to the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea has paid the U.S. forces stationed in south Korea billions of dollars raised as taxes collected from the people every year for the up-keep of the U.S. military bases and its aggression troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the three-year long Korean war the U.S. imperialists massacred at least 1.24 million innocent civilians in all parts of south Korea. Even in the post-war period GIs cruelly killed innocent civilians, regarding them as preys, playthings and inferiors of a colony. They did not hesitate to commit such shuddering crimes as raping south Korean women in broad daylight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was attributable to the south Korea-U.S. alliance designed to fabricate two Koreas that the Korean nation's desire to set up a democratic reunified state after its liberation could not come true and the spirit of alliance with the north for reunification that was mounting in south Korea in the 1960s under the slogan of \"Let's go to the north, come to the south and let's meet at Panmunjom!\" was chilled and the July 4 Joint Statement clarifying the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--and the north-south \"agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange\" were reduced to dead documents, failing to take even the first step towards its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This traitorous south Korea-U.S. alliance also threw a serious hurdle in the way of implementing the June 15 joint declaration, a landmark for reunification common to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Team Spirit, Foal Eagle, Ulji-Focus Lens and other anti-north joint military exercises staged under various codenames and reckless military provocations perpetrated against the north almost every day were, without an exception, products of the alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The past 59 years of the south Korea-U.S. relations have been, in fact, a history of disgrace and disasters as the national dignity and sovereignty have been wantonly encroached upon and anything national and democratic cruelly violated in all fabrics of social life and a crime-woven history in which the Korean nation's uniform progress has been hampered and the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula have been exposed to a serious threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should not allow the south Korea-U.S. relations characterized by cooperation for treachery, permanent division and war to go beyond 60 years.    \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard, Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary dismisses the U.S. assertion as an entirely groundless fabrication, as claimed by the American public.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly hopes for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue it should withdraw its wrong assertion about the DPRK's \"uranium enrichment program\" and approach the negotiations with a sincere attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's relations with various countries expanded as the days go by in the new century, driving the U.S. attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK into total failure. Much upset by this, the U.S. sought a new pretext for keeping the Korean peninsula unstable in the nuclear issue, the issue of \"enriched uranium.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After fabricating the story about the above-said program, the Bush group worked hard to get even a nuclear expert of a third country involved in the issue in a bid to make it sound plausible. After all, they cited the non-existent DPRK \"uranium program\" to charge it with nuclear development and pressured other countries to regard its settlement as a precondition for improving relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. knows well that the DPRK does not admit this \"uranium program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYet, the U.S. is dramatizing it in a bid to isolate the DPRK internationally, disarm and stifle it come what may. This is what the U.S. is really seeking in the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can browbeat the DPRK with the assertion about the fictitious \"uranium enrichment program.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
