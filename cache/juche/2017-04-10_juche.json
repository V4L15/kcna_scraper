The U.S. seeks to stifle the DPRK by force at any cost, even discarding any decency and impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It shows the true colors of the U.S. styling itself the world's \"judge\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Emboldened by their master's unfair double standards and double-dealing attitude of making profound confusion of right and wrong, the south Korean puppet warmongers and the Japanese reactionaries, are now going reckless, not afraid of any punishment from the Heaven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by its self-righteous and unilateral actions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warmongers and the Japanese reactionaries had better stop behaving foolishly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The brigandish double standards of the U.S. can never be pardoned."
