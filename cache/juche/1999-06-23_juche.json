These are very dangerous developments. It means a declaration of an all-out war against the north that a plan to start a war against the north was formally ratified at the \"National Assembly.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The enemy is seeking justification for agitating a war against the north in its \"intrusion into the northern limit line and armed provocations\". This is a brigandish logic reminding one of a thief turning on the master with a club. It is nothing but an intolerable and shameless sophism.It is none other than the South Korean war hawks who have infiltrated their warships deep into the north side's territorial waters and ceaselessly committed armed provocations. This is  an undeniable stark reality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These reckless military provocations in  waters off the west coast fully reveal the bellicose nature of the South Korean warmongers  who  attacked the north first and then  described its decisive self-defence measure of strongly countering them as \"provocations\" and  are going to ignite a war against it under that pretext.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that  an attempt to unleash a war against the north  was revealed at the South Korean \"National Assembly\" at a time when U.S. conservative hard-liners do not bother to let loose such bellicose remarks as urging the U.S. congress  to take a military option against the DPRK following the Yugoslav crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nReaching the extremes are the provocations on the part of the South Korean war hawks to ignite a war of aggression on the north at whatever cost, backed by the United States that has finally  rounded off \"operation plan 5027-98\" for an preemptive attack on the DPRK through the Yugoslav war.   But this is as foolish as a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger.   We will mercilessly  retaliate against the provokers and make them pay  a high price. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Il Sung, the greatest-ever commander \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The President Kim Il Sung was the outstanding military strategist and the greatest-ever invincible commander.   His greatness as a military genius was clearly demonstrated in the two revolutionary wars fought against imperialist aggressors.   He fought against the one million strong Japanese imperialist army for 15 years, with neither home front nor support of a regular army. He made the Japanese shudder with his unique guerrilla war methods. He finally defeated them and liberated the country on August 15, 1945.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-july 1953)  fought against the U.S. aggressors he led the whole party, the entire army and all the people with his extraordinary intelligence, stratagem, strong faith and will, matchless grit and courage, ardent passion and benevolence,  working miracles unprecedented in the war history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While preparing for the Korean War, the U.S. imperialists made the bravado before the world that their victory was  certain and it was a matter of time.\r\nAnd they hurled into the war huge armed forces more than two million including their three services armed with up-to-date combat equipment, armies of 15 satellite countries, the South Korean Army and the Japanese militarist armed forces and huge  quantities of up-to-date combat  and technical equipment. They employed the most  cruel and brutal methods and means in the war including chemical and germ weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time the DPRK was just freed from the yoke of the colonial slavery.\r\n   But the enemy lost in the Korean war more than 1.567 million strong effective including over 405,000 strong U.S. forces, some 12,200 planes, 3,250 tanks and armored vehicles, 560 warships of different types, more than 13,000 trucks, 7,695 artillery pieces and other fabulous combat and technical equipment. This is almost 2.3 times the loss sustained by the U.S. imperialists in the four-year pacific war. They  suffered one bitter defeat after another everywhere, quite contrary to their original plan to win victory with ease.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The then U.S. president, Eisenhower, Macarthur, Ridgway, Clark, Walker, Van fleet, Dean and other commanders of the \"UN forces command\" and brass-hats became objects of many cartoons as defeated generals.   Korea's victory in the war  was something unprecedented and  beyond the expectations of bourgeois militarists.   The Fatherland Liberation War was  commanded by the legendary hero Kim Il Sung who embarked upon the road of revolution in his teens to unfold the Juche-based grand program for army building and defeated the one million strong Japanese army in his twenties.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was famous for so many original strategies, tactics and war methods created by him  with his extraordinary military intelligence and distinguished stratagem. They included the strategy of  going over to prompt and all-out counter-attack, a modern encirclement battle, the formation of the second front  with powerful regular armed forces behind the enemy  line, a positive position defence battle and an intensive use of artillery fire in mountainous areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the world progressives are unsparing in their praises  of Kim Il Sung, who defeated U.S. and Japanese imperialism in one generation and defended the dignity of the country and the nation, as the greatest commander and hero.  \r\n\r\n"

In this context, to give \"suffrage\" to Koreans in Japan first is like putting the cart before the horse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThat day, vice-chairman of the Chongryon central standing committee O Hyong Jin met Japanese Minister of Autonomy Takeshi Nota and  requested him to treat the \"suffrage\" issue with caution.

They also sent four battleships between 09:05 and 09:45 and another two between 13:40 and 14:10, threatening our peaceful fishing boats bent on fishing operations.   On June 22, they also illegally infiltrated eight battleships into our territorial waters on four occasions.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs is already known, frequent infiltration being made by the South Korean battleships, manipulated and backed by the U.S., are deliberate and premeditated 6moves to spark another bloody gun-firing in the waters, shift the responsibility on to the DPRK and find a pretext for a new war.   Nowadays, the South Korean authorities are acting more rashly with the backing of the U.S.    However, their behaviour is as foolish as jumping from the frying pan into the fire.   Once again, we warn the South Korean authorities to stop naval provocations which will ruin themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
