Korea joint war exercises under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The joint war exercises launched by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean bellicose forces are dangerous maneuvers for offensive operations to invade the north as they are chiefly aimed to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula, say papers here today in signed commentaries.\r\n It is the U.S. imperialists' invariable ambition to contain the DPRK by force of arms and put the whole of Korea under its control, observes Rodong Sinmun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists drew up even a scenario to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK after deploying huge aggression forces in and around the Korean Peninsula.  It is by no means a hypothesis that they seek to launch a total war against the DPRK all of a sudden while staging these joint war exercises under the simulated conditions of an actual war in the area close to the military demarcation line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., seized by war hysteria, seeks to launch a nuclear war in a bid to stifle socialism, a life and soul of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut this only lays bare the brigandish nature of U.S. imperialism and threatens peace on the Korean Peninsula and the security of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to this sabre-rattling of the U.S. imperialists and the south korean war hawks the nation's security is exposed to a grave threat. This situation compels the DPRK to take a corresponding option for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK clarified more than once, it neither wants a war nor avoids it. Limitless is its option for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the aggressors ignite a war on this land at any cost, they will face punishment unprecedented in war history and will be bound to drink a bitter cup of defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the DPRK values the nation's dignity and sovereignty more than anything else and, therefore, will mercilessly retaliate against those who dare encroach upon them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
