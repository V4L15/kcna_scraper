This method has now been introduced in bean paste factories and homes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently, bean paste holds widespread attention after the scientific corroboration of its immense benefit for health, particularly as a good functional food. The functional foodstuff refers to such foods able to prevent cancer and other adult diseases hard to cure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Bean paste is acknowledged to function as antioxidant, prevent the transmutation of cell tissues, reduce the content of cholesterol in blood, protect against radioactivity and control the multiplication virus. \r\n\r\n"

Its total plottage is more than 30 hectares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The tower body is composed of 70 granite blocks, the front and the rear 18 blocks each and the two sides 17 blocks each. It was built in such a way as to represent a pile of Kim Il Sung's works. 25,550 large and small granite blocks symbolize the glorious days of his 70 year-long revolutionary activity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two faces, front and rear of the tower body bear the letters \"Juche\". The torch, 20 metres in height, serves to emphasize the effect of the burning flame. At night the illuminated torch looks like a real torch in flame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The tower is decorated with at least 250 choice stone pieces sent by heads of state of 10 countries, personages of different social standings of over 80 countries, international organizations and Juche idea study organizations. They are inscribed with letters praising the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Placed in front of the tower is a group sculpture of a worker, a farmer and an intellectual holding a hammer, a sickle and a writing brush, the emblem of the Worker's Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a monument to an ode praising the revolutionary feats and benevolence of the President in front of the tower pedestal. Erected on both sides of the tower are 6 subsidiary sculptures which show the vitality of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two huge fountains send up 150-metre jets of water in the midstream of the river. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The erection of the Tower of the Juche Idea was completed in two years under the dynamic guidance of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

It is bounded on the three sides by the sea. So, it is called a maritime country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has an area of more than 222,200 square kilometers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe North Korea has an area of more than 122,760 square kilometers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The terrain is predominantly mountainous. Nearly 80 percent of the land area is mountainous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea has splendid mountains and rivers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn particular, Paektu, Kumgang, Myohyang, Chilbo, Kuwol and other mountains are well known for their beautiful landscape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mt. Paektu that soars imposingly in the northern tip of the country stands 2,750 metres high above sea level, the highest in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mountain is called Mt. Paektu for its peaks look covered with white snow all the year round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJanggun, Hyangdo, Ssangmujigae and other peaks of the mountain and Lake Chon on the top of it look like a land of mystery. The sunrise above the thick forests of the mountain of which you may command a bird's-eye view presents a spectacular sight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Preserved in Mt. Paektu area is a time-honored native home of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. The area is associated with the history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle of the President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mt. Kumgang in the east coast of Korea is, from old times, a pride of Korea and one of the noted mountains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   12,000 peaks soaring high, mysterious rocks and cliffs, pure and clean water flowing down from many ponds and pools, numerous waterfalls with a rainbow and autumn-tinted mountain present a scenery beyond description. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBesides Korea has many scenic spots, including moran hill in Pyongyang, Yaksandong Hill in North Phyongan Province, Pakyon Fall in Kaesong, Songdowon in the east coast, Monggum and Kumi ferries in the west coast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also has cultural remains and relics that show a long history of the nation and grand monumental edifices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are many famous hot springs and highly efficacious spas in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea belongs to a typical temperate zone. The average annual temperature is 10 degrees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The four seasons are distinct. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Signature campaign of world peace organizations supported \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The Korean National Peace Committee in a letter to world peace organizations on March 14 expressed full support to the signature campaign conducted by the world peace organizations including \"globe net\", a movement for peace and disarmament, considering it to be a good occasion to draw keen attention and awareness of the world people to the U.S. criminal war moves and build up strong world public opinion calling for putting pressure on the arrogant United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n\"Globe net\" and other world peace organizations are conducting a brisk worldwide signature campaign against the establishment of the U.S. \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system (TMD) and moves to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles targeted against the DPRK and other countries, keeping in close touch with \"citizens network\" for peace on the Korean peninsula and anti-war, peace organizations in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter praised the movement of those organizations for peace and disarmament as just activities and expressed the expectation that they would expand and develop the signature campaign into a worldwide anti-U.S., anti-war, peace movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. moves for developing ballistic missiles including the establishment of the \"TMD\" are left unchecked, the world will see in a new era of the Cold War again and the tragedy of the 20th century will be repeated in the 21st century, too, the letter said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world's peace-loving forces should make concerted efforts to decisively frustrate the U.S. moves to build the \"TMD\" based on its ambition for world hegemony and all other criminal war maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean National Peace Committee will further strengthen international solidarity with these organizations in the struggle for checking and frustrating the U.S. moves for war of aggression in the future, too. \r\n\r\n"
