Korea joint military drills slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League released a statement yesterday, denouncing the large-scale joint military maneuvers the U.S. imperialists are planning to stage together with the South Korean bellicose forces as a more dangerous war provocation against the north than the \"Team Spirit\" joint military maneuvers and a nuclear test war to impose a nuclear holocaust on the Korean nation.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Together with the invincible people's army capable of defeating any formidable enemy at a stroke, our young vanguard will not remain a passive onlooker to the present situation where peace in our country is being threatened by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean warmongers and the tensions  reached an extreme pitch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war hawks should not run wild but immediately halt the war rehearsal against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they ignite a war of aggression in this land in defiance of our repeated warnings, we youth and students will be eight million human bombs to wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressors to the last and certainly achieve the cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon all the youth and students at home and abroad, together with all other Korean people, to rise up more vigorously in the struggle against the war provocation moves of the U.S. aggressors under the uplifted banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.     \r\n\r\n"

Korea military exercises under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Large-scale joint military exercises to be staged by the U.S. and South Korean war hawks from March 21 are explicitly a replica of the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercise and a premeditated war game of higher level for an invasion of the northern half of Korea, which are, in nature, an open military provocation aimed at the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary.\r\n The news analyst further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers listed the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil\", provoking its dignity, and went the length of unhesitatingly declaring that they would \"make a nuclear attack\" on it unless their unacceptable brigandish demand is met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, nobody can vouch that the soon-to-be-staged war games, which involve unprecedentedly huge forces and latest military equipment, will not go into an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers should not act rashly. If they and their stooges ignite a war of aggression in this land, we will never miss that opportunity to wipe out the aggressors to the last and realise our cherished desire for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

The credit for this goes to the outstanding leadership ability and army-based policy of Kim Jong Il who has stratagem and pluck of Mt. Paektu, the message stresses, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n You are the great teacher of our nation and the entire humankind and the sun of the 21st century all people look up to and follow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n You provided our nation with the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration, a milestone for national reunification, in June 2000 to open a new history of the national reunification movement with which to achieve the independent reunification by the united efforts of our nation. As a result, the 70 million fellow countrymen in the south and the north and abroad are advancing along the road of unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, hot-blooded youths in the south, will take the lead in upholding your noble intention in the glorious road to victory and become a human bomb and fortress in the struggle to reunify the country.     \r\n\r\n"
