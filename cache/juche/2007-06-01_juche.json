The idea of \"By our nation itself\" has become the spirit of the June 15 era of reunification and it has been able to powerfully spur on the struggle for independent reunification with great attraction as it represents so unequivocally the will and desire of the Koreans for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Guided by the principle of \"By our nation itself,\" the Koreans have resolutely stood against the unreasonable interference and disturbance of outside forces and dealt hard blows to the flunkeyist treacheries of the anti-reunification forces within the nation following the lead of outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This stubborn struggle of the Koreans made it possible to preserve the principle of \"By our nation itself,\" the principle of national independence, in the reunification movement and establish the structure of Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence represents the dignity and honor of the nation, its pride and self-respect as well as the indomitable will and spirit of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can block the struggle of the Korean nation to defend its dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic traits of the Koreans eloquently manifested in the high degree of consciousness of independence and desire for independent reunification are the propelling force making the nation strong and adding shine to the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should promote the development of the times and bring earlier independent reunification by displaying the spirit of national independence and patriotic enthusiasm to a higher degree.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This provided Japan with a legal foundation to replace the \"Pacifist Constitution,\" which it has so far advocated as a symbol of the \"Pacifist State\" by a war constitution and helped it make a breakthrough towards building a \"legitimate\" militaristic and war state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article carried in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the Japanese reactionaries for the retrogressive constitutional revision very adversely affect the process to preserve the equilibrium of forces and stability in East Asia and the Pacific region, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By settling the issue of exercising the \"right to collective self-defence\" to meet its militaristic purpose Japan seeks to pave the way for conducting military operations for overseas aggression single-handed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters' desperate bid to exercise the above-mentioned right is aimed to go beyond the framework of the limited \"right to individual self-defense\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is allowed to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" through the constitutional revision, it may hurl its combatant forces into any area any time to kick off a war of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is set to reorganize its \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" into \"Self-Defense Armed Forces\" through the constitutional revision. This means the conversion of the SDF into armed forces for overseas aggression of legal offensive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are keen to stipulate the exercise of the above-said right in the Constitution and put this plan into practice. This may put further spurs to the moves to reinforce the military bloc in the Asia-Pacific region including Northeast Asia, spark a new Cold War and arms race. Consequently, the relations between Japan and other countries in Asia may become more hostile as the days go by to lead to clashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the primary target of the Japanese militarists' exercise of the above-said right. They are waiting for a chance to start a war to stage a comeback to Korea under the pretext of \"supporting the U.S. armed forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people of the DPRK are heightening vigilance against the moves of Japan to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" and launch reinvasion and are fully ready to settle accounts with the Japanese militarists any time. If they exercise the above-said right against the DPRK, its army and people will mercilessly wipe out them through the toughest counter-actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to give up their wild ambition for overseas invasion, well aware that their exercise of the above-said right would only precipitate their own self-destruction, warns the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

You may have no chance to take care of me or your mother, as is your filial duty, but you must give yourself heart and soul to the cause of Korea's independence. \"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the President waged the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the Japanese imperialists sent renegades of the revolution to the house in Mangyongdae, carrying a fat roll of bank-notes with them in an attempt to make him \"surrender\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They tried to tempt her with the words that they would give him the post of commander of their Kwantung Army or commander of the Army present in Korea if he came over to them, but they failed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forced her to join in the \"surrender campaign\" and dragged her to the rugged mountains of the shore of the Amnok River and northeastern areas in China, but they did not attain their purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At last he liberated the country.  On October 14, 1945 when the President called at Mangyongdae, his dear native village, twenty years after he had left there, she said with happiness that she freed herself from life-long worries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though her grandson was the head of state, Ri Po Ik, an ardent patriot, lived a frugal life, doing farming till the last moments of her life and died at the age of eighty-three.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Asimismo, en esta labor se establecio la estructura de toda la nacion coreana vs. EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la independencia nacional descansan la dignidad y honor de la nacion, el orgullo nacional, la indoblegable voluntad e impetu de la misma. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nadie puede bloquear el camino de lucha de la nacion coreana por defender su dignidad y soberania. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los coreanos deben manifestar plenamente el espiritu de independencia nacional y el fervor patriotico para promover el desarrollo de la epoca y adelantar la reunificacion independiente.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun se opone al \"derecho a autodefensa colectiva\" de Japon\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 31 de mayo (ATCC) -- Hace poco, fue aprobada la \"ley del plebiscito\" en la camara de consejeros de la dieta japonesa. De esta manera, Japon pudo tener el marco legal para enmendar en la belicista la actual \"constitucion pacifista\", con que se pintaba hasta la fecha como \"Estado pacifista\", y abrio la brecha para construir legalmente un Estado militarista y belico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual de este jueves y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las maniobras de los reaccionarios japoneses para reformar la constitucion dan influencias negativas sobre el equilibrio de la fuerza y la estabilidad en la region de Asia Oriental y el Pacifico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ese pais isleno trata de solucionar el problema de ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" conforme a su objetivo militarista para abrir asi el camino de desarrollar a solas las operaciones militares agresivas en ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo esencial de este asunto reside en eliminar las restricciones del \"derecho a la autodefensa particular\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En caso de permitirse el ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" por la enmienda constitucional, es muy probable que Japon despache a sus fuerzas armadas de combate a cualquier tiempo y lugar para desencadenar la guerra de agresion a otros paises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mediante esa enmienda, los japoneses tratan de convertir a las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" en el \"ejercito de autodefensa\" para capacitarlas legalmente para la agresion a ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales maniobras aceleraran el fortalecimiento de los bloques militares y produciran una nueva guerra fria y carrera armamentista en la region de Asia y el Pacifico, inclusive el Nordeste Asiatico. Tambien, se empeoraran cada dia mas las relaciones entre Japon y otros paises asiaticos, lo cual causara al fin y al cabo hostilidades y consiguientes conflictos entre ellos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La Republica Popular Democratica de Corea es el primer blanco del ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" de los militaristas japoneses. Estos tratan de iniciar nueva agresion a Corea bajo el pretexto de \"apoyar a las tropas norteamericanas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El ejercito y el pueblo de Corea se mantienen muy alertos ante las maniobras arriba mencionadas de los imperialistas japoneses y estan firmemente decididos a destruirlos sin falta en la batalla final. Si ellos ejercen el \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" contra la RPDC, el ejercito y el pueblo de esta los castigaran despiadadamente con el golpe de superdureza. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios japoneses deben abandonar su ambicion de agredir a otros paises, al tener presente que el ejercicio del polemico derecho los llevara a la autodestruccion.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
