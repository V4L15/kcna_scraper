It is based on the \"gunboat diplomacy\" of big powers which came out to make colonies in modern times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the \"gunboat diplomacy\" was prevalent in aggressor countries, the U.S., too, had used it as one of the main ways for overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. emerged the first nuclear weapons state and the ringleader of imperialism ahead of the end of the Second World War, and it changed its \"gunboat diplomacy\" into the nuclear blackmail strategy, more violent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the world political structure was divided into socialism and capitalism after the war, the U.S. strategy was focused on blackmailing and collapsing the ever-more developing socialist countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. mobilized its citizens into the frantic \"Red-hunting\" by inciting reactionary \"McCarthyism\" and declared its overseas version of the Cold War and staged on a full scale the military confrontation with socialist countries while launching the black propaganda branding them as \"devils\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. strategy of horror reached to the extremes in pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the middle of the last century the U.S. ignited the Korean War and threatened with A-bomb the Korean people who suffered the first nuclear disaster by its A-bomb attack on Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its strategy of horror has reached the worst phase after the emergence of the Trump administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration put forward the settlement of the nuclear issue of the DPRK as the first item of its diplomacy and security policy and confirmed \"maximum pressure and engagement\" as its DPRK policy. Talking about \"approach to north Korea means preemptive attack\", it makes no scruple to show that its strategy is hard-line hostile policy eclipsing the policies of the preceding administrations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It mobilized high-ranking officials of the White House and media to launch a massive threatening offensive, saying that \"the military option is on the table and a solution to the north Korea issue is the only military action.\" Not content with this, Trump repeatedly posted on his twitter \"warnings\" to the DPRK, labeling it target of \"world threats\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration massively hurled the U.S. nuclear strategic assets and special warfare forces and equipment into the largest-ever joint military drills Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 to conduct the exercises for preemptive attack aiming at \"removal of the supreme leadership\" of the DPRK and \"overthrow of its social system,\" thus bringing another nuclear war crisis to the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Together with the dangerous nuclear blackmail strategy involving triad-strategic assets such as nuclear strategic bomber, ICBM and nuclear submarine, the U.S. strategy of horror is being implemented in an all-round way and multiple forms by forcing neighboring countries of the DPRK and other countries concerned to politically and diplomatically isolate the DPRK and impose tougher economic sanctions and persistent cultural infiltration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The earth is under the reign of the jungle law, and justice and truth are violated owing to the U.S. strategy of horror which is disturbing the world peace and security and bringing unrest and crisis to the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. tyrannical strategy of horror can never work on the DPRK only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has not hesitated nor vacillated in the standoff of more than 70 years with the U.S., \"the only superpower in the world\" to which other nuclear possessors dare not oppose. It has staunchly advanced along the road of independence, Songun and socialism with the offensive fighting spirit and indomitable will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strength of the DPRK, which is rapidly developing despite arrogance of the U.S., and its strong spirit to beat back the empire of evils prove that the U.S. noisy strategy of blackmail is the bluffing one, only able to play the weak countries and nations without nukes like jellyfish, and the \"empty gun strategy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great strength of the DPRK is now terrifying the U.S. which boasts that it has thousands of nuclear warheads and it is \"the world's biggest economic entity.\" This strength does by no means come from money or A-bomb. It is just the strength of the great idea, the strategic depth guaranteeing the victory of the DPRK and the decisive factor of its victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the DPRK is displaying its dignity as an invincible power with the might of great idea, single-minded unity that can never be broken even by nukes, tremendous military strength and inexhaustible self-development force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are days never to return when the U.S. could threaten the DPRK with nukes. The U.S. is no longer an existence of threat and horror to the DPRK and, on the contrary, the latter poses the biggest threat and horror to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great is the strength of the DPRK which is leading the building of a new world, peaceful and prosperous, while foiling the U.S. strategy of horror woven with high-handed and arbitrary practices, aggression and intervention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever defend itself with the strength of justice and reliably ensure peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region and the rest of the world."
