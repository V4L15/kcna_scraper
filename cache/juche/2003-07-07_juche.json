This is proved by a series of counter-measures taken by it recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Arab Committee for Solidarity with the Korean People and Supporting the Reunification of Korea in Jordan in a commentary carried in the newspaper \"Al-Itishah\" said that people's Korea standing firm on the forefront in the struggle against the imperialists solemnly declared that if enemies invade it, it will throw them into an abyss of ruin. And it has invariably adhered to its own political and military stand, lending no ear to anybody's threats and abuses, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An article entitled \"truth about the nuclear issue and security and peace of the Korean peninsula\" carried in the information bulletin issued by the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea laid bare the cunning trick of the Bush administration to garner support of the international community for preemptive military strike at the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a shining exploit he performed for the cause of national reunification, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line of one Korea, the line of reunification, serves as a line of national independence for achieving the complete independence of the country and the nation and a true patriotic one for the prosperous development of a reunified country and the prosperity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the president firmly maintained the patriotic line of reunification at all times and led the nation to achieve it, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He convened the historic joint meeting of representatives of political parties and public organizations of the south and the north of Korea at a crucial time when a campaign for \"separate election and separate government\" was underway in South Korea under the signboard of the un soon after the liberation of the country and led the whole nation to wage a nationwide struggle to frustrate the flunkeyist and traitorous forces' moves for the permanent division of Korea. And at a time when there were acute and sharp conflict and struggle between the two lines, ie. one for one Korea and the other for two Koreas, he waged an incessant struggle to frustrate the separatists' moves to create two Koreas. He also led the north and the south to resume dialogue and negotiations when their relations remained frozen and adopt joint statements and agreements, thus opening a new phase of the movement for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After setting forth the line of one Korea, a line of reunification, the president devoted himself to its materialization. Thanks to his immortal exploits the cause of national reunification has victoriously advanced despite the challenge and obstructive moves of anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and the pro-reunification patriotic forces have grown to be invincible forces. This is a great victory of the line of one Korea, a line of reunification, over the line of two Koreas, a line of division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il, the sun of the 21st century and the lodestar of national reunification, is wisely leading the nation's movement for reunification, with the firm determination and will to reunify the country in the present generation at any cost, carrying forward the cause of national reunification started and led by the president.    \r\n\r\n"
