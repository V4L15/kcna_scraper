            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Abduction under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Association for Human Rights Studies released a statement Friday accusing the south Korean ruling forces of pulling up the north over what they called \"human right issue\" in a bid to politicize and internationalize the issue of \"defectors from the north.\"\r\n Referring to the fact that the south Korean authorities took hundreds of so-called \"defectors from the north\" to south Korea from a third country and right after the action the \"Uri Party\" of south Korea came out with a plan to improve the settlement of those defectors from the north in south Korea, the statement noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a wanton challenge to the June 15 joint declaration, an open negation of the system in the north and an unpardonable anti-national criminal move to drive the inter-Korean relations to an unpredictable worst phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of \"defectors from the north\" much touted by the south Korean ruling and right-wing conservative forces is a product of the U.S. campaign to tarnish the international authority and prestige of the dignified DPRK and destabilize its system to intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., finding it impossible to stifle the DPRK with such physical means as military threat, blackmail, economic sanctions and blockade, expended a lot of money and goods for such a mean operation as cooking up \"the issue of defectors from the north\" through allurement and abduction in a bid to use it as a main card for pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. recently passed the \"bill on the human rights in north Korea\" through its House of Representatives in a bid to provide a guarantee for rendering the human right issue in the DPRK such as \"the issue of defectors from the north,\" etc. extremely serious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the south Korean authorities are joining the U.S. and ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea in the anti-DPRK campaign for confrontation, while undisguisedly alluring and abducting \"defectors from the north\". These acts cannot be construed otherwise than deliberate moves to downplay the precious achievements made in the efforts to achieve national unity and reunification for the last four years since the publication of the joint declaration and bring the inter-Korean relations back to the phase of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By alluring and abducting a group of northerners to south Korea its authorities forced many people in the north to live separated from them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is an anti-national, unethical crime as their action produced more \"divided families\" in the era after the publication of the joint declaration. \r\n The association bitterly condemns the above-said crime committed by the south Korean authorities together with other dishonest forces in south Korea, backed by the U.S., as an open international terrorism and an unpardonable human rights abuse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abductors can never escape from punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will be held entirely accountable for the serious consequences to be entailed by the recent massive allurement and abduction of fellow countrymen in the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
