            "content": "KCNA Dismisses Japanese Sankei Shimbun's Ridiculous Assertions  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- Sankei Shimbun again came under fire for staging a diatribe as a typical reptile newspaper of the right-wing conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper in its recent article titled \"Patient efforts to wipe out the misunderstanding of the comfort women issue\" openly denied the coercive recruitment of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army, the worst crime committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newspaper falsified the historical truth in breach of the elementary press ethics which regards the impartiality and accuracy as a lifeline. It made much ado about the \"uncertainty of the ground with which Kono made his statement,\" describing the natural public opinion at home and abroad on the \"comfort women\" issue as a \"misunderstanding\" and asserting that the imperial Japanese army had never been directly involved in such coercive recruitment as slave hunting. This was blatant denial of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts about the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army had already been testified to by many victims and witnesses in different countries of the world, documents dating back to those days and former soldiers of the imperial Japanese army. More facts about these crimes are being disclosed still today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To cite a most recent example, a paper in which a Japanese personage concerned admitted that the military instructed the setting up of \"comfort stations\" and a confidential document of the Dutch government proving the coercive recruitment of the \"comfort women\" by the imperial Japanese army were opened to the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report made to the Netherlands by a Dutch intelligence officer who had been dispatched to Indonesia right after the Second World War was worked out on the basis of accounts of the interrogation made into Japanese war criminals and the testimonies made by those concerned on July 5, 1946. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The contents of the report prove that the imperial Japanese army was fully involved in the above-said crimes ranging from the coercive recruitment of the \"comfort women\" to the operation of the \"comfort stations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for Sankei Shimbun, an expert on spreading lies and letting loose vituperation, to have claimed that public outcries over the above-mentioned issue were a \"misunderstanding,\" falsifying the universally recognized hard historical facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not secret that Sankei Shimbun styling itself an influential paper is active as a patron of a right-wing conservative organization which spearheads the campaign for tampering with history but its diatribe going against the trend of the times is little short of discarding its original mission as one of media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No denial can ever alter history. Sankei Shimbun would be well advised to clearly understand this truth of history and bear in mind that it is the only way out for it to have a proper stand on the crimes against humanity, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto comprueba que ese protocolo significa para los uniformados estadounidenses la \"autorizacion de sus actos delictivos\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los habitantes surcoreanos deben intensificar la lucha por anular ese convenio, que les chupa la sangre e impone desgracias, y expulsar a los criminales uniformados yanquis, que desprecian a los coreanos y violan su dignidad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
