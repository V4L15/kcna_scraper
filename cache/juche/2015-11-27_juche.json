She talked nonsense that she expected the \"north to give up its nuclear program and opt for opening and cooperation\" and \"it is necessary to pressurize the north to make a strategic decision to abandon its nuclear program and take the road of changes.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive's foreign tours were mean mendicant ones and disgusting ones for confrontation as they were aimed to boost cooperation with foreign forces in the nuclear racket against the DPRK, while justifying the \"north policy\" of south Korea, and thus carry out her scenario to force the north \"to abandon its nuclear program first.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She vociferated about \"nuclear threat from the north\" and the \"north's abandonment of its nuclear program\" before outside forces. This was nothing but behavior of the shortsighted fool bereft of any elementary reason, the commentator says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before crying out for the \"north's abandonment of its nuclear program,\" the south Korean chief executive should reflect on the provocations the south Korean warmongers have perpetrated, escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and danger of a nuclear war by zealously joining the U.S. in its nuclear threat to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately she begs the outside forces for cooperation in the campaign to pressurize the DPRK, the more serious catastrophe the north-south relations will face and the further the confrontation and tension will escalate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defence is not a bargaining chip under any circumstances. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will further bolster up its nuclear deterrent and resolutely counter any hostile move to disable it as long as the U.S. pursues its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the danger of a nuclear war against it persists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive would be well advised to bear this in mind."

This proves that the drills were targeted against the DPRK and its neighbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal wantonly violating peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can decide the fate of the peninsula and the region through high-handed moves for igniting a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brigandish acts of harassing peace are bound to be countered by strong measure for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to take just measures for self-defence for safeguarding the sovereignty of the country and the peace and stability of the region from the U.S. war moves."
