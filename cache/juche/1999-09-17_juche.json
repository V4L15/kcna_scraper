Even \"police reserve force\" was hurled into Korea in 1952. Well over 140,000 young and middle-aged men were conscripted to be sent to the Korean front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Naval and air forces of Japan were also involved in the war. Over 50 warships and about 30,000 Japanese took part in the Inchon landing operation alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japanese pilots flew U.S. aircraft on combat missions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries offered their land to the U.S. as sortie, logistic and operation bases. All the ammunition used by the U.S. troops in the first three months of the war had been made in Japan. On special order from the U.S. forces at least 400 enterprises produced military hardware and war supplies of various types round the cloak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan handed the germ weapons it had developed in secrecy during World war II over to the U.S. who used them in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was entirely with this support from Japan that the U.S. could hold out in the war for three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean War brought huge profits to Japan. But for Japan's participation in the Korean War, Korea would not have suffered such disastrous calamities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As clarified in the recent DPRK government statement, it is widely known that Japan, a defeated nation in World war II, revived and rearmed itself under the \"golden shower,\" availing itself of the \"Korean War boom\" at the instigation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's criminal participation in the war is still fresh in the memory of the Korean people and the people's army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen an opportunity presents itself they will certainly settle accounts with it. \r\n\r\n"
