Agrego que su pais desea la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, no tiene voluntad de hostilizar el Norte de Corea y persigue la mejora de relaciones con esta, pero todo esto es posible cuando el Norte de Corea muestre la voluntad de ejecutar su obligacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t El diario Rodong Sinmun en un articulo individual difundido este miercoles senala que el intento de EE.UU. es justificar la politica  hostil anti-RPDC y aplastarla a toda costa con las fuerzas militares tildandola de \"destructora de la paz\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de fundada la RPDC, EE.UU. la definio como su enemigo y perpetro las maquinaciones hostiles a la RPDC para derrotar el regimen optado por el pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El imperio las continua de siglo en siglo, los cuales son los actos antieticos y terroristas estatales nunca vistos en la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El imperio no desea ni un minimo la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC e intenta derribarla con el metodo militar cuanto tenga la oportunidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. habla de la mejora de  relaciones con la RPDC y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, lo cual es la burla e insulto al pueblo coreano que desea la verdadera paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque EE.UU. actua astutamente no puede liberarse de la responsabilidad de empeoramiento de la situacion de esta Peninsula."
