And he highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The complex has a very important duty and role to play for firmly reinforcing the nation's shipbuilding industry and independent national economy, he noted, putting forward the highly important tasks to be fulfilled by the complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The complex has a brilliant tradition as it has taken the lead in devotedly implementing the Party's economic policies by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in every annual of the Korean revolution, he said, expressing great expectation and conviction that all the Party members and other working people of the complex would successfully carry out in the future, too, the militant tasks assigned by the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Rakwon Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room devoted to the history of the Oxygen Plant-Building Factory before looking round the Sheet Metal Processing Shop, the Heat Exchanger Shop, the Assembling Shop and various other production processes of the factory to learn about in detail with the technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the newly manufactured oxygen plant, he expressed great satisfaction with the fact that the workers of the complex produced a modern oxygen plant by their own efforts by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and highly praised their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that they have manufactured the 15,000-cubic-metre oxygen plant by their own efforts and with their own technology patently proves the great potential of the nation's industry which has been put on a high scientific and technological basis, he said, specifying an orientation and ways for completing the production of large oxygen plants earlier than schedule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing one by one the books on the labor campaigns of loyalty and a collection of poems that bear witness to the patriotic devotion made by the workers of the factory with pure conscience while manufacturing oxygen plants, he stressed that the DPRK's cause of building a thriving nation is sure to be successfully accomplished thanks to such heroic workers as the workers of the complex who are devoting all their wisdom and enthusiasm to the drive for opening  the gate to a thriving nation by displaying the indomitable mental power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with labor innovators of the complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the Party members and other working people in North Phyongan Province have made strenuous endeavors to carry out the militant tasks set forth by the Party, thereby doing a lot of work on all fronts of economic construction in recent years, he highly appreciated their achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
