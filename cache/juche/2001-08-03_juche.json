And Japan's diplomatic authorities said in an irresponsible manner that the case is not the government's business, when the bereaved family members asked for information about the details of the accident and confirmation of the fate of the missing. Such immoral and insincere behavior and attitude can convince nobody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities concerned should confirm the fate of the missing captain of \"Myonggwang-3\" as soon as possible and inform his family of it. And the Japanese government should take a sincere and responsible step for the settlement of the damage caused by the recent accident, in consideration of the relations between the two countries. \r\n   \r\n"
