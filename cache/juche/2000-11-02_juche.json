It is due to the outside forces that the homogeneous. Korean nation with a history of 5,000 years has remained divided into two so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unnecessary for our nation to read other's mind or ask for other's help in dealing with all the problems and the issue of national reunification in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has made enormous contributions to the human history of culture. With this national pride we should have a Juche-oriented viewpoint and stand on the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 north-south joint declaration is of weighty significance as it confirmed the two sides' resolve to independently solve the issue of national reunification by concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This declaration made it possible for our fellow countrymen to pave the broad avenue for national reunification under the banner of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national identity and patriotism and the spirit of national independence based on it are the basis for achieving the great national unity irrespective of interests of different classes and strata and reunifying the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If subjectivism is allowed to turn aside from the objective conditions and realities in the national reunification movement or other's ready-made solution to the reunification issue is blindly applied, it will be impossible to represent the interests of the whole nation in general and achieve the country's reunification in accordance with the will and interests of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

There can be true friendship only when it is based on an independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If big-power chauvinism, an idea of oppressing and dominating others, and flunkeyism, an idea of not believing in one's own strength and toeing and looking up to big and developed countries are allowed in the relations between countries and nations it will breed inequality and discord among countries and nations and it is impossible to achieve true friendship and cooperation among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to hold fast to the independent stand, it is necessary to address and handle all problems arising in the international arena from an independent stand and solve them independently in the interests of their countries and nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary not to allow others to violate their sovereignty but struggle against all practices of infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK government to establish and develop the relations of friendship, cooperation and good-neighborliness with all countries that respect its sovereignty and are friendly to it, guided by the idea of independence, peace and friendship, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n"

If there be anything done by us we remained true to the sense of revolutionary obligation towards the great leaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I saw the South Korean people eagerly asking soldiers of the people's army not to leave them during its temporary retreat though they were under the administration of the DPRK only for a few days. But as a man who experienced this administration for five years I could not betray it. My 35 years in prison were a period of my self-control and self-education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When I was told that the DPRK launched a satellite and Jong Song Ok won the world marathon championship as she drew strength and courage in the entire 42 km race, picturing Kim Jong Il to herself, I grasped the might of the DPRK where the people are firmly united around him and got an inspiration from it. \r\n\r\n"
