He went the lengths of letting out a flurry of such vituperation that \"the north, which inflicted a lot of wounds and pain upon our nation through the June 25 war, is still perpetrating provocations\" and that \"it is necessary to force the north to correct its wrong thinking.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with this, he cried out for \"quickly completing 'report on the truth behind south Korean abductees,' a collection of information gathered over the past five years so that it may be recorded in history,\" disclosing his black-hearted intention to more recklessly resort to the anti-DPRK confrontational moves over the \"issue of wartime south Korean abductees\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Consultative Council of Former South Korean Public Figures in the North for the Promotion of Peaceful Reunification in a statement on Wednesday condemned this as another unpardonable, very grave political provocation against the DPRK and an unbearable insult to those who came over to the north. The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"wartime south Korean abductees\" touted by the puppet forces are those who voluntarily came to the DPRK in quest of the genuine road of truth and worthy life, infuriated by the war ignited by the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee puppet clique against the north and disillusioned with the colonial rule enforced by them during the past Fatherland Liberation War\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the \"abduction issue\" is concerned, the puppet group is the chief culprit of hideous abductions and worst human rights abuser.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. and the puppet group which forcibly took away a large number of people to south Korea through \"A-bomb\" threat and blackmail during the June 25 Korean war and forced so many families to live separated from each other for several decades and it was again the group of traitors which unhesitatingly committed the unethical acts of abducting citizens of the DPRK in broad daylight including 12 women employees whom they keep in custody even this time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces' allurement and abduction of DPRK's citizens have reached their height since Park Geun Hye came to power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in March this year traitor Park cooked up the \"law on human rights in the north\" which her predecessors dared not do and included in it a provision calling on the puppet Ministry of Unification to work out a plan concerning \"abductees\" and implement it and report its results to the \"National Assembly\". And she is agitating \"defection from the north\", personally planning and commanding the abduction of DPRK's inhabitants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of shamelessness for the criminal abductors to trumpet about \"the issue of wartime south Korean abductees\" while talking about\" ethics\" and \"moral laws\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group are getting frantic in the moves for escalating confrontation with the DPRK even by building the \"memorial for June 25 wartime south Korean abductees \", prompted by their sinister intention to ratchet up  the \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK by labeling it \"abductor\" at any cost and tide over the worst ruling crisis, her biggest headache.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it is the last-ditch efforts of the group of traitors to get out of the bottomless abyss of ruin."

That is why the U.S. considers the DPRK as its primary task to grab it. To this end, it is massively introducing latest weapons and equipment into south Korea and its vicinity, while dramatizing the \"story of threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. resorted to nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK in the past, too. But it is something unprecedented that it is staging nuclear bomb-dropping drills as now with ill-famed nuclear strategic bombers involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation calls on all the countries desirous of world peace and security to sharpen vigilance against the U.S. arms buildup in the Asia-Pacific region and turn out in the struggle to check it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace-loving DPRK will make every possible effort to prevent the U.S. from igniting a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of the Asia-Pacific region and ensure genuine peace and security there."
