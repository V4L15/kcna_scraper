Equipped with 12 cruise missile launchers and 4 torpedo launchers, the sub is capable of performing the mission of attacking warships and subs of the rival side and supporting special operations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has introduced Stennis and Ronald Reagan nuclear carrier strike groups into south Korea and its vicinity for the first time in history. It announced that it would deploy Pacific reaction flotilla of the U.S. Third Fleet including cruise missile destroyers Spruance and Momsen in East Asia under the pretext of extending the operation theatre of the U.S. Seventh Fleet based in Japan and would dispatch more warships to this region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known that the U.S. \"Asia-Pacific rebalancing strategy\" which calls for deploying over 60 percent of its Navy in Asia-Pacific by 2020 is aimed at maintaining the political and military edge in this region and the DPRK is made its primary target.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when a scenario for vicious \"precision air raid operation\" designed to \"disable\" the nuclear facilities and strategic means of the DPRK is openly advertised in the U.S., the up-to-date U.S. nuclear submarine entered a south Korean port, adding to the gravity of the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A series of \"war scenarios\" against the DPRK worked out by the U.S. and the U.S. massive introduction of strategic assets into south Korea clearly prove that detente and security on the peninsula can not be ensured by the unilateral efforts of one party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the strong denunciation and criticism by the DPRK and regional countries, the U.S. painted Mississippi's entry into Pusan Port as a \"port-call scheduled before several months\" and \"routine visit\" but it is sheer sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the contrary, it goes to prove the fact that the U.S. is ceaselessly creating an evil cycle of confrontation and tensions on the Korean peninsula and in the region in a bid to hamstring at any cost the efforts of the DPRK for prosperity and carrying out Washington's scenario to bring down its social system in a premeditated and regular manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite self-evident that the line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is the only choice for defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and developing economy and improving the people's living standard as early as possible now that the U.S. persists in its frantic anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clearer that the U.S. perverted view on the DPRK is the main reason why tensions persist on the Korean peninsula so dangerously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made a very hasty and strategically wrong decision this time, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and physical action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case something undesirable happens on the peninsula, the U.S. will be held fully accountable for this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. wants to survive even now, it had better stop at once its frantic war moves against the DPRK to carry out its anachronistic and reckless scenario for dominating the world."

Tiene por su mision atacar los buques de guerra y submarinos del rival y asegurar al mismo tiempo el cumplimiento de operaciones especiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlegaron al Sur de Corea y su contorno por primera vez en la historia las flotillas de portaaviones nucleares norteamericanos Stennis y Ronald Reagan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de ampliar el teatro operacional de la septima flota de las fuerzas maritimas de EE.UU. con su base en Japon, fueron ubicadas en Asia oriental las escuadras de reaccion en el Pacifico de la tercera flota que incorpora los destructores provistos de misiles cruceros Spruance y Momsen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. esta anunciando que seguira despachando a esa region mucho mas buques de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs conocido que la \"estrategia de reequilibrio de Asia-Pacifico\" de EE.UU., que pretende desplegar en esta region mas de 60% de sus fuerzas maritimas hasta el ano 2020, tiene como su objetivo mantener la hegemonia politico-militar en la region y toma a la RPDC como el blanco de primer golpe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, se divulga abiertamente en EE.UU. el plan de \"operacion de ataque aereo de precision\", cuya mision principal reside en \"exterminar\" las instalaciones nucleares y los medios estrategicos de la RPDC. Si se toma en cuenta este hecho, resulta mas grave la llegada al Sur de Corea del submarino nuclear ultramoderno dotado de misiles cruceros que son medios principales para cumplir la susodicha mision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. inventa sin cesar diferentes \"guiones de guerra\" contra la RPDC e introduce en el Sur de Corea sus armas estrategicas, lo cual evidencia que con los esfuerzos unilaterales de una parte no se puede aliviar la tension ni preservar la seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPerplejo ante la fuerte condena y critica de la RPDC y otros paises regionales, EE.UU. dice que la entrada de Mississippi en el Puerto de Pusan es una \"visita normal y planeada ya hace varios meses\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal sofisma comprueba que el imperio norteamericano se dedica de manera planificada y cotidiana a la campana anti-RPDC con el proposito de crear de continuo el circulo vicioso de enfrentamiento y agravacion de tension en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno, impedir la prosperidad de la RPDC y derrocar su regimen al final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa que continuan las maniobras anti-RPDC, esta mantendra con mas firmeza su linea de desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y las fuerzas armadas nucleares, la cual es la unica opcion para defender la dignidad y soberania de la nacion y mejorar cuanto antes la vida de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe hizo mas evidente que la repetida agravacion de tension en la Peninsula Coreana se debe al criterio hostil de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez tambien, EE.UU. tomo una decision frivola y equivocada en lo estrategico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC esta preparada tanto para el dialogo como para las medidas fisicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi en la Peninsula Coreana acontece lo que nadie desea, su responsabilidad recaera totalmente sobre EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. quiere sobrevivir, debera abandonar de inmediato sus anacronicas e imprudentes maniobras belicas anti-RPDC que se orientan a la toma de hegemonia mundial."

            "content": "Minju Joson acusa a EE.UU. de cobijar acciones militaristas de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 21 de junio (ACNC) -- Segun fuentes extranjeras, Estados Unidos involucro a Japon en los ejercicios militares conjuntos que se efectuan en el Oceano Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, EE.UU. cancelo la medida de restringir la importacion de accesorios de arma de Japon. Como resultado, las empresas japonesas de industria belica pueden suministrar a sus homologas norteamericanas todas las piezas de armamento que quisieran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual divulgado el dia 21, el rotativo Minju Joson revela que tales hechos insinuan que se estrechan mas las relaciones de cooperacion militar EE.UU.-Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es nueva la colaboracion de esos paises que persiguen sendas ambiciones de agresion, comienza el comentarista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de la II Guerra Mundial, el aspecto de relaciones entre EE.UU. y Japon se ha convertido en el de la cooperacion entre el amo y su lacayo, pero no se han cambiado sus objetivos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon viene impulsando poco a poco la conversion en potencia militar pensando que podria realizar su ambicion de reagresion saliendo del estado de pais criminal de guerra si se suma activamente a las maniobras de EE.UU. para tomar la hegemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor su parte, EE.UU. viene defendiendo tal comportamiento de Japon creyendo que si usa como brigada de choque al pais isla, le sera mas facil cumplir la estrategia de dominar a Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl respaldo activo de EE.UU. alienta cada vez mas a Japon que habia preparado ya la base legal de reagresion al adoptar la \"ley de seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta evidente que EE.UU. sera el blanco de represalia del Japon militarista, su otrora rival de la II Guerra Mundial que siempre busca la oportunidad de tomar desquite de su derrota."
