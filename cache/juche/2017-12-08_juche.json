A citar un ejemplo, fabrico y aplico la \"iniciativa de seguridad contra la proliferacion\" y la \"iniciativa de seguridad maritima regional\" y otras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de prevenir la \"proliferacion de armas de exterminio masivo\", condujo los ejercicios internacionales de interceptacion maritima contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el segundo semestre de este ano, la comandancia de fuerzas norteamericanas del Pacifico prepara en etapa crucial las operaciones de bloqueo maritimo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl trasladar en el mes pasado el proyecto de ejecucion de esas operaciones a los titeres surcoreanos, asigno a las fuerzas navales del Sur de Corea, Japon y EE.UU. la mision de encargarse de las aguas internacionales de los Mares Este y Oeste de Corea, el alta mar del Mar Este y la zona maritima al sur de la isla Jeju, respectivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Tratado de Londres sobre la Definicion de la Agresion y la resolucion no. 3314 de la Asamblea General de la ONU establecen que la sancion por el estilo de bloqueo sobre un Estado soberano en el tiempo de paz significa un ilegal acto de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho de los seguidos ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC de mayor envergadura, desarrollados en el mar y el aire mediante el traslado de numerosas propiedades estrategicas a la Peninsula Coreana, EE.UU. reclama hasta el bloqueo maritimo, lo cual resulta un crimen de guerra que lleva la situacion a la fase \"incontrolable\" y al borde de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl bloqueo naval anticoreano comenzo ya hace mucho tiempo, pero no puede asustar ni poner de rodillas al pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda de Trump muestra algun menor gesto para poner en practica su intento de bloqueo maritimo, no se hara esperar la implacable contramedida de autodefensa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y sus seguidores deben actuar con prudencia reflexionando de las consecuencias catastroficas del bloqueo naval anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEscrito por Jong Hyon."
