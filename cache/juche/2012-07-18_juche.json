The Korean nation has common national feelings and unanimous desire for the reunification. This will provide a basis for unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when the entire nation get united, will it be possible to strengthen the driving forces of the country's reunification. And only when the driving forces of the reunification are strong, can they frustrate the anti-reunification moves of the separatist forces at home and abroad and achieve the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lesson showed that the deviation from the principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity and denial of the north-south declarations would deteriorate the inter-Korean relations and endanger the nation's destiny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The future of the inter-Korean relations and the country's reunification movement entirely depend on how the north-south declarations are preserved and implemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stand and attitude toward the north-south declarations are a milestone distinguishing reunification from division, unity from confrontation and peace from war."

Korea's \"2012 White Paper on Diplomacy\" under Fire: KCNA Commentary\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean puppet regime published \"2012 white paper on diplomacy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t In the document it talked nonsense that it has maintained the inter-Korean relations and the stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors who are more dead than alive to draw up the document full of lies in order to advertise their foreign policy achievements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an action is a revelation of the attempt to justify their sycophantic and traitorous anti-reunification and confrontation policy and shift the responsibility for the bedeviled inter-Korean relations on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Quite contrary to the contents of the white paper, a touch-and-go situation is prevailing in relations between the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The serious situation of the peninsula which is arousing serious concerns from the whole Korean nation and the world peace-loving people is the product of the Lee group's sycophantic and traitorous policy from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon seizing the power, the Lee group spoke ill of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" by terming it \"exclusive nationalism\". The solicitation diplomacy pursued by the puppets crying out for the \"cooperation with the international community\" precisely means the traitorous diplomacy for confrontation with the compatriots in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has frantically sought to realize the nuclear cooperation against the DPRK while insisting on the \"policy toward the north\" the keynote of which are the \"theory of nuclear threat from the north\" and \"the theory of urging the north to scrap nuclear program first.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It set it as a prerequisite for improving the inter-Korean relations to urge the north to scrap the nuclear program first and has sought to force the DPRK to disarm itself. In the meantime, talking about the U.S. offer of a \"nuclear umbrella\" and the like it begged the U.S. to maximize its nuclear threat to the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Talking about the \"contingency\" in the DPRK, the group drafted even a war scenario to invade the north and staged such large-scale war drills as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle aimed at preemptive nuclear attack on the north every year in collaboration with foreign forces. It has resorted to the smear campaign against the DPRK over the issue of its \"human rights\" performance by saying this or that about the idea and social system in the DPRK even in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in January last year in particular, the government, political parties and social organizations of the DPRK proposed the south Korean authorities to hold wide-range dialogues and negotiations in order to discuss and settle the crucial issues for the Korean nation. But the group branded it as a \"camouflaged peace offensive\" and \"tactics for united front\" to kick up the racket for confrontation, and prevented the inter-Korean high-level military talks proposed by the DPRK from being held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The atmosphere for confrontation and danger of war are constantly prevailing on the peninsula due to the treachery of the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disgusting sycophantic and pro-U.S. foreign policy of the conservative group has fully reduced south Korea to a colony of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Claiming that the tightened \"alliance\" with the U.S. will improve the \"prestige\" of south Korea and bring benefits to it, the group made no scruple of accepting the wrong demands of the U.S. such as the dispatch of troops to Afghanistan and the sanctions on Iran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It concluded the humiliating \"Free Trade Agreement\" with the U.S., thus seriously threatening the south Koreans' right to existence. Although a large number of people are suffering from untold hardships in their life it has spent a huge amount of funds for the upkeep of the U.S. troops in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee and his group earned an ill fame of colonial servants for their actions for confrontation with fellow countrymen and treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human scum are foolishly trying to pull themselves out of crimes to prolong their remaining days, but it is too late."
