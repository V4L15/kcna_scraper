Other countries, therefore, will not remain a passive onlooker to Japan's desperate moves for MD and, accordingly, will take countermeasures against them. This will cause a new arms race, a Cold War to rage. The Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia are exposed to the greatest danger of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already warned that such moves of Japan mean a hostile act, a grave threat to it. Nevertheless, Japan is getting frantic in its moves to step up the building of the MD targeted against the DPRK. By doing so Japan has openly violated the spirit of the agreement reached at the six-party talks on refraining from threatening each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reckless moves will adversely affect the worldwide efforts for peace, disarmament and detente and the process to ensure peace in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Songun Revolutionary History \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 2 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il's Songun revolutionary history is a sacred chronicle of lifting the position and national power of socialist Korea to the highest plane and displaying the dignity and glory of the nation to the whole world with the treasured sword of Songun. It is an undying history of the legendary great man who opened up a brilliant new era of the victory of the cause of independence with his rare gift and distinguished leadership ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun stresses this in an editorial article Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary history of the Workers' Party of Korea is glorious revolutionary true records of feats which will shine through all ages, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set forth the Songun politics as the main political mode in face of the grim situation confronting the country and the revolution and has led the cause of Korean-style socialism along a victorious course with the revolutionary army as the main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary history of the WPK is a sacred course of the opening of the new history of a dignified socialist political power, the course of a heroic struggle in which a matchless military power no one dare provoke has been built, and an epic of creation and change in hewing the future of the prospering country our own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flawless solution of the fundamental questions arising in the construction of a powerful nation by building an invincible political and ideological power under the banner of Songun is a great feat that provided a firm guarantee for the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military power for self-defence has been fortified rock-firm and the DPRK has become possessed of a powerful nuclear deterrent under the banner of Songun. This is a historic event which has made it possible to shatter the U.S. imperialists' ever-growing threat of preemptive nuclear attack and their sanctions and pressure and honorably defend the supreme interests of the state and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK have laid a springboard for the building of a prosperous and powerful country with world-startling creation and leaps and greeted an efflorescence of the prospering country. This is a precious fruition of the unique mode of creation and the wise leadership of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sacred Songun revolutionary history of the WPK vividly represents the greatness of Kim Jong Il born of the heaven, the most distinguished statesman and rare great man in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been no such leader in the world as Kim Jong Il who elevated the dignity and position of the country to the position of a power and brought a tremendous change in a brief historic period of ten odd years in the worst adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary history of the WPK is a history of indomitable struggle in which all difficulties have been surmounted with steadfast faith and strong will, a long journey of noble loving care shown for the people with devotion and an ever-victorious history shining with experienced and tested political ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the supreme incarnation of faith and will previously unknown in the world history of politics; he is not only the state leader and Supreme Commander but the affectionate father of the people and the great servant for them and a statesman of ability who has built up the revolutionary ranks and wisely led the Songun revolution with his distinguished ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Songun revolutionary history of the WPK is the national treasure which should be glorified through all generations, the article stresses the need to firmly defend the Songun revolutionary feats and tradition of the WPK and carry them forward invariably, attach importance to the military affairs and direct primary efforts to national defence and strictly observe the revolutionary principles in all realms of social life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this far-fetched sophism cannot go down with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the two war games put together are little short of the Team Spirit joint war game which earned itself ill fame as a nuclear test war and a preliminary war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aspect of the grave nature of the two war drills is that they were reckless acts of challenging the process of a peaceful solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue and the normalization of the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revealing light was cast on the hypocritical and perfidious colors of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities in resorting to the hostile and aggressive acts against the DPRK, seeking confrontation and war as in the past under the cloak of \"dialogue\" and \"peace\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We never overlook the indiscreet war provocation moves of the U.S. and the south Korean war maniacs behind the curtain of \"dialogue\" but are fully ready to cope with an emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the settlement of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue and the improvement of the inter-Korean relations depends entirely on the policy of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities toward the DPRK. The reality shows that no matter how many times dialogues are held and whatever good agreement is reached, they are useless and, in the long run, a military clash may break out, unless this policy is amended. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean bellicose forces should approach the DPRK with reason and abandon their hostile policy and aggressive design against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They slew innocent Korean people cold-bloodedly as \"criminals\" by setting the evil laws in motion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Originally, the Japanese imperialists instituted and promulgated the \"Law for Maintenance of Public Peace\" in April 1925 for the purpose of suppressing the leftist movement forces which aspired after socialism against the imperialist ruling system at home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From May that year, they widened its application range and objects to Korea and other colonial countries and regions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The law woven with human rights violation provisions stipulated that all acts \"changing the state system or denying the private property system\" and all the activities against the colonial fascist ruling system should be punished as \"offences\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists revised the penalty regulations of the law in 1928 in favor of their colonial rule.  According to it, those who formed an association to \"change the state system\" and its leading personnel shall be sentenced to life imprisonment or death and other members to five and more years of penal servitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists supplemented the law with more fascist human rights violation provisions in 1941 just before the Pacific War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It served also as the basis for the concoction and enforcement of other fascist laws in colonies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists, on the basis of the law, fabricated many special criminal laws such as \"ordinance for probation of Korean political offenders\" and \"ordinance for prevention and detention of Korean political offenders\" and ruthlessly repressed the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle and all the progressive movements of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They put some 234,000 Koreans in jail in a year of 1925. This figure well illustrates how many Koreans had been arrested, imprisoned and killed by the \"Law for Maintenance of Public Peace\" and other fascist laws during the colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such atrocities the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean people by dint of the fascist laws are crimes violating international laws.  They can neither be pardoned nor justified.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

True to the lofty intention of his father, he came to Mangyongdae by foot, covering the \"250-mile Journey for Learning\" after his graduation of Badaogou Primary School in the northeast area of China. There he was admitted into the fifth year class of Changdok School in April 1923. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Changdok School was established by Kang Ton Uk, his grandfather on mother's side, and other far-sighted people from Chilgol and the surrounding area as a part of the patriotic movement for cultural enlightenment after the \"Korea-Japan Annexation\".   It was a fairly large school with more than 200 students out of the private schools established in west Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President studied hard the Korean history, culture and geography at the school and visited Mts. Ryongak and Jongbang and other places of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the course of the study, he gained a good knowledge of beautiful fatherland and valuable historical and cultural relics and cultivated ardent patriotism.  He scratched out the word Mother-tongue from the textbook \"Mother-tongue Reader\" and wrote in its place the word Japanese. The Mother-tongue Reader became the Japanese Reader.  He told pupils of Changdok School, who were practicing themselves in Japanese, that the Koreans should speak in Korean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He produced and guided the performance of the musical play \"Thirteen Houses\" in reflection of hatred for the Japanese imperialists and love for the fatherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the liberation of the country, the President visited the school in October 1945 and said with deep emotion that the period in Changdok School was of significance in his life and the patriotism fostered at that time gave him a great confidence and fighting spirit during the anti-Japanese armed struggle.  And he indicated clearly the way to be taken by the school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The school, which has turned to be a model school under the warm care of the President, is now training lots of pupils as future pillars with ardent love for the motherland.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
