He stepped up the cause of army building by dint of his outstanding ideas and energetic leadership, thereby founding the Korean People's Army, the revolutionary regular armed forces of the Juche type, in a matter of less than three years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is, both in name and in reality, a revolutionary army that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle?the indomitable revolutionary spirit of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and its rich fighting experience and adroit art of warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the birth of this Juche-oriented regular army our Republic, from the very beginning after its founding, enjoyed the prestige of being a dignified people's country with its own strong armed forces; it defeated the imperialist aggressor forces that had been boasting of being the \"mightiest\" in the world and achieved a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t April 25, 1932, the day when our revolutionary armed forces began to take historical roots, was fundamental to vanquishing the brigandish Japanese imperialists and realizing the sacred cause of national liberation; February 8, 1948, the birthday of our regular armed forces that inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle, was crucial to the great victory of the Fatherland Liberation War and the successful advance of our socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole course of historic development of the Korean People's Army has been accompanied by constant tension and intense confrontation in the world's largest powder-keg and hottest spot which is pregnant with the danger of outbreak of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being faithful to its mission of defending the country, the revolution and the people, our army has smashed the enemy's adventurous provocations at every step, upholding the military line of self-reliant defence and the banner of \"a-match-for-a-hundred.\" In the course of this, it has been developed into an invincible combat force capable of defeating any enemy, however formidable, at a stroke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the grimmest and most difficult period when it had to fight against the allied imperialist forces of the world single-handed, with no flanks and with no support from outside, our People's Army performed remarkable exploits by waging a heroic, do-or-die struggle in the first line of the revolution under the leadership of the great Comrade Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As this elite revolutionary army played the role of the standard-bearer and solid cornerstone for defending socialism and the revolution at the forefront of the anti-imperialist military front and the construction of a prosperous country, our Republic has won one brilliant victory after another in the battle to safeguard socialism and gained the high reputation of a world-class military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In world history cannot be found any other nation that accomplished the great cause of army building from scratch by relying on its internal forces and built an elite army in spite of the protracted, worst-ever challenges and blockade; such brilliant exploit of building a powerful army for the sake of national prosperity is a miracle that can be wrought only by the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the peerless patriots and iron-willed commanders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officers and men of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army, which made its first fine appearance through a magnificent parade 70 years previously, has become what it is today, hoisting the flag of victory in the fierce battle fields in defence of the country and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army, which has grown up into a world-class powerful army, is a stout pillar in preventing the catastrophe of war and defending peace on the Korean peninsula and in the region and a force that makes breakthroughs in the vanguard of the grand march of our people towards final victory for the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now our people regard as their great pride our brave People's Army which is struggling with the spirit and stamina of Paektu, and are gaining fresh strength and courage from the militant might of our army which is growing stronger day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army has won the sincere affection and trust of the people at the cost of blood, sweat and death-defying devotion, achieved oneness with them enjoying their enthusiastic support and assistance, and performed feats on the fronts for defending the country and building socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a source of pride for our Party and state and a great fortune of our people that they have such a dignified and powerful revolutionary army, an army of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I deem it the highest honour to have assumed the heavy responsibility of supreme command of the courageous revolutionary army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On behalf of the Workers' Party of Korea, the government of the Republic and all the people, I once again warmly congratulate all the officers and men on the occasion of the 70th founding anniversary of the heroic Korean People's Army, and extend militant greetings to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Combatants of the units participating in this parade and all the other officers and men of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the Party and the country have high expectations of it and the people are sincere in their affection for it, the People's Army must defend the country and the people reliably through faithful service and devoted struggle as befits the army of the Party and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should increase its political and military capabilities to the maximum as suited to the status of our dignified state to meet the demands of the times and the developing revolution, and firmly guarantee by force of arms the struggle of our Party and people to accomplish the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The central task facing the People's Army at present is to perfect its combat capabilities as befitting a revolutionary army by holding aloft the banner of modelling the entire army on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and implementing to the letter the strategic lines and tasks for increasing the military strength put forward by the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should be boundlessly loyal to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is the army of our Party which was born and built up in the embrace of the Party; the source of its mightiness lies in the Party's revolutionary ideas and leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should become the first death-defying corps, the first guards unit, sharing its destiny with the Workers' Party of Korea and defending its Central Committee with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should firmly establish the unified leadership system of the Party within itself, create a revolutionary military climate in which all its service personnel move as one under the command of the Party, and organize and conduct all types of military work on the basis of the Party's lines and policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should maintain strengthening itself politically and ideologically and making itself morally sound as its two major tasks, and concentrate all its efforts on preparing itself as an army that is strong in ideology and faith like the 7th Regiment during the anti-Japanese war and the Guards units during the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should raise more fiercely the flames of the revolution in training to improve its capability of fighting a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Training is precisely the way to defending the socialist country and the people, and the short-cut to turning the People's Army into a powerful army is to make the most exacting demand upon its soldiers under training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should steadily improve the content, style and method of training in line with the Party's ideas on military strategy and tactics, with the demands of the Juche-oriented tactics and with the demands and features of modern warfare, and should not stop even a day practical training in a virtual combat environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present situation, in which the United States and its vassal forces are making a fuss around the Korean peninsula, the People's Army should remain on full alert and give a spur to perfecting its combat preparedness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thus we must prevent any aggressive forces from violating or offending the dignity and sovereignty of our sacred country in the slightest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Units of all services, arms and corps must intensify training aimed at having a command of their military hardware and improving their specialist levels, so as to make full preparations for waging hi-tech warfare in any operational space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the People's Army must present building itself up into an army, which is excellent in all aspects, as an important strategic task in line with the requirements of the new, higher stage of turning the entire army into an army of cadres and modernizing it, and give top priority to its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army must establish rigid ethos and assume the appearance of a perfect regular army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel, from privates to generals, should be well versed in military regulations and manuals, and make it part of their habit to abide by them, thus ensuring that all units, sub-units and other places where there are soldiers always present regularized features.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officers and men of the army, always bearing in mind that the People's Army cannot exist even a moment separated from the people, must boundlessly respect and love them, and constantly sustain the fine traits of the revolutionary army, whose soldiers defy death if it is for the sake of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army must not weigh the importance of undertakings intended for the people, but regard it as a revolutionary military climate to devote all its sincerity with the most honest attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Holding higher the patriotic, revolutionary slogan \"Let us take upon ourselves both national defence and socialist construction,\" it should give free rein to its unexcelled heroism in all places for translating the people's dreams and ideals into reality by displaying fortitude and creativity, not knowing the word impossible, and continuously take the lead in the struggle for transforming the country into a more beautiful land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Comrades,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as imperialism exists on the globe and the United States persists in following its hostile policy against our country, the mission of the People's Army, as a powerful sword for defending the country, people and peace, can never be changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Final victory belongs to our Party and people with a firm grip on the arms of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our Party and people are fully convinced that the Korean People's Army, which has provided a military guarantee for the revolutionary cause of Juche, will continue to reliably defend the Party and the revolution, the country and the people, and increase its strength in every way possible to safeguard justice and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as we have the Korean People's Army that is unfailingly loyal to the leadership of the Workers’ Party of Korea, our glorious motherland?the Democratic People's Republic of Korea?will grow more powerful and more prosperous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel of the People's Army,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flag of the ever-victorious Workers' Party of Korea will always lead the way ahead of you, giving you a great encouragement and rousing you to fresh struggle and victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us fight bravely for the Party and the revolution, the country and the people."

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Anti-DPRK Frenzy Denounced\r\nPyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesperson of the Institute for Japan Studies at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Friday over the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are becoming more desperate in pursuit of anti-DPRK campaign:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are getting evermore pronounced in anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who moved around some European countries from the very beginning of the year, crying out that our ballistic rockets constitute threats to those countries, is now making despicable attempts to use the 23rd Winter Olympic Games as a venue to agitate for maximum pressure and sanctions against our country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Particularly, Foreign Minister Kono begged for increased pressure against the DPRK while traveling the countries like Pakistan, United Arab Emirates, Canada and China, and continues to make indiscreet and depraved acts of persuading the countries that have diplomatic relations with the DPRK to fully implement the \"economic sanctions resolutions\" and sever the diplomatic relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kono even babbled out such nonsense that he \"highly appreciates\" the so-called \"Nuclear Posture Review\" released by the Trump administration which has clearly exposed the U.S. wild ambition to threaten other sovereign states with nuclear weapons and dominate the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese regime has long deprived itself of the qualification to say anything about peace and stability, as it supports and advocates nuclear big-stick policy of the U.S., the very country that inflicted nuclear disasters two times on the Japanese citizens. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, all the words and actions of Kono, who is in the van of sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK, indicate that he is no less than a puppet of the U.S. and a spokesperson for the U.S. representative in Tokyo, lacking basic logic, knowledge and qualities of a normal diplomat, to say nothing of qualities of foreign minister of a country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leading personages of the Japanese regime, not wanting to fall behind Kono, are competing with one another to show their loyalty to the U.S., raising voices for the implementation of anti-DPRK UNSC \"sanctions resolutions\", which is a resemblance of the medieval religious trial, and inciting an atmosphere of anti-DPRK confrontation. The purpose behind these moves is crystal clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe quarters are now relying on all kinds of deceptions and tricks to revise the constitution by any means and make Japan a country that can conduct a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries still think that they can put the sovereignty of Korea on a chopping board and chop it together with neighboring countries as in the past, there is no greater mistake.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries like Kono keep on clinging to anti-DPRK confrontational mania without any sense of their current status, it will result in digging out their graves by their own hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities would be well advised to show discretion and prudence with clear understanding on the might of the DPRK that has now become a full-fledged strategic state."

Y el 8 de febrero de 1948, dia de nacimiento de las fuerzas armadas regulares herederas de las tradiciones antijaponesas, nos permitio obtener un gran triunfo en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria y proseguir el avance victorioso de la causa socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el trayecto del EPC estuvo caracterizado por un prolongado estado de tension y un intenso enfrentamiento en el mayor polvorin y el punto mas candente del mundo con el inminente peligro de una nueva guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFiel a su mision de defender a la patria, la revolucion y el pueblo, nuestro ejercito frustro todas las arriesgadas provocaciones del enemigo con la linea militar de autodefensa y la consigna de uno contra cien en alto, fortaleciendose en ese transcurso en indestructibles tropas de combate capaces de vencer de un golpe a cualquier enemigo poderoso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los mas arduos y dificiles momentos en que hemos tenido que bregar solos contra la alianza imperialista, sin flanco ni refuerzo, el Ejercito Popular ha realizado grandes proezas en la heroica lucha de muerte en la primera linea de la revolucion bajo la direccion del gran General.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor contar con un ejercito revolucionario elite, puntal inconmovible y abanderado en la defensa del socialismo y la revolucion en el frente antimperialista y la avanzada de la construccion de una patria rica y poderosa, nuestra Republica ha logrado triunfos sucesivos y contundentes en la defensa del socialismo y exhibido su aspecto imponente como una de las mayores potencias militares del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo tiene su parangon en la historia el milagro de haber logrado por su propia cuenta la gran obra de la fundacion del ejercito sobre las ruinas y preparado las mas poderosas fuerzas militares en medio del mas persistente desafio y bloqueo. Esta es una inmensa proeza que pueden realizar solamente el gran Lider y el gran General, eminentes patriotas y comandantes de acero, en su empeno de enriquecer a la nacion y fortalecer al

firme pilar de defensa de la paz que previene la catastrofe en la Peninsula Coreana y sus cercanias, asi como la patrulla que encabeza la gran marcha de nuestro pueblo hacia el triunfo definitivo del

fuerza y animo en la combatividad de nuestro ejercito que se eleva cada dia mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon ardiente sangre y sudor y entrega total ha conquistado el verdadero amor y confianza del pueblo y con el fervoroso respaldo y apoyo del pueblo logra la unidad monolitica y protagoniza hazanas en la defensa nacional y la construccion socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTener tan imponente y poderoso ejercito de la revolucion y del pueblo es el orgullo de nuestro Partido y Estado y la gran dicha de nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara mi es un gran honor asumir la responsabilidad del comandante supremo que dirige a un valeroso ejercito revolucionario como ustedes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn nombre del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, el gobierno de la Republica y todo el pueblo, vuelvo a felicitar y saludar fervorosamente a todos los oficiales y soldados del heroico EPC en ocasion del aniversario 70 de su fundacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCombatientes de las columnas en la

correspondiente a la posicion de nuestro prestigioso Estado en consonancia con la demanda de la epoca y la revolucion en desarrollo y asegurar militarmente la lucha de nuestro Partido y pueblo para culminar la causa socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tarea principal que tiene hoy por delante es completar su combatividad como ejercito revolucionario al materializar cabalmente la linea estrategica y las tareas presentadas por el Partido para su fortalecimiento, enarbolando la consigna de su identificacion con el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera ilimitadamente

de este como fuente de su poderio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe compete ser el primer cuerpo y guardia que defienden con el fusil al Comite Central del Partido, confiandole su

indicaciones como un solo hombre y organizar y realizar todas las labores en atencion a sus lineamientos y politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben asumir como dos tareas primordiales el fortalecimiento

vanguardia de la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ejercito Popular intensificara mas el entrenamiento para elevar la capacidad de combate real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui precisamente una manera de defender a la patria socialista y el pueblo y siendo mas exigente con los ejercicios se puede formar cuanto antes a un poderoso ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso renovar sin cesar el contenido, la forma y el metodo de los ejercicios de acuerdo con la estrategia, tactica e ideologia militares del Partido y con la exigencia y modalidad del autoctono metodo de combate y de la guerra moderna y no interrumpir ni un momento los ejercicios practicos que asemejan la batalla real.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora que Estados Unidos y sus seguidores forman alborotos en la Peninsula Coreana y sus cercanias, le atane mantener una vigilancia extrema y dar mas acicate a los preparativos de guerra, de modo que los agresores no se atrevan a violar ni afrentar en modo alguno la dignidad y soberania nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas unidades de diversos ejercitos, armas y especialidades tendran un buen dominio de sus armamentos, se entrenaran para la mayor especializacion y de esta manera estaran siempre listas para combatir con alta tecnologia en cualquier operacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, de acuerdo con la exigencia de una nueva fase para convertir a todo el ejercito en el de cuadros y modernizarlo, presentaran como importante tarea estrategica la excelente preparacion de sus efectivos en todos los aspectos y prestaran primordial atencion a su realizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl Ejercito Popular le atane establecer una ferrea disciplina militar y perfeccionar su aspecto como fuerzas regulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militares, desde el soldado hasta el general, haran suyas las normas y reglas establecidas y se acostumbraran a observarlas. Las unidades y subunidades y los militares demostraran su aspecto como fuerzas regulares en cualquier lugar y momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiempre conscientes de que no pueden vivir un instante separados de la poblacion, todos los oficiales y soldados la respetaran y amaran de todo corazon y mantendran el bello rasgo del ejercito revolucionario que se arriesga para defenderla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPensaran que para el pueblo no existen tareas importantes o menudas y consideraran como un estilo revolucionario dedicarle todo lo suyo con una actitud de ilimitada sinceridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnarbolando mas la consigna patriotica y revolucionaria de Encarguemonos tanto de la defensa nacional como de la construccion socialista, mostraran el heroismo sin par en todas las obras para materializar el sueno e ideal del pueblo, con el espiritu creador y la combatividad que todo lo hacen posible, y seguiran siendo los primeros en embellecer a nuestra patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCompaneros:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que persista el imperialismo en la Tierra y continue la politica hostil de Estados Unidos a Corea, jamas puede variar la mision del Ejercito Popular como poderoso remedio para defender el pais, el pueblo y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria final pertenece a nuestro Partido y pueblo que empunan con firmeza el fusil de la revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos seguros de que el Ejercito Popular de Corea, que ha venido asegurando con las armas la causa revolucionaria del Juche, seguira salvaguardando como muralla de acero al Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo y multiplicando su capacidad como defensor de la justicia y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor tener al Ejercito Popular de Corea ilimitadamente fiel a la direccion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, nuestra gloriosa patria, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, sera eternamente poderosa y prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDelante de ustedes flameara siempre la bandera del invencible Partido del Trabajo de Corea, dandoles un gran estimulo y conduciendolos hacia una nueva lucha y victoria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Luchemos con valentia por el Partido, la revolucion, la patria y el pueblo!"

Ahora, actua groseramente para utilizar los 23o Juegos Olimpicos Invernales de caracter pacifico como un escenario para incitar la maxima presion y sancion contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el canciller japones Kono insistio en Pakistan, los Emiratos Arabes Unidos, Canada, China y otros paises en la necesidad de presion anti-RPDC y sigue instigando a los paises que tienen las relaciones diplomaticas con la RPDC la ejecucion completa de las \"resoluciones de sancion economica\" y la ruptura de las relaciones diplomaticas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvaluo de alto el \"reporte de revision del estado nuclear\" de la administracion Trump que demostro abiertamente la ambicion de amenazar con armas nucleares a otros paises soberanos y dominar a todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos gobernantes japoneses perdieron ya la calidad de hablar de la paz y la estabilidad, ya que apoyan y defienden la politica de garrote nuclear de EE.UU. que impuso en dos ocasiones los desastres nucleares al pueblo japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, las palabras y acciones de Kono que esta al frente de la campana de sancion y presion anti-RPDC demuestran que este tipejo no pasa de ser una marioneta de EE.UU. y vocero del representante norteamericano acreditado en Tokio, que no tiene ni la logica elemental ni el conocimiento comun ni las cualidades del diplomatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, otros caudillos de las fuerzas gobernantes de Japon insisten a porfia en la ejecucion de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC del Consejo de la ONU, que hacen recordar la inquisicion de la edad medieval, e infunden el ambiente de enfrentamiento, lisonjeando a EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, las banda de Abe se vale de todas las artimanas y fraudes para enmendar a toda costa la Constitucion a fin de convertir Japon en el pais capaz de hacer la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una gran equivocacion si los reaccionarios japoneses tratan a la RPDC con la concepcion del siglo pasado cuando violaba arbitrariamente el Poder estatal de Corea junto con los paises vecinos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Kono y otros reaccionarios japoneses siguen recurriendo a la locura conflictiva anti-RPDC sin tener en cuenta la situacion de si mismos, adelantaran mas su autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas han de actuar con prudencia tomando en cuenta el poderio de la RPDC que ha situado dignamente en la posicion de Estado estrategico."
