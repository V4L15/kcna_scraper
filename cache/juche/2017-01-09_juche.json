desire of Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t Respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un in his New Year Address stressed the need to frustrate the challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad who go against the Korean nation's desire for reunification and clearly see who is the principal enemy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of who is the principal enemy of the nation is a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery and a matter of properly approaching the country's reunification, the cherished desire common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the sworn enemy of the Korean nation as it partitioned its territory into two parts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S., the Koreans have suffered pain and misfortune from the territorial division for more than seven decades and have never been free from the constant danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces landed in south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the Japanese imperialists in pursuance of their aggressive interests in the middle of the last century, dividing Korea into two parts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then, the U.S. has resorted to the persistent intervention and aggression in wanton violation of the sovereignty of the Korean nation in a bid to realize the strategy for dominating the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal nature of the U.S. as a disturber of Korea's reunification had been already brought to light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., displeased to see the Korean nation reunified as one, has pursued the scenario of sowing seeds of discord among Koreans in an effort to drive the anti-reunification forces of south Korea into confrontation and war with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the U.S. quitted south Korea, taking hands off the issue of Korea, the Korean nation would have achieved the country's reunification long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unprecedented deadlock of the north-south relations at present is an inevitable result of the U.S. heinous plots and intrigues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has persistently interfered in the internal affairs of the Korean nation, laying a stumbling block in the way of settling the issue of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that it openly disturbed the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, agreements common to the nation, and deliberately escalated the tension whenever the movement for reconciliation grew strong between the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the chief architect of national division and the principal enemy of the Korean nation hindering its reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the anti-reunification sycophantic and treacherous forces in south Korea are foolish enough to seek a way out in escalating confrontation with compatriots in the north, still regarding it as their principal enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet warmongers defined the compatriots in the north as the principal enemy and justified the dependence on outside forces and confrontation with the compatriots in the \"defense white paper.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crying out for tightening alliance with the U.S., they have resorted to the smear campaign against compatriots in the north, in collusion with outside forces, and gone busy with solicitation diplomacy over the issue of national reunification, the internal issue of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations are pushed to the worst phase and a serious obstacle is lying in the way of the country's reunification due to acts of treachery of the Park Geun Hye group which, so obsessed with confrontation with compatriots, can hardly discern who is the real enemy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time for all Koreans to dynamically stage a nationwide struggle to frustrate the moves of such anti-reunification sycophantic and treacherous forces as Park Geun Hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans should struggle to solve the issue of the country's reunification through unity and alliance with the transparent viewpoint and stand, firm pluck and confidence that it can be settled by the concerted efforts of the nation responsible for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should heighten the vigilance against outside forces' interference and arbitrary practices to dominate the Korean peninsula and the region, keeping the nation divided forever, and never allow such deed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should accelerate the nation-wide reunification advance by united efforts of the nation and thus bring about a new phase of independent reunification without fail this year."
