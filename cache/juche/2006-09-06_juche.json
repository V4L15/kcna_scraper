Its malicious moves to form an encircling ring around the DPRK and military blackmail against it are a wanton violation of the UN Charter which bans hostile acts against the UN member nations and a criminal act weakening the UN authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the arbitrary and unilateral policy of the U.S. which has gone beyond control is allowed, international justice cannot be ensured and no country can exercise its legitimate rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The realities today in which the sovereignty of different countries is trodden underfoot and global peace and security are facing a grave threat urgently call upon all the countries to maintain a sharper vigilance against the arbitrary and unilateral policy of the U.S. than ever before. The world peace-loving people should oppose and resolutely shatter it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anti-North Smear Campaign of Ultra-Right Forces in S. Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary assails the ultra-right forces in south Korea for becoming evermore undisguised in their anti-north smear campaign.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, they made public a \"report on the results of the investigation made into those abducted by the north during the June 25 war.\" It is full of sheer lies such as the baseless claim that the north \"abducted\" south Koreans in an organized manner during the last war and that most of them were \"abducted right after the start of the war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"report\" worked out by the above-said elements and released by a reptile newspaper is a sheer fabrication as it grossly tampered with history and falsified facts. It is nothing but a product of the unpardonable anti-north campaign because it seriously insults the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for \"those abducted by the north during the June 25 war\" much touted by the ultra-right forces in south Korea, they joined the volunteer army to fight against the U.S. imperialists' aggression and courageously came over to the north in quest of a worthwhile life, after being disillusioned with the colonial fascist rule in force in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this rash act of making profound confusing of right and wrong the above-said elements seek to stoke extreme bitterness towards the north, zealously pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, in a bid to chill the daily mounting desire to achieve reunification through the pro-north movement and alliance with the north in south Korea and stem the trend of the June 15 era of reunification and restore the outdated era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Branding what the ultra-right conservative forces in south Korea are now doing against the nation as the last-ditch efforts of those forsaken by the era, the commentary urges them not to waste time with peddling the fiction about \"those abducted by the north\" but probe the truth behind the luring and abduction operation conducted by them in collusion with the U.S. to forcibly take people from the north to the south and open it to the public and make an apology for the crime.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he took epochal measures unprecedented in history to recall all the teachers, scholars and students from the front and to set up the study-while-working system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the guidance of the President, a decision on carrying the universal compulsory primary education into effect from 1956 was adopted and a law on enforcing the universal compulsory secondary education from Nov. 1, 1958 was promulgated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Free education started in primary schools in 1956 and in middle schools in 1958 and tuition system was abolished in all the schools up to universities and postgraduate courses on April 1, 1959. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's theses marked a new turning point in the development of education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThanks to the popular educational policy of the President the educational system of the country has been constantly consolidated and developed, the overall education reached incomparably high standard and a compulsory education of high level is being enforced in the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Establishment of Fair International Political Order Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- It is necessary to put the earliest possible end to the present unfair international political order whereby human rights standards are applied to certain countries in a selective manner though they should be based on the principle of objectivity and universal value. For the present, the U.S. should be forced to roll back its unreasonable policy to use human rights as a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and an important lever for realizing its wild ambition for world supremacy. \r\n Minju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel is neither censured nor held accountable for its military actions against innocent civilians because such countries as the U.S. styling itself a \"human rights judge\" are abusing the human rights issue for attaining their sinister political purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was behind the recent military operation of Israel. It not only supported Israel in its military actions but protected it from international criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never escape from the responsibility for Israel's crimes against humanity as the U.S. and Israel were closely linked with each other politically over the Lebanese situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This hard fact had an impact on the stand of the U.S. and other Western countries and some international organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hard reality today that human rights standards vary according to which countries the U.S. deals with.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
