They are staging war manoeuvres against North Korea on the pretext of \"intrusion\" and the like.\r\n   The war manoeuvres against the north the present South Korean rulers have staged since they took power are nearly ten times as many as in the same period right after the appearance of the \"civilian\"-veiled \"government.\"\r\n   Worse still, the present South Korean chief executive visited military academies and units of the three services of the puppet army and incited war fever, crying for \"confrontation with communism.\"\r\n   The arms buildup and war manoeuvres will only result in worsening the north-south relations and  leading the situation of the country to the brink of war.\r\n   Now that the South Korean rulers are resorting to the arms buildup and war manoeuvres hand in glove with outside forces, we will have no choice but to take strong countermeasures.\r\n   They must discontinue their arms buildup and war manoeuvres at once and stop their reckless  moves to unleash a war against us immediately.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, a large number of people have lost their jobs, many families have been destroyed and many children  became \"orphans,\" abandoned by their parents.\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are bestially cracking down upon the struggle of workers and jobless people while appeasing them.\r\n   They must put an immediate end to the brutal suppression.\r\n   The speakers expressed the belief that the South Korean workers would certainly frustrate the murderous layoff system and \"restructuring\" by fighting in firm unity in defiance of appeasement, deception and violence employed by the authorities.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
