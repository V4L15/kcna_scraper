It is also a worthwhile work to glorify forever the history and tradition of the Korean revolution that has wrought epoch-making miracles by the force of the army-people unity, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this force, we should carry out the mammoth tasks for this year. The army and the people should pool their efforts to bring an epochal turn in agricultural production, put on a normal basis the production in pilot sections of the national economy and build monumental edifices glorifying the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army-people unity is characterized by the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of revolution and remaining faithful to its idea and leadership. This spirit is the source of the invincible might of the unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people should rally closer around the headquarters of revolution in terms of ideology and purpose, upholding the slogan \"Let us devotedly defend the headquarters of revolution led by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il!\" as the slogan of faith and action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inexhaustible might of the unity should be fully demonstrated in the drive to build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Like the army, all the people should set daring and big plans as required by the general march and put them into practice strenuously and energetically in a do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the general onward movement for this year we should build more edifices symbolizing the army-people unity such as army-people power station and bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should continue the brisk drive to improve the ideological viewpoint, style of work and way of life to the level of the army so that the soldier culture, emotion and spirit may prevail over the whole society. It is also important to more thoroughly establish the public traits of giving importance to the military affairs and putting forward the army.\r\n The editorial calls for giving fuller play to the might of the army-people unity under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il and thus adorning this significant year as a year of proud victory and glory unprecedented in the history of the country. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "True Colors of U.S. as Arch Nuclear Criminal Disclosed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Thursday carries a lengthy signed article laying bare the true colors of the U.S. imperialist aggressors as the arch nuclear criminal in the world.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real nature of the U.S. as the world's arch nuclear criminal found a vivid expression in the fact that it singled out a preemptive nuclear attack as its basic military strategy for world domination after the Sept. 11 incident and has since contemplated the use of nukes as conventional weapons, regarding all other countries of the world as targets of its nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the main target of the U.S. strategy of preemptive attack, its strategy of preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. imperialists had suffered a shameful defeat in the last Korean war, they have worked hard to stifle the DPRK by use of nukes. To this end, they have shipped at least 1,000 nuclear weapons of different types into south Korea, turning it into the biggest nuclear outpost in the Far East and incessantly increasing the nuclear threat to the DPRK. The U.S. is, therefore, chiefly to blame for having spurned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have staged ceaseless nuclear war exercises targeted against the DPRK with huge nuclear strike means involved, openly threatening to use them in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. This has increased the danger of a nuclear war on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises, a combination of \"RSOI\" and \"Foal Eagle,\" staged last March in south Korea, were reckless large-scale nuclear war exercises for a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the DPRK can not remain a mere onlooker given the fact that the U.S. is persistently pursuing its policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes. It was the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons and Washington is chiefly to blame for standing in the way of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. The DPRK's possession of nuclear weapons is an exercise of its legitimate right to self-defence and a measure for just defence as it is aimed to avert a war and protect its\r\nideology and system, freedom and democracy from the U.S. increasing nuclear threat and its attempt at preemptive nuclear attack.  It is in full line with the principle of defending national sovereignty and requirements of international law for preventing war and ensuring peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. can find a smooth solution should the U.S. stop uttering such empty words as \"it has no intention to invade north Korea\" devoid of any guarantee but take such trustworthy measure in practice as rolling back its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes and making a switchover to a policy of peaceful coexistence with it. Whether the U.S. makes a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK or not is a touchstone showing whether it truly wants the settlement of the nuclear issue between them and the denuclearization of the peninsula or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the peninsula is to be nuclear-free, it is necessary to clear south Korea and its vicinity of all the U.S. nuclear weapons and its threat of a nuclear war and eliminate all possibilities of south Korea going nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a focal point and the master key to denuclearizing the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is loudmouthed about \"non-proliferation of nuclear weapons\" but it is, in fact, chiefly accountable for fostering the nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from its biased stand, the U.S. has connived at, encouraged and cooperated with those forces toeing its line and its allies in the development and possession of nukes. But it has pulled up those countries that incurred its displeasure over their \"nuclear issues\" and kicked up a noisy racket of pressure in a bid to internationalize those issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any alliance with the U.S. is used as standards by which to handle the nuclear issue, then the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would be invalid. As a matter of fact, the double standards applied by the U.S. in handling the nuclear issue are turning the NPT into an irrelevant dead document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a particularly serious attention is that the start of a global thermo-nuclear war by the U.S. is no longer an assumption but may be a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The internal and external situation of the U.S. is not good. The U.S. economy is in the grip of a crisis due to the increasing burden of military spending and the escalating \"anti-terrorism war\". Its financial and trade deficits are swelling faster than ever before and the bankruptcy of enterprises and the depression of production are going from bad to worse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American society is threatened with the nightmare of terrorism and horror and pervaded with an atmosphere of internal division. The U.S. stands more isolated internationally for its high-handed practices and unilateralism. It is seeking a way out of this serious crisis in igniting a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past the U.S. nuclear attack was targeted against one or two cities of a country but now the world has, in fact, become the target of the nuclear war to be provoked by the U.S. Herein lies the great danger of its strategy of preemptive nuclear attack.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Some of them proved to be living in Japan or to have been murdered. This well shows what crafty and childish method the Japanese right-wing conservative politicians are using\r\nto attain their political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hectic anti-DPRK campaign of the Japanese reactionaries over the abduction issue is designed to escalate confrontation between the DPRK and Japan, scrap the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and create a climate for reinvasion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A proof of this is that they have recently worked out \"OPLAN 5029-05,\" a more concrete version of their war scenario to invade the DPRK.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Thursday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warmongers have gone the lengths of working out this new adventurous \"plan\" for a war of aggression against the DPRK. This indicates that the U.S. policy for stifling the DPRK is rapidly inching close to the dangerous phase of igniting a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"OPLAN 5029-05\" unlike the previous \"plans\" is chiefly aimed to deliberately create a war state on the Korean Peninsula and spark a military conflict on its own initiative. It calls upon the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" to replace the U.S. Pacific Command not only in working out plans but in carrying out operations.\r\n Large-scale joint military exercises have been staged with huge aggressor armed forces involved, new type shells with high destructive power are being provided to the U.S. forces present in south Korea, the reorganization of their second division is expected to be completed by this summer, that is, two years earlier than scheduled, and the U.S. is contemplating shipping smaller nuclear bombs capable of destroying underground facilities into south Korea before any other places. These dangerous military moves can be seen only on the eve of war. They are intended to put into practice the scenarios for preemptive attacks on the DPRK such as the new \"OPLAN 5029-05\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the attempt of the Bush warmongers and their allied forces to bring down the system in the DPRK and invade it while talking about a \"particular situation\" and \"the rapidly changed situation\" is nothing but daydreams of those suffering from psychosis and megalomania. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to heed the DPRK's warnings and cancel its war scenarios and roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK. Should the warmongers continue running wild, they will be bound to meet wholesale deaths in face of the Songun army of the DPRK.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They range from the essence, mission and role of the health service to issues of thoroughly implementing the prophylactic line of the Workers' Party of Korea, improving medical service, developing medical science and technology, strengthening the training of medical workers and fully ensuring material supply to the health sector. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The correctness and great vitality of the Juche-based idea on public health advanced in the letter, which should be taken as guidelines in the socialist health service, have been fully manifested through practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of the DPRK have enjoyed the benefits of the socialist health service such as the preventive and free medical service and section doctor system even in difficult years of the \"Arduous March\" and forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government has taken steps to protect the people from various communicable diseases with regular vaccination and anti-epidemic measures and to plug teeth for a million people free of charge every year over the last decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The material and technical foundation of the public health sector has been strengthened, scientific accuracy and efficacy of diagnosis and treatment improved with the introduction of latest scientific and technical achievements and thus qualitative level of medical service raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many successes have been made in medical science and technology in recent years. Many kinds of good medicine have been developed and their production processes established. And a new kind of cell strain has been found out for diagnosis and production of preventive medicines against viral diseases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, modern hospitals, medical institutes and medicine production centers including the Academy of Koryo Medical Science, Children's Nourishment Institute, Endocrine Institute, Taedonggang Injector Factory, Kanggye Koryo Medicine Factory have been built in different parts of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
