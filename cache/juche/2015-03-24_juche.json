He added that the factory should build up a strong technical force and raise the level of technical skill of its employees to establish a scientific method of producing fish meal fodder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing expectation and belief that the employees of the factory would creditably fulfill their duties, he had a photo session with them."
