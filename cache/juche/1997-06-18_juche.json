            "content": "Statement of spokesman for Ministry of People's Armed Forces\r\n Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will not hesitate to fight the final battle with the United States and the south Korean authorities if they so earnestly wish to make a military showdown with the DPRK.\r\n   The spokesman for the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces of the DPRK warns this in a statement today as the dangerous scheme of the enemies to mount a forestalling attack on the DPRK is being put in action rapidly.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   On June 17, the south Korean puppet navy and marine corps staged a \"joint landing exercise\" involving various types of warships and large military forces as what they call a \"demonstration of operations of combined battle groups\" on the East Sea of Korea.\r\n   On June 14, puppet marine corps units held a surprise landing exercise aboard I.B.S. rubber boats, simulating the distance between the Paekryong Island on the West Sea of Korea and the seashore of the north side.\r\n   The enemies overtly describe the exercises as aimed at \"enhancing the operability for landing on the enemy seashore anytime and anywhere.\"\r\n   They have gone so far as to threaten they will take a \"countermeasure\" and spread a \"sea of fire\" against the DPRK on the military demarcation line and \"retaliate\" on the DPRK even by using chemical weapons stockpiled in south Korea.\r\n   It is common military knowledge that landing exercise is attack exercise that goes beyond self-defence.\r\n   We cannot overlook the fact that the recent exercises were landing exercises for attack.\r\n   It is self-evident what the attack exercises are targeted at. The enemies' landing exercises are obviously part of their aggressive and offensive combat exercises against the DPRK.\r\n   We have warned more than once that the rumour extensively spread by the United States and the south Korean puppets from the beginning of the year about \"possibility of the outbreak of war\" by the food shortage-stricken DPRK is to create circumstances for a forestalling attack on the DPRK.\r\n   The enemies consider that the circumstances for the attack operations have been ripe in the main.\r\n   Since the beginning of this month, we have sharply watched the ill-boding military movements of the south Korean puppet army on the East and West coasts of Korea and the mobile exercises of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces coinciding with them.\r\n   On June 14 when the surprise landing exercise of the south Korean puppet army was going on, the U.S. military moved the control stations of the 13th marine flying regiment from Iwakuni of Japan and the West Coast of the U.S. mainland to the Osan Air Force Base in south Korea in order to carry out a long-distance nonstop flight exercise along the Iwakuni-Osan route and the U.S. mainland -Okinawa-Osan route.\r\n   It is clear what the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppets seek.\r\n   The enemies are thought to believe it is high time they made a forestalling attack since the DPRK is temporarily suffering from repeated natural disasters and numerous soldiers of its armed forces are engaged in farming in the socialist countryside. They are mistaken, however.\r\n   The chief executive of south Korea is trying to aggravate the tensions and make a military showdown with the north in a bid to find a way out of the serious political crisis caused by the Hanbo incident, the \"Presidential Election campaign funds\" and other scandals.\r\n   Dialogue and war are incompatible.\r\n   The enemies are outwardly calling for \"four-way talks\" for a lasting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and, behind the scenes, making war preparations in earnest.\r\n   At this moment when dark clouds of war are rushing toward our motherland and fighting is about to break out, our revolutionary armed forces cannot remain an onlooker to the situation, pinning hopes on dialogue for an indefinite period.\r\n   It is the noble mission of the Korean people's army to safeguard the socialist motherland and the people reliably by force of arms.\r\n   When aggression is triggered off, counterattack will follow inevitably.\r\n   Our people's army will level its guns at every movement of the enemies and promptly take relevant countermeasures.\r\n   If the enemies try to test our will and military strength despite our repeated warnings, our people's army will mobilize all potentials consolidated for scores of years and give vent to our people's pent-up grudges and wrath. \r\n\r\n"

They should invariably uphold their leader singleheartedly with the steadfast revolutionary outlook on the leader, come what may.\r\n   The idea of the red flag and the spirit of resolutely safeguarding the leader should be prevalent in the whole society and, to this end, all the party members and people should actively learn from the spirit of revolutionary soldiers.\r\n   The more strained the situation, the greater efforts should be put into strengthening the people's army on the basis of the revolutionary philosophy that the destiny of socialism and the development of the country are guaranteed by the might of the people's army.\r\n   The imperialists and the reactionaries may try desperately and there may be some traitors and renegades as the revolution is prolonged and manifold difficulties crop up, but we do not feel surprised at all.\r\n   With no desperate efforts can the enemy block the great struggle and triumphant advance of the Korean people, the reporter declared. \r\n\r\n"
