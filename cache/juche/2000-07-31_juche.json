The north and south will steer the inter-Korean ministerial talks in conformity with the spirit of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      Firstly, the north-south ministerial talks should discuss and solve the issues of putting into practice the joint declaration signed by the leaders of the two sides in such a way as to respect the agreed points laid down in it and seek shared interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     Secondly, the north-south ministerial talks should begin with solving easy problems in a spirit of good faith and cooperation, from the practice in the past when negotiators were locked in distrust and dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     Thirdly, the north-south ministerial talks should attach importance to practice so as to produce substantial results before the nation and go in for peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   2.

The north and the south cooperate with each other and take appropriate measures to help compatriots under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan form a home-visiting group and visit their hometowns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   5. The north and the south agree to relink the severed Seoul-Sinuiju Railways and discuss the matters related to it at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   6.

It only lays bare the true colors of the United States which has up to this date interfered in the internal affairs of South Korea as a de facto ruler in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. ambassador's remarks are an insult to all the Korean people working hard to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country as early as possible as they go against the basic spirit of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our nation responsible for the solution of the issue of the country's reunification should settle it independently by its concerted efforts.

It is clear that the U.S. has an axe to grind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What arouses the world's unanimous apprehension at the moment is not the DPRK's \"missile threat\" but the U.S. \"National Missile Defence\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. conservative hard-liners' big fuss about the fiction of the DPRK's \"missile test\" and \"missile threat\" is aimed to calm down the world criticism of the U.S. even a bit and divert its focus to the DPRK in a bid to establish its reckless and dangerous \"NMD\" system at any cost.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. \"NMD\" is bound to misfire in face of strong domestic and foreign censure. \r\n\r\n"
