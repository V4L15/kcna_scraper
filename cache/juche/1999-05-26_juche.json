This is a righteous and just struggle to oppose flunkeyist treachery and fascist outrage of the South Korean authorities and defend elementary vital rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The c.c. of the Korean Metal, Machine, Mining and Power Workers Union extends full support and encouragement to their struggle.   The South Korean authorities' suppression of the unionists of Kumsokryonmaeng shows their wicked intention to put down the workers' demand at the point of bayonet and continue to depend on foreign forces and cling to anti-social misrule.   As long as the colonial rule of the U.S.  continues and flunkeyist quislings strut about in South Korea, the position of the workers cannot be changed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letter expressed the belief that the South Korean workers, compatriots and class brothers, will fight it out to make their demands met and clearly show the united might and mettle of the working class to the South Korean rulers.  \r\n\r\n"

Paektu, I came to know that Marshal Kim Jong Il is a person who is affiliated with the gun. He mastered how to fire a gun in his early years, when he realised that with a gun one is sure to win.\r\n   It is none other than our Marshal who devoted his soul to the iron and shared affection with the gun. The gun of the Marshal is his comrade that is at his side with faith and accompanies him with aim.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The May spring of the south witnessed blood shed by guns of traitors. But the gun has become a comrade in the north so that spring comes from obligation and faith, turning red as an everlasting spring of Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The gun in the south is considered to be a dirty one that is obedient to the ruling quarters and despotic to the popular masses. It is a pronoun of submission and crime, an evil one that should not have been.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, in the north there is a person who calls the gun motherland, love and independence. He is none other than the brilliant commander Kim Jong Il, a peerlessly great man.\r\n   The two pistols left by Kim Hyong Jik were the first seed of arms on this land. They were instrumental in bringing the liberation and victory by Kim Il Sung, who was a commander of the anti-Japanese guerilla army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Marshal's outlook on the gun has been perfected by the takeover of guns made in blood.\r\n   The gun of Kim Jong Il is the hand of patriotism and a smile that builds up a powerful nation and gives happiness to the people.\r\n   The American empire was amazed not by nuke-bomb but by his philosophy of the gun which makes it possible to win by the force of ideology, leadership and virtues. \r\n\r\n"

Korean chief executive's \"solicitation diplomacy\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of South Korea is reportedly to set out on a foreign trip from May 27.   In this regard some mass media of South Korea and other countries have recently made propaganda for someone's \"support\" and \"cooperation\" for the \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" of the South Korean authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean chief executive himself in an \"interview\" cried out for \"cooperation\" in \"security\", repeating the same tone of argument and revealed again his sinister attempt to bring the internal affairs of the Korean nation to international arena.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such a fact indicates that his projected foreign trip is a \"solicitation diplomacy\" pursuing a criminal purpose to beg for international \"support\" to his anti-national, anti-reunification policy toward the north and further aggravate the military tensions on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" are in essence aimed at refusing the other party's option for system  and \"inducing\" somebody to degenerate under the deceptive signboards of \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief executive of South Korea said during his visit to the United States last year this is the same as the policy with which the U.S. collapsed the former Soviet Union and other east European  socialist countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" are, in the long run, nothing but a reversion of the anti-north confrontation policy of the South Korean authorities, local henchmen following the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a product of imprudent expansive delusion. \r\n\"Solicitation diplomacy\" to gain support from someone with such anachronistic anti-north policy cannot be construed otherwise than the anti-north, anti-reunification behaviour of the flunkeyist traitor.\r\n   And those who are going to support his criminal acts will be branded as those who are to join in his anti-north separatist policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Never should it go unnoticed that in defiance of our repeated warnings, some countries surrounding Korea are going to sell modern submarines and other war materials and equipment to South Korea for a small amount of money. This is in essence a shameless undisguised hostile act against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This act of surrounding countries helps toward the U.S. arbitrariness under the situation in which the United States is deploying more armed forces in South Korea from the mainland under the pretext of filling up \"vacuum of combat power on the Korean peninsula\" caused by the Kosovo crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moves of the South Korean authorities pursuing the anti-reunification policy to isolate and stifle the north and of those countries that are siding with it will inevitably go bankrupt.\r\n   While watching their moves, we will take a strong countermeasure corresponding with our sovereign right in case it is considered necessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The master of the Korean issue is the Korean people and all attempts to internationalize it contrary to their will are the criminal moves to ignore the national right to self-determination and dignity of the Korean people and obstruct the reunification of Korea, which can never be tolerated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should discontinue the anti-national, anti-reunification flunkeyist treacheries, and countries surrounding the Korean peninsula should act with prudence lest they should be embroiled in the criminal Korea policy and anti-north confrontation policy of the United States and the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
