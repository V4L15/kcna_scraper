and member of the House of Representatives= members of the SDP delegation Masako Owaki, Director of the International department of the SDP and member of the House of Councillors, and Hideo Den, Vice-Chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defence Department Council of the SDP and member of the House of Councillors= Head of the delegation of the New Party Sakigake Akiko Domoto, Chairperson of the New Party Sakigake dietmen's group and member of the House of Councillors= and suite members.\r\n   The talks discussed issues of DPRK-Japan relations and the resumption of talks for establishment of DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations, pending humanitarian and cooperation matters and issue of strengthening visits and contacts of ruling parties and in other domains.\r\n    Before discussing the issues, the WPK side said that all the WPK members and working people of Korea with great pride and honor of having General Kim Jong Il as WPK General Secretary are pushing ahead with the Korean-style socialism, rallied close around him in one mind.\r\n   The WPK side stressed it is the unshakable faith of the Korean people that led by General Kim Jong Il who is identical with President Kim Il Sung, they will certainly win and that it is their firm will that when he is determined to do, they do anything under any circumstances.\r\n    Touching upon the situation on the Korean Peninsula and national reunification question, the WPK side said the south Korean authorities are now staging large-scale joint military manoeuvres against the northern half of Korea behind the scene of \"inter-Korean dialgoue\" and \"four-way talks\" and rendering the situation extremely strained by introducing modern combat equipment from outside.\r\n   All the facts show that the present \"government\" of south Korea does not seek to have inter-Korean dialogue and reunification, but to emerge from the worst political crisis.  \r\n    There is no change in the stand of the DPRK to ease tensions between the north and south of Korea, build confidence and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country through dialogue and negotiations between the two sides of Korea, it stressed.\r\n   The WPK side called attention to the fact that official personnel of Japan let out words getting on the nerve of the DPRK and threatening it, clamouring about the \"event of contingency on the Korean Peninsula\" and are rendering the situation on the peninsula strained by pursuing the policy entirely inclined to south Korea, and urged Japan to do things helpful toward the relaxation of tension on the peninsula and the reunification of Korea and to pursue a balanced policy at least.\r\n   Sharing the view that the DPRK-Japan relations must be normalised at an early date, both sides explained their viewpoints.\r\n   The WPK side said independence, peace and friendship constitute the idea of the WPK external policy and with the 21st century, the Asia-Pacific era, at hand the Asian people, the masters of Asia, should build a new Asia, independent, peaceful and prosperous.  \r\n   The WPK side said that it is the invariable stand of the WPK to establish and develop good neighbour relations with Japan.\r\n   It stressed that Japan must sincerely repent of the past when it inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean people, abandon the hostile policy toward the DPRK and stop encouraging the division of Korea and obstructing its reunification.\r\n   Then, we will approach Japan, a neighbouring nation, with friendly feelings and the abnormal relations between the two countries will be improved, the WPK side noted.\r\n   The Japanese side referred to the importance of creating a good atmosphere for normalising the Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations.\r\n   It noted that it is necessary for the ruling parties to openheartedly exchange their views and expand interchanges in various domains.\r\n   It was stressed at the talks that the talks for normalising the DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations must be resumed at an early date.\r\n   The WPK side pointed out that to improve the DPRK-Japan relations is the aspiration and demand of the two peoples and, accordingly, dialogue between the two countries must be one for improving the relations and realising the common will and aspirations of the two peoples.\r\n   To this end, the two sides should trust each other and strive to do for an independent dialogue in which they should deal with matters in such a way as reaching an agreement by placing issues helpful to the improvement of relations above others, the WPK side said, and clarified that if the Japanese side sincerely wants to hold dialogue for the improved relations between the two countries, the DPRK is ready to do right now. \r\n   Turning to such problems as the \"suspicions\" and the repatriation of \"Japanese Red Army\" personnel raised by some members of the opposite side, with which the DPRK has nothing to do, the WPK side said their act is not a sincere attitude towards the talks, and that it is not helpful to the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations at all.\r\n   Discussed at the talks were matters of strengthening multilateral and bilateral contacts between the ruling parties of the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   The two sides shared the view that looking far into future, the two countries should be near and close countries, not near yet far-apart countries, and that they should seek active cooperation for the early establishment of the DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations and the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n   The talks proceeded in a sincere and good atmosphere.    \r\n\r\n"

He firmly built up the internal force of the nation and set in motion its force to the maximum and thus liberated the nation and ushered in a new era of national prosperity and development, an era of independence.\r\n   The Korean people, conscious of being the masters of their own destinies, defeated the incomparably strong Japanese and U.S. imperialists, and built a powerful Socialist state, independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in defence, from debris in a short span of time.\r\n   All these tremendous achievements are fine fruits of the high-pitched spirit of independence.\r\n   His greatness served as a motive force which helped the Korean nation fully display his creativity.\r\n   The excellent creative talents and might of the Kim Il Sung's nation brought up by him had been fully displayed in great social changes to set up the most advantageous socialist system of Korean style centred on the people by carrying out social revolutions of two stages in a short period and in the great history of creation to build up out of nothing a powerful independent national economy and the self-defensive capabilities which ensure the sovereignty of the country and the development of the nation.\r\n   His greatness also constituted a decisive factor which made it possible to achieve the close unity of the nation.\r\n   From the first days when he embarked upon the road of the revolution, President Kim Il Sung, deeply considerate of catastrophic consequences of chronic factional strifes which had been handed down in Korea and lessons left by them, wisely directed the struggle to preserve the national character and achieve the great national unity based on national character.\r\n   Under his wise leadership, the association for the restoration of the fatherland, a united front body involving people from all social standings, was formed  during the anti-Japanese armed struggle. After the country was liberated, different forces unsparingly devoted their energies, talents and wealth to the building of a new society in one mind under the banner of patriotism.\r\n   The highest-level singlehearted unity in which the leader, the party and the people are closely united in ideology, morality and obligation has been established in our country.    \r\n\r\n"
