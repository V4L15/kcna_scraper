He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK considers the military affair as the most important state affair and gives top priority to strengthening the army. This politics is the political mode which can be created only by Kim Jong Il, general type statesman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory and glory are always in store for the Korean people guided by Kim Jong Il, general type politician with literary and military accomplishments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The secretary general of the Tanzanian National Coordinating Committee of the Juche Idea Study Groups in his speech said: The world records many heroines, but no great woman performed such great exploits as Kim Jong Suk did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What occupies the most important place in her history of revolutionary struggle and her feats was that she ensured President Kim Il Sung's safety and brought about the future of modern Korea by giving a steady continuity to the revolutionary cause of Juche. \r\n\r\n"

This declaration represented the resolution of the communist parties and workers' parties to fight it out for the future of humankind with firm confidence in the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the declaration been published than over 150 media of more than 60 countries gave wide publicity to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of political parties which signed the declaration at the time of its adoption was 70 and it reached 170 one year after its adoption. 251 political parties have signed it up to this date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive parties including communist parties and workers' parties of various countries took the Pyongyang declaration as the charter of socialism and their action program and are working hard to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political parties of various countries including Russia and Romania keep pace with each other in the movement for rebuilding socialism, boosting their relations on the basis of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many progressive parties including the Communist Party of the Russian Federation, the Norwegian Communist Party and the New Communist Party of Great Britain sent their delegations to the DPRK to learn from experience in its party building and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A gathering of officials of progressive parties from more than 20 countries took place in Moscow to mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of the declaration. It adopted a statement \"let us advance under the uplifted banner of the Pyongyang declaration.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this shows that the Pyongyang declaration proves more valid as days go by. \r\n\r\n"

This was recognized by the world and even Japan is aware of this fact Tok Islet will always remain part of the territory of Korea and no one has the right to interfere in this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercise staged by the Japanese reactionaries was intended to use this as a pretext to commit a military provocation to the DPRK and launch their reconquest of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' claim to Tok Islet goes to prove that the Korean peninsula is made the first target of their overseas aggression and they leave no stone unturned to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people are greatly angered by the Japanese reactionaries who are keen on the moves to occupy Tok Islet, with the far-fetched assertion that it belongs to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and the people's army, their hearts burning with bitter grudge against Japanese militarism, will mete out a merciless punishment to the Japanese reactionaries, if they invade even an inch of Korea's territory. \r\n\r\n"
