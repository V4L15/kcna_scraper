They denounced the Japanese imperialists for seeking an extravagant purpose to obliterate the Korean nation through the sexual enslavement of the Korean women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever more undisguised moves of the Japanese reactionaries to distort history are aimed to instill into the Japanese people the idea that there is no need to feel guilty consciousness of the crimes committed by their country against humankind in the past and make a state compensation and reparation for them, so as to evade the liquidation of the crime-ridden past and revive militarism, they stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discussed at the subcommittee meetings held, divided into the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Japanese army, the issue of forcible drafting and the issue of Japan's distortion of history, were practical measures to further enhance the role of the International Solidarity Council and make the Japanese authorities liquidate the past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A statement related to the future activities of the council was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Outlined in the statement was the issue on conducting activities to bring Japan's past human rights violation to the international tribunal and an international signature campaign for demanding the Japanese authorities' liquidation of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also pointed to the issues of jointly investigating and exposing the damage caused by the criminal acts of the Japanese imperialists in Asia, conducting the activities of demanding the Japanese government survey, collect and return remains of victims dispersed in different parts of Asia, the activities to foil the moves of the Japanese ultra-right forces to militarize Japan and distort history and the activities of positively assisting the victims' litigation of compensation being held in different parts of the world against the Japanese government and enterprises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noted in the statement were the issues of strongly demanding the Japanese government make a clear reflection and apology for the past crimes in the process of establishing the DPRK-Japan diplomatic relations, investigate and open to the public the human rights abuses case by case and take steps to make compensation for them and conducting the activities of demanding the revision of the south Korea-Japan \"basic treaty\" in which an article of Japan's apology is not specified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting heard victims' oral evidence of the past crimes of Japan and saw a video show. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the meeting delegations and delegates of Korean organizations from the north and the south and abroad and victims held an exchange gathering to express their vow to wage a joint struggle to get an apology and compensation for the monstrous human rights abuses from Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is nothing but a despicable political plot to charge the DPRK with the proliferation of   nuclear substance and a foolish attempt to tarnish the international image of the DPRK and dodge daily mounting worldwide criticism and denunciation over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is widely known that the U.S. was rejected at the 2nd round of the Six Way talks and the meeting of the working group of the talks when it raised the fiction of the \"enriched uranium program,\" while pressurizing the DPRK to accept CVID. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that the U.S., much upset by this, spread such rumor in a bid to charge the DPRK with \"nuclear proliferation\" and make the \"enriched uranium program\" sound plausible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., ill-famed for lies and deceptive tricks, egged the IAEA, its tool, on to hatch a new plot to pressurize the DPRK to admit its \"enriched uranium program\". This is absolutely intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The smear campaign launched by the U.S. on the basis of the fiction of \"illegal sale of uranium hexafluoride,\" not content with spreading worldwide the rumor about the DPRK��s nonexistent \"enriched uranium program,\" clearly indicates that the U.S. has become most desperate in pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another sinister aim sought by the U.S. in this smear campaign is to raise again the fiction of \"enriched uranium program\" at the next round of the six way talks and force the DPRK to admit it in a bid to deliberately throw an obstacle to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can put international pressure upon the DPRK under the pretext of \"illegal sale of uranium hexafluoride\" and the like in an attempt to force it to disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase its capability for self-defence in every way under the uplifted banner of Songun no matter what others may say.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
