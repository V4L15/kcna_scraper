            "content": "South Korean Regime Accused of Provoking DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to a question put by the KCNA as regards the scheme of the south Korean regime to put its provocation attempt into practice by irritating the DPRK with militant actions almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime infiltrated its warships deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK southwest of Yonphyong Islands and fired bullets and shells at civilian fishing boats of a foreign country. Following this grave military provocation, it has resorted to war-like actions, seriously irritating the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak said at an urgent meeting of the ministers in charge of foreign affairs and security on Sept. 26 that south Korea should strictly cope with the north's politically-motivated and planned provocation, while getting it ready for the forthcoming election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Jong Sung Jo, chairman of the south Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff, toured the 7th division and 2nd corps of the army in the forefront on Sept. 28. He said there may be enemy provocation at any time and called for immediately and resolutely countering the provocation, regarding it as an opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin, minister of Defense, appeared at the 2nd Fleet Command of the navy where he called for keeping fully prepared while let loose a spate of invectives about the north's possible provocation by way of trumpeting in the east and attacking in the west.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers reinforced five islands in the West Sea of Korea and their surrounding waters with troops, artillery pieces, various types of missiles, fighters and warships and made a fuss as if something serious had happened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group made such reckless remarks as \"threat from the north\" and \"sign of provocation\" even at UN session and made vain efforts to build up public opinion over \"north wind\" as evidenced by its anti-DPRK confab with its U.S. master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In step with this, the ultra conservative media, philistine and human scum are busy spreading the \"rumor of the north's intervention in the presidential election\". They are alleging that the north is creating instability ahead of the presidential election in south Korea and that there is possibility of additional provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those bellicose remarks and frantic anti-DPRK racket are intentional and planned provocation aimed to orchestrate a shocking incident like military conflict by getting on the nerves of the DPRK to the extremes in a bid to get rid of the ruin and turn the table in favor of the conservative forces' stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically, the south Korean puppets have tried to find a way out in fabricating a groundless story about the \"north wind\" whenever they faced major political momentum and ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June 2010 they cooked up the hideous farce of \"Cheonan\" warship sinking incident for their vicious purposes to calm down the anger of the people at the \"government\" before the local election and secure the ruling stability with smooth election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Afterwards, the bold measure of the DPRK for improving the inter-Korean relations created big splashes in the south Korean public and the atmosphere of the movement against the confrontation policy mounted. But the warmongers hatched a military conflict like Yonphyong Islands shelling case and it resulted in chilling the hard-won atmosphere of improving the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean war maniacs reinforced troops as never before in the biggest hotspots of the West Sea and cried out for \"getting fully prepared\", while crisscrossing the forefront areas. But their intention is nothing new.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nobody would be deceived by their reckless remarks such as the \"north's intervention in the presidential election\" and \"instability\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People are now sick of their old stereotyped trick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people inside and outside Korea clearly see who is the real provocateur and from where the danger of war comes through the military provocations of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hackneyed and threadbare \"rumor of threat from the north\" would arouse the public resentment against the group of traitors of south Korea and hasten its ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should not run reckless, being aware that it will have to pay dearly for its provocation."

It should also practice such authority as finally examining the resolutions of the Security Council on peace and security, those on sanctions and the use of force, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reform of the Security Council, core agenda for the UN reform, brooks no further delay and it should be carried out on the principle of fully ensuring responsibility, transparency, impartiality and objectivity in activities and guaranteeing the right to representation of developing countries in formation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An end should be put to the politicization, selectivity and double-standards when discussing the human rights issue. Never to be allowed is the continued creation of circumstances in which the human rights situation of some countries are called into question while that of other countries are ignored to meet political purposes and interests of the West and according to the standard of Western-style value.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula has become the biggest hotspot in the world due to the U.S. persistent hostile policy toward the DPRK. There persists the vicious cycle of confrontation and escalation of tensions that even a spark may lead to a thermonuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No issue including the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can be settled unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK. This is the review of the whole course of dialogue it has had with the U.S. and the lesson it has drawn through its experience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will join hands with anyone who truly wants Korea's reunification and the nation's reconciliation and prosperity and make responsible and persevering efforts to frustrate outsiders' interference and anti-reunification forces' moves to perpetuate the country's division by concerted efforts of Koreans, and thus achieve the historic cause of national reunification."

            "content": "KCNA Issues Detailed Report on 5th Anniversary of October 4 Declaration\r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency issued a detailed report \"The 5-year-long history of the bedeviled north-south relations says\" on Thursday, the 5th anniversary of the historic October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t The gist of the report is as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The adoption of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, practical program of the former, marked a great event to shine in the history of the reunification movement of the Korean nation, the one and only nation in the world that has suffered from disgrace and pains for more than half a century due to its division. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean Lee Myung Bak regime during its tenure of office blatantly challenged the national reunification declarations, mercilessly infringed upon the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and brought about the worst phase of confrontation between compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It tarnished the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as \"national chauvinism\", \"narrow-minded nationalism\" and the root cause of \"insecurity\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group malignantly blustered that \"it would not be dragged by the north without a principle though it may not sit with the north for dialogue during its 5-year tenure of office\" and that \"it is ready to leave the inter-Korean relations frozen till the end of its tenure.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It carried out the overhaul of the \"Ministry of Unification\" to turn it into one of anti-reunification and reshuffled even Chongwadae and Intelligence Service to staff them with die-hard anti-reunification elements keen on inciting confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the positive and broad negotiations proposals made by the DPRK through the joint statement of its government, political party and organizations, the puppet regime categorically denied them, asserting \"sincerity is not in view\" and \"it might be a tactics\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, no proper dialogue was possible between the north and the south during Lee Myung Bak's office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group brutally clamped down on the persons concerned with the joint declarations and their supporters and went the lengths of repressing the former \"presidents\" who signed the June 15 Joint Declaration and October 4 declaration, forcing them into deaths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present inter-Korean relations have taken up the confrontation structure more serious than the one in the period of the Cold War before the adoption of the June 15 declaration, and plunged into the one reminiscent of a fierce war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group, in alignment with its U.S. master, rounded off the \"OPLAN 5027\" and \"OPLAN 5029\" to be the more provocative war plans and confirmed a pre-emptive attack on the DPRK as the orientation of its \"military policy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also revised the military reaction programs and operational rules so that the military units may ignite a war at any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Begging its U.S. master to extend the 2012 transfer deadline of wartime operational control, the Lee group even takes part in the dangerous \"Proliferation security initiative of weapons of mass destruction\" and U.S.-led establishment of missile defence system which its predecessors dared not attempt and turned south Korea into a base for igniting a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee and the military war maniacs have held more than a thousand of war drills against the DPRK for the past 5 years under various codenames including Ulji Freedom Guardian, Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, Hoguk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They mapped out a \"scenario for invading the north\" the main content of which is \"civil operation\" on the premises of waging a special warfare targeting the headquarters of the DPRK, preempting strikes at its nuclear and missile bases and occupying its territory. And they committed such dangerous acts of applying them to the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills in August.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to the new U.S. defense strategy and hostile war policy toward the DPRK, the Lee group has massively introduced various latest military equipment and mass destruction weapons and, at the same time, has got frenzy to conclude a military agreement with Japan and form the triangular military alliance with Japan and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the military confrontational rackets kicked up by the puppet regime, the waters around the 5 controversial islands in the west sea which the north and the south agreed to turn into peaceful waters have already turned into the world biggest hotspot where a second Korean war may break out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the great loss to the nation in December of last year, the Lee group of traitors committed unethical crimes against the nation, an unprecedentedly thrice-cursed politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK, stunning the entire nation and humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Uncountable is the damage the civilian economic cooperation and the overall economy of south Korea suffered due to its reckless acts against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to its moves to check the north-south cooperation between NGOs, lots of non-governmental cooperative enterprises and organizations ended their existence or are on the verge of bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean pubic are denouncing the Lee Myung Bak regime as \"the most broken regime in morality in history\", saying \"they can not but consider how it could so rapidly break the south-north relations in such a short period\". They are now contending that it is attributable to its pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese traitorous nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak conservative group was driven into a miserable plight of not being allowed to remain as a member of the nation due to its crimes against the nation and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Such a piteous lot of traitor Lee goes to prove that he will get only self-destruction through his anti-DPRK confrontation, and that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is, indeed, a desire of the Korean nation and a truth of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stand and attitude to the historic north-south joint declarations are a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from quislingism and reunification from division. The implementation of the joint declarations guarantees the nation's livelihood, reunification and peaceful prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is invariable in its stand to advance hand in hand with anyone if he sincerely desires the country's reunification and wishes for the nation's peace and prosperity, and to make responsible and persevering efforts to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the compatriots in the north, south and overseas will mercilessly smash the vicious moves of the separatist forces for escalating confrontation against reunification, and certainly usher in the new era of independent reunification and peaceful prosperity that proudly advances in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\"."

el camino por la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora en el Sur de Corea y en ultramar se avivan furiosamente las llamaradas de la lucha masiva por seguir impulsando la epoca del 15 de Junio y sentenciar rotundamente a la banda titere surcoreana que ahogo la aspiracion y el deseo de los coreanos por la reunificacion practicando en su mandato la politica de sumision a las fuerzas foraneas y la de confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La causa de reunificacion de la patria de los grandes Generalisimos, quienes abrieron maravillosas perspectivas de la prosperidad nacional, avanza vigorosamente gracias al Mariscal           Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Mariscal defiende y mantiene firmemente la idea y las lineas de los grandes Generalisimos sobre la reunificacion de la patria y sus hazanas inmortales y llama con energia a todos los coreanos a la lucha por cumplir esa empresa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La historica Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre son el legado precioso que dejo el Dirigente a los coreanos y la bandera de reunificacion independiente a levantar invariablemente toda la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy en dia, se interrumpieron el dialogo, las negociaciones, el contacto y el viaje reciproco entre ambas partes coreanas y fracaso el proyecto de cooperacion humanitaria, lo cual se debe a las fuerzas opositoras a la reunificacion como la horda de Lee Myung Bak que nego totalmente las declaraciones conjuntas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En actualidad, la salida para normalizar las relaciones N-S, eliminar el peligro de guerra y abrir la nueva epoca de reunificacion independiente y prosperidad comun esta en mantener y ejecutar las declaraciones arriba mencionadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nos esforzaremos activamente por dar continuidad a la nueva epoca de la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad, o sea, la epoca de reunificacion del 15 de Junio, levantando la bandera de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, programa de reunificacion del nuevo siglo, y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, programa de implementacion de la primera."

            "content": "Publicada informacion detallada de ACNC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 4 de octubre (ACNC) -- En ocasion del 5o aniversario de publicacion de la historica Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, la Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea hizo publica el dia 4 la informacion detallada \"Acusa el lustro de la ruptura de las relaciones Norte-Sur\". \n\t\t\t\t\tSe transmite abajo el resumen del texto:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, programa de ejecucion de la primera, fue un acontecimiento trascendental en la historia del movimiento por la reunificacion de la nacion coreana que sufre mas de un medio siglo la verguenza y dolores como unica nacion dividida en este mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, en desafio frontal a estas declaraciones pro-reunificacion de la nacion, el poder titere surcoreano de Lee Myung Bak durante el periodo de su mandato infringio brutalmente el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" y trajo la confrontacion fratricida nunca vista en la historia nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsulto ese ideal como \"nacionalismo chovinista y estrecho\" y fuente de la \"inquietud de seguridad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo con mala intencion que \"no dejare arrastrarme por el Norte sin principios si bien se quede en suspension el dialogo Sur-Norte durante un lustro\" y \"estoy decidido a dejar en congelacion las relaciones Sur-Norte hasta el final de mi mandato\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReestructuro completamente el Ministerio de Unificacion con el fin de convertirlo en un aparato anti-reunificacion y sustituyo hasta a los agentes de Chongwadae y el Servicio de Inteligencia por los maniacos de confrontacion y anti-reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el gobierno, partidos politicos y  entidades de la RPDC en su declaracion conjunta propusieron las negociaciones activas y amplias, las nego sin motivo alguno diciendo que \"no se ve la sinceridad\" y \"seria una tactica\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi que en todo el periodo de mandato de Lee Myung Bak no se realizo ninguna vez un dialogo efectivo entre el Norte y el Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, reprimio bestialmente a las personalidades relacionadas con la Declaracion Conjunta y sus partidarios y acoso y llevo a la muerte a los ex \"presidentes\" que firmaron la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas forman una estructura mas conflictiva que en el periodo de la guerra fria antes de la aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y se hallan en la coyuntura de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos adicionaron y completaron con los contenidos mas provocativos los planes de guerra de agresion a la RPDC como \"OPLAN 5027\" y \"OPLAN 5029\" en confabulacion con su amo norteamericano y fijaron el ataque preventivo contra ella como \"politica militar sobre el Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak modifico la guia de enfrentamiento militar y reglamentos operacionales para favorecer a las unidades militares provocar la guerra en cualquier momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImploro a su amo norteamericano el prolongamiento del periodo de traspaso del mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra, cuyo recibo fue programado hasta 2012, y se incorporo al establecimiento del sistema de defensa antimisil y a la \"Iniciativa de Seguridad contra la Proliferacion\" (PSI en ingles) en que hasta sus antecesores no se atrevieron a tomar parte, de modo que el suelo surcoreano se convirtio en una base de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante los ultimos cinco anos, el traidor Lee Myung Bak y los belicistas de la capa militar surcoreana libraron en mil y cientos de ocasiones con EE.UU. los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC tales como \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", \"Key Resolve\", \"Foal Eagle\" y \"Hoguk\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTrazo el \"guion de agresion al Norte\" basado en la \"operacion civil\" con la premisa de la guerra especial contra la Direccion de la Revolucion de la RPDC, el ataque preventivo a las bases nucleares y de misiles de ella y la ocupacion a sus zonas y lo aplico en los ejercicios belicos conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" desarrollado en agosto pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn adhesion a la nueva estrategia de defensa nacional y la politica de guerra contra la RPDC de EE.UU., introdujo en gran cantidad los equipos belicos ultramodernos de toda indole y armas de exterminio masivo mientras se desespera por concertar el convenio militar con Japon y fabricar la alianza militar tripartita. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la campana militar de la banda traidora, la zona maritima de cinco islas del Mar Oeste que se proyectaba convertirla en una area pacifica comun del Norte y el Sur se hizo la zona mas candente del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos crimenes antinacionales y antieticos de la banda traidora cometidos despues del gran duelo nacional sufrido en diciembre del ano pasado son provocaciones politicas sin precedentes que consternaron a la nacion coreana y los demas pueblos del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa imprudencia antinacional del traidor Lee causo incontables perdidas en la cooperacion economica civil y la economia surcoreana en conjunto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al impedimento de la cooperacion civil Norte-Sur, desaparecieron o fracasaron muchas companias y entidades surcoreanas que se animaban con la aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl circulo social surcoreano denuncia que \"como el poder de Lee Myung Bak pudo romper tan rapido las relaciones Sur-Norte en el corto periodo de su mandato\" y que \"el poder de Lee es el mas corrupto en moralidad en la historia\" y revela que esto se debe a la naturaleza vendepatria, proyanqui y projaponesa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda conservadora de Lee Myung Bak se encuentra en la situacion miserable en que no puede vivir mas junto con la nacion coreana por sus crimenes antinacionales y anti-reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl destino tragico del traidor Lee comprueba que la confrontacion anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea trae el arruinamiento y que el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" es la aspiracion de la nacion y la verdad de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posicion y la actitud sobre la historica Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur es la piedra de toque que distingue el patriota del vendepatria y la reunificacion de la division. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reunificacion, la paz y la prosperidad de la nacion coreana consisten en la ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC tiene la invariable posicion de cooperar con quienes desean de veras la reintegracion territorial del pais y la paz y prosperidad de la nacion y hacer los esfuerzos pacientes y responsables por lograr la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar frustraran despiadadamente las brutales maniobras fratricidas y anti-reunificacion de las fuerzas separatistas y abriran sin falta la nueva era de reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad que marche vigorosamente con el espiritu de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\"."
