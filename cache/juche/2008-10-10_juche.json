            "content": "S. Korean Puppet Army Authorities' Moves Denounced\r\n Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- The Navy of the Korean People's Army solemnly declares that it will never tolerate the moves of the south Korean puppet army authorities to fix the \"Northern Limit Line\" (NLL) unilaterally drawn by the U.S. forces without any legal basis and prior consultation with the DPRK as the extension of the military demarcation line in sea waters but decisively counter any attempt to infringe upon its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Navy Command of the KPA declared this in a statement issued on Thursday in connection with the fact that the situation in the waters off the frontal area on the west coast of Korea has become so tense that a naval clash may break out due to such military provocations as the ceaseless infiltration of warships deep into the territorial waters of the north side by the south Korean puppet army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The navy of the south Korean puppet army has escalated the intrusion of warships into the territorial waters of the north side since early in September, the statement noted, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the daily average of the number of their intrusions reached three to five. On September 27, several warships intruded into the waters of the north side from Yonphyong Islet and Taechong Islet, firing shells. On October 7, seven warships and a rubber boat illegally intruded into the waters of the north side. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet army authorities are infiltrating warships into the territorial waters of the north side in a premeditated manner, openly revealing their sinister intention to \"stick to\" the illegal NLL unilaterally set by the U.S. forces in the territorial waters of the north in disregard of the Korean Armistice Agreement and international law half a century ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the fact that no sooner had the present puppet traitor come to power than adopted the \"Northern Limit Line\" as a \"policy,\" claiming that \"no compromise should be made over it\" from \"the standpoint of the territorial conception.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers of the south Korean puppet army are gradually expanding the sphere of intrusion into the waters of the north side to the waters east of Taechong Islet and northwest of Paekryong Islet from those southwest of Yonphyong Islet. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their reckless military provocations and moves to preserve the NLL are rendering the situation in the West Sea of Korea so dangerous that the third West Sea skirmish and the second June 25 war may break out any moment there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is always a limit to patience. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet army authorities would be well advised to think twice about what will happen if the warning and self-restraint of the north touch off resentment and lead to a decisive action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army is closely following with utmost vigilance the movements of warships of the south Korean puppet navy and keeps itself fully combat ready to deal a crushing blow at the provocateurs any time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet army authorities should halt at once the intrusion of their warships into the territorial waters of the north side and drop their foolish ambition to stick to the illegal NLL."

The principle could be laid down for the first time only by the President who waged the revolutionary struggle by organizing and mobilizing the popular masses with the faith that the internal force of the revolution is the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe President formed the first party organization, the Society for Rallying Comrades, the origin of the Workers' Party of Korea, in early July of 1930 and expanded the party organization with it as a parent body. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, a party organization was formed with members of revolutionary organizations in the area of Onsong in early October of 1930 and many basic party organizations came into being in armed ranks and in the area of East Manchuria nearby the River Tuman and in the northern border area in a short span of time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRight after reorganizing the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army into the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) in March 1934, the President took an epochal step of instituting the party committee of the KPRA so as to control and guide local party organizations as well as the party organizations of all levels in the army units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParty organizations were organized in the units of the KPRA and vast areas inside and outside the country and linked with the headquarters of the Korean revolution in an organizational way, with the result that the party's leadership over the Korean revolution as a whole was established with success and the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle was brought to uninterrupted upswing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBasing himself on the success and experience accumulated in the party building during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle, the President saw to it that party organizations were organized in different local areas immediately after the liberation of the country and formed the central organizing committee of the Communist Party of North Korea on October 10, 1945.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was a historic event in accomplishment of the cause of party founding which had been carried on for many years under the guidance of the President."

It is said to have been reconstructed several times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For its superb beauty, it is called \"Jeilrudae\", \"Manhwaru\" and so on. It is a cultural asset showing the excellent architecture of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pavilion of peculiar style consists of the southern and northern wings with lifted floors supported by 11 and 9 pillars respectively. It has a hanging board with the characters \"the most beautiful mountains and rivers in the world\" written by a foreign envoy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Graceful is the outside view of the pavilion with its two hip-saddle roofs fitted together at a right angle. And the railing around the lifted wooden floor, the girders with silk patterns painted red and blue and every other element of the pavilion strike the visitors with wonders for its exquisite work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pavilion conveys various stories including the famous anecdote that Kim Hwang Won, a well-known poet in the period of the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392), broke his brush, regretting his inability to depict the scenic beauty of its surroundings and an episode telling the patriotism of General Kim Ung So and a woman Kye Wol Hyang who killed a boss of the Japanese aggressive army in the period of Imjin Patriotic War (1592-1598).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pavilion forms a district of cultural relics together with the Taedong Gate, the Bell-house of the Pyongyang Bell, the Monument to Kye Wol Hyang and the Paek Son Haeng Memorial House. It was severely damaged by indiscriminate bombings of the U.S. imperialists during the Fatherland Liberation War, but was rehabilitated soon after the war under the government's policy of preserving national culture and is now cared for as a national treasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today an endless stream of working people of all strata, school youth and children and foreigners flows to the pavilion."

These remarks come under fire by signed commentaries of leading newspapers Thursday. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun says that the \"pro-north left-wing forces\" touted by the fascist maniac are those who desire reconciliation and unity between the north and the south and struggle for independent reunification. These reckless remarks should never be overlooked as they are extremely fascist and provocative outbursts calling for bringing charges against the patriotic pro-reunification democratic forces and punishing all of them on charges of groundless linkage with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group, which adopted the sycophancy towards the U.S. and anti-reunification as its policy, is getting evermore frantic in the brutal crackdown upon the patriotic pro-reunification democratic forces in a bid to eliminate them, staking their fate on the north-south confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the Lee group is actively plugging the \"National Intelligence Service\" into the anti-reunification crackdown.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this campaign is a criminal intention to savagely suppress and stamp out the pro-reunification democratic forces of various strata in south Korea by linking them with the north in a bid to stay in power and aggravate the north-south confrontation. What was uttered by the above-said intelligence official is an open declaration of his plan to throw all progressive and patriotic organizations and people standing in the way of the implementation of the anti-reunification policy behind bars and a horrifying declaration of a war against the pro-reunification democratic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This self-exposed that the Lee group is an anti-reunification group of traitors disqualified to live in the June 15 era of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality eloquently proves that it is impossible to achieve independent and democratic development of south Korean society and reconciliation and unity between the compatriots and reunification unless they foil the Lee Myung Bak regime's treacherous and provocative fascist crackdown being perpetrated in south Korea under the pretext of any linkage with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson observes: The Lee group is busy suppressing pro-reunification patriotic forces, claiming that members of the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration in south Korea praised the Juche idea and the system in the north and conducted information service in favor of them and they carried out their activities at the \"instructions\" from the north. This is a prelude to the wholesale fascist crackdown to eliminate those forces."

It is also pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' policy to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world progressive forces should urge the south Korean authorities to opt for implementing the above-said declarations but never allow the Lee group to pursue its bellicose anti-reunification policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should strongly demand the U.S. stop throwing a hurdle in the way of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, sincerely honor its commitments, roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK and withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea without delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Solidarity rallies, seminars and lectures took place in Mongolia and Ethiopia from Sept. 22 to Oct. 3 on the above-said occasions."
