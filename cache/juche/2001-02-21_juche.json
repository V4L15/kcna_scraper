Paektu area makes headway \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- Big efforts are being made in the DPRK to spruce up and preserve well revolutionary sites, battlesites and relics.\r\n The re-building of Mt. Paektu area is pushed forward as part of the efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the Japanese imperialists' military occupation and rule over Korea, President Kim Il Sung waged an anti-Japanese armed struggle to liberate the country on Mt. Paektu, which has been called the ancestral mountain from the olden times, and its surrounding area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is also a secret camp where leader Kim Jong Il was born. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For these reasons, the Korean people consider Mt. Paektu as the holy mountain of the revolution and the native place dear to their hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large-scale rebuilding of Mt. Paektu area is now under way amid the great concern of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will spring up on Mt. Paektu a waiting room for lecturers and a boarding house for cable-car operators. A project will be undertaken to reinforce the steel towers for cable-car service and Paektu and Hyangdo railway stations will be spruced up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A hall preserving revolutionary relics and a combined lecture ground and various service facilities for excursionists will appear in the secret camp on Mt. Paektu and power and communications networks will be improved in the secret camps on Mt. Paektu, Mt. Sono, Mt. Kom and Mt. Kanbaek. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Samjiyon county where the Mt. Paektu secret camp is situated will be given a face-lifting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n New streets will appear in township and 2-3 storey apartment houses of diverse shapes will stand on their either side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several bridges will span streams and children's parks will be built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More big service facilities including hotels for excursionists will be built to accommodate an increasing number of visitors while public buildings and dwelling houses renovated and all the buildings will be put under an electric heating system.\r\n Rimyongsu, Phothae and Mubong areas will be dotted with modern dwelling houses and service facilities commensurate with the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the projects are completed, Mt. Paektu area will turn into a huge open-air museum.    \r\n\r\n"
