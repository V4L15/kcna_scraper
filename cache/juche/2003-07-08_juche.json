Ri Hang Jun, secretary of the Central Committee of the  Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, said in a speech that  Kim Jong Il opened a new history of perpetuating the memory of the president, reflecting the ardent longing of the youth and students and all other people for him and their strong desire to hold him in high esteem as the eternal sun of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Young people from all walks of life renewed their determination to devotedly defend Kim Jong Il and uphold the Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea in the van, always keeping in mind the president's behests on holding Kim Jong Il in higher esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the c.c. of the league, and others were present at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A memorial stage of agricultural workers \"the fatherly leader is still with our farmers in Yonbaek plain\" was held in Ohyon-ri, Yonan county, South Hwanghae Province on the same day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sung Sang Sop, chairman of the Central Committee of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea, said in a speech that Kim Il Sung devoted all his efforts to the development of the country's agriculture and the happiness of the people, always mixing with the farmers, adding that he was the father of the people peerless in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was a presentation of art pieces including a female vocal solo \"the leader is without an equal in the world\", a mixed duet  \"the general is identical to the leader\" and women's quintet \"fully ripe rice sways on either side of the road to the front\". It successfully represented the revolutionary enthusiasm of the agricultural workers.    \r\n    \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. attempt to abuse name of UN blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The United States recently distributed copies of its \"draft statement\" critical of the DPRK among member states of the U.N. security council in a bid to have a \"statement of its president\" adopted and desperately lobbied for achieving its objective. But its bid proved futile due to the opposition of some countries.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such move of the United States is an act of disregarding the principles of the U.N. Charter as it branded the DPRK's just measures to defend its sovereignty as unjust ones by making a profound confusion of the relations between the arch criminal, who spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, and its victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this the U.S. sought to convince the international community of the danger of nuclear development\" in the DPRK and pit the U.N. against Pyongyang in a bid to get a justification for pursuing its policy of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the United States that compelled the DPRK to build up a strong physical deterrent force. The U.S. is persistently pulling up the DPRK over its \"nuclear issue\" and working hard to bring it up for discussion at the U.N. in a bid to get it take any \"step\" against Pyongyang while keeping mum about the nuclear weaponization of Japan, Israel and its other allies. This clearly indicates its unjust act of applying \"double standards\" in handling the nuclear issue, away from the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the United States are committed to respect the U.N. Charter and abide by all its principles as members of the U.N. All its member states are equal and none of them has the right to impose its will and demand upon other member states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an insult and a mockery of the U.N. for the U.S. to attempt to take any \"measure\" against the DPRK through the U.N. forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.N. Security Council takes any \"action\" critical of the DPRK contrary to its stand and interests, as demanded by the U.S. it will leave an indelible blot on the U.N. history as it will be little short of encouraging U.S. arbitrary practices and moves for hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pressure or blackmail will not help solve the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. Dialogue and negotiations are the only way of settling it.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean military refuted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on July 6 accusing the South Korean military authorities of vociferating again about the \"theory of principal enemy\" in a bid to bedevil the inter-Korean relations.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Ministry of National Defence\" of South Korea in teaching materials titled \"moral education\" distributed among frontline units called not only the government, the army and the citizens in the north but South Koreans and the world peace-loving people supporting the north \"principal enemies\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"theory of principal enemy\" can never go together with the \"policy of peace and prosperity.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the South Korean authorities are talking about a \"policy of peace and prosperity\", they are, in fact, pursuing confrontation and war. This is clearly evidenced by their loudmouthed \"theory of principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities are calling the fellow countrymen in the north \"principal enemies\" while treating the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, the outsiders, like an ancestral tablet. This is, however, nothing but the shriek of the doomed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The advocacy of the \"theory of principal enemy\" will only bring war, disaster and self-destruction. \r\n The South Korean military authorities should know well that they will be held entirely accountable before the nation for the irretrievably serious consequences to be entailed by their fresh racket.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA lays bare true colours of Japan as war criminal state\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The \"remembrance, responsibility and future\" fund of Germany on June 30 declared that it has paid reparations to the tune of 2.3 billion euro to 1.37 million victims to forced labor of 70 countries of the world including Russia and Ukraine from June 2001 to June 2003.\r\n It is said that the fund will continue compensating till 2005, with the funds coming from the federal budget and private companies of Germany. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As is well known, Germany, a war criminal state in Europe, has sincerely paid reparations and made compensation for scores of years to those nations and individuals that fell victim to fascist Germany in one way or the other during the Second World War after deeming it a state responsibility to compensate for the war crimes and apologizing for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to information available, Germany paid 122.3 billion mark equivalent to 7,900 billion yen as reparations by the end of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the attitude taken by Japan, another war criminal state in Asia, is quite the opposite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has paid only 356, 552.07 million yen in compensation according to article 14 a of the San Francisco Peace Pact which stipulates that \"Japan admits that it has to compensate allies for damage and sufferings it inflicted upon them during the war\" and bilateral treaty and agreement signed in the subsequent period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had refused to apologize to the Asian people for its crimes committed against them for half a century. Only on the 50th anniversary of its defeat it made a \"repentance\" for mere form's sake through the so-called \"Statement of Murayama (the then prime minister).\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was no more than a verbal repentance and apology. Japan has not made any sincere compensation or reparation for mental, human and material damage it did to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During its colonial military rule over Korea the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans and killed over one million Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special mention should be made of the fact that they forced more than 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army and killed many of them in cold blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists indiscriminately destroyed or looted valuable cultural heritages handed down by ancestors and plundered Korea of natural resources and products without limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by Japan in the past are too many to enumerate. Yet, there is no prospect of Japan's redress for them though nearly 60 years have passed since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even in this new century Japan is talking about a \"peace state,\" a \"normal state\" and \"future\", keeping mum about the aggression and plunder it committed against Korea and other Asian countries. On the contrary it is keen to emerge a military power and launch expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that on July 4 shortly after it was reported that Germany has made fresh efforts to carve out its future after getting understanding from countries around it by liquidating its gloomy past, Japan was so brazen-faced as to approve at its diet a bill on dispatching heavily armed self-defence force to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is getting more zealous than any other countries in supporting the U.S. in its strategy to stifle the DPRK over the \"nuclear issue.\" This poses a great threat not only to the Korean peninsula but to the rest part of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n japan is greatly mistaken, however. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is by no means what it used to be in the past and Asia today is not what it was in the past, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will resolutely foil Japan's moves to launch reinvasion of Korea under the uplifted banner of Songun to protect the peace and stability on the peninsula and in the rest of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
