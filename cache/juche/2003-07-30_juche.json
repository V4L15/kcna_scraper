            "content": "KCNA flails U.S. strategy for preemptive strike \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- \"Information\" used by the United States for justifying the Iraqi War has proved totally false, creating a great furor. \r\n The Bush administration has so far spearheaded the operation to scour every nook and corner of Iraq so as to find out objective evidence proving Iraq's \"possession of weapons of mass destruction\" which it cited as a pretext for starting the Iraqi War. But it has so far proved futile, thus driving Washington into a political predicament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when there is an increasing doubt on the international arena about information about \"weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq, U.S. political and press circles are becoming increasingly assertive that the Bush administration might distort or hype the above-said information when launching the attack on Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is becoming clearer that the \"information\" is false as those involved in the war expressed their understanding of their assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much upset by this, the bush regime tried to clinch the case by shifting the blame for the leakage of false information about the Iraq's \"plan for purchasing uranium\" onto the CIA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi War broke out as the inspection conducted under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" demanded disarmament and systematically led to an armed attack. It was a war of aggression and state terrorism the U.S. unilaterally committed, ignoring international law and the united nations, to meet its political purpose and economic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intends to apply the same methods to the DPRK as it did in the Iraqi War. It was by no means before long that the U.S. had to pay a price for peddling false \"information\" about \"enriched uranium plan\" and the suspected \"secret underground nuclear facility\" in Kumchang-ri of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula was caused by the policy to stifle the DPRK pursued by the U.S. that regards the DPRK as an anathema to it, not an issue of whether one develops nuclear weapons or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. council on foreign relations in a recent report titled \"meeting nuclear challenge of North Korea\" said that the U.S. should consider pushing forward tough measures to the possible scope though it does not command full support from regional allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the document shows, the U.S. is not concealing its vicious plot to mount a preemptive military attack on the DPRK at any cost under the pretext of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The escalated reckless moves of the U.S. to carry out its strategy for preemptive attack compels the army and the people in the DPRK to keep themselves fully combat-ready. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S., which seems to be upbeat after the Iraqi War, goes on with its policy to stifle the DPRK without discretion, it will only precipitate its self-destruction.    \r\n"

No one can toy with the strength of the people of the DPRK where the leader, the party and the masses are singleheartedly united, he stressed.    \r\n    \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. attempt at preemptive attack under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA)-- The \"peaceful method\" and \"dialogue\" much touted by the U.S. ruling quarters so far as regards the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. are nothing but a clumsy burlesque intended to cover up their psychological warfare and escalated moves to stifle the DPRK by force such as finally examining and comprehensively rounding off a new scenario for a war against the DPRK so-called \"Operation Plan 5030\". Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary denouncing the united states for having worked out the \"Operation Plan 5030\", a new plan for a war of aggression on the DPRK, aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on it behind the curtain of \"dialogue\".\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pushing ahead with the plan to bolster up the U.S. forces present in South Korea to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK behind the curtain of \"dialogue\" and stepping up the strategic deployment such as transferring its combat equipment involved in the Iraqi War to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, while demanding the DPRK \"drop its nuclear development program before dialogue\", are stepping up the development of smaller nukes to make nuclear strikes at the DPRK's strategic targets and underground facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Operation Plan 5030\" worked out against this backdrop, suggests that the U.S. imperialists' provocation of another Korean War is not a hypothesis but becoming a reality. But the DPRK has its own powerful operation mode to cope with the U.S. war method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. dares to ignite another war against the DPRK, judging it as its earlier targets of war, this would be the most gross mistake ever to be committed by it in history.    \r\n"

Under his energetic leadership there emerged in the country a genuine people's power, the first of its kind in history representing the interests of the working people and serving them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his noble view on future and dynamic guidance the socio-political foundation of the people's power came to be solidly based on the single-hearted unity of the party, the leader and the masses and its role has rapidly increased in all fields of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's power entered a new stage of its development and is fully displaying its might as a powerful political weapon in the Songun era thanks to the outstanding wisdom, distinguished leadership ability and devoted efforts of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il was nominated as a candidate for deputy to the 11th term Supreme People's Assembly. This was an expression of absolute support for and trust in him by servicepersons of the people's army and people of Korea and their firm faith and will to share to the end their destiny with the people's power associated with immortal exploits of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls upon all the people to go to the polls with such unshakable faith to fulfill their civic duties in glorifying forever the immortal feats Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed in building the power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
