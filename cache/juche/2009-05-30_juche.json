Our country signed the Framework Convention on Tobacco Control presented by the WHO in June Juche 92 (2003) and has launched an anti-smoking campaign consistently.

It provides tobacco-quitting goods, tonics and consultation to those who intend to give up smoking, thus paying off profusely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-smoking propaganda activities have been vigorously conducted in various forms and methods, with the result that smokers are abstaining from smoking on their own accord, boys in their minority do not start smoking and a social control atmosphere has been created.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Q: What is the theme for the World No Tobacco Day this year?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A: We are going to organize functions on the day in accordance with the theme \"Tobacco Health Warnings\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the occasion of the day, anti-smoking propaganda activities on the theme are vigorously conducted at the provincial hygienic propaganda halls and non-smoking signs are put up in public health and educational institutions and public places."
