Korean Warmongers' Projected War Exercises Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command officially announced that it would stage Ulji Freedom Guardian, the first puppet army-led south Korea-U.S. joint military exercises, from August 18 to 22 with at least 10,000 U.S. forces stationed abroad and in south Korea involved. A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee issued a statement Friday denouncing the projected saber-rattling.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Branding the joint exercises as DPRK-targeted provocative war exercises that replaced the Ulji Focus Lens which the U.S. and the puppet warmongers staged on an annual basis from mid-1970s, the statement continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an open declaration of confrontation with the DPRK and an outright challenge to the Koreans and the international community desirous of peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected U.S. and the south Korean warmongers' saber-rattling would only escalate tension and the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and gravely threaten stability in Northeast Asia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warmongers of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are trying hard to justify the war exercises, claiming that they are aimed at \"defense.\" But with nothing can they cover up their aggressive nature.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that the \"dialogue\", \"peace\" and \"improved relations\" touted by the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group are nothing but an empty talk and they only seek confrontation and war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never tolerate the provocateurs' moves for a war of aggression against the north, the moves aimed to tarnish the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation, but will resolutely counter them with a powerful measure for self-defence.\r\n"

This reality of Japan reminds one of the dark era when Japan waged the \"national spiritual general mobilization movement\" under the slogans of \"Let's go to Manchuria!\" and \"Let's go to Pacific!\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ultra-right forces that are taking the lead in stirring up this social atmosphere. They do not hesitate to utter bellicose remarks that \"Japan will meet ruin if the prime minister stops visiting 'Yasukuni Shrine'\" and \"even 'small-scale war' with China should be considered,\" etc.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's preparations for war have, in fact, reached a final phase given that it is pushing forward the replacement of the \"pacifist constitution\" by a war constitution and the reorganization of the SDF into \"armed forces for self-defense\" following the institution of various laws for the execution of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is growing vigilant against the Japanese ultra-right forces' stepped-up ideological and moral preparations in step with the legal and military ones for reinvasion while openly calling for building \"Japan capable of fighting a war\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better stop running amuck, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless moves for reinvasion.\r\n"

Yet, it is working with bloodshot eyes to stem the trend of the June 15 era of reunification and foster the inter-Korean confrontation, stepping up its policy of confrontation with the DPRK as regards the inter-Korean relations issue. His anti-reunification confrontational policy resulted in freezing the relations between the north and the south which had favorably developed since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and putting the inter-Korean cooperation undertakings on the verge of breakdown.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hatred and resentment of the south Koreans at Lee triggered off massive candlelight demonstrations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sycophants and traitors are bound to meet self-destruction as they rule over the people and infringe upon the dignity and interests of the nation, backed by foreign forces. This is the truth taught by history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Suppression is by no means a cure-all. No brutal crackdown can arrest the struggle of the people.
