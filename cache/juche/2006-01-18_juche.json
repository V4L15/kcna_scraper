            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Lift Sanctions against DPRK for Resumption of Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- The United States is letting loose a string of base outcries to shift the responsibility for the delayed second phase of the fifth round of the six-party talks on to the DPRK from the outset of the year.\r\n Officials of the U.S. administration vied with each other to assert that the U.S. is making efforts to resume the six-party talks and that pursuit of illegal activities of north Korea and the six-party talks are totally different from each other and these activities have nothing to do with the talks. By these outbursts it means that the U.S. is making a lot of efforts for the resumption of the six-party talks but the DPRK is laying obstacles to the progress of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is base, indeed, for the U.S. to try to lay hurdles in the way of the six-party talks through unjust sanctions and pressure and lay the responsibility for the delayed talks at the DPRK's door. \r\n  The U.S. sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK are the main obstacle to the progress of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. financial sanctions are an issue directly linked with the talks, it is unthinkable for the DPRK to negotiate the nuclear issue with the party seeking to isolate and stifle it while being exposed to sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The financial sanctions against the DPRK are little short of an act of suffocating the DPRK to bring down its system and contrary to the purport of the joint statement of the six-party talks which calls for mutual respect and co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to respect each other and co-exist in peace and take steps for building confidence and normalizing the relations with a view to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. This is the basic spirit of the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pressure and sanctions are incompatible with peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wanton violation of the joint statement is further bedeviling the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. as it is nothing helpful to establishing the relations of confidence. \r\n If the U.S. truly wants to resume the talks, there is no reason to refuse to remove the hurdles lying in the way of the talks. It is proper for the party chiefly to blame for having deadlocked the talks to fulfil its commitment before any party else and this would be a practical step to resume the talks.\r\n Of late the international community is paying due attention to the fact that the U.S. high-handed policy is adversely affecting the process to settle the nuclear issue of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even U.S. media comment that the Bush administration's smear campaign against north Korea and its refusal to hold high-level talks on financial sanctions against it and the like do not stand to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. refusal to lift sanctions against the DPRK and its escalated pressure, threat and blackmail against it only compel the latter to take tougher countermeasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants to resume the six-party talks, it should lift, among other things, the sanctions against the DPRK, the factor blocking the resumption of the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP Indicted for Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland Monday issued a lengthy indictment which brings to light the despicable true colors of the south Korean successive fascist dictatorial regimes, the predecessor of the Grand National Party in south Korea.\r\n The most hideous crime committed by the successive dictatorial regimes was that they turned south Korea into a horrible wasteland of democracy and human rights, a veritable living hell by pursuing the most barbarous fascist rule, the indictment said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After usurping power with the backing of the United States the Park Chung Hee military junta enacted at least 2,000 evil laws including the \"Anti-Communist Law\" and the \"Special Law on Punishing Special Crimes\" in just ten months after the \"May 16 military coup\" in 1961. In consequences patriotic political parties and public organizations and people from all walks of life were suppressed on charges of being \"pro-communists\" and 659 press organs were closed in just two years till 1966. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Yusin\" clique fabricated many cases such as \"a spying case\" and the \"case of operative group for communizing south Korea\" in a bid to crack down upon south Korean people of all social strata and eliminate political opponents. To cite a typical example of this, they abducted Kim Dae Jung, an exile in Japan at that time, in the heart of Tokyo in broad daylight in a bid to kill him in the open sea and kidnapped Kim Hyong Uk, former \"director of the Central Intelligence Agency\", and assassinated him in cold blood for the mere reason that he criticized the \"Yusin system\" after seeking refuge in the U.S.\r\n The Chun Doo Hwan clique staged the \"December 12 military purge coup\" in 1979 under the backstage wire-pulling of the U.S. and proclaimed the \"extraordinary martial law\" throughout south Korea. They enacted or retrogressively revised more than 100 fascist laws in an effort to force political parties and organizations to disorganize themselves or block their activities, pressed media organizations into merger or forced closure. They also savagely suppressed even the elementary freedom of political activities and democratic rights including assembly, demonstration and association.\r\n In order to crack down upon the south Korean people who rose up in the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification the Roh Tae Woo military regime declared the so-called \"war against crimes\" in October 1990 and in June 1991 and mobilized even the south Korean regular armed forces and 4.6 million-strong reserve forces as well as 150,000 policemen, the \"Security Planning Board\" and prosecution to kick up a whirlwind of check-up and investigation across south Korea everyday and arrest those on the want lists and activist students and other young people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kim Young Sam regime, the bastard of the Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo military regimes, also committed fascist suppression of south Korean youths and students and other people under the signboard of \"a civilian government\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment cited facts to prove that the successive dictatorial regimes sold off the dignity and interests of the nation to foreign forces through their despicable sycophantic treacherous acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Park Chung Hee hurled a total of 320,000 young and middle-aged south Koreans into the shambles of the U.S. war of aggression fought against Vietnam to die en masse, unhesitatingly signed the south Korea-Japan \"agreement\", a treacherous document, and concluded the south Korea-U.S. \"Status of Forces Agreement\" which grants privileged status to the U.S. forces in south Korea. And he set up the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" in November 1978 for joint operations in the war against the north and staged the world's largest \"Team Spirit\" nuclear war exercises and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Chun Doo Hwan, a hand-raised stooge of the U.S., brutally suppressed the anti-U.S. struggle of south Korean youth and students and people, worried about it more than his American master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When there occurred the arson of the \"American Cultural Service\" in Kwangju in December 1980, the arson of the \"American Cultural Service\" in Pusan in March 1982 and the occupation of the \"American Cultural Service\" in Seoul in May 1985, the traitor took the lead in setting up the \"investigation headquarters\", \"teams in charge of investigation\" and the like while raising a hue and cry over \"pro-communist and enemy-benefiting\" acts and \"agitation from the north\" and mobilized all forces of the police, prosecution and even the army to arrest patriotic youth and students and people of various other strata and even religionists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After taking the \"presidential office\" to succeed to Chun, Roh Tae Woo promised the U.S. to cover the expenses for the upkeep of its forces in south Korea with taxes collected from the people, thus meeting the U.S. demand for increasing the share of their \"defense spending.\" He also signed the shackling south Korea-U.S. \"Wartime Host Nations Support Agreement,\" thus providing a \"legal guarantee\" for the U.S. forces to use south Korean ports, airports, etc. in the event of contingency on the Korean Peninsula as they please. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Kim Young Sam who took \"the presidential office\" under the signboard of \"a civilian government\" begged for the U.S. forces' permanent occupation of south Korea, even paying more than three billion U.S. dollars for the upkeep of the U.S. forces there. He joined the U.S. in making much fuss about \"nuclear suspicion\" and crying for \"chastisement\" and \"sanctions\" in a bid to harm and stifle the fellow countrymen in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He opened even the rice market related to south Korean peasants' lifeline to the U.S. and plunged the economy into catastrophe.\r\n The successive dictators were anti-reunification elements who blocked the nation's reconciliation and unity and chilled the fellow countrymen's desire for independent reunification by pursuing the \"two Koreas\" policy and the confrontation with the north, the indictment noted, and went on:\r\n They set up a \"separate government\" in south Korea, bringing the tragedy of division to this land, adopted the U.S. criminal \"two Koreas\" line as a \"policy\" and built the concrete wall in the whole area south of the Military Demarcation Line, thus bisecting the territory of Korea without hesitation.\r\n They officially advocated the \"unification under the liberal democratic system\" totally negating dialogue and reunification contrary to the July 4 joint statement and persisted in the moves for permanent division while peddling the \"northern policy\" and \"international legalization of 'two Koreas'\".\r\n The crimes committed by the successive dictatorial regimes should be cursed for all ages and sternly judged by the nation and history.\r\n The representative of the GNP, a descendant of the \"Yusin\" fascist dictator, would be well advised to keep silent and step down so that she may not follow in the tragic footsteps of her father.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, the U.S. is set to make a preemptive nuclear attack anytime on any state regarded as \"dangerous\". It listed different Asian countries including the DPRK as targets of its preemptive nuclear attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is made the primary target of this attack. The U.S. nuclear war scenario is thus targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. imperialists have become evermore undisguised in their moves to launch a nuclear war, the DPRK is left with no option but to significantly bolster its deterrent for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should not be allowed to use Asia-Pacific as a theater for their nuclear war for world domination, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The message urged the young people to devote their youth to the firm defence of the socialist country in hearty response to the WPK's Songun revolutionary line as the ranks in charge of the national defence and a main force for it and fully display the militant stamina and courage of the young vanguard in the general advance of Songun revolution for building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation. \r\n Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the youth league, in his report at the meeting dwelt on the undying exploits performed by the peerlessly great persons in the development of the Korean youth movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter recalled that Kim Il Sung set out the politics of attaching importance to the youth, successfully training the youth league and young people as a dynamic militant unit of the revolution and dependable heirs to the socialist cause, and that Kim Jong Il deemed it as a revolutionary obligation of the younger generation to eternally hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem and remain loyal to his cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youth league has developed to be an ideologically pure organization modeled on the Juche idea, the Songun idea of the WPK, an organized entity strong in unity, organizing ability and militancy and an organization closely linked with the same destiny in which the young people have formed a harmonious whole with their illustrious leaders. And the young people have grown to be reliable successors to the Songun revolutionary cause of Juche. This is the main review of the 60 year-long history of the youth league. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on the five million young people to further consolidate the single-minded unity of the ranks of members of the young vanguard closely united around Kim Jong Il in thinking and purpose as required by the era of Songun and become Songun revolutionary comrades who share the same idea and will with him and ardent fighters in the 21st century.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
