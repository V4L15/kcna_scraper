Korean ruler's suppression of Hanchongryon flayed\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The North headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) in its statement on April 20 demanded that the South Korean authorities unconditionally stop the suppression of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) and abolish the \"National Security Law\" at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement called attention to the fact that the South Korean authorities are trying to nip a meeting of the 7th-term Hanchongryon deputies in its bud, kicking up search rackets throughout South Korea. It went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The meeting is an annual regular gathering of the deputies selected by students to form the central headquarters with the chairman and to decide on action program for a year.  So, it should not be incriminated in any case, nor should it be put down.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hanchongryon called press conferences on April 2 and 8,  calling upon the authorities to allow and give an active cooperation in peaceful holding of the meeting.     However the authorities branded this meeting as \"illegal\" and created an awful atmosphere of suppression, trying to nip it in the bud.   This fascist suppression is clear evidence of a frantic campaign of the South Korean authorities to stifle Hanchongryon, the umbrella organization of the students, upset by their patriotic activities. \r\n\r\n"

It is well illustrated by the fact that the South Korean authorities are now spreading a strange rumour about the \"status\" of the U.S. forces present in South Korea, even inviting neighboring countries to join in their row.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This row was belatedly followed by such measures to save the situation as admitting \"misinformation,\" making an \"official denial\" and expressing \"regret.\" Underlying this row are extreme uneasiness of the present authorities, who can not survive even a moment without the backing of the U.S. forces, and their treacherous and flunkeyist intention to keep foreign troops in South Korea by all means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how hard they may try to give a new description of the \"status\" of the U.S. forces in South Korea,  they are no more than illegal occupation forces and their nature can never change in the sense that they are the source of war constantly threatening the peace on the Korean peninsula.   It is an undeniable obligation for the United States, a signatory to the Korean armistice agreement, to discuss the issue of withdrawal of its forces to ensure durable peace with the DPRK which is technically at war with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States can not flee from this responsibility and the South Korean authority's interference in the issue is an imprudent behaviour, evidence that they were oblivious of their deplorable position.   Since the proposal on holding the four-way talks to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula came from the United States it should accept the DPRK's principled assertion that the issue of withdrawal of U.S. forces should be discussed if it is truly interested in the objective and progress of the talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should pay a due attention to the fact that the row kicked up by the South Korean authorities, who have neither justification nor qualification to meddle in the issue to be settled between the DPRK and U.S., by spreading the false rumour is nothing but a sinister move to bar the four-way talks from making any progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We once again clearly state that the issue of withdrawal of U.S. forces is a key one to be discussed at the four-way talks. The refusal of the U.S. to do it means, in a nutshell, that it is not genuinely interested in guaranteeing peace on the Korean peninsula and that it is unwilling to give up its policy of permanent occupation of South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities should approach the four-way talks, clearly mindful that such an attempt will never work on the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

In this way they seek to inflict upon the fellow countrymen dreadful disasters of bio-chemical warfare as well as calamities of thermonuclear war, banking on the U.S.'s anti-DPRK war moves. It is an anti-national crime indelible down through generations to come.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their anti-national moves to stockpile biological and chemical weapons have turned South Korea into the world's biggest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction where not only various kinds of nuclear shells and bombs including neutron bombs but also biological and chemical weapons are massively stockpiled.    The South Korean authorities are these days hell-bent on the anti-north confrontation moves, raising a hue and cry over groundless \"development of biological and chemical weapons\" and \"threats\" by the north. This is intended to intensify the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK,  using such fiction as \"second nuclear card\", and cover up their actions to stockpile those weapons.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should stop such moves as development, production and introduction of the weapons at once, clearly mindful that their anti-north confrontation and war moves supported by those weapons will lead them to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

The Korean people have broken through manifold difficulties and trials:&nbsp;The imperialists' desperate moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and their blockade,  a dramatic change in the climate  for external economic relations following the collapse of the socialist market, repeated natural disasters, the worst in a hundred years and so on.

The DPRK, a powerful country in terms of politics, ideology and military, is going to become an economic power.    There are already good signs showing that it is not an empty talk to build an economic power and this will come true in near future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Instances of this are over 100 successes of world significance made in scientific researches including the successful method of producing iron with locally available raw materials and fuel, the production of electron microscope of 300,000 magnifications, the completion of gigantic land rezoning projects, steady increase in electricity production at minor hydro-power stations in different parts of the country, signal achievements reported from the mining, metal and machine-building industries and the production kept going in different domains.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state has paid deep attention and concentrated investment in key branches of the economy and sent competent scientists and technicians there. And spectacular economic, scientific and technological successes are registered in various domains of the national economy such as oil exploration.    General Secretary Kim Jong Il is steering the gigantic work to build an economic power.
