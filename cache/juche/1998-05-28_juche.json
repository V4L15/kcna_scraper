Almost every day of May, they blocked rallies and demonstrations of workers and threatened that they would \"severely punish\" those students who took part in demos.\r\n   This is a premeditated repressive offensive to flee from the present ruling crisis caused by economic bankruptcies and contradictions and feuds within the political camp.\r\n   The struggle of workers and students is right and just in every aspect.\r\n   The present South Korean regime is now brutally suppressing workers who have been in misery after losing their jobs owing to the lay-off system and labour exchange  system which were introduced under the trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund. Previously, it tried to appease them.\r\n   This clearly shows that it is not a \"government for the people\" but a mouthpiece of business groups.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must clearly know that with no fascist suppression can they bridge over the crisis. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean authorities must stop anti-north campaign\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities recently made public a \"result of investigation\" into the long-drawn-out \"north wind\"  case  and groundlessly accused the north of having helped amplify the rumors about somebody's political tendency in a bid to keep him from winning the \"presidential election.\"                        \r\n   Though they slandered the north with groundless charges during the investigation, we have refrained from manifesting our position concerning them, taking inter-Korean relations into account.                              \r\n   Since they connect the case directly with the north and abuse the case for their political purpose, however, we cannot but make clear our principled position.              \r\n   Historically, we have maintained the stand of noninterference in \"Presidential Election\" in South Korea.  \r\n   What we are interested in is not who becomes President but what policy  the elected President pursues.           \r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities alleged that the \"north wind\" case occured due to \"anti-south operations\" of the north. The allegation is another grave political plot for confrontation with the north.                           \r\n   They raised outcries over the north's \"policy towards  the south,\" citing a letter sent to a \"Presidential candidate\" by a person. But their outcries are acceptable to nobody.                                                     \r\n   Correspondence between friends is a usual practice in any country and in any society. Ensuring privacy of correspondence is a matter pertaining to the most elementary human rights.                                               \r\n   In South Korea, however, post offices open letters of individuals and use them for an ulterior political purpose.\r\n   It is the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP) that perpetrates such human rights abuses.                  \r\n   The \"north wind\" case faked up by the \"ANSP\" by using a letter of a person for a political purpose is another grave human rights violation which cannot be tolerated in view of international law, ethics and morality. It is also a rash act which can be done only by political swindlers.          \r\n   They should make an apology to the addresser.            \r\n   The fact has made clearer that the \"ANSP\" is the headquarters of anti-north plots and confrontation and a cancer which should be eliminated at once for the improvement of inter-Korean relations.                      \r\n   The South Korean authorities must not resort to anti-north plots through the \"north wind\" case invented by the  \"ANSP\" but sternly punish at once former \"ANSP Minister\" Kwon Nyong Hae and other plot-makers who sponsored the case.\r\n   If they want to get something by connecting the case with the north,  which has nothing to do with it, they are mistaken.                                                   \r\n   They must know that if they continue seeking confrontation with the north, availing themselves of the case, they will have to pay dearly for the plot.            \r\n   They will be held wholly responsible for all its consequencies.                                              \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Lies of illiterate\r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation broadcast a commentary titled \"lies of illiterate\" concerning Hwang Jang Yop's interview with a South Korean newspaper.                                     \r\n   The commentary says:                                     \r\n   Hwang, who defected to the south from the north, in an interview with a newspaper on May 19, maliciously slandered the north and spoke for the present South Korean \"government\" authorities.                                   \r\n   What he, who has lived in seclusion under the protection of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP) over  the past one year, said in the press interview is all lies invented by the \"ANSP\".                                     \r\n   His remark proves that he is ignorant of the situation of the north. He talked about \"possible collapse of the system\" and \"alternate force\" in the north and cried for  \"unification of systems.\" It shows that he is a diehard  anti-communist element and an anti-north servant of the \"ANSP\" who unhesitatingly said what even ultra-right        \r\nconservatives of South Korea do not dare say as regards inter-Korean relations.                                     \r\n   Admittedly, the north's system is based on singlehearted unity of whole society around the leader. In actuality, the north is a strong country that any formidable enemy  hardly dare attack and is an unconquerable society which has united closely in any adversity. It is obvious to anyone that there has never been and there can never be an  \"alternate force\" in such a society. Even the United States, which has tried hard to stifle the north, is now admitting the solidness of its system.                                \r\n   But Hwang, ignoring this situation, slandered the north with lies about the non-existent \"alternate force.\"         \r\n   Though he had a political career in the north, he could never find himself in the hub of politics. While \"studying\" social science, he embezzled foreign currency and had an affair with an overseas Korean woman. The traitor, forsaken both in the north and the south, is now in a poor position that he should tell lies to prolong his days.               \r\n   The ridiculous drama directed by the \"ANSP\" and played by Hwang is illustrative of the serious crisis of the present rulers.                                                     \r\n   The ruling-opposition competition for the forthcoming local autonomy election has become fiercer with the ruling camp being minority and the opposition majority. And the \"ANSP,\" which faked up the \"north wind\" case, is now like a house in mourning.   The economy, which already suffered an unprecedented financial crisis and is now being hit by  another one, is beyond recovery and public resentment against the \"government\" authorities is ever growing.       \r\n   On the contrary, the north has been successfully making the forced march of socialism, effecting a fresh upsurge and a great advance, undaunted by years of blockade by the imperialists and natural disasters.                         \r\n   The \"ANSP\" used Hwang in the despicable drama in the hope of preventing public sentiments from inclining toward the north and pacifying public discontent and protest.          \r\n   But it boomerangs disastrously. It is well known a fact that the \"ANSP,\" buttering up the \"civilian\" regime, guided Hwang's defection and has offered him a brain-washing education in Seoul to adapt him to South Korean society.    \r\n   It, which disgraced itself as a faithful servant of the \"civilian\" dictator, has failed to draw a proper lesson and used Hwang for a political drama, currying favor with the   present regime. The South Korean people will not remain a passive onlooker to the despicable behavior of the \"ANSP.\"  \r\n   If the \"ANSP\" continues fostering confrontation with the north by making use of Hwang, they will totally destory the headquarters of plots.                                      \r\n   The present \"government\" authorities' using such a common enemy of the nation as Hwang in anti-north plots through the \"ANSP\" is a criminal act obstructing national reconciliation and unity.                                                  \r\n   If they want to evade such a fate as their predecessors', they should stop the despicable anti-north plots at once.   \r\n   Hwang should no longer be used for the political purpose of the authorities but had better hang himself before he is stoned to cleath by our people.                             \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are putting spurs to arms buildup, not military reduction.      \r\n   In April, the U.S. military additionally deployed huge armed forces in South Korea and plans to increase their number till the end of the year.                            \r\n   The U.S. warhawks largely expanded the arms system of the U.S. Forces in South Korea with new sophisticated operational hardware allegedly to \"improve operational capacity.\"                                                  \r\n   When he was in South Korea in April, Chairman of U.S. joint chiefs of staff Shelton toured forefront areas along the military demarcation line and discussed with      brasshats of the South Korean puppet army about \"proposal for jointly coping with contingency\" and \"proposal for increasing the U.S.-South Korea joint defence preparedness.\"\r\n   What is all the more serious is the fact that the \"Rsoi\" manoeuvres, which were held after the U.S. 8th Army, the main combat force of the U.S. troops in South Korea, was put on a war footing, coincided in time with the South Korean visit of Shelton.                                           \r\n   War exercises in which the U.S. Forces in South Korea play a leading role are being incessantly staged.           \r\n   All facts eloquently prove that the United States is the very one which is rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula strained, bringing it to the brink of war.        \r\n\r\n\r\n"
