            "content": "New tunnel built near memorial palace\r\n Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- A new tunnel has been built through Mt.Ami near the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the sacred temple of Juche, to mark the third death anniversary of the great leader President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   With the tunnel built, the Ryongsong Motorway from Pyongyang airport leads directly to the memorial palace.\r\n   The letters \"Kumnung Tunnel\" written by the President are inscribed above both ends of the tunnel.\r\n   The double-arch tunnel looks like an ancient Korean wall gate and befits the gate of the sacred temple.\r\n   The construction of the tunnel not only changed the looks of the area but also makes it more convenient for Koreans and foreigners to visit the memorial palace.\r\n   The tunnel was built by soldiers of the Korean People's Security Forces in nine months.\r\n   The ceremony of marking the construction of the tunnel was held today, attended by Ri Jong Ok, politburo member of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and Vice-President of the DPRK, and other senior party and state officials.\r\n   In his report at the ceremony, Hong Song Nam, alternate politburo member of the WPK Central Committee and Vice-Premier of the Administration Council, described the tunnel as a result of the noble morality and wise leadership of Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is determined to venerate the president as the founder of socialist Korea and the sun of all people for all ages, and a monumental edifice erected on the strength of military-civilian unity. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
