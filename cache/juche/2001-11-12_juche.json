This attitude has nothing to do with the dialogue and only made problems more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a true will to resume the dialogue with the DPRK, it should properly approach the dialogue and begin with creating an atmosphere favorable to it and building confidence. This is the most urgent task before the u.s. and a process to which it should give top priority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. dialogue can be resumed only if the U.S. changes its attitude toward the DPRK and takes practical measures to create this atmosphere and build confidence. \r\n\r\n"
