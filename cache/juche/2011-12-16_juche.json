This was possible because the guerrilla army was strong in the anti-imperialist spirit and faith. During the Fatherland Liberation War the army and people of the DPRK defeated the U.S. imperialists, chieftain of imperialism, and their lackeys mainly because they had strong anti-imperialist spirit and the firm will to defend the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any illusion about and fear of imperialism make it hard to believe in one's own strength and slacken the anti-imperialist spirit, being infected with war-weariness. This will finally end up yielding to imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One should counter the imperialists' use of force in kind. If a country neglects the work to bolster the capability for self-defense, while worrying about difficulties before it, it will be hard to humble the arrogance of the imperialists,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the staunch anti-imperialist spirit and a powerful driving force that the Workers' Party and people of Korea have firmly protected the gains of revolution and sovereignty of the country and nation while frustrating the imperialists' highhanded practices and moves for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article calls on the revolutionary countries and peoples to bravely meet the challenge of the imperialists with the above-said spirit and forces and thus defend the supreme interests of the country and nation and build a new independent and peaceful world."
