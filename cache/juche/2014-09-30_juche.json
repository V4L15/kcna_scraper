            "content": "KCNA Commentary Denounces Projected Deployment of THAAD in South Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 30 (KCNA) -- Washington continues floating its worn-out story about the \"threat from north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Susan Rice, assistant to the U.S. president for national security, in her talks with traitor Kim Kwan Jin, chief of the security office of Chongwadae of south Korea, at the White House blustered that \"it is necessary to maintain close cooperation in policy-making and strong combined defense posture to cope with the threat from north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She pressurized the latter to accept the deployment of THAAD in south Korea as a military measure for implementing the U.S. strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This brought to light the U.S. sinister design to establish its regional vantage point for carrying out its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific under the pretence of protecting peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in other parts of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After cooking up the fiction about the \"threat from north Korea\" in a bid to carry out its domination strategy, the U.S. has long stepped up its moves to build a missile shield targeting the regional powers behind the scene. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has regarded south Korea as the most suitable area for building its missile shield as it is in military confrontation with the DPRK and geographically close to major regional powers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence, it has plugged south Korea deep into its missile shield project under the pretexts of sharing information in the field of tracking ballistic missiles with south Korean puppet forces and conducting a survey of sites for deploying THAAD and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As such moves faced difficulties due to the opposition of the south Korean people and vigilance among countries in the region, the U.S. is mulling finally clinching the deal for the introduction of THAAD into south Korea by using the extension of the transfer of the wartime operation control as a bargaining chip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. is working hard to calm down the opposition of regional powers by employing such poor trick as \"a counter-action\" to cope with \"the nuclear and missile threats from north Korea.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Rice uttered is nothing but remarks made against this backdrop.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the U.S. is contemplating using south Korea as a shock brigade and cannon fodder for carrying out its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific and turning it into an outpost for all-out confrontation with its neighboring powers in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If its scenario becomes a reality, the Korean Peninsula will be reduced to a springboard from which the U.S. can launch aggression for world domination and to a scene of bloodshed and fierce scramble of big powers as what happened in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deployment of THAAD in south Korea would only spark off serious political and military unrest and a hot armament race in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, the arch criminal harassing peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop at once making much fuss over the \"threat from north Korea\" to cover up its criminal scenario."
