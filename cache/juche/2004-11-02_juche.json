And RC-135 strategic reconnaissance planes made shuttle flights in the sky over the east of Paeka Islet, Yangphyong and Yangyang on October 13, 14 and 19 to spy on objects in the depth of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An E-3 commanding plane perpetrated espionage on the forefront areas of the DPRK on Oct. 13, 14 and 19 while commanding fighter planes mobilized in various war games including aerial warfare exercise and drill of  catching aerial targets in the sky over Kumsan, Ronsan, Ansong and Koesan. The cases of the aerial espionage by strategic reconnaissance planes, electronic reconnaissance planes and commanding planes numbered 30 or more in October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, RC-12, RC-7B and other tactical reconnaissance planes made sorties day and night to spy on military objects of the DPRK side in the sky over the areas along the Military Demarcation Line. The planes numbered 8 on October 9, 7 every day on October 5, 18, 25 and 28 and 6 every day on October 19 and 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made 10 more espionage flights in October than in September.

            "content": "DPRK to Approach Six-party Talks in Its State Interests \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- It is the principled stand of the DPRK on the six-party talks to approach the talks and handle the issue related to them in its state interests, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary.\r\n The DPRK took the initiative of holding the six-party talks and has exerted efforts to make them successful prompted by the desire to make the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free, prevent a nuclear war and ensure lasting peace on it, the news analyst notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. State Secretary Powell during his recent junkets to Japan, south Korea and other countries falsified facts, claiming that the six-party talks were put to a stalemate because of the DPRK's lack of efforts to participate in the talks. This indicates that his Asian trip was aimed to serve a sinister political purpose of convincing the international community of the U.S. willingness to further the six-party talks, shifting the blame for the delay of the talks on to the DPRK and putting collective pressure upon it under that pretext in a bid to bring it to its knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the six-party talks entirely depends on the U.S. attitude toward them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. Whether the U.S. renounces its hostile policy toward the DPRK or not is a determining factor of whether the six-party talks may prove successful or whether the DPRK-U.S. relations are pushed to those of acute confrontation  The Bush group's claim that the DPRK will gain much for coming out to the six-party talks does not reflect its intention to lead the talks to any solution to the problem but is nothing but a crafty trick to attain sinister political and military purposes by employing a delaying tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government's proposal for \"reward for freeze\" commanded approval of all the participants in the six-party talks at their third round as it was a just offer to settle the nuclear issue fairly, a proposal calling for compensation to the DPRK for its economic losses caused by the freeze of its nuclear power industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side, too, admitted this at the talks. However, no sooner had the talks been over than the U.S. asserted that there could never be any reward for north Korea's nuclear freeze, totally negating all the agreements and the common understanding reached at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It even went the lengths of demanding once again that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, thus overturning the groundwork of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is an aim sought by the U.S. in this behaviour. It wanted to give the American voters the impression that the government has exerted efforts for the solution of the nuclear issue in a bid to garner support for Bush in the presidential election just near at hand so that he might be reelected and, at the same time, lay the blame for the deadlocked six-party talks at the DPRK's door in case of their collapse in a bid to secure a pretext for preempting an attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wishes a solution to the nuclear issue through the six-party talks and peace on the Korean Peninsula it should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and set forth a realistic alternative proposal to accept the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" and the offer of \"reward for freeze\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are getting more loud-mouthed about the \"reform\" and \"opening\" of the north, even stringing out the obtrusive words that they will \"not stint aid\" and going to the extent of begging for \"international support\" to it.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The essence of the \"reform\" and \"opening\" about which the south Korean authorities are beating the drum is, in one word, to disorganize the north from within and change it after the pattern of the \"strategy of peaceful transition\" that the U.S. used in driving the East European socialist countries to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is obviously a grave provocation against the north that the south Korean authorities are getting more desperate these days in their anti-national moves for \"reform\" and \"opening\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the inter-Korean relations are in a state of freeze due to the anti-ethical acts and anti-national perfidy of the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They do not have the slightest intention to promote reconciliation and unity of the nation and improve the inter-Korean relations by honestly implementing the June 15 joint declaration. They are running about day in and day out to realize their wild ambition for \"unification through absorption\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should, above all, apologize for their criminal acts in driving the favorably developing inter-Korean relations into a crisis, instead of letting out the high-flown jargon about someone's \"reform\" and \"opening\" while cooperating with outside forces.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

It accused him of asserting that a proposal made by the U.S. at the third round of the six-party talks was a very flexible and good one and it hoped an early resumption of the next round of the talks. He went the lengths of raving that the north was to blame for the delayed talks, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Powell was well aware of the fact that the U.S. evermore undisguised hostile acts against the north and its unilateral demand that the latter dismantle its nuclear program first are a stumbling block lying in the way of the talks but he worked hard to shift the blame for the delay of the talks on to the north. This is a brazen-faced assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has no intention to mount an attack on the north, then how can one interpret the U.S. massive shipment of up-to-date weapons of various types into the Korean Peninsula, its operation plans to invade the north being disclosed one after another and the \"North Korean Human Rights Act,\" etc? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not entitled to talk about the six-party talks. The call made by the U.S. for the talks while frantically stepping up the war preparations is just like asking for a handshake while brandishing an iron club to beat one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called for conducting a more vigorous struggle against the U.S. and war and for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea in order to frustrate the U.S. war moves and achieve independence, peace and reunification on this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
