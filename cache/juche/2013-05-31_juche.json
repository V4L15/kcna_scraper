This is entirely ascribable to the puppet authorities' extreme confrontation policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they seek is to realize their ambition for \"unification of social systems\" at any cost by steadily intensifying the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK in league with outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because of such group of traitors who are finding a way out in the confrontation with compatriots, quite indifferent to the nation's destiny that there created a serious hurdle in the cause of the country's reunification and all Koreans have been exposed to the constant danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly want to see trust, dialogue and mended relations, they should roll back their confrontation policy and implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration."
