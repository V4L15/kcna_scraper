Korea's decision to introduce U.S.-made fighters \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- The South Korean \"Ministry of National Defence\" decided to select F-15K of the U.S. Boeing Company as the type of fighters of the next generation on April 19, a Seoul-based radio reported.\r\n This decision can never be tolerated as it is an act contrary to the basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the atmosphere for reconciliation and cooperation now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula after the publication of the joint press release on April 5 this year. It is also an action going against the positive trend toward warming up the temporarily frozen inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad ardently hope for national unity and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccordingly, what is needed in South Korea is an atmosphere of national reconciliation, not an atmosphere of confrontation and war caused by lethal weapons outsiders seek to sell, instigating it to kill fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the South Korean military authorities caved in to the pressure of the U.S. munitions monopolies and turned down the nation's vital demand for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not hesitate to sacrifice other country and nation for its own benefit. Pressed by it, the \"Ministry of National Defence\" of South Korea decided to introduce U.S.-made fighters, which is a concentric expression of its pro-U.S. toadyism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As is known, the U.S. has forced South Korea to purchase such type of fighters worth 5,800 billion won with taxes collected from the south Korean people in a bid to bring profits to the U.S. munitions monopolies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the U.S. is seeking to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation by selling to South Korea scores of such fighters capable of carrying nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding South Korea as an operational base for its Asia strategy, nuclear strategy, the U.S. is scheming to deploy in local areas in advance the latest fighters to be used for putting this strategy into practice. Such moves can not but be a time fuse to spark fresh military confrontation on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sale of weapons to South Korea will be censured by the Korean people and the world people as it will delay the peace process in the peninsula and aggravate the situation in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n"
