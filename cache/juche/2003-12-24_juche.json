They asserted that the nature of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula has been distorted and misrepresented by media of the West including the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the DPRK stand for the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, the nuclear crisis could be settled peacefully through dialogue only if the U.S. expresses its will to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, they noted, and stressed that it is important for the international community to have a correct understanding of the nature of the nuclear issue and show a strong sense responsibility to seek a fair solution to the issue.  \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Charter and international law and a serious infringement upon the DPRK's sovereignty as it was aimed to suffocate the DPRK through an \"international siege\" and economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves for an international siege and blockade against the DPRK are deliberate and premeditated provocative ones to aggravate the DPRK-Japan confrontation and ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula. \r\n Ever since the outbreak of the second nuclear crisis they have never missed the chance to bluster that Japan would never allow the DPRK's nuclear program and if it does not yield to their demand, they would take additional \"hard line measures.\" They are now being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and army of the DPRK will take toughest retaliatory measures the moment it judges its sovereignty has been infringed upon by Japan's blockade operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no guarantee that Japan's blockade will not lead to such a serious situation as a war. In case a war breaks out, it will bring unpredictably disastrous consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should stop at once such foolish moves to suffocate the DPRK through an \"international siege\" and economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary warns the DPRK will never overlook Japan's reckless attempt.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
