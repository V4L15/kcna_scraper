He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the KPA successfully built it in a grand style under a long-term plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to the history of the factory, he stressed that the factory should minutely organize the ideological education for giving fullest play to its employees' mental power and dynamically wage a hot emulation and thus successfully  operate the important post directly linked with the work for  improving the diet of the service personnel and people, the armory-like establishment on the fishing front by achieving signal successes in production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the combined control room, sample room, net-production shop, rope-production shop, float production shop and others to learn in detail about the level of its technical equipment, production and quality of products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  As the factory is fully equipped with such equipment as modern net-weaver, winder and shaper, the level of its technical equipment and production capacity has been remarkably increased and a sea of machines has appeared, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he was pleased that the factory successfully put an integrated production system on a high scientific and IT basis by pooling efforts with scientists and technicians, the system whereby it can seek the most reasonable production method suited to the production environment, and installed modern machines of Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has an important duty to perform, he noted, indicating the tasks facing it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it became possible for the factory to massively produce and sufficiently supply varieties of fishing tackle not only to specialized fishery stations but also to sideline fishing boats of KPA sub-units stationed in coastal areas, he said with pleasure that the factory is an icon factory, a valuable asset and a big base for the generations to come as it can greatly contribute to developing the fishing industry of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with the officials and employees of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Pak Yong Sik and So Hong Chan."

This is the inescapable fate of the stooge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD deployment in south Korea has long been pushed forward as demanded by its master whether it is wanted by the south Korean puppet forces or not. As residents in Songju County claim, preparations such as the laying of electric wires have been made in the area long before the decision on THAAD deployment was announced.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The delayed announcement was just deception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, \"diplomacy\" pursued by the puppet regime which talked much about dichotomy whereby it depends on the U.S. for \"security\" and attaches importance on China for economy is bound to end in failure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is too natural that even media of south Korea, commenting on the \"diplomacy\", said that there are feelings of crisis that south Korea-China relations plunged into a quagmire after ten months of \"the Tiananmen platform diplomacy\" pursued by Park Geun Hye and that \"northern diplomacy\" which has been cemented since 1990 seems to have been intercepted first by THAAD."
