Assailing this, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says:\r\n The United States is the arch criminal posing a real nuclear and missile threat as it does not hesitate to use nuclear weapons and missiles to exterminate humankind in a bid to realize world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a brigandish logic for the united states to insist on establishing the Missile Defence System (MD) under the pretext of the DPRK's non-existent \"missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is made a main target of the U.S. MD. Therefore, the United States is planing to deploy missile interceptor radars, the main equipment of the MD, in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the U.S. is demanding the DPRK reduce its \"conventional forces\" while taking an offensive attitude toward the DPRK with huge aggressor forces including nuclear weapons deployed in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and its moves to isolate and stifle it are escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increasing the danger of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unilateralism of the united states that it does not bother to sacrifice others in its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people will not allow anyone to encroach upon the dignity of the country and nation in a bid to meet the interests of the united states and its strategic demand.    \r\n\r\n"

Their start of the Korean War in 1950 was a product of their strategy of state terrorism and policy of military terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention recently is that they paint the DPRK as a \"rogue state\" in a bid to wage an \"anti-terrorism war\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that those countries \"supporting\" terrorists and \"rogue states proliferating\" missiles and weapons of mass destruction would be the targets of their operations. This suggests that the DPRK is made their target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK should be called a \"rogue state\" for its manufacture of missiles for self-defense, how one should term the U.S. that has stockpiled a lot of missiles of various types and more than 20,000 nuclear warheads? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, the U.S. is the worst rogue state in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No pressure can ever work on the DPRK. If the U.S. challenges the patience of the DPRK with pressure and power politics, the latter will meet the challenge with its toughest policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The division of Korea is attributable to outsiders and the outsiders are the main obstacle lying in the way of national reunification. dependence on the outsiders, therefore, makes it impossible to reunify the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country should be reunified in a peaceful way through inter-Korean dialogue, cooperation, national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is a sure guarantee for national reunification. When all the Koreans get united to form a single driving force of reunification, it precisely means national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the great national unity it is necessary for all the Koreans in the north and south and abroad to make visits, contacts, boost cooperation and exchange and strengthen solidarity among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south of Korea agreed to achieve reunification by federal formula on the principle of promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests, recognizing and respecting the existence of their different ideas and systems. as a result, a solid foundation has been laid for them to confidently achieve the reunification of the country with a common blueprint for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude towards the declaration shows who wants national reunification or not and who is a patriot or a traitor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans at home and abroad should turn out with ardent patriotism in a grand march for independent reunification of the nation that began with the publication of the historic declaration, to make a tangible contribution to the building of a reunified country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
