            "content": "KCNA Commentary Condemns Park Geun Hye of Crimes Committed in Three Years of Her Office\r\n Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- Traitor Park Geun Hye's three years in office are full of crimes she committed by kowtowing to outsiders, betraying the nation, bringing the north-south relations to a total collapse and blocking the democratization of the south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea ruled by Park today is a colony of the U.S. and shackled even to neighboring big powers in the true sense of words. It now reminds one of the period dating back to the late 19th century and the early 20th century when Korea went to ruin due to the scrambles among big powers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regarding dependence on outsiders as her inborn disposition, Park has left the dignity and interests of the nation to the tender mercy of outsiders and escalated confrontation with the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had she been elected \"president\" of south Korea than she phoned the U.S. president to fawn upon him by telling him that she would put the U.S.-south Korea alliance on a higher stage through close cooperation with Washington. She made her first foreign tour of the U.S. after taking office where she shamelessly promised her American master to unconditionally tailor her \"north policy\" and other diplomatic and security policies to Washington's north Korea policy and diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She created her diplomacy and security team with confrontation maniacs who earned ill-fame as military gangsters, saying that she absolutely trusted the judgment and decision of the military. She thus left all the matters of the north-south relations to be handled by them and reduced them to playthings of confrontation and war maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever she opened her mouth to decry the north's nuclear deterrence for self-defence, she talked rubbish that \"the north's nuclear weapons should never be allowed\" and \"it is sheer illusion for the north to implement the line of simultaneously pushing forward the two fronts.\" She solicited international cooperation during her foreign junkets, crying out for \"the north's dismantlement of nuclear weapons.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crying out for \"adhering to principle\", she brought to rupture the hard-won north-south authorities talks and, furthermore, totally closed the Kaesong Industrial Zone though her predecessors dared not do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her regime, in collusion with the U.S., got desperate in its moves for a nuclear war against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It together with the U.S. mapped out the \"tailored deterrent strategy\" designed to mount a preemptive strike at the DPRK by mobilizing even mainland-based nuclear force of the U.S., the plan for \"jointly coping with local war\" aimed to lead the DPRK to an armed clash and the provocative \"4D operation plan\" to attack its nuclear and missile bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to those war scenarios, they staged Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, Ulji Freedom Guardian and other large-scale joint military drills every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the emergence of the present regime, ultra-modern U.S. nuclear war hardware and strike means including nuclear carrier Nimitz, George Washington, nuclear submarine Cheyenne and B-52 strategic bombers, B-2 stealth strategic bombers and F-22 stealth fighters are frequenting south Korea and its vicinity for nuclear war drills. Consequently, south Korea has turned into a U.S. exhibition ground of cutting-edge nuclear war hardware and strike means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime has massively introduced U.S.-made weaponry under the pretext of coping with non-existent \"provocation and threat from the north\" during three years of office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It spent hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars for purchasing U.S.-made weaponry such as various type missiles, helicopters and airships. In addition to it, a stupendous amount of funds were spent for buying high-altitude spy drones for establishing MD system, SAMs and Aegis destroyer combat system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It extended for an indefinite period the transfer of OPECON scheduled in 2015 to turn south Korea into a permanent colony and military base of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is busy staging together with the U.S. madcap war drills aimed at preemptive attack on the north almost every day under the pretext of its bolstering of nuclear deterrent and satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is now introducing ultra-modern nuclear strike means and special-ops forces which earned an ill-fame in wars of aggression overseas in the past, openly talking about \"beheading operation\" and \"high-density strikes\" against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Most recently the puppet forces staged a large-scale naval firing maneuver under the simulated conditions of \"enemy armed provocation\" and \"surprise attack and occupation of five islands in the West Sea. In the wake of opening to media a large-scale combat equipment mobile drill of the 20th mechanized infantry division of the puppet ground force, south Korean and U.S. forces conducted the south Korea-U.S. combined wartime reinforcement rehearsal aimed at the rapid deployment of U.S. reinforcing force in the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the reckless provocative moves of the Park group, the north-south relations have plunged into nadir and the situation in the Korean Peninsula has reached the worst phase that should never be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group of traitors is, indeed, a source of trouble to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should be rooted out in time."
