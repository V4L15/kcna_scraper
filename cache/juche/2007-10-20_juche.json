But history cannot be changed with words nor can it be reversed by a distorted description in the history textbook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing materials to prove that forcible drafting of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists was a hideous human rights abuse, the author of the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forcibly drafted, kidnapped and abducted Koreans in groups and forced them to slave labor and murdered them. These were crimes that could not be committed without politicizing the destruction of the Korean nation or without orders and instructions of the government during their colonial rule over Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rolling off the tongues of the Japanese reactionaries quite often these days, with regard to the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists, are the words that the drafting and abduction were made \"at the voluntary will of Koreans.\" This means that they were utterly not accountable for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They persist in denying the past crimes and tampering with history, considering it to be \"an act of self-maltreatment\" to honestly admit the forcible drafting and kidnapping of Koreans and other crimes of the Japanese imperialists and make an apology and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, however, the distortion of history and denial of past crimes are an act of self-maltreatment and a foolish behavior of isolating Japan in international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bearing this in mind, Japan had better stop such act and redress the past at an early date. This is beneficial for Japan itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
