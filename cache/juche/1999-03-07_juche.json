Korean chief executive's remarks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Yun Song Sik, a South Korean defector to the north, branded the \"achievements\" advertised by the South Korean chief executive in his recent \"dialogue with the people\" and \"press conference\" as a mockery of the people and a sheer lie.   Yun made the remark in his interview with KCNA on Saturday a year after the emergence of the \"people's government\" in South Korea.   He told KCNA:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the last year, the \"people's government\" has further turned South Korea into a plaything of outsiders and a land with bankrupt economy through dependence on outsiders and sycophantic, treacherous policy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    South Koreans are in despair with no hope though they stay alive, due to distress in living, poverty, distorted moral structure, plunder by comprador capital, bankruptcy of businesses in depression and massive unemployment.   The present ruler is a heinous pro-American, pro-Japanese flunkeyist and traitor who kowtows to outsiders for the maintenance of his regime and personal comfort, while remaining indifferent to the interests and welfare of the people. For instance, he claimed that his \"victory in Presidential Election\" also means \"victory of the United States.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   National independence and reunification are the only way out for the South Korean people.   The chief executive of South Korea should reject dependence on the United States and Japan and take the line of national independence, before it is too late.   He should have the spirit of national independence and stop all political disputes that encourage distrust and confrontation among fellow countrymen. He should immediately abolish the anti-reunification \"National Security Law\" which defines fellow countrymen as \"enemy.\" He should also take the road of terminating the foreigners imposed tragic division of more than half a century and reunifying the country at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

The government is a powerful weapon for firmly consolidating the political and ideological position of Korean socialism and bringing about a new upswing in socialist economic construction and cultural development, the paper notes, and says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It reliably defends the gains of the revolution and the people's happiness from the imperialists and other reactionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also repulses the tendencies toward \"reform\" and \"opening\" and guides the state administration, economic management and all other spheres of social life as required by socialism and on the principle of socialism so as to play a big role in helping the people deeply grasp the advantages of socialism through practice.   The people's government does all it can to improve the people's material and cultural life in a responsible manner.   There is no change in the state's popular policies, though hard pressed for everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government invariably pursues popular policies such as free and compulsory education and free medical care so that the people can enjoy great benefits from the state. The government also steps up economic construction and cultural development in order to provide the people with conditions for an affluent and highly civilized life. \r\n \r\n"
