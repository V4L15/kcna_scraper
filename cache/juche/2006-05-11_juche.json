            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides On-Site Guidance to Newly Built Pyongyang Conservatory\r\n \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, provided on-site guidance to the newly built Pyongyang Conservatory.\r\n He was received by leading officials of the conservatory on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commander of the unit which had participated in its construction made a report to him on its successful construction. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conservatory covering a plottage of 5 hectares on the bank of the Taedong River has been constructed by soldier-builders in a matter of two years. It is a seat of learning music and arts as it is equipped with all educational facilities such as a main building, a building for a special education, an annex, an 800-seater concert hall, several auditoriums, a hostel, a gymnasium and entertainment and service facilities. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il was briefed on the designs of the buildings and their interior structures before going round a room dedicated to the history of the conservatory. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went round the historic relics and mementoes associated with the undying footprints of President Kim Il Sung. He highly appreciated the achievements made by the conservatory, noting that it has trained many talented artistes, thus greatly contributing to the development of the Juche-oriented art over the last 57 years since its establishment. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Making the rounds of lecture rooms, rooms for teaching individual students in subjects of special study, auditoriums of different sizes, a gymnasium, a dinning hall and rooms of the hostel, the fashionable concert hall, etc. for a long while, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the modern conservatory has been built with success. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He extended high appreciation and thanks to the soldier-builders for having completed the construction project in a brief span of time by devoting all their wisdom and energies with intense loyalty to the Party and the revolution. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to build more edifices to meet the aesthetic tastes and wishes of the popular masses, it is necessary to positively explore and apply unique and peculiar architectural styles and bring about steady innovations in the formative artistic representation of architecture, he stressed. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our Party spares nothing for the younger generation, the future of the country, and feels greater pride and joy in doing so, he said, underscoring the need to direct big efforts to the work to bring them up to be pillars of the country, in the future, too. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to train students into talented artistes possessed of a high level of special knowledge and skill while at the conservatory, it is important to steadily improve the qualifications of the teachers as required by the developing reality and provide better educational environment, he noted, indicating a specific orientation and ways to do so. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak Pong Ju, premier of the DPRK Cabinet, and Ri Yong Chol and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "- Definite End to Joint Military Exercises with Foreign Forces Demanded  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities' continued participation in joint military exercises with foreign forces cannot be construed otherwise than a criminal act of standing in the way of achieving peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula and hamstringing the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations, zealously pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy towards the DPRK. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed article. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military maneuvers staged by foreign forces in south Korea every year are one of the main factors of straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist forces present in south Korea have been hell bent on war maneuvers for the last several decades, watching for a chance to invade the DPRK. They instigated the south Korean military to stage every year large-scale war exercises targeted against the DPRK such as the RSOI, Foal Eagle and Ulji Focus Lens. Such provocative saber-rattling has been the root cause of harassing the peace in Korea, spoiling the atmosphere of peaceful reunification and increasing the danger of war.\r\nThe above-mentioned war exercises are very dangerous war gambles aimed at mounting a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A touch-and-go situation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula. In order to preserve and consolidate peace there, it is necessary to put an unconditional halt to the joint military exercises with foreign forces in the south, a factor of the mounting tension. To put a definite end to the above-said joint military maneuvers is a principled and fundamental issue arising in the military relations between the north and the south of Korea. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By deliberately escalating the nuclear stand-off with the DPRK the U.S. seeks to create distrust, confrontation and military tension among the Koreans. Precisely for this reason the U.S. keeps wooing the south Korean war-mongers to have joint military maneuvers as annual events despite the growing atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south. .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly wish for peace, reconciliation and cooperation, they should not dither about taking practical steps for terminating the military confrontation and ensuring lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula but make a responsible decision to do so.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
