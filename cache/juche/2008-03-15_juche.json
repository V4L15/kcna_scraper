Korean Warmongers' Saber Rattling under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- With nothing can the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces ever conceal the criminal nature of the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises staged by them as they were moves to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK, saber rattling aimed at destroying the peace and the stability on the Korean Peninsula and invading the DPRK from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long sought to invade the DPRK, regarding south Korea as a stepping stone, and furthermore, put Northeast Asia under its military control.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on history, there has been constant tension on the Korean Peninsula and a danger of the outbreak of war against the DPRK has increased due to all forms of war exercises staged by the U.S. in south Korea including Team Spirit, RSOI, Foal Eagle and Ulji Focus Lens joint military maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle remained unchanged in their contents as only the codename of RSOI was replaced by Key Resolve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that the above-mentioned exercises were extremely dangerous war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK as they were designed to put the carefully worked out scenario for preempting a nuclear strike at the DPRK into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has insisted the recent joint military exercises were of \"defensive nature\" though they involved adventurous plays with fire aimed at vitiating the peaceful atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula and bringing a nuclear war disaster to the Korean nation. This is like burying its head ostrich-like in the sand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korean trigger-happy forces have always watched for a chance to invade the DPRK. The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises were a clear proof of this dangerous scenario for a war of aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
