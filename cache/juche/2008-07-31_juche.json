It is \"pragmatism\" that the Lee group advocated as what they called \"ruling philosophy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that \"pragmatism\" touted by traitor Lee is nothing but a theory of confrontation can be clearly explained by the fact that the traitor seeks to deal with the inter-Korean relations not in terms of the relations between compatriots but in terms of those between the different states under the signboard of \"pragmatism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The inter-Korean relations are special ones because the Koreans forced to live separated for the time being by foreign forces are working hard to achieve reunification. This being a hard reality, the Lee group are trying to apply reactionary \"pragmatism\" to the inter-Korean relations, painting them as the ties between states. The most typical example of the traitor's policy of \"pragmatism\" was furnished by the fact that right after coming to power he tried to eliminate the \"Ministry of Unification\" and transfer its function to the \"Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" in a bid to paint the inter-Korean relations as those between the two different states. The Lee group's persistent insistence on the treacherous \"pragmatism\" would not only bedevil the inter-Korean relations but escalate confrontation. Herein lie the treacherous nature and danger of \"pragmatism\" advocated by the traitor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee spelled out \"pragmatism\" as a weapon for opposing reunification in order to overturn all realities brought about by the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" \"No nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" publicized by Lee on the basis of \"pragmatism\" cannot be constructed otherwise than an extremely treacherous policy because it is designed not to have dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south but to pursue confrontation and a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Pragmatism\" is an unpardonable treacherous theory of confrontation opposed to the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish an act than for the Lee group to make desperate efforts to check the advance of the June 15 era of reunification under the watchword of \"pragmatism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can bar the Koreans from dynamically advancing for national reunification under the banner of national independence, regarding the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as truth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
