OPLAN 5015 focuses \"on bolstering the capabilities for striking the headquarters\" including the scenario of making a prompt attack on the headquarters and communication facilities of the rival side.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean bellicose forces disclosed a plan for deploying ballistic missiles with the range of 800 km, making provocative remarks about \"keeping the whole of the north within striking range and full-scale operation of Kill Chain to cope with the north's nukes and missiles\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a commentary observes that these reckless war drumbeats are screwing up the tension on the Korean Peninsula and pushing the inter-Korean relations into catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t OPLAN 5015 mapped out by the south Korean warmongers together with the U.S. once again clearly reveals the south Korean authorities' real stance against dialogue and peace as they are keen to invade the DPRK in league with outsiders while talking volumes about the improvement of the north-south relations, the commentary notes, and warns:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations which are still in a fragile state may collapse overnight if the south Korean authorities persist in political and military provocations to harm the fellow countrymen in the north with the backing of foreign forces as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations should not be allowed to become a scapegoat for the confrontation maniacs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nation will never allow the south Korean authorities to escalate the confrontation with the compatriots, going against their unanimous desire for the national reconciliation, unity and improvement of the inter-Korean relations."

This cannot but be sophism, the height of impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story about \"threat from north Korea\" being floated by Tokyo is nothing but a poor trick to divert elsewhere the international community's bitter criticism of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Japan is under fire at home and abroad for its undisguised moves for reinvasion including the adoption of the security legislation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, Japan is trumpeting about the old theory of \"threat from north Korea\" in a bid to get rid of its unfavorable position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, by noisily advertising the DPRK as \"a state posing threat\", Japan seeks to make the world drop its negative view on the scenario for domination over Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has committed too monstrous crimes in the past to hide them and its ambition for reinvasion is extremely dangerous.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No country will be taken in by Japan's clumsy farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better make sincere apology and reparation for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past at an early date, instead of resorting to the above-said trick."
