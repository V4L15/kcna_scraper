Korean War ignited by the U.S. on June 25, 1950 imposed unspeakable misfortune and sufferings on the Korean people, causing tremendous human and material losses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has, however, falsified the truth of history and persisted in its moves to stifle the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a foolish act to evade the responsibility as the provocateur of the Korean War and realize its wild ambition for domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistorical facts bring to bolder relief the true colors of the U.S. as provocateur of the Korean War and a war criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean War was an inevitable product of the U.S. strategy for putting the world under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was pursuant to the U.S. foreign policy for aggression and its direct result.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. set it as an immediate strategic goal of its foreign policy to establish \"leadership over the world\" and dominate the world by taking advantage of its favorable position in which it emerged the boss of the imperialists after the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tU.S. President Truman in his \"message\" sent to Congress on December 19, 1945, said that at last it became possible for the U.S. to get the leadership position which U.S. President Wilson had wished to grant to it after the end of World War I, adding that it should assume with pleasure the mission to \"lead the world\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to realize its wild ambition to dominate the world the U.S. declared the Cold War against the growing socialist countries and world revolutionary forces and came out with what it called \"containment strategy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe so-called Truman Doctrine spelled out by Truman at a joint meeting of the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives in March 1947 was an open declaration of a war against the socialist forces and the world independent forces and a declaration that called for carrying out its strategy for world domination and \"containment strategy\" in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe proclamation of \"Truman Doctrine\" and the establishment of the above-said strategy meant that the U.S. launched an \"anti-communist crusade expedition.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. attached importance to the Far East in Asia in carrying out its strategy for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMacArthur, commander of the U.S. forces in Fart East and commander of the UN forces during the three-year Korean War, said at that time that Europe had a dying system but Asia having 800 million population would decide on the advance of the world history in 1 000 years to come, adding that the U.S. will lose the whole world if it fails to put Asia under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. reactionary government ostensively advocated the policy of putting main emphasis on Europe but it enforced the policy of attaching importance to Asia in practice under the influence of \"those advocating Asia first\" including MacArthur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey attached great importance to Korea, in particular, among Asian countries, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Top secret document No. 4849\" of the Information Research Bureau of the U.S. Department of State on January 28, 1949 said that in the light of Korea's geographical situation in Northeast Asia to control Korea and its people was of value to any other states interested in the Far East and it was beyond any doubt that Korea was very important for the U.S. from the political point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor its military and strategic position of Korea the U.S. regarded it as a strategic stronghold for making a military strike at any region in the Far East and as a \" bridgehead\" and a \"forefront in the Far East\" from which to intrude into China and the Far Eastern region of the Soviet Union.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo cite just an example, MacArthur was reported to say that Korea was like a bridgehead leading to the continent and that conquering the whole of Korea would help the U.S. forces cut off the only supply line linking Siberia of the Soviet Union with its southern parts and put the whole areas between Vladivostok and Singapore under the U.S. control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. also said Korea was the forefront in the East where it was standing in confrontation with communism and a political and military confrontational hotspot between the East and the West as the north and the south of Korea were taking quite different paths after the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuch upset by the fact that the DPRK was making a leaping advance toward socialism, bringing about epoch-making changes, the U.S. termed Korea an \"ideal battle site on which every possible success of the U.S. in Asia might hinge\" and a \"testing ground for the confrontation between the U.S.-style democracy and communism.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis finally prompted the U.S. to adopt it as a basic policy toward the DPRK to colonize the whole of Korea by means of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. considered war as an effective lever for bringing down the people's democratic system deeply rooted in the DPRK and imposing aggressive demands upon its people strong in independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. illegally brought the issue of Korea up for discussion at the UN in autumn of 1947, cooking up the puppet regime in south Korea in 1948 and worked hard to build \"Asia's best\" puppet army. All this was aimed at meeting these demands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs seen above, the Korean War was an inevitable product of the U.S. brigandish strategy and policy for aggression toward the DPRK, both aimed to colonize the whole of Korea and realize its scenario for dominating the world in the Far East, using it as an outpost."

Accordingly, huge quantities of new type offensive weapons are being additionally deployed in the units of the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tU.S. units supposed to be transferred to Phyongthaek U.S. base south of the River Han are being relocated in the front areas. The U.S. forces side is closeted with the puppet forces over the issue of keeping the U.S.-south Korea \"Combined Forces Command\" as it is even after the transfer of the right to command wartime operations to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLarge-scale joint military exercises are going on one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. staged a joint military drill together with Japanese and south Korean forces in the South Sea of Korea on June 21 and 22 and a joint naval maneuver with the south Korean forces in the West Sea from June 23 to 25 with nuclear-powered carrier George Washington involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn June 22 the U.S. forces staged the largest-ever joint live shell firing in the area south of the DMZ in league with south Korea. In this drill they perpetrated such reckless provocation as firing at the flag of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe situation goes to prove that the U.S. still remains unchanged in its ambition to stifle the DPRK and put the whole Korean Peninsula under its control in a bid to secure a bridgehead for carrying out its strategy for Asian domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is, however, no more than a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK emerged a military power whose military capability is incomparably stronger than what was during the Korean War in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. had better not forget the disgrace and defeat it suffered in the war fought against the young DPRK."

From the afternoon of June 26 they heavily bombed the northern half of Korea and the U.S. 7th Fleet started the military operation in the waters off Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn July 7 the U.S. imperialists let the UK and France submit a resolution to the effect that the U.S. forces' military actions in the DPRK should be conducted under the UN flag which was aimed to put satellite countries under its control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe resolution had no phrases as dispatching \"UN forces\" or setting up \"UN command\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the U.S. imperialists called the \"allied forces command\" \"UN command\" and their aggression forces \"UN forces\" in a bid to justify the UN resolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNext day, they let MacArthur, U.S. commander in Far East, hold a concurrent post as \"UN forces commander\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe resolutions cooked up by the U.S. imperialists are a wanton violation of the UN Charter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt that time, they intentionally excluded the delegate of the DPRK, the country concerned, and invited only the south Korean puppet delegate to the session in a bid to have the resolutions reflecting their demand adopted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. maneuvered the UN Security Council into illegally adopting all the resolutions related to the Korean War without the participation of the former Soviet Union, a permanent member of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present situation suggests that the U.S. may launch armed invasion under the UN flag, by taking advantage of the present international relations, just as it did during the last Korean War.

            "content": "EE.UU no puede ocultar su identidad de provocador de guerra (1)\r\nPyongyang, 27 de junio (ACNC) -- Ya transcurrieron 62 anos desde cuando Estados Unidos desato la guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\tEsta, estallada el 25 de junio de 1950, hizo sufrir al pueblo coreano incontables desgracias y penas y enormes perdidas humanas y materiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. continua hoy tambien con su campana para atropellar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea tergiversando la verdad de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un acto estupido para liberarse de la responsabilidad de provocacion de la guerra coreana y realizar su ambicion dominacionista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos historicos ponen al desnudo a todo el mundo la naturaleza de Estados Unidos como provocador y criminal de la guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProducto inevitable de la estrategia de hegemonia mundial\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa guerra coreana fue producto inevitable de la estrategia de Estados Unidos para dominar el mundo. Especificamente, devino la continuacion de su politica exterior de caracter agresivo y su resultado directo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando su posicion favorable de caudillo de los imperialistas que ocupo despues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Estados Unidos presento como su meta estrategica de su inminente politica exterior la \"direccion sobre el mundo\" y la toma de hegemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su mensaje enviado el 19 de diciembre de 1945 al Congreso, el entonces presidente estadounidense Truman parloteo que EE.UU. debe asumir con gusto la mision de \"dirigir al mundo\" agregando que \"ellos (los norteamericanos) pudieron recibir la posicion directiva que quiso concederles el presidente Wilson despues de la Primera Guerra Mundial\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara realizar su ambicion, el imperio declaro la guerra fria contra los paises socialistas y las fuerzas revolucionarias del mundo en pleno crecimiento y presento ademas la llamada \"estrategia de contencion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"Doctrina Truman\", publicada por este en marzo de 1947 en la reunion conjunta bicameral del Congreso, fue la abierta declaracion de guerra contra las fuerzas socialistas y las independientes del mundo, la cual anuncio el cumplimiento de la estrategia de dominar el mundo y \"la de contencion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse suceso significo el inicio de la \"cruzada anticomunista\" con miras a la hegemonia mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsia primero, Europa despues. Y Corea sobre todo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEEE.UU. concede importancia a Asia, en particular, al Extremo Oriente en el cumplimiento de su estrategia de heguemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMacArthur decia entonces que Europa es \"sistema que va muriendo\", pero Asia con una poblacion de 800 millones \"determinara el avance de la historia del mundo en los proximos mil anos\", opinando que  si EE.UU. no logra tomar a Asia, perderia el mundo entero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno reaccionario estadounidense abogo aparentemente por el centralismo de Europa, pero en realidad, se inclino a la politica de apreciar a Asia dejandose llevar por \"los que dan primacia a Asia\", inclusive MacArthur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCorea era la manzana que apetecia mas al imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el \"documento supersecreto no. 4849\" de la oficina de investigacion de informaciones del Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. fechado 28 de enero de 1949, se lee que \"Por la posicion geografica de Corea en el Nordeste Asiatico, vale la pena a cualquier Estado, interesado en el Extremo Oriente, controlar ese pais y su pueblo\" y \"es indudable la importancia politica de Corea para EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posicion estrategica militar de Corea es tan favorable que hizo a EE.UU. verla como \"base estrategica\" para dar ataque militar a cualquier region del Extremo Oriente y como \"puente\" y \"linea avanzada en el Extremo Oriente\" desde donde se puede lanzar la invasion contra China y el Extremo Oriente de la ex Union Sovietica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ejemplo, MacArthur habia dicho que si se logra ocupar todo el territorio de \"Corea, puente al continente\", se puede \"cortar la unica linea de abastecimiento que conecta a Siberia de la Union Sovietica con la region sur de Asia, … Dominar toda la zona entre Vladivostok y Singapur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, puesto que despues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, el Norte y el Sur de Corea construian sistemas sociales diametralmente opuestos, EE.UU. describia a Corea como linea avanzada en el Oriente donde se enfrenta con el comunismo y como punto de enfrentamiento politico y militar entre el Oriente y el Occidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTemiendo a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea que se desarrolla vertiginosamente hacia el socialismo logrando cambios seculares despues de la liberacion (15 de agosto de 1945), definio a Corea como \"campo de batalla de ideales que quizas determine todos los exitos de EE.UU. en Asia\" y \"lugar de ensayo de confrontacion entre la democracia al estilo norteamericano y el comunismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fin, EE.UU. llego a elegir como fundamento de su politica sobre Corea colonizar a toda Corea con el metodo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConsidero que la guerra es el unico medio eficaz para derrocar el regimen popular democratico arraigado profundamente en la parte norte de Corea e imponer al pueblo de esta muy independiente sus demandas de bandido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPartiendo de esta demanda, el imperio remitio ilegalmente el problema coreano a la ONU en otono de 1947, fundo el regimen titere surcoreano en 1948 y se esforzo mucho por organizar el ejercito surcoreano como el \"primero de Asia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi la guerra coreana fue producto inevitable de la estrategia bandidesca y la politica agresiva a Corea de EE.UU., encaminadas a colonizar a toda Corea y cumplir el plan de heguemonia mundial en el Extremo Oriente tomandola como base avanzada."
