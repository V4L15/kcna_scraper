Korean Authorities Urged Not to Behave Contrary to Hard-won Atmosphere of Improving Inter-Korean Relations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- Very ill-boding ceaseless demeanors chilling the atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations have been reported from south Korea since the publication of the joint press release to bring pain to Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK issued a statement on Wednesday, prompted by its desire to keep the hard-won atmosphere of improving the north-south relations afloat and open up their prospect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should, to begin with, stop dishonest demeanors of ceaselessly floating story that \"security crisis was caused by the north first\" and it is \"chiefly to  blame\" for the recent dangerous crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive of south Korea blustered at Chongwadae that \"the crisis was caused by the north's landmine and shelling\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin, chief of the security office of Chongwadae who came to the contact, is spreading rumor that the south wrested \"apology from the north\", claiming that the north \"made an apology\" for \"planting landmine\" and pledged to make efforts to defuse tensions and prevent the recurrence of the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, Hong Yong Phyo, minister of \"Unification\", unhesitatingly let loose a spate of sophism that \"May 24 step\" can be lifted when priority is given to the \"north's apology\" for the Cheonan warship sinking case, measure for preventing  the recurrence of the case and punishment of those responsible for it as this opportunity is the \"first instance\" in which the south wrested a \"sure apology\" from the north and the south laid a \"stepping stone for ending the vicious cycle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is strange is that the south Korean authorities are spreading rumor that \"regret\" expressed by the north in the joint press release is the north's \"admission\" and \"apology\" for the suspicious case which occurred in the Demilitarized Zone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They asserted that the word \"regret\" means the \"apology of north Korean style\" as it is a technical term which contains the intention of \"apology\" both from the legal point of view and in the light of practice at international political negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A linguistic expert of south Korea said that \"expression  of regret\" means, in fact, \"the intention of inquiring after a sick person,\" clarifying its true meaning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, \"regret\" is no more than an expression that \"I am sorry for the case\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the \"Ministry of Unification\", when asked on what ground it concluded the landmine blast in the DMZ as \"a provocation from the north,\" was tongue-tied and simply uttered what was stated in the joint press release was a correct answer as he was not in a position to go into details.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was quite different from the fact that the south remained silent about the blast of the similar \"landmine\" in the same place along the DMZ on August 23.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Mine blast\" of such kind that occurred in the DMZ is just a common accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Misjudgment of the rival would only entail catastrophic consequences in the north-south relations. The south should not forget this even a moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next, the south Korean authorities should stop such foolish act of bluffing that the adoption of the joint press release was a \"victory of theory of principle\" won by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean political camp is noisily claiming that the south \"won a score\" and the north \"lost a score\" in the match for weathering the recent crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin and Hong Yong Phyo are main players here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are asserting that the joint press release was a result of the negotiations based on their consistent principle in which the \"government\" flatly rejected the north's demand even though it urged the south to stop anti-north loudspeaker broadcasts while creating crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those concerned of Chongwadae are also vociferating that the south forced the north to accept \"the theory of principle\" while \"highly estimating the joint press release as it contained an apology from the north and its promise to prevent the recurrence of such incident as requested by Park Geun Hye.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An agreement by both sides is possible on mutual understanding of agenda items and recognition of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive, not content with getting busy making \"encouraging phone calls\", called law-makers from the \"Saenuri Party\" to Chongwadae on August 26 where she highly appreciated the joint press release as a result of \"firm will\" and \"security awareness based on principle\".  She even praised the negotiators for \"approaching the contact on principle for the security of the people and the country\". This is something beyond common sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that the representative of the \"Saenuri Party\" said the \"only way of checking the north's provocation\" is \"resolute punishment\" just the way he uttered before his American master while kowtowing to it. In response to his nonsense, such rubbish as \"theory of principle for security\" backed by \"flank support\" and \"action of keeping pace\" were heard all at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are of the view that the successful tide-over of the crisis and the adoption of the joint press release were ascribable to the powerful capability for defence of the DPRK based on nuclear forces and the might of the single-minded unity of the army and people of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is also the result of the unanimous desire of all the Koreans to live in a peaceful environment free from confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was a fair estimation by the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop at once pointing an accusing finger at the DPRK, asserting that the accounts of the briefing made by the director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA on the result of the urgent contact were different from what was said at the contact.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative reptile media in south Korea are misleading the public mindset, asserting the director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army was \"double-tongued\" when he claimed that \"the south Korean regime fabricated a groundless case and unilaterally judged the situation which was created unilaterally\" and that the \"government should protest against it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the director of the KPA General Political Bureau mentioned as regards the urgent contact reflected the stand of the party, army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying this or that about it cannot but be viewed as a behavior devoid of elementary etiquette toward the dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean authorities unhesitatingly made such ridiculous remarks that they should not slacken alert, pinning hope on improving the north-south relations, but avoid \"over-speed\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The security meeting of Chongwadae held on August 27 called for refraining from having \"too much optimism\" as the north-south negotiations are not over but they are just a beginning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the \"Ministry of Unification\" even said that speedy development of the north-south relations should be avoided as the \"May 24 step\" has not yet been lifted and, therefore, \"not much should be expected from the reunions of separated families and relatives\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Assertion calling for avoiding \"speedy\" development of the north-south ties is a revelation of ill intention of cross-minded guys who are displeased with the improvement and development of the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yun Pyong Se went the lengths of talking such rubbish that the adoption of the joint press release is a \"victory of the close south Korea-U.S. alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' reckless act has reached the phase of staging \"integrated firepower annihilating drill 2015\" targeting the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paying no heed to the changed atmosphere, the warmongers opened fire at \"red marks\" designated according to \"operation\" allegedly to cope with \"north's provocation\", military confrontation hysteria and wanton infringement upon the dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation was that even the south Korean chief executive joined warmongers to hurl them into the confrontation racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogue is not a veil for concealing the confrontation scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing will be more shameless than trumpeting about the implementation of the agreement while staging saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very serious are these developments in just several days after the publication of the joint press release. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations can never be mended by unilateral sincere efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not make a foolish misinterpretation of the hard weathering of such crisis on the eve of war and refrain from such act as threatening the hard-won peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who took part in the contact, in particular, should be prudent in their remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is essential at present is that any remark and any behavior would be a barometer judging whether one has etiquette of respecting one's dialogue partner or considering one as an object of mistrust and antagonism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should pay heed with utmost consideration to the advice of the DPRK reflecting its patience and generosity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An agreement by both sides should be implemented and one step taken today will lead to ten, nay hundreds steps tomorrow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tiding over of the crisis does not mean the achievement of peace\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are following with higher vigilance the future moves of the south Korean authorities."

It is the faith of the revolutionaries that they have to keep even though their flesh is torn to shreds and ground to powder and it is again this faith that they must neither abandon nor give up even if they may breathe their last and be charred to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The faith of the revolutionaries is formed and consolidated under the care of the great leader. The whole course of the Korean revolution which advanced and emerged victorious under the leadership of the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu is the course of the struggle which brought up those of faith and will who did not yield under any hardships and difficulties. During these days, such men strong in faith and fighters of will as former unconverted long-term prisoners were produced that can never be seen in any other country in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The former unconverted long-term prisoners overcame the mediaeval punishment and sweet appeasement and mounted the scaffolds with smiles. Therefore, they clearly showed before the world how strong the faith and will of the members of the Workers' Party of Korea believing and following the party and the leader are. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those of strong revolutionary faith and indomitable will are sure to emerge victorious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can block the road of the army and people of the DPRK dashing forward just as in the spirit of snowstorm over Mt. Paektu while overcoming difficulties with indomitable faith and will under the leadership of the great party."

            "content": "Portavoz de Departamento de Politica de CDN advierte a Sur de Corea a moderarse en palabras\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 2 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Despues de publicada la informacion conjunta, en el Sur de Corea salen las palabras infructuosas al ambiente de la mejora de las relaciones entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea, lo cual aflige a la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\tCon la unica voluntad de mantener el ambiente de la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas preparadas a duras penas y abrir su buena perspectiva, el portavoz del Departamento de Politica del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 2 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben dejar primero su proceder injusto de seguir divulgando el rumor de que \"la crisis de seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana fue iniciada por el Norte de Corea\" y el Norte es el \"autor\" de la presente crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mandataria surcoreana dijo publicamente en Chongwadae que \"la presente crisis fue causada por la provocacion de mina y el canonazo del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl jefe de la Oficina de Seguridad de Chongwadae, Kim Kwan Jin, quien participo en el contacto, dijo como si la parte Norte hubiera \"pedido perdon\" por la \"provocacion de mina\" y decidido a hacer esfuerzos por la distension y la no repeticion del caso y difunde el rumor erroneo de que el Sur \"recibio el perdon del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tanto, el ministro de \"Unificacion\", Hong Yong Phyo, solto la sofisteria de que esta vez, el Sur de Corea recibio por primera vez el \"perdon cierto\" del Norte y preparo \"el fundamento para acabar con la circulacion viciosa\" y que \"las  medidas del 24 de mayo tambien seran eliminadas cuando el Norte pida perdon por el incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta ´Cheonan´, tome las medidas de no repeticion y castigue a los culpables\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas ridiculo es que las autoridades surcoreanas difunden el rumor de que la \"lastima\" del Norte expresada en la informacion conjunta significa el \"reconocimiento\" y \"perdon\" del Norte por el incidente sospechoso ocurrido en la zona desmilitarizada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas insisten en que el termino \"lastima\" contiene el sentido de \"perdon\" tanto en el punto de vista juridico como en las costumbres de las negociaciones politicas internacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn linguista surcoreano dijo que la \"expresion de lastima\" significa \"preocupacion por la enfermedad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, la \"lastima\" quiere decir \"lo siento mucho\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, a la pregunta cual es el motivo de poder  afirmar que el caso de explosion de mina ocurrido en la zona desmilitarizada es la \"provocacion del Norte\", el vocero del \"Ministerio de Unificacion\" contesto con una palabra de que \"la informacion es una respuesta correcta dado que no pudiera enumerar lo todo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un fenomeno contrastante con la palabra callada sobre el igual caso ocurrido el 23 de agosto en el mismo lugar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl caso de \"explosion de mina\" ocurrido en la zona desmilitarizada no es nada mas que un incidente ocurrido a menudo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no deben olvidar que el mal juicio a su contraparte causara sin falta una consecuencia catastrofica en las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY deben dejar las absurdidades de soltar los disparates como si la aprobacion de la informacion conjunta fuera la \"victoria de su teoria de principios\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, el circulo politico del Sur de Corea habla ruidosamente de que en el desmontaje de la \"espoleta\" de la presente crisis, ellos mismos \"ganaron\" y el Norte de Corea \"perdio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwan Jin y Hong Yong Phyo toman activa parte en soltar tales palabrerias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon respecto a la informacion conjunta aprobada, ellos insisten en que es un producto obtenido tras participar en las negociaciones manteniendose en los principios invariables y rechazando rotundamente la demanda del Norte de interrumpir la radiodifusion creando la crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos relacionados de Chongwadae disparatean como si inculcaran a alguien la \"teoria de principios sobre el Norte\" diciendo que \"evaluan altamente el hecho de que el acuerdo contiene la disculpa del Norte y la promesa de la no repeticion de provocaciones exigidas por Park Geun-hye\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acuerdo entre ambas partes se logra a base de entendimiento y reconocimiento reciprocos sobre los casos  ocurridos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl cabo de \"telefonear para estimular\", el dia 26, la mandataria surcoreana llamo a Chongwadae a los parlamentarios del \"Partido Saenuri\" para elogiarse a si misma diciendo que \"es un exito alcanzado con la invariable conciencia sobre la seguridad penetrado por los principios\" y que \"mantuvo hasta el fin los principios para la seguridad de los habitantes y el Estado\", lo que es una vanagloria fuera de conocimiento elemental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas ridiculo es que el delegado del \"Partido Saenuri\" disparateo que el \"unico metodo para prevenir la provocacion del Norte\" es la \"represalia rotunda\" y solto unas locuras tales como la llamada \"teoria de principios de seguridad\", el \"apoyo de flanco\" y el \"ajuste del paso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNosotros estimamos que la recuperacion de la crisis y la aprobacion de la informacion conjunta fueron alcanzadas por las poderosas fuerzas autodefensivas a base de las fuerzas armadas nucleares y el poderio de la unidad monolitica del ejercito y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY es el producto del unanime deseo de todos los coreanos de vivir en un ambiente pacifico sin la confrontacion ni la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la evaluacion imparcial no solo de nosotros sino tambien de todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC publico el resultado del contacto urgente, las autoridades surcoreanas lo calumniaron como \"inversion de palabra\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllas deben dejar de inmediato este proceder irreflexivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios de prensa conservadores inducen en error la opinion publica diciendo que el \"gobierno debe protestar\" al Norte por las palabras del jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC quien dijo que \"las autoridades surcoreanas juzgaron unilateralmente con hechos infundados los incidentes ocurridos parcialmente\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas palabras del jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC sobre el contacto urgente de alto nivel Norte-Sur reflejan la posicion de nuestro partido, el ejercito y el pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCriticarlas es una inmoralidad e ignorancia sobre la contraparte del dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas problematico es que las autoridades surcoreanas sueltan sin escrupulos el disparate de que no deben relajar la alerta y exceder la velocidad abrigando alguna ilusion sobre la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reunion de seguridad de Chongwadae, convocada el 27 de agosto, salieron los disparates de que hay que \"guardarse de abrigar el optimismo demasiado\", ya que las negociaciones Norte-Sur no terminaron sino comienzan por ahora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el vocero del \"Ministerio de Unificacion\" insistio en \"contenerse en la esperanza en el encuentro de familiares y parientes separados, puesto que es abstinente el exceso en las relaciones intercoreanas mientras no se cancelen las medidas del 24 de mayo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta insistencia es la expresion de las malas entranas de los que no desean la mejora y el desarrollo de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYun Pyong Se dijo absurdamente que la aprobacion de la informacion conjunta es la \"victoria del fortalecimiento de la alianza Sur de Corea-EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon tal imprudencia las autoridades surcoreanas libraron

dispararon balas y proyectiles hacia el \"blanco rojo\" establecido para la \"operacion de represalia\" frente a la \"provocacion del Norte\". De esta manera, infringieron brutalmente la dignidad de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo grave del caso es que la mandataria surcoreana instigo en el mismo terreno a los belicistas al enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dialogo no es el velo para ocultar la mala intencion de enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No habra otro acto mas cinico que insistir en la ejecucion del acuerdo tirando balas y proyectiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Son muy serios los hechos de los ultimos dias despues de publicada la informacion conjunta Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las relaciones intercoreanas no se resuelven por la sinceridad o esfuerzos de una parte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas no deben comentar con incoherencia la prevencion de los desastres de la guerra, lograda a duras penas, ni amenazar la paz rescatada tan dificilmente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, los participantes en el contacto urgente deben prestar prudencia a sus palabras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas importante en la actualidad es expresar en sus palabras y acciones el respeto o la desconfianza y hostilidad a la contraparte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas deben aceptar con maxima prudencia nuestro consejo paciente y magnanimo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El acuerdo entre ambas partes coreanas es necesario para la practica y un paso de hoy llevara diez y cien pasos de manana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La superacion de la crisis no significa la llegada de la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC observa con mas vigilancia que antes las acciones posteriores de las autoridades surcoreanas."
