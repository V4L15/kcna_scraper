Then, U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld blustered that the decision to deploy the MD network would have a deterrent effect on somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the bush bellicose forces are starting the deployment of the MD to take military sanctions and strike against the DPRK under the pretext of its alleged \"progress made in acquiring nuclear capability\" and \"missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. intends to launch military intervention against the DPRK on the plea of its \"nuclear and missile threat\" in a bid to settle the bilateral issue not by peaceful means but by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rumor about the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK persistently spread by the U.S. is no more than a cunning trick to justify its establishment of the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By perfecting the MD the U.S. seeks to contain those independent countries and big powers and hold global supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its decision to deploy MD for action should never be allowed as it is a very adventurous move that may upset the strategic balance and stability of the world and spark a new arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. moves against the DPRK further heighten the revolutionary vigilance of its army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite right that the DPRK has increased its self-defensive military capability to cope with the U.S. intensified policy to invade and stifle it with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a pipedream of the Bush bellicose group to try to contain the DPRK with strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. unleashes a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, it will not escape its destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

He said what was the most important thing in building a factory and a working site was to pay deep attention to workers and their working conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before leaving the factory, he dropped in at a room where products of the factory were on display.
