Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- South Korean organizations are strongly protesting against the authorities' measure for troop dispatch to the Iraqi war.\r\n The south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification in a statement on April 3 denounced the \"motion on the troop dispatch\" the authorities railroaded through the South Korean \"National Assembly,\" taking advantage of the U.S. Iraqi war of genocide as something not understandable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said this is an act of giving up their stand to realize peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called for foiling the U.S. nuclear racket and its moves to escalate the tensions on the Korean Peninsula through a struggle to force the U.S. to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification solidarity for implementing the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration and peace on the Korean Peninsula in a statement on the same day said that the recent decision to dispatch troops to the war is a criminal act of providing a new pretext to justify the U.S. war and it would never tolerate the authorities' irresponsible measure of supporting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a meeting titled \"day of students' action for stopping U.S. Iraqi war, repealing measure for troop dispatch and removing war danger on the Korean Peninsula\" was held in Seoul on April 4 under the co-sponsorship of the (South) Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the Youth and Student Committee against War with over 1,000 students attending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting speakers said that troop dispatch can be checked only through their direct action, calling for successfully staging a student strike against war scheduled on April 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At another meeting held in its wake speakers called on all students across South Korea to boycott lectures and turn out to streets on April 11 in protest against the barbarous war and gather in front of the city office on April 12, the \"day of global peace against war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youth and student solidarity for implementing the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration in a statement on April 4 said that it is strongly opposed to the authorities' measure for troop dispatch as it has no other meaning than helping warmonger Bush and is little short of supporting the supremacy and self-justified act of the U.S. which infringed upon the sovereignty of Iraq.    \r\n\r\n"

As this did not prove workable, the U.S. is trying to settle this issue by military means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is an issue to be settled between the DPRK and the U.S. in view of its origin, nature and essence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt to meddle in this issue would not help solve the issue but, on the contrary, make its settlement difficult and complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the 13th Summit of Non-Aligned Countries clarified the stand of the NAM, the most reasonable way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is for the DPRK and the U.S., both directly responsible for the issue, to sit face to face for negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n this is a strong rebuff to the unreasonable behavior of the u.s. which insists on \"multilateral talks\" to internationalize this issue, turning its face away from the consistent offer of the dprk to seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue through the dprk-u.s. direct talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No threat, blackmail, pressure and sanctions can ever work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never beg for peace afraid of a war, allowing the dignity and sovereignty of the nation to be infringed upon, and the DPRK will never sacrifice its supreme interests, yielding to pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should properly judge the self-defensive capability and the might of single-hearted unity in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. ignites a nuclear war despite the DPRK's efforts for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, the DPRK will mercilessly punish the aggressors with the might of the Songun policy in order to defend the sovereignty and dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the South Korean authorities of bringing the situation to the brink of a war, toeing the U.S. line, the delegate urged them to fairly approach the nuclear issue and strongly demand the U.S. to respond to the proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK, the best solution to the issue, if they truly want peace, stability and reunification on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

This has been clearly proved by the revolutionary history of the country over the past decade since the 1990s of the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatest feat he has performed in leading the Korean revolution to victory is that he enunciated the Songun idea and the Songun revolutionary line, thus providing a correct political idea and mode of a socialist state for the first time in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The practical lesson of our revolution clearly teaches that his Songun idea and policy serve as an all-powerful treasured sword to defeat any formidable enemy and victoriously advance the revolutionary cause despite any difficulties and hardships and guarantee the independent development of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the military power of the DPRK has grown steel-strong under the Songun leadership of the WPK, the reporter said that the DPRK has turned into the world's military power that no formidable enemy dares provoke. \r\n The state leadership system and the single-hearted unity of the society have grown stronger in the DPRK as required by the Songun era. As a result, its political might has significantly increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's Songun revolutionary line serves as a great revolutionary line in our era and an ever-victorious banner of the Korean revolution, he said, calling for increasing the might of the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to convert the whole country into an impregnable fortress and beef up the defence capacity in every way and direct primary efforts to boosting the defence capability of the country by giving priority to the development of the national defence industry as required by the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning to the situation, the reporter said: The U.S. and other imperialist bellicose forces are unhesitatingly engrossed in armed attacks on Iraq, a sovereign state, under the pretext of \"combating-terrorism\", thus gravely disturbing global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. staged reckless military exercises after bolstering up the aggression troops present around the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\", driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UN Security Council is abused for the U.S. hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, the U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the failure of all the efforts for dialogue and the extremely tense situation and the DPRK will have no other option but to beef up the military deterrent force to avert a war and defend the sovereignty and security of the country and the nation by mobilizing its potential to the maximum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not want war but if the U.S. ignites the war, defying its warning, its army and people under the brilliant commander who enforces the great Songun policy will never miss the chance to mercilessly wipe out the enemy and put a final end to the confrontation with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
