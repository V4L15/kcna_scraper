            "content": "Chosun Ilbo will be made to pay\r\nPyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The Chosun Ilbo newspaper in south Korea, which styles itself as a press tycoon and rightist conservative, carried a most provocative anti communist, anti-DPRK editorial on June 24, putting a period to the patience of the north.\r\n   This editorial came when the Kim Young Sam fascist warmongers' moves for new war against the north were getting more vicious than ever.\r\n   The newspaper slandered the dignified political system of the north most viciously ever in its anticommunist false propaganda.\r\n   We can never connive at their frontal attack on our system, which means the lifeblood and dignity of our people.\r\n   Ever since Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, the Chosun Ilbo newspaper has engaged itself in hindering democracy in south Korean society and national reunification and inciting mistrust and discord between fellow countrymen, as the most reactionary press medium owned by pro-Japanese traitors, extremely rightist anticommunists and their clans.\r\n   The June 24 editorial also insulted the inviolable name of Korea, though the newspaper itself is named after Korea (Chosun). This is patent proof that the newspaper is devoid of self-determination and national identity.\r\n   While hurling mud at the northern system, the newspaper tried to beautify south Korea, which is, however, on the verge of total collapse now, with all spheres of politics, the economy and culture being violated by foreign forces and national identity being no longer in sight due to the Kim Young Sam regime's treacherous open-door policy for socalled \"Internationalisation\" and \"Globalisation.\"\r\n   It is none other than the northern half of Korea that defends national dignity and interest, preserves self-determination and national identity and exalts the prestige of the motherland. That is why the south Korean people look up to the north as a beacon of hope in their effort for independent development free from U.S. domination and subjugation.\r\n   The allied forces of imperialism are resorting to political pressure, economic blockade and military threat against the DPRK, which they regard as a thorn in their flesh as it is building socialism invariably, preserving self-determination and national identity in the revolution and construction. \r\n   Though the situation has become rigorous, our Party and Government have triumphantly guided our people in their \"Arduous March\" for the nation of today and the future, reliably defending socialism and national dignity, undaunted by any formidable enemy's threat.\r\n   In this glorious struggle our people and army remain faithful to the cause of the Party, united around it in one mind and full of confidence and optimism.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, however, slandered our people, who are defending the nation's independence and dignity, far from sympathizing with their admirable struggle from the national point of view. Indeed, the daily's editorial has no shred of nationality.\r\n   Those who authored the editorial, ignoring the situation and betraying the soul of the nation, are undoubtedly traitors to the nation.\r\n   With the editorial, the daily has earned itself ill fame not only as phoney and venal newspaper but as mouthpiece of anti-communist, anti-north maniacs.\r\n   We have already made clear that there is a limit to our patience.\r\n   We, viewing the anti-communist, anti-north editorial as an offpsirng of the desperate manipulation of the Kim Young Sam regime, in the grip of the serious crisis, and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP), consider it the most grave provocation and declaration of war against the north.\r\n   Now that the south Korean puppets attacked the north through Chosun Ilbo, we have a right to take a counteraction.\r\n   Our counteraction will continue in every way until the south Korean traitors stop their breath and Chosun Ilbo ceases to exist.\r\n   We will no longer regard the daily as a press organ of south Korea but as our disgusting enemy and a group of criminals who fueled confrontation in the nation and will deliver a merciless retaliatory blow at them.\r\n   All our people and servicemen are resolved to sternly punish the south Korean puppets and Chosun Ilbo.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, a faithful servant of the \"ANSP\", will have to pay dearly for the crime and the perpetrators will meet a disgraceful doom. \r\n\r\n"

At that time, he declared an anti-Japanese war with some comrades and two pistols.\r\n   In the last days of his revolutionary life, too, he smashed the imperialists' anti-DPRK, anti-socialist acts with a revolutionary offensive and defended Korean socialism in the strong spirit he displayed in the anti-Japanese war.\r\n   His history was also a glorious history shining with strategy and tactics of braving difficulties and carrying out all the historic tasks in the revolution and construction.\r\n   He had never sidestepped difficulties and trials in the dangerous underground revolutionary struggle, armed struggle, hard-fought modern war, social revolution,natural transformation and anti-imperialist war minus shooting.\r\n   It was President Kim Il Sung who defeated the two strong imperialisms, U.S. and Japanese, with the strategy and tactics, defended the nation's dignity and sovereignty and demonstrated the spirit of heroic Korea. It was also he who made a new history of creation and construction and built the best socialism centred on the masses of the people in the world with the same strategy and tactics.\r\n   It was with infinite loyalty to the revolutionary cause and a strong sense of responsibility for the destiny of the masses that he could make a history of breaking through hardships of revolution in an indomitable spirit.\r\n   In his whole life he always considered that there would be no party and leader without the people and the homeland and if the leader was daunted by trials, the people would be in distress and if the leader sidestepped trials, the revolution and construction would fall back far.\r\n   With a matchless iron will and grit, the President triumphantly led our revolution, overcoming trials and difficulties.\r\n   The will and grit were an iron will of not bowing to any adversity, an offensive spirit of braving difficulties with the belief that there is always a way out and an indomitable spirit of not bending one's knees though one may die.\r\n   He could overcome the trials and difficulties because he guided the revolution, believing in the masses and mixing himself with them.\r\n   If one believes in the people and relies on them at all times, one shall always emerge victorious= if forsaken by them, one will always fail -- this is the creed and motto he maintained always leading the revolution. \r\n\r\n"

In the course of his journeys there were lanes, a road to the front under the shower of bullets and shells, and muddy roads under rain and snow.
