Korea called for\r\n  Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- 53 years have passed since the U.S. military occupation of South Korea.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today runs a commentator's article in this regard.\r\n   The daily says:\r\n   High-raking officials of the U.S. military are crying for its forces' permanent presence in South Korea and northeast Asia. Their utterances are a brigandish rigmarole ridiculous in view of the requirements of the present times and an extension of their cold war policy.\r\n   The U.S. militarily occupied South Korea with the Japanese imperialist defeat as an occasion to divide Korea into two parts. They unleashed a Korean War in a bid to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its cradle and colonise the whole Korea.\r\n   The United States should have drawn a serious lesson from its defeat in the Korean War, abandoned its wild ambition for aggression on Korea and pulled its forces out of South Korea. It, however,  wantonly violated and destroyed the Korean Armistice Agreement on purpose after the cease-fire and turned South Korea into a military base for a war for aggression on Korea and Asia as well as a nuclear forward base, the largest in the far east.\r\n   It has so far justified the military occupation of South Korea with the logic of the Cold War. The USSR, its rival in the period of the Cold War, collapsed and the former and Present allies of the DPRK have normalised their relations with South Korea. \r\n   The U.S. loud-mouthed logic of the Cold War--\"deterrence to southward invasion\"--has not gone down with anyone any longer. This shows that the \"guarantee for security\"\" advertised by the U.S. in a bid to justify its military presence in South Korea and its surrounding areas is nothing but a sophism.\r\n   The U.S., however, seeks the permanent presence of its forces in South Korea and east Asia because of its dominationist design.\r\n   It intends to stifle the DPRK and socialism by forces of arms. Its attempt to destroy our red flag  by  military strength is a daydream.\r\n   If the enemies dare to provoke another Korean war, our revolutionary armed forces will first annihilate the U.S. aggression forces and remove the rootcause of aggression and war from the Korean peninsula.\r\n   It is high time for the U.S. to withdraw its forces from South Korea without losing its face.\r\n   The U.S. withdrawal of its forces from South Korea will be the best choice for  the sake of Korea, Asia and the world as well as for the U.S. people. \r\n\r\n"
