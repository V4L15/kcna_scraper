            "content": "DPRK Government Will Strive for Peace \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Pak Ui Chun, who is leading a DPRK delegation to the ministerial meeting of the 14th ASEAN regional forum, said at the meeting that the DPRK government will continue to closely cooperate with the member states of the forum including ASEAN countries for the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the region in the idea of its external policy for independence, peace and friendship in the future, too. It is indispensable for the ASEAN regional forum to thoroughly keep the essential principles of respect of sovereignty, non-interference in other's internal affairs, peaceful co-existence and ban on the use of force in order to fulfill its mission as a unique forum for political dialogue in the region, Pak said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the main instable factors present in Asia is none other than Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is duty-bound to redress its unprecedented past crimes by making due apology and compensation as it is a war criminal state which committed hideous crimes against humanity such as killing a great number of people and reducing hundreds of thousands of women into sexual slaves after invading Asia in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the present Japanese authorities, not content with concealing and beautifying the past crimes, made no scruple of distorting the history, challenging the international community. This arouses resentment and vigilance against Japan among Asian countries which had undergone its invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Especially, the frantic suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) rampant in every part of Japan is a grave provocation against the DPRK and an act of infringing upon its sovereignty, which no preceding Japanese government dared to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues to be keen on its crackdown upon Chongryon, the DPRK can not but warn Japan that it would bring about a more serious political crisis than the financial sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the behests of President Kim Il Sung and it is the invariable stand of the DPRK government to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiation. The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is, in essence, the issue directly connected with the end of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and removal of nuclear threat to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the adoption of the Feb. 13 agreement, Pak reaffirmed the DPRK government's firm will to honor its commitments under the agreement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He praised the province for having built such a big hospital by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be the best sanitary environment and convenience for the hospital as it is the most important institution related to the precious lives and health of the people but some sections do not meet these requirements, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need for the hospital to abide by the principle of isolating itself from outside and enforcing the section segregation inside it, he said that to this end, it is necessary to disallow outsiders' disorderly access to the hospital and strictly forbid people except the staff to enter the sections requiring germ-free condition including test rooms inside the hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave instructions even on settling detailed problems arising in ensuring scientific accuracy in medical treatment and creating good environment around the hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the mistake committed in the construction of the hospital was attributable to the lack of responsibility for job and serve-the-people spirit on the part of those who designed the hospital without taking the function and nature of the construction object into consideration and those who supervised it, he urged all the officials to think a lot of their work and steadily improve their technical and professional qualifications to be genuine servants for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for updating the North Hamgyong Provincial People's Hospital as intended by President Kim Il Sung so that the people in the province may fully benefit from the system of free medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Hong Sok Hyong, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee and Pak Nam Gi, department director of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
