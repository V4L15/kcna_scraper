Herein lies the gravity of the development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The real aim sought by the present Japanese government in its move to fully exercise the right to collective self-defense is to realize the ambition to turn Japan into a military giant with the backing of the U.S. and reinvade Asian countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan stages military actions in the northeast Asian region together with the U.S., they will deteriorate the regional situation. Japan's Self-Defense Forces are capable of advancing not only into Northeast Asia but into the Asia-Pacific region and fighting a war without difficulty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is emerging new aggressor forces arousing caution and concern of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese government follows in the footsteps of the past aggressors, it will lead Japan to a total ruin."

The DPRK was founded on September 9, 1948 by the unanimous will of the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung, from the initial stage of nation-building, oriented his work to carving out a new road suited to the specific condition of the country, building of socialism guided by the Juche idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By applying the principle of independence in politics, self-support in the economy and self-reliance in national defence, the DPRK turned into a political and military power strong in the sense of independence, while foiling all the moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Marshal Kim Jong Un set it as the principal task of the Workers' Party of Korea to build an economic power and improve the people's living standard and is wisely leading it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has set many goals for the improvement of people's material and cultural life including the construction of the Masik Pass Ski Resort and is successfully carrying them out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement warmly congratulated the Korean people greeting the 65th anniversary of the DPRK, extending full support and solidarity to their just cause."
