The report elaborated on the background against which the issue of A-bomb victims surfaced in the DPRK, the scope of the damage done to them and the attitude and stand of the Japanese government toward it.\r\n The report said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States dropped A-bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan on August 6 and 9, 1945, killing or wounding about 700,000 residents there. These disasters took the lives of about 159,000 persons in Hiroshima and about 73,000 persons in Nagasaki.\r\n Among the A-bombs victims were foreigners, most of them were Koreans.\r\n The south Korean \"Association of A-bomb Victims\" estimated that the total number of Korean A-bomb victims in those days was about 70,000 and about 40,000 of them were killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The A-bomb victims now residing in the DPRK are those who returned home after the defeat of Japanese imperialism or those who returned to the DPRK according to the step for realizing repatriation of Korean nationals in Japan which had been implemented since the end of 1959 and their descendants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As Japan abandoned claims to compensation for damage done by allied nations in the \"San Francisco Peace Treaty\" in September 1951, the Japanese government is internationally obliged to compensate A-bomb victims for damage done by the U.S. dropping of A-bombs, taking the place of the assailant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government examined its A-bomb victims once every ten years from 1965 and conducted such positive medical service as paying allowance for their health.\r\n It was compelled to give financial assistance to many A-bomb victims in south Korea several times, though discriminative, by the repeated protest and criticism from them and public circles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A-bomb victims were reported to live in at least 30 countries including the north and the south of Korea, China, the U.S., Canada and Brazil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese government has neither apologized to the A-bomb victims in the DPRK nor taken any steps to assist them under the pretext of the absence of diplomatic ties between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should admit due responsibility for having spurned the issue of A-bomb victims of the DPRK and honestly apologize and compensate all of them. \r\n The A-bomb victims in the DPRK are those who have not received \"A bomb-victim health note-book\" or repatriated to the DPRK after refusing to receive them of their own accord and their descendents. They are victims of the Japanese government's hostile policy toward the DPRK and national discrimination policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should own the responsibility for having sidestepped the above-said issue for the last more than 60 years and honestly compensate A-bomb victims in the DPRK and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should take an immediate practical step to settle the issue of A-bomb victims in the DPRK by offering equipment or financial assistance needed for medical treatment as early as possible as a separate step from its state compensation so that they may receive necessary aid from the humanitarian point of view.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the stirring reality possible only in the DPRK which enjoys the wise leadership of the great Party and has the most revolutionary and militant working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism will be ever-victorious in the future too, thanks to the revolutionary working class and other people who regard socialism as their life and soul. \r\n All the workers and other people should work harder to glorify the present Songun era as an era of fresh victory and prosperity under Korean-style socialism, carrying forward the proud tradition in which they took the lead in victoriously advancing the socialist cause under the leadership of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. \r\n It is the invariable stand and will of the Party and people of the DPRK to boost solidarity with the world revolutionary people in their struggle for independence against imperialism and for socialism The working class and people of the DPRK will positively support and encourage the international working class and progressives in their struggle against aggression and war, domination and subjugation and for the building of an independent and friendly new world and dynamically push forward the victorious advance of the socialist cause shoulder to shoulder with them in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on April 30 denouncing the United States  for its sinister moves to revive a pro-U.S. conservative \"government\" in south Korea.\r\n The U.S. separately invited \"presidential candidates\" of the south Korean \"Grand National Party\" to the U.S. in February and March, instigating it to achieve the unity of pro-U.S. conservative forces. It, at the same time, encouraged it to rally conservative forces and usurp power through the next presidential election, labeling the present south Korean \"government\" a \"pro-north left-wing government\", the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. even instigated them to rally the conservative forces to seize the next-term \"government\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, hand-raised lackeys of the U.S. Ri Hoe Chang, former representative of the GNP, and Kim Yong Sam slandered the present south Korean \"government\" an \"unidentified government\" dominated by \"pro-north left-wing\" forces. They even went the lengths of crying out for forming a big solidarity front of conservatives\" to put an end to the left-wing forces' regime and return to power at any cost. These outbursts were also attributable to the U.S. instigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks through this is to prevent the appearance of democratic politics, progressive politics, the desire for which has become a trend in south Korea, retain its grip on south Korea as its colony and bring the inter-Korean relations which are favorably developing in the June 15 era back to those in the era of confrontation and provoke the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gone are the days when there existed the master-servant relations between the U.S. and south Korea, the times when the U.S. could dictate the latter everything, interfering in its politics. \r\n Prevailing in south Korea at present is not the \"U.S.-style\" but the strong trend of independence, national cooperation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish dream for the U.S. to try to revive the pro-U.S. conservative regime, not away from its anachronistic bad habit, failing to face up to the reality of south Korea. This will only touch off stronger resistance against the U.S. among the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to immediately stop foolishly instigating the south Korean pro-U.S. conservatives to return to power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
