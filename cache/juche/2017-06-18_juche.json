            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Condemns U.S. for Mugging of Diplomatic Package of DPRK Delegation\r\n Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave the following answer to the question raised by the KCNA on Sunday as regards the incident in which a diplomatic package of the delegation of the DPRK was seized in New York:\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 16, the delegation of the DPRK which was on its way home after attending the Conference of States Parties to the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities was literally mugged at the John F. Kennedy International Airport by the U.S. authorities that forcibly took away a diplomatic package from the delegation by an illegal and heinous act of provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the airport, a group of more than 20 including those who claimed to be from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and the police officers made a violent assault like gangsters to take away the diplomatic package from the DPRK diplomats who were in possession of a valid diplomatic courier certificate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the diplomats vigorously resisted, they grabbed the diplomatic package using physical violence and made off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that the gang of more than 20 was on standby waiting for the delegation in front of the boarding gate of the specific flight before making the assault leaves no doubt that this was a planned and organized provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK regards this mugging by the U.S. as an intolerable act of infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and a malicious provocation, and strongly condemns it in the name of the government of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This mugging act of the U.S. serves as a graphic account telling the world how reckless and despicable the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK has become.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should reflect on its reckless act and be fully aware of the grave consequences to follow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Diplomats of a sovereign state are being robbed of a diplomatic package in the middle of New York where the headquarters of the United Nations is located and that serves as the venue for international meetings including the United Nations General Assembly. This clearly shows that the U.S. is a felonious and lawless gangster state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community needs to seriously reconsider whether or not New York, where such an outrageous mugging is rampant, is fit to serve as the venue for international meetings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. owes the DPRK a good explanation of its act of infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and an official apology on behalf of the U.S. government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. fails to give its due response to our demand which is all too reasonable and fair enough, it will be totally responsible for all the consequences to be entailed."

It is openly bulldozing and urging the south Korean authorities into deploying THAAD.\n\t\t\t\t\t Every day high-ranking politicians of the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Defense Department and Congress are \"expressing their attitudes\" before media, forcing the deployment of THAAD. On June 8, Trump who has now faced the crisis of impeachment said before the chiefs of diplomacy and security that \"THAAD is very important for the U.S. government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, high-ranking persons concerned such as the under-secretary of the U.S. Department of State flew into south Korea, urging \"earlier deployment\" of THAAD, and claiming that the \"delayed deployment of THAAD can break the south Korea-U.S. alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea in a statement Sunday said this is a clear revelation of the brigandish nature of the U.S. which regards south Korea as a mere colony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities speak for candlelight demonstrators, they should come to their senses, though belatedly, and follow the south Koreans' demand for the withdrawal of THAAD deployment, not accepting the U.S. master's demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities allow THAAD deployment, swimming against the trend of the times, they would meet the same miserable fate as the Park Geun Hye group of traitors which met ruin for going wild for the THAAD deployment and would be deserted and rejected by history and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brigandish act of going roughshod while pressing for the THAAD deployment for aggression can never be tolerated."
