            "content": "Researcher of Disarmament and Peace Institute of DPRK Foreign Ministry on Deserved Treatment Sustained by S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The full text of \"Deserved Treatment\" written by Ri Song Il, a researcher of the Disarmament and Peace Institute of the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK, Thursday reads as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently lamentation deploring their own plight is being heard from the puppet south Korean group occasioned by U.S. Secretary of State Tillerson's visit to Japan, south Korea and China, drawing the attention of media across the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choongang Ilbo of south Korea in an article expressed disappointment as the state secretary praised Japan as the \"most important ally\" while calling south Korea just an \"important partner\" during his recent tour. The paper commented it as the Trump administration's acknowledgment of the level of the U.S.-south Korea alliance lower than the U.S-Japan alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In Japan the secretary expressed his stand at a press conference after full exchange of views with the Japanese foreign minister, while in south Korea he hastily held a press conference clarifying the U.S. stand before having a talk with the puppet foreign minister. This meant total negligence of south Korea's view, the paper deplored, adding that the secretary did not include dinner in schedule only in south Korea even though he had dinner schedules with diplomatic bosses in China and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Maeil Economy, reporting about the non-reference of THAAD by the U.S. state secretary during his meeting with the Chinese foreign minister, said expectation that the U.S. would exercise its influence on China, which is putting pressure on south Korea over THAAD deployment, crumbled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media of various countries, too, said south Korea is greatly disappointed by the U.S. state secretary's recent visit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maltreatment and contempt sustained by the south Korean regime this time are something quite deserved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason that the south Korean authorities have become like an empty Kimchi pot is attributable to their acting as a puppet at the beck and call of the U.S. and according to divination signs given by shaman Choe Sun Sil without their own clear standpoint and \"policy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park Geun Hye resorted to the \"policy for putting pressure on the north\" while pursuing the policy of \"unification of social systems\" with hope pinned on the \"story of the north's collapse\". And she pressed for the deployment of THAAD, a dangerous system which will bring instability and disaster to the Korean peninsula and the region, despite unanimous rejection and denunciation at home and abroad. This is well known to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing can change the relations between the master and stooge no matter how desperately the south Korean regime may go hell-bent on escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen while acting as a shock brigade in executing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. Masters are masters and stooges are stooges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The remarks of the U.S. state secretary during his recent tour made the world people clearly see the relations between the master and stooge and how the U.S., whom the south Korean puppet regime look up to as God, treat south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the stooge is needed, it is shielded and used but when it is considered to be useless, it is disregarded. This is American pragmatism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities can never get rid of the deplorable fate of stooge as long as they escalate confrontation with the fellow countrymen, taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, not properly seeing who is the enemy of reunification and principal enemy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever deals with the south Korean puppet authorities, who were punished by their own people and forsaken even by their master for acting as a puppet of others and for going reckless, being unaware of where they stand, will only face shame and disgrace."
