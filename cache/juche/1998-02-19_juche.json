            "content": "Negotiations with political parties and organisations in S. Korea urged\r\n  Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- A joint meeting of the political parties and organisations in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held in Pyongyang on February 18 adopted a letter to South Korean political parties and organisations. \r\n   The letter pointed out that the north and the south should take the road of independence and unity together, taking as the steadfast guidelines the three charters of national reunification which were set out in \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification,\" a work published by General Kim Jong Il last year.\r\n   The key to the solution in taking this road is not the change of regime in South Korea but the switchover in policy and how political parties and organisations motivate it, the letter said. \r\n   It continued:\r\n   First, South Korea should express its willingness to respect the three principles of national reunification -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- and reject domination by outsiders and dependence upon them and shape the destiny of the nation independently in line with this idea.\r\n   The Korean question must be solved on the principle of the Juche character and the national character and the country's reunification must be realised independently by the Korean nation itself, not by outsiders.\r\n   South Korea must decisively reject the \"international cooperation\" antagonizing the fellow countrymen in the north.\r\n   The north and the south must jointly cope with the domination and interference by outsiders.\r\n   We strongly urge the political parties, organisations and personages from all walks of life in South Korea to value the dignity of the nation and take the road of national independence in the true spirit of independence.\r\n   Second, South Korea must make a bold decision to replace its wrong anti-north confrontation policy with a pro-north reconciliation policy.\r\n   Institutional devices obstructing pro-north reconciliation must be removed at an early date.\r\n   We strongly demand that, today when the military fascist dictatorship collapsed and the \"civilian\"-veiled fascist dictatorship has come to an end, the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning,\" which have obstructed the reunification of the country and ruthlessly killed a large number of pro-reunification, patriotic-minded people over the past 50 years, be eliminated unconditionally.\r\n   At the same time, an immediate end must be put to the large-scale joint military exercises being staged against the DPRK, with uptodate military hardware introduced from abroad and such things as arms race must be terminated.\r\n   Third, the north and the south, in order to open a way out for the nation together,  must actively promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and have the boldness to collaborate and unite among the fellow countrymen.\r\n   The north and the south must respect each other's idea, system and religious belief, accept without any prejudice what is beneficial to each other for the reunification of the country and join hands and unite with each other.\r\n   We are convinced that \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country,\" a valuable patriotic heritage of the respected President Kim Il Sung, who devoted his whole life to achieving great national unity, constitutes a common foundation of the nation in firmly uniting the entire fellow countrymen as one. We earnestly call upon all the political parties and organisations in South Korea to take the same step with us in realising it.\r\n   Fourth, we, considering that dialogue and negotiations are essential for solving the question of the country's reunification independently and peacefully, reclarify we have always flung doors open for wide-range dialogue.\r\n   The political parties and organisations in the north and the south are obliged to play a leading role in creating an atmosphere of dialogue and negotiations.\r\n   We solemnly declare that we are ready to hold dialogue and negotiations with any South Korean people including political parties and organisations that truly want to open a way out for the nation together on the principle of national independence and great unity.\r\n   The letter expressed the expectation that the political parties and organisations in South Korea would positively respond to our patriotic calls.    \r\n \r\n"

And large modern machine factories including the Rakwon Oxygen Plant Works under the Rakwon Machine Complex were newly built.\r\n   Local products include a 10,000-ton press, a 18,000 cubic meter oxygen plant, a 125,000 kva hydroelectric generator, 50,000 kva thermal turbines, 210-ton boilers, 5,450 hp compressors, large ships, large trucks, numerical control machine tools and eight-axle electric locomotives.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung, considering the development of the machine industry the core of heavy industry and the foundations of technological progress, indicated long ago the orientation and way for building machine industry in each period and stage of the developing revolution.\r\n   He unfolded a grand design for the development of the machine industry even in the grim period of the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-july 1953) and recalled technicians from the front to lay the foundations of the machine industry.\r\n   After the war he put forward the slogan \"iron and the machine are the king of industry\" and gave energetic guidance to the founding of modern machine industry and development.\r\n   He visited the Huichon General Machine Tool Plant (the then Huichon Machine Tool Factory) in February, Juche 60 (1971) and kindled the torch of new technical innovation. \r\n   He also initiated the machine-tool-begets-machine-tool movement twice and opened a turning point in improving the technique and equipment of the national economy.\r\n   The machine industry of Korea started from scratch after its liberation (August 1945) and underwent a complete change under his wise guidance.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n  Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities passed \"bills\" on the layoff allowing system and labour exchange through the \"National Assembly.\"\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   With the passage of the bills, the system of allowing companies to lay off workers has been legalised and could be introduced in all industrial sectors of South Korea.\r\n   This is an unpardonable challenge to South Korean working people including workers.\r\n   It is only too natural that South Korean workers are strongly opposed to legalising the lay-off allowing system.\r\n   This fascist system grants evil entrepreneurs unlimited rights to freely lay off workers en masse under the pretext of averting deficits.\r\n   It cannot go unnoticed that the South Korean authorities rectified and erased out at random the points of the \"agreement of the labour-management-government committee\" on admitting the union membership of unemployed people and ensuring reemployment of jobless workers.\r\n   This shows that the South Korean authorities are not in the least interested in the living condition of the working people but are engrossed only in escaping from the present economic crisis by sacrificing them.    \r\n\r\n"
