Now it is busy with its moves to develop and deploy the missile defence system (MD) as a prerequisite to realizing its attempt at a preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It decided to deploy 20 interceptor missiles in Alaska and two more of them in California by 2007 under the pretext of countering \"missile attack\" from the DPRK.\r\n This cannot be interpreted otherwise than a serious development as the true objective of its moves to bolster MD is to neutralize the defence capability of the DPRK and mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it without much difficulty.\r\n The DPRK will increase its war deterrent in every way to foil the U.S. hostile policy toward it and Washington's escalated moves to provoke a new war.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on:\r\n The U.S. has neither right nor face to talk about human rights.\r\n It is a typical inhuman society where people are denied elementary right to existence and human rights are wantonly violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has blatantly abused human rights not only in the international arena but at home. The U.S. imperialists invaded and occupied Iraq in a brigandish manner defying the UN and the world public protest, cruelly killing innocent Iraqis. They made no scruple of using even chemical weapons in Iraq to burn many civilians including children and women to death in gross violation of international law and conventions.\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. claims to be a \"defender of human rights\" and a \"human rights judge\", shamelessly paying lip-service to human rights. This is an insult to the genuine human rights and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"human rights issue\" is nothing but a political fiction aimed at intensifying its interference in the internal affairs of other countries and its operations to overthrow their governments and stifle them. The \"human rights\" racket launched by the U.S. against the DPRK on the basis of the above-said fiction would get it nowhere. \r\n The U.S. would be well advised to immediately halt the politically-motivated \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when all Koreans unite close as one under the banner of great national unity, will they prove to be a mighty driving force for reunification and is it possible to shatter every move of the separatist forces at home and abroad against reunification and pave a wide avenue for accomplishing the cause of reunification as early as possible. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n In order to increase the driving force for reunification all Koreans should come out as one in the movement for independent reunification under the banner of patriotism irrespective of ideology and social system, the article notes, and goes on:\r\n It is necessary to strengthen the driving force for reunification in every way through a practical struggle for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should keep pace with one another and take joint actions in the struggle for Korea's reunification in order to frustrate the evermore undisguised moves of the enemies against reunification. Compatriots from all walks of life should glorify the June 15 era of reunification through their many-sided contacts, wide-ranging discussion on the reunification issue and solidarity and alliance and bind the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad hand and foot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity should be achieved in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All members of the nation should courageously join the ranks of forces standing for great national unity, bearing in mind that increasing the driving force for reunification under the banner of the declaration guarantees national reunification. Under no circumstances partisan, class and individual interests can be more important than the cause of great national unity and the cause of national reunification.\r\n Now that the separatist forces at home and abroad have gone to extremes in their moves, whoever is concerned about the destiny of the country and the nation and truly wishes national reunification should unite close in thinking and purpose in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and turn out in the movement for great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have now gone to extremes.\r\n The recent attack on a Shiite mosque has escalated tension among factions and increased social unrest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Armed men strut about the streets and the number of victims of clashes between Shiites and Sunnites reaches 30 on a daily average, reminiscent of a civil war.\r\n The unceasing clashes among nationalities and factions have created the imminent danger of a civil war that would engulf Iraq, to say nothing of Baghdad.\r\n Violence among factions in Iraq is an inevitable product of the war of aggression launched by the U.S. and its interference in the internal affairs of the country.\r\n The U.S. suppression and massacre of civilians and its wrong policy of inciting confrontation among factions are reducing Iraq to a land where an evil cycle of terrorism and retaliation and extreme chaos and disorder prevail and where freedom and democracy are crudely violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither freedom nor democracy is guaranteed and people are at feud although they live in the same country. This is the stark reality of Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if the intensified violence among factions leads to a civil war in Iraq, it will spread like a strong earthquake affecting the whole Mid-east.\r\n The U.S. war of aggression of Iraq brought violence, social chaos and tragedy to the country, not peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, former U.S. President Carter, commenting on the matter, said that the Iraqi war launched by the U.S. was a war of injustice that strangled democracy and increased violence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. invaded a sovereign state in March 2003 under an absurd pretext invented by it to meet its political and economic purposes defying the United Nations and in gross violation of international law. It was an unpardonable crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is hatching despicable plots to drive a wedge among factions in Iraq and escalate violence there in a bid to plunge the whole country into a civil war of genocide.\r\n This is little short of doubling or trebling its war crimes committed against the Iraqis and other people of the world desirous of global peace and stability.\r\n It is quite natural that the world public is becoming increasingly assertive that the U.S. president and war fanatics should be brought to an international tribunal so that they may be judged as war criminals and forced to pay for the catastrophic aftermath of the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the chief executive and the defense secretary of the U.S. claim that the Iraqi people are at the moment of choice and media are hyping up violence among religious forces. This is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wars waged by the U.S. in different parts of the world can never be interpreted as just wars as injustice can not prevail over justice and a lie can never turn out to be truth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
