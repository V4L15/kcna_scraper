This shows he evidently plays the role of servant for the U.S.\r\n   At the time of \"nuclear inspection\" campaign in the early 1990s, the dishonest people of the IAEA made hostile activities against the DPRK without impartiality and neutrality at the instigation of the U.S. and other western forces who tried to isolate and stifle the DPRK. The DPRK gave warning message against those activities more than once and finally adopted a resolute measure of withdrawing from the non-proliferation treaty because the NPT and the IAEA were used for sinister political purposes.\r\n   Today the IAEA, far from drawing a lesson from the past, is fanning the U.S. moves for stifling the DPRK militarily with outcries for \"inspection.\" the DPRK will certainly make the dishonest people of the IAEA pay for their acts.\r\n   They must act with discretion, mindful that they will suffer more disgrace under the eyes of the international community if they continue to act as a servant for \"great powers.\" \r\n\r\n"

This is entirely owing to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea and new war preparations.\r\n   Never have they responded to our fair peace overtures. On the contrary, they have worked hard to unleash a new war of aggression, a nuclear war, on the Korean peninsula, pursuing the \"policy of strength\" behind the facade of \"peace.\"\r\n   Activities are being made for all-out war under the \"Operation Plan 5027,\" the plan of a second Korean war of aggression.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists' scheme for invasion of the DPRK has gone beyond the danger line.
