My son graduated from Pyongyang University of Music and Dance and became a teacher there. He also highly appreciated my younger brother. Thinking of what I was doing in south Korea, far from repaying the benevolence shown by the leader, it seemed my heart would break apart. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Regretting my hesitation, I renewed my determination to come to the DPRK at any cost even though I lose my life on the way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December last year, news of Kim Jong Il's untimely passing away on a train while devoting himself to the welfare of our people came like a thunderbolt from the blue. I could not but burst out sobbing looking up to the sky above the motherland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I was going to come back to his embrace and beg pardon on my knees. I made up my mind to come to the DPRK at the cost of my life and be buried in the homeland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t My whole soul was directed to the DPRK and I had nothing to fear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I shook off the surveillance of agents of the puppet Intelligence Service and departed the cursed south Korean land and came back to the DPRK, motherland."

It has formed a triangular military alliance with south Korea and Japan, tightening military pressure upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, it staged a firing drill with the DPRK flag as the target under the scenario to stifle the DPRK with all military means including nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural exercise of the right to self-defence for the DPRK to counter the U.S. persistent anti-DPRK policy and intensified military pressure with its increased nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, to replace the AA with a peace accord is a prerequisite to peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula."

He said that Japan needs to acquire the capability to attack enemy bases to prevent ballistic missile \"attack\" by other countries. He also said that to attack enemy bases comes within the scope of \"self-defense\" in the light of international law and the interpretation of the Japan Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These reckless remarks which his predecessors dared not to let loose were made without hesitation by a guy who was a mere scholar.

Korean \"Government's\" Moves to Conclude GSOMIA with Japan \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- There is a political storm in south Korea in the wake of the action taken to put off the conclusion of the General Security of Military Information Agreement (GSOMIA) with Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean \"government's\" attempt to clinch the signing of GSOMIA in secret without passing through the \"National Assembly\" went bust. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was fully disclosed that this treachery was sponsored by Chongwadae (presidential office). The Defense Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of south Korea had got aboard the same boat with Chongwadae. But, now they are busy shifting the responsibility for this onto one another. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group tried to conclude an agreement for military alliance with Japan. However, it could not but step back for fear of punishment by history and nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the controversial agreement would mean the first agreement for military cooperation ever to be signed with Japan since the end of World War II. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Political, press and social circles in south Korea are strongly protesting against the Lee group's unhesitant military nexus with Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is persistently shunning sincere apology and reparation for its past thrice-cursed crimes committed against the Korean nation. It is watching for a chance of aggression, raising a claim to Tok Islets, an open disclosure of its wild ambition for staging a comeback to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the agreement with Japan means paving a way for the Japanese militarist forces' reinvasion of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why the preceding ruling quarters of south Korea dared not attempt to conclude any military agreement with Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Lee Myung Bak attempted to conclude the agreement in great haste by setting in motion his mandarins of Chongwadae. This tells that he is the worst traitor putting the \"five traitors of 1905\" into the shade. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is behind Lee's operation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. has egged the Lee group on to sign a military agreement with Japan in real earnest for several years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has considered the military nexus between the U.S. and south Korea along with military ties between the U.S. and Japan and between Japan and south Korea as a key link in the chain efforts to round off the tri-angular military alliance. Hence, the U.S. has so far pressurized south Korea to sign the agreement with Japan as early as possible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that the U.S. and south Korea held the two-plus-two ministerial security talks on June 14 at which they released a joint statement on the above-said military alliance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. main goal is to complete the formation of the tri-angular military alliance in a bid to carry out its strategy for dominating the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason why sharing information about the DPRK is the main contents of the agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The attempt for signing GSOMIA fully lays bare the true aim of the Lee group to do harm to fellow countrymen and realize its scenario for invading the north in reliance upon outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak has already been sentenced to death as far as his fate as a politician is concerned. Yet, he is committing such high treason as making Koreans fall victim to outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors is the root cause of bringing disasters to the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans should never allow the moves to conclude GSOMIA with Japan but eradicate the root cause of their misfortune in good time."
