No wonder, Lee, the worst traitor, and Park, an offspring of dictatorship and conservative forces, were closeted together.\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not hard to guess what they discussed at this huddle except for ways for the conservative forces' stay in power as they became partners just for political reasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They, feeling guilty conscience, let a person concerned of Chongwadae loose rhetoric that they \"discussed mainly outstanding issues related to people's living including economy and public peace rather than political matters.\" This is nothing but a silly talk. It is clear from the fact that the huddle was requested by Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As she kicked off her \"presidential election\" campaign with political burlesques under such mottos as \"Serve in a war as a commoner\" and \"Form a new party\", she must have used the recent huddle as an occasion for advertising her feats and colluding with Lee for a large alliance of conservative forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, Park toured various parts of south Korea under the spurious signboard of \"large integration of people\" after being selected as a \"presidential\" candidate from the \"Saenuri Party\" in August. But her \"campaign for concord\" regardless of \"idea, stratum, region, generation, industrialization and democratization\" was coolly treated and rebuffed by people of various social standings wherever she went for being a campaign of conservative for the revival of dictatorship against democracy and progress. It invited accusation and ridicule even from the ruling party and conservative forces due to Park's stand on the \"yusin\" dictatorship and the present one-person dictatorial system and hideous scandals of her confidants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was \"supported and welcomed\" only by the descendants of such thrice-cursed traitors as Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-Hee and ultra-right conservatives including human scum Kim Young Sam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For instance, a son of Kim Young Sam uttered words of \"strong support\" and clarified his will to cooperate with her, saying \"he was pleased to hear her advocate a large alliance of conservatives\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, Park Geun Hye's on-going \"presidential election\" campaign and her recent visit to Chongwadae for huddle with Lee are aimed to achieve the aims of the conservative forces, to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lee Myung Bak who is staking his fate on the conservative forces after his retirement from office must feel very grateful for her gesture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The developments go to prove that \"the large integration of people\" touted by Park is aimed at seeking the dictatorial regime's stay in power through the large alliance of conservative forces. This gives the lie to Park's hypocritical talk about \"keeping a distance from the Lee regime\" and \"revamping\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was around this time two years ago that Lee praised Park, uttering: \"We are in the single-minded relationship which does not require any explanation.\" And Park on her part proposed a toast to the \"success of the Lee regime\", saying \"reemergence of power depends on the success of the present regime\". Recollecting all this makes it clear what Park will seek in the days ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean people from all walks life do not wish to see the repetition of the five years of nightmare, they should not be taken in by the chicanery of Lee and the clan of the \"Saenuri Party\" but make a clean sweep of the conservative group including the descendants of \"yusin\"."

EA-18G Growler electronic warfare plane of the U.S. Navy was transferred to the Misawa base from the U.S. mainland. It was reported that the plane is capable of jamming enemies' waves to disturb their radar network. As a result, the true objective of the Misawa base is being brought into bolder relief as a base for espionage and plot-breeding operations whose basic mission is to monitor the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is contemplating building high performance radars in two other places for detecting ballistic missiles and reinforcing and deploying the U.S. Marines in Okinawa, Japan.

Its scenario is to lay siege to big powers of the Eurasian continent and build missile shields of various classes in a bid to mount missile attacks from all sides in \"contingency.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its missile threat is wrecking the world peace and security and sparking off discord and military contradiction among countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The MD should be checked at once."
