At that time communist and workers' parties of some countries abandoned their faith in socialism as it collapsed in East European countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation, leader Kim Jong Il had conducted his energetic ideo-theoretical activities to arouse the world revolutionary parties to the struggle for defending and advancing the socialist cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He authored such celebrated works as \"The Historical Lesson in Building Socialism and the General Line of Our Party\", \"On the Fundamentals of Revolutionary Party Building\" and \"Abuses of Socialism Are Intolerable\" in the early 1990s to point out why socialism collapsed in some countries, review the historical lessons in building socialism and indicate the path of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His work \"Socialism Is a Science\", published on November 1, 1994, threw the world into a great excitement.
