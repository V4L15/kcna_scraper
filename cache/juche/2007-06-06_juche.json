In another development, it is increasing the combat capability of its forces while reinforcing its special troops in south Korea, Japan and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says that such movements as the joint development of MD and the forward deployment of task forces are a revelation of the U.S. hegemonic and strong-arm policy to hold an upper-hand of strength in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world and contain its strategic enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are prompted by its strategic scheme to realize its ambition for preemptive attack based on an unchallenged upper-hand of strength, the paper notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of security posture touted by the U.S. is aimed to bolster armed forces and hold military supremacy in a bid to attain upper-hand of strength worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the U.S. theory of \"upper-hand of strength\" is its attempt to mount a preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and security have been wrecked and the danger of war increased in different regions of the world by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries of the world are now directing big efforts into increasing their military capability for self-defense, remaining highly vigilant against the U.S. arms buildup and military policy of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such developments are seriously affecting the global peace and the development of international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. cover up its criminal nature as a wrecker of peace and security and a mastermind of escalating the tension.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica doctrina de \"superioridad de fuerzas\" de EE.UU.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 5 de junio (ATCC) -- Como ya trascendidos, Estados Unidos impulsa la investigacion conjunta para implantar el Sistema Antimisiles en colaboracion trilateral con Japon y Australia. Por otra parte, incrementa la combatividad de sus efectivos en la region de Asia-Pacifico, inclusive el Sur de Corea y Japon, al emplazar adicionalmente ahi a las tropas especiales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun difundio este martes un comentario individual que senala en particular: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El desarrollo conjunto del Sistema Antimisiles, el emplazamiento en las zonas avanzadas de las fuerzas moviles para el ataque y otras maniobras del imperio parten de su politica hegemonica y despotica de resistir a los \"rivales estrategicos\" al tomar la \"superioridad de las fuerzas\" en el ambito mundial, en particular, en la region de Asia y el Pacifico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A la larga, ese intento estrategico consiste en satisfacer su ambicion de atacar preventivamente a otros paises aprovechando la absoluta \"superioridad de las fuerzas\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por tal razon, el \"establecimiento de la disposicion para la seguridad\", de que habla tanto EE.UU., es en su esencia el lema de aumento armamentista y de hegemonia militar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy dia, por culpa del imperio, se quiebran la paz y la seguridad en varias regiones del mundo y se acrecienta el peligro de guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Muy alertos ante el aumento armamentista y la agresiva politica militar de EE.UU., numerosos paises del orbe prestan mucha atencion al fortalecimiento de sus fuerzas armadas para la autodefensa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Estas circunstancias tienen graves consecuencias en la preservacion de la paz mundial y el desenvolvimiento de la situacion internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. nunca podra ocultar su identidad criminal como perturbador de la paz y la seguridad y responsable de exacerbacion de la tension.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Si los reaccionarios japoneses desafian a la demanda de la sociedad internacional recurriendo a la tergiversacion de la historia, adelantaran solo su bancarrota. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellos deben ver correctamente la demanda de la epoca y expiar sus barbaridades del pasado.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
