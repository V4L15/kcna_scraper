            "content": "Japanese government hit for anti-DPRK smear campaign\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- On March 24 the Japanese government made public what they call \"mysterious ships pursuit case\" and tried to link the \"case\" with the DPRK.    The foolish act comes under fire in Rodong Sinmun today.    The news analyst says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The government and the Defense Agency of Japan said it was disclosed that the \"mysterious ships\" have entered a \"seaport in the northern part\" of the DPRK and the \"purpose of intrusion into the territorial waters\" was uncertain, in a bid to describe those ships \"operational boats\" from the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While making the \"case\" a fait accompli, the Japanese government is engaged in such a farce as \"protest.\"   All this is a clear indication of one more confrontation with the DPRK.   Japanese reactionaries invented such a shocking incident as the afore-said \"case,\" and are now raising a hue and cry over it in an attempt to avoid foreign and domestic criticism of the efforts to pass bills on the updated \"guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation\" and facilitate smooth deliberation of the bills at the diet.   Whenever they think it necessary for their own interests, they engage themselves in premeditated anti-DPRK smear campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the Japanese authorities are now trying to make an impression as if they were \"interested\" in the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan. The above-mentioned \"case\", however, proves that they seek confrontation with the DPRK, not improved relations.    Japan is to blame entirely for grave consequences of the anti-DPRK smear campaign as the \"mysterious ships pursuit case\" which will adversely affect the relations between the two countries. \r\n    \r\n"

It was none other than the President Kim Il Sung who put an end to the ruling class's history of domination that made the popular masses an object of politics, and created the history of politics for the people and it is General Secretary Kim Jong Il who has creditably carried it into practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I respect them so deeply because I was fascinated by their anthropocentric Juche philosophy, ideo-theoretical  activities based on it and great exploits for the times and history, the article stresses.   Kim Jong Il formulated a fresh and unique political method, that is benevolent politics, while working with President Kim Il Sung, who was a great master and veteran of world's political circles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His noble political idea is that the popular masses are master of politics and that the politics should serve them.    He puts the interests of the people above anything and subordinates everything to it.   Individual characters and personality are respected and human rights are guaranteed by the politics of love and trust, which is pursued in Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Juche philosophy and the political method based on it have brought about amazing reality on the land of Korea.   In Korea, tax system was completely scrapped in 1974, sons and daughters of ordinary working people are fully developing their talents and medical arts truly serve the people.   Kim Jong Il, who is enriching the human history of politics with love and trust, is the great sun of mankind.   As it is led by him, socialist Korea will remain shining all over the world as an ever-victorious powerful nation and the forthcoming 21st century will be marked by his august name. \r\n \r\n"

They threw hundreds of rotten eggs at the building of the \"National Congress for New Politics\" and pulled down the party flag and burnt it.   The party made commitments to settlement of farmers' debt and reform of cooperatives during the \"election\" campaign, but it broke the promise, they said, strongly urging the party to take measures.   On Friday, about 25,000 members of stock-breeding cooperatives held a meeting in Youido in protest against the anti-social crimes of the ruling quarters ruining stock-breeding. \r\n\r\n"

The present era is the era of independence when the world people defend independence and advance along the road of independence.   The imperialist's moves and interference violating people's independence have been ceaselessly committed. As a result, a turmoil occurred in the world in which a country which was considered to be a big power collapsed all at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK, however, did not collapse but grew ever stronger despite any blockade and pressure from imperialists and  still remains a fortress of socialism.   The imperialists are very afraid of the spirit and might of the DPRK which has enforced the independent politics on the strength of the Korean people rallied close around Kim Jong Il and with the Juche idea as its guiding idea. So, they dare not provoke the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people, who demonstrated their capacity to build a powerful nation by launching a satellite last year, are running at a canter on a steed with confidence and optimism, not yielding to trials and difficulties.   It is a strong determination and will of Kim Jong Il to build a powerful nation of Juche in the near future  which comprehensively embodies the Juche idea in political, military, economic and all other domains and which will fully display its might. \r\n  \r\n"

He emphasized that the respected Marshal Kim Jong Il has wisely steered the movement of all compatriots for reunification, devoting all his energy and thoughts to its cause.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whoever truly loves the country and nation and aspires for national reunification should come out to hew the destiny of the nation independently hand in hand with compatriots, not depending on outsiders, he said, and continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean people should wage a strenuous struggle for the repeal of the \"National Security Law,\" a obstacle in the way of contact and dialogue between fellow countrymen  and reunification, and the dismantlement of such institutional machinery as \"Ministry of National Unification\" and \"National Intelligence Service\".   Hanminjon and patriotic people from all walks of life will put spurs to the nationwide onward march towards national reunification under the uplifted banner of the 10-point program for great national unity and thus bring earlier the dawn of a reunified country. \r\n\r\n"

Korean \"government's\" harsh labor policy under fire\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The worker-peasant department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (Hanminjon) made public on April 1 an indictment of the harsh labor policy pursued by the present authorities of South Korea, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The document deals with the one-year-long encroachment upon the rights and interests of workers by the self-described \"government for the people\" that has tightly tied the working people to chains of power and capital.   It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After coming into power, Kim Dae Jung asserted the labor policy of his \"government\" was \"different\" from its preceding \"governments\" and promised to work to \"defend collective rights of the workers.\" He revised labor relations laws for the worse and applied them, though.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In March last year the \"government\" let the \"constitutional court of justice\" adopt a decision describing the \"law on labor union\" now in force as unconstitutional, under which man is punishable if he does not remain true to the collective agreement between the labor union and the management. In fact, the \"legal protection\" under the collective agreement has become null and void.   Kim Dae Jung \"government\" is hell-bent on fascist suppression of a just struggle of the workers. In South Korea commemorations of the May Day, the traditional international holiday of workers, have been the target of suppression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On September 3 last year the fascist junta mobilized more than 14,000 riot police of some 124 companies, bulldozers and helicopters to the bloody suppression of strikes of workers of the Mando machine works.   The fascist police rushed to the work-sites to arrest upwards of 2,400 workers.   The \"Labor-Management-Government Committee\" invented by the present \"government\" is no more than a tool to provide justification for its traitorous labor policy, including \"lay-off system\" and \"labor exchange,\" on the plea of \"agreement\" with labor circles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the whirlwind of lay off more than 8,800 workers of  the Hyun Dai Motor Company were dismissed on four occasions, about 16,000 in financial circles and over 2,000 in Korea communications engineers Co., Ltd. According to the doctored figures released by the authorities, tens of thousands of working people of public enterprises lost their jobs.   As a result of the sweeping \"restructuring\" 170,000 employees of the 5 conglomerates, or 20 to 30%, were deprived of their jobs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unemployed already number far more than  8 million, children who go without meals 150,000 and people who destroy themselves 40 on a daily average.   The unemployed swarming over all streets and unbroken chains of deaths are the true picture of South Korea, an outcome of the murderous labor policy of the Kim Dae Jung group of traitors. \r\n\r\n"
