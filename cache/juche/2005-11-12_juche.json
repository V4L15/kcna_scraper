            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on WPK's Perfect Unity with People \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) -- The history of the Workers' Party of Korea is a glorious history during which it formed an integral whole with the popular masses and has always emerged victorious. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As strikingly demonstrated through the celebrations of its 60th birthday, all the Korean people are single-mindedly united around the WPK and leader Kim Jong Il, absolutely supporting and trusting the party headed by him. \r\n The history of the WPK is a glorious history in which the party has firmly protected and successfully met the people's needs and interests with its popular line and policies and a proud history in which it has carried out the revolution and construction depending on their strength. It is, at the same time, a sacred history in which it has looked after the destiny of all the people in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the leadership of President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il that the party could form an integral whole with the popular masses and always emerge victorious with their might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung was the great leader who gave origin to the perfect unity between the WPK and the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Believe in the people and rely on them at all times and you shall always emerge victorious; if you are forsaken by them, you will always fail\". This was Kim Il Sung's maxim. He thus set out the idea of believing in the people as in Heaven. This was a main starting point and the supreme principle to govern the party building and activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the perfect unity between the party and people has been successfully inherited by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to Kim Jong Il that there is the invincible WPK which has perfect unity with the popular masses. Devotedly defending him, therefore, provides a sure guarantee for protecting the single-minded unity between the party and people and achieving the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche. This is a historic review of the WPK's building and activities and the firm faith of the party members and other people in the DPRK.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Bush listed the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\" and has since worked out scenarios for a war of aggression against it including \"OPLAN 5030\" and a plan for using tactical nuclear weapons for striking its nuclear facilities. \r\nThe Korean people are exposed to the threat of the most aggressive imperialist power. They have the right to decide their own future free from foreign interference and achieve the peaceful reunification of Korea divided by the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Brazilian people and all other progressive people of the world extend support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just struggle.\r\n Also seen on the homepage was a map marked with U.S. military bases in south Korea.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They succeeded in successfully supplementing and completing a script and production designs properly retaining the theme of the original work and reflecting the present reality in a matter of less than one month. \r\n Kim Jong Il enjoyed the premiere given on August 16 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Korea and expressed great satisfaction over its success and sent thanks to all the performers on behalf of the WPK Central Committee, the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and its government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spared time to watch the performance again on Oct. 9 and 29 and highly praised its creators and performers, noting that it played a great role in demonstrating to the world the appearance of Songun Korea and the spirit and might of the country on the occasion of the 60th anniversaries of the WPK and liberation of Korea. He extended thanks to them and presented them with gifts carrying his loving care to be handed down through generations.\r\n From its premiere Arirang evoked unprecedentedly lively response. The performance originally slated to close on Oct. 17 had to be extended till Oct. 30.\r\n Arirang aroused strong response among south Koreans, overseas Koreans and foreign guests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, indeed, demonstrated to the world that a rosy future is always in store for Kim Il Sung's nation advancing, holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the sun of the 21st century.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

This indicates that the U.S. intends to unhesitatingly use force on the Korean Peninsula. Under this situation, the south Korean military authorities are extensively reinforcing their armed forces under the signboard of \"independent national defense\" talking about \"alliance\" with the U.S., which will suit the strategic calculation of the U.S. bellicose elements and fan its ambition for a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
