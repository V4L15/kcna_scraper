            "content": "DPRK NDC Policy Department Blasts U.S., S. Korea for Turning Southwestern Waters in West Sea into Hottest Spot Waters\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- The Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK in a detailed report on Saturday disclosed and denounced the thrice-cursed crimes committed by the sworn enemy given the prevailing situation in the hot spot waters in the West Sea which can be called the epitome of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the south Korean puppet forces' policy for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The report disclosed the sinister nature of the gangster-like U.S. which turned the West Sea of Korea into the hottest spot waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military tension in these waters that does not subside despite the passage of time is the extension of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its direct product, the report said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Back in 1953 when the June 25 war ended in truce, the U.S. moved desperately to create a starting point for a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On many occasions such as the 346th meeting of the Military Armistice Committee in December 1973, the DPRK-U.S. general-level talks in Panmunjom in August and September 1999, the U.S. categorically ignored the efforts made by the DPRK side to set the maritime military demarcation line in the West Sea and prevent the military conflict there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has been without exception behind the vicious moves of the puppet forces of south Korea to escalate the military tension in the hot spot waters in the West Sea into the estuary of the River Han.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of artillery live-shell firing drills in the said waters and the ceaseless intrusion into the territorial waters and air of the DPRK after the fabrication of the \"northern limit line\" in the West Sea of Korea clearly prove that the U.S. is the arch criminal ratcheting military tension and the danger of conflict in these waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also disclosed the moves of the south Korean puppet forces, a group of hideous warmongers who turned the sea common to the nation into the hot spot waters of confrontation and conflict. It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Command for the Defense of Northwestern Islands of south Korea which regards the hot spot waters in the West Sea as its operational theatre held a \"memorial service\" for those who met deaths while running riot in the forefront areas for confrontation with the fellow countrymen and also has been hell-bent on another round of provocation while crying out for \"punishment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was timed to coincide with the farce for taking a posture for putting an end to the \"north's provocation\" within 24 hours by task forces of the puppet navy and marine corps commissioned in May.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From 16th to 18th, dozens of large combat warships of the puppet navy and coastal police staged marine mobile drills with fighters with different missions involved. They also staged air defence drill, exercises for defending the area they are stationed and exercises for countering underwater infiltration while crying out for turning the hot spot waters into the \"grave\" of someone and escalating military stand-off for the purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In fact, the military situation in the hot spot waters in the West Sea has gone beyond the phase of control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A clear proof of it was the reckless military actions committed by the puppet military gangsters on May 27.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The provocative marine infiltration is without exception supported by the puppet air force and ground artillery pieces with the involvement of the fully-armed marine groups made up of puppet warships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinister aim sought by the south Korean puppet forces is to deliberately invade the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK and make a preemptive strike and thus compel the Korean People's Army to take counteraction for self-defence and then paint the DPRK as the chieftain of \"provocation\" and \"threat\" by setting in motion reptile reactionary media and push the situation in the hot spot waters in the West Sea to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most urgent task for ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula at present is to put the situation in the hot spot waters in the West Sea under control, the report said, and noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The increasing military tension has to be deescalated and the daily mounting danger of military conflict has to be defused at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park Geun Hye and her group finding themselves at risk in the face of the worst \"administrative\" crisis are pushing the situation in the sensitive hot spot waters in the West Sea to the point of explosion at the zealous instigation of their American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hot spot waters in the West Sea made us keenly realize in practice the truth that talking would never help achieve peace and only matchlessly powerful arms will ensure genuine peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Steadfast is the will of the army and people of the DPRK to prevent the danger of conflict in the hot spot waters in the West Sea, improve the north-south relations and defuse tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces should admit their criminal responsibility for turning the southwestern waters into the world's hottest spot waters and immediately stop their reckless military provocations."

Korean Regime Unconditionally Send back Its Citizens\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet authorities on June 21 declined the request for the presence of the citizens of the DPRK whom they lured and abducted to south Korea at a trial claimed by the Bar Association for Democratic Society, and sent a legal representative who is their cat's paw there, thereby bringing the trial to a rupture. This only glaringly revealed their true colors as a group of human rights abusers and matchless philistines.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK said in a statement on June 25 that the above-said behavior of the south Korean authorities was little short of self-admittance to the hideous allurement and abduction committed by themselves as it shows how much they are afraid of the disclosure of their criminal nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group can have neither reason nor excuse whatsoever to decline the request made by the Association which was authorized by the families of victims, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gangsters of the puppet Intelligence Service are the criminals who are resorting to all sorts of plot-breeding and conspiracy to divide harmonious families of the people in the DPRK while getting engrossed in the abduction of the DPRK citizens in order to save their hideous hostile policy toward the DPRK from its bankruptcy and the abductees of the DPRK and their families are their direct victims.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment, the families of victims are holding out the hope that their beloved daughters would come back to the fold of the families as early as possible, and we are ready to immediately send them to south Korea to meet their daughters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the puppet group is talking about \"adaptation\" and \"brain-washing.\" This is just poor sleight of hand to keep the abductees away from outside, cover up the despicable true nature of their unethical crimes and escape protest and denunciation at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Frankly speaking, we know well through reliable information obtained from the inside source of the puppet group the reason why it is not letting public know about the condition of the DPRK citizens and in what difficult situation they brave blackmail and appeasement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We also know that the gangsters of the puppet Intelligence Service are now finding themselves in hot water over the issue of how to handle the citizens of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those telling more lies to cover up truth would become bigger liars and they are bound to add crimes to what they have committed already amid public censure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet group persistently resorts to sordid smear campaign against the citizens of the DPRK and keeps mocking at the public at home and abroad, rubbing salt in the wounds of the families of the victims, the situation will turn out to be more serious. This is our repeated warning."

Workers and other people of various circles in south Korea are staging broad-based actions against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 18 the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of Trade Unions of south Korea sponsored a meeting of 100 000 financial and public workers for pledging an all-out action in Seoul. There, they strongly denounced the regime for working hard to reduce the workers to slaves of money and power and pass the buck for its failed economic policy and the deteriorated people's living to them by introducing the above-said system. They launched a large-scale anti-\"government\" action under the slogan \"Let's put an end to the oppressive and dictatorial regime!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They had already staged a series of actions including a meeting for pledging a protest against the regime, group hair cutting and meetings of workers of trade unions of various industrial sectors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They declared at the meeting that they would go on a general strike of 400 000 workers in case Chief Executive Park Geun Hye fails to retract the above-said introduction plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea said in a statement on Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean workers' actions are an eruption of the pent-up curse and anger of south Koreans of various circles at traitor Park and their stern punishment of her who has mercilessly abused even the elementary right to existence of the popular masses, not content with turning south Korea into a veritable hell through outrageous fascist dictatorship and unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said system which Park is working with bloodshot eyes to introduce is, in fact, the most inhumane and unpopular modern-day slavery system that legalizes and justifies the harsh exploitation and maltreatment of workers. This is clear evidence proving Park-style twisted \"outlook on economy and value.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, Park is a thrice-cursed enemy with whom the toiling people can never live together as she is \"a princess of yusin\" steeped in pro-privileged concept to the marrow of her bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is asserting that the introduction of the above-said system is \"badly needed to achieve an economic boom.\" But lurking behind it is her ulterior design to get rid of the economic crisis caused by her by sacrificing the workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a stark fact recognized by everyone that corrupt and ignorant Park has plunged the south Korean economy into a bottomless pitfall of crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the mindset of the south Korean public that the system should be applied to Park first to punish her as she is being branded as the \"one who registered no success\" during her tenure of office in case the system comes in force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All workers of south Korea should not step back even an inch in their death-defying struggle, the confrontation between justice and injustice, but overthrow the Park regime, the source of all evils, before anything else if they want to protect their rights to existence and work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All workers in the DPRK will sincerely and positively support the just struggle of the south Korean workers who determinedly rose up against the Park regime's unpopular dictatorial rule in order to defend their genuine democratic rights and right to existence."

Ademas, se dedicaron a las maniobras para provocar la guerra nuclear introduciendo enormes fuerzas armadas y equipos belicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, cometieron actos provocativos de categoria especial de examinar la posibilidad real de la \"operacion de descabezamiento\" para eliminar la Direccion Suprema de la Revolucion Coreana y lograr el \"derrumbe del regimen\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales tentativas provocativas de los yanquis y titeres surcoreanos, que actuan con imprudencia nadando contra la realidad cambiada y la corriente de la epoca y levantando la oleada fanatica de confrontacion anti-RPDC, hacen redoblar mas la voluntad de venganza del ejercito y pueblo coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los imperialistas yanquis y la banda traidora surcoreana atentan, por poco que sea, la dignidad y la soberania de la RPDC pese a las reiteradas advertencias de esta, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea eliminaran totalmente el bastion de los enemigos y lograran sin falta la causa historica de la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos delegados de los obreros, trabajadores agricolas y estudiantes jovenes expresaron en sus pronunciaciones la decision de heredar la gran tradicion victoriosa y dar la mas tragica derrota final a los enemigos al destruir con las fuerzas armadas invencibles de Paektusan el baluarte de agresion sin dejar ni un tipejo de sellar el acta de capitulacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, hubo la manifestacion multitudinaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mismo dia, tuvieron lugar mitines semejantes en todas las provincias, ciudades y distritos de la RPDC."
