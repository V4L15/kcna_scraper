He, sharing his destiny with the service personnel and people, led the Fatherland Liberation War to victory with his distinguished military wisdom, outstanding strategy and tactics, big trust and loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t The three-year war started by the U.S. imperialists was a fierce political and military stand-off between the only two year old DPRK and the U.S. which boasted of numerical and technological advantages with a hundred and scores of years of history of aggression, troops of 15 satellite countries as well as puppet south Korean army and the Japanese militarists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 25, 1950, the U.S. imperialist aggressors invaded the DPRK all of sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President immediately set forth the strategic policy in the first phase of the war on June 25 to resolutely thwart the enemies' invasion and promptly launch a counterattack. The next day, he in his historic radio speech appealed to the party, army and people to turn out in the sacred battle to wipe out the U.S. and its stooges from the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made field inspection of Seoul several times from July 15 to August 14, Juche 39 (1950), a historic course which provided a turn in the first phase of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He crossed the iron bridge over the River Rimjin in mid-July by jeep and reached the front command in Seoul where he straightaway unfolded the strategic plan of conducting the operation of encircling Taejon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of July he again left for his journey to the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went to Suanbo very close to the foremost front and advanced an operational policy of rapidly crossing the River Rakdong and destroying enemies in the Masan, Taegu, Yongchon and Phohang perimeters. On August 9 he went to Seoul and clarified the shortcut to victory to completely liberate the southern part of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 2 240 km-long journey to the front made by the President resulted in liberating over 90 percent of the south Korean area and over 92 percent of the south Korean population in little more than a month since the war started.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the front made a U-turn around September 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enemies backed by huge reinforcements desperately attempted a \"general offensive\" in the River Rakdong perimeter and launched a massive landing operation in Inchon area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With scientific insight into the change of the relations of forces between friends and foes and the situation on the front, the President advanced a strategic policy in the second phase of the war in mid-September on forming a strong counterattack group while ensuring the temporary strategic retreat of the main forces of the People's Army by delaying the enemies' advance as much as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To tide over the grave difficulties, the President set up the commanding post of the Supreme Command in Okchon-myon (at that time) in Maengsan County from October 16 to 20 and set forth the operational plan of forming the second front of the combined units of the People's Army while commanding the retreat to a success.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Based on the analysis of the preparations of the People's Army for counterattack, weak points of the enemies and relations of forces between friends and foes, the President advanced the strategic policy in the third phase of the war and visited over 310 units, covering 5 120 km for its realization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Staying in Kosanjin (at that time) from November 4 to December 18, the President led the new counterattack operation to victory, opening up an epochal turn in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ordered the army to launch a decisive counterattack on all fronts toward the end of November 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After leaving Kosanjin, he made 280 km journey at night to reach at Taeyu-dong, Tongchang County on November 28 where he organized and commanded the operations for encircling and annihilating the main group of enemies in the River Chongchon, Lake Jangjin and Chongjin and Hamhung areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The units on the second front together with the combined forces of the People's Army launched a fierce attack, shattering the enemies' \"Christmas offensive\" and liberating all areas in the northern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After convening the 30th plenary meeting of the Cabinet in Yonphung-dong, Kanggye City in mid-December, the President continued his journey to Hyangha, Janggang County.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the third plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea from December 21 to 23 he made a historic report \"The Present Situation and the Immediate Tasks\" and the conclusion, indicating important tasks for consolidating the victory won in the counterattack, strengthening the party and enhancing its role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He moved the Supreme Command to Konji-ri (at that time) in January, Juche 40 (1951) and guided more than 200 important meetings of the party, army and state till the war ended. He continued his guidance from the Supreme Command to the front and again from the front to the rear, leading the army and people to victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In mid-1951, the President set forth the strategic policy in the fourth phase of the war on holding initiative of the war and achieving the final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited more than 600 battle sites on the front and rear including Mt. Jihye, Sungap-ri and Puldanggol as well as factories and farms, covering over 12 640 km, a significant journey that led to the final victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to the wise guidance of Kim Il Sung that the enemies' \"autumn offensive\" was totally thwarted in early November 1951.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June 1952 when the U.S. imperialists tried to massively build up forces behind the scene of the armistice talks and clinch \"honorable talks\" the President again made his field guidance to North Phyongan Province to increase the combat capabilities of the People's Army and strengthen the rear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He inspected the front command in Sungap-ri, Kumgang County and the combined unit in Soksa-ri in fall of 1952, clarifying the operational policy for foiling the enemies' \"Kimhwa offensive\" by the Korean war method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February 1953, the President crossed snowy mountains and ridges including Masik Pass in the eastern area and Myongmun Pass in the northern area, arousing soldiers of units on the foremost front, working people in Jagang and South Phyongan provinces to the final victory in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in May he went to the conference hall of the armistice talks and clarified the bright idea and ways for wringing the windpipe of the enemies and securing surrender from them and led the operation for the third strong counterattack to bring about a decisive victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 27, Juche 42 (1953) time has come for the U.S. which boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world to kneel before the Koreans and sign the document of surrender.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President at a historic place which is now the Jonsung Revolutionary Site finally examined the document of the Armistice Agreement and ratified it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The brilliant victory won in the hard-fought war was a victory of the President's outstanding idea, strategy and tactics and warm loving care for the people."
