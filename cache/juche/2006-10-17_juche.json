            "content": "National Meeting Held to Mark DIU Anniversary \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 16 (KCNA) -- A national meeting to mark the 80th anniversary of the formation of the Down-with-Imperialism Union (DIU) by President Kim Il Sung was held at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium Monday.\r\n Upon embarking on the path of revolutionary struggle shouldering upon himself the destiny of the country and the nation in his early years, the President drew a serious lesson from the preceding nationalistic movements and the early communist movement and made a bold decision to take a path of independent development of the revolution, completely different from those, and formed the DIU with like-minded members of the young vanguard representing the new generation on that basis on Oct. 17, Juche 15 (1926). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Nam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, in a report said that the formation of the DIU marked a starting point in building a revolutionary party of a new type in Korea and provided roots of the glorious WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the revolutionary cause of Juche that started with the birth of the DIU thanks to the outstanding idea of the President and his wise guidance has dynamically advanced along the path of independence, Songun and unity over the past 80 years, the reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-victorious history of the Korean revolution represents the most brilliant history of outstanding revolutionary activities of the President as he had consistently embodied the noble idea of the DIU with unshakable revolutionary faith and will, taking independence, Songun and unity as the lifeline of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by the President has been successfully carried forward by the party at a new higher stage as it has faithfully inherited the tradition of the DIU under the outstanding and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has pursued the Songun politics, successfully carrying forward the Songun idea and line of Juche which trace their origin to the DIU and whose validity and vitality have been proven throughout the Korean revolution. This served as a basic source of strength which made it possible for the Korean revolution to achieve miraculous victories despite manifold difficulties generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, immensely blessed with the great leaders, have consistently preserved the Juche character of the revolution despite the complicated history and made triumphant advances in the national liberation, the class emancipation and in the whole historic course of socialist construction with the might of the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks around the party and the leader and by force of arms. This is a main review of the 80 year-long history of the Korean revolution that emerged ever-victorious under the banner of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party, army and people of the DPRK will dynamically accelerate the historic march to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche and successfully realize the President's desire for a rich and powerful country true to Kim Jong Il's outstanding idea and leadership, full of conviction of sure victory and revolutionary optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The security of our socialist country is seriously threatened by the daily-growing threat of a nuclear war from the U.S. and its vicious moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. This situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula requires the army and people of the DPRK to wage a dynamic struggle along the immutable orbit of Songun revolution under the uplifted banner of independence against imperialism, the banner of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK took a fresh countermeasure to cope with the threat of a nuclear war by the enemies and their moves of sanctions and pressure in view of the situation where the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK have reached the worst phase, after going beyond the limit of tolerance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A recent successful underground nuclear test in the DPRK with its indigenous wisdom and technology 100 percent will contribute to preserving peace and stability on the peninsula and its vicinity as it marked a historic event that greatly encouraged and pleased the army and people of the DPRK who have desired to have powerful self-reliant national defence capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will steadily increase the politico-military might of Juche under the banner of Songun which they have held high in the whole course of the Korean revolution, guided by the idea of the DIU and firmly defend their ideology and system and the cause of justice and thus certainly achieve a final victory in the historic stand-off with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by senior party, army and state cadres, chairpersons of the friendly parties, Cabinet members, officials of the party, armed forces and power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, KPA servicepersons, officials of scientific, educational, cultural, art, public health and media organizations and working people in Pyongyang.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Engrossed in expanding their factional forces, they drove out people to reckless struggles, inviting only worthless sacrifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nationalists did not indicate the true way for the national liberation struggle, only talking about \"development\" of education and industry, \"self-cultivation\" and \"class cooperation\" and \"national autonomy\" under the veil of \"national reformation\" and \"cultivation of ability\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung, basing himself on the deep-going analysis of the preceding theories of the working class and actual conditions of the then revolutionary movement, formed the DIU with anti-imperialism, independence and sovereignty and socialist idea as its programme, thus initiating the Korean revolution which would advance forward under the banner of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The formation of the DIU made the Korean revolution bid farewell to all sorts of worn-out tendencies including flunkeyism and dogmatism and forge ahead with correct target, strategy and tactics on the principle of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea and Songun revolutionary cause have their origin in the DIU.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Can Never Evade Settlement of Its Past: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 16 (KCNA) -- Japan has become more vociferous over the \"abduction issue\" after the emergence of a new Cabinet.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says:  Japan should do what it should, instead of persisting in drum beating over the already settled \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe, the new prime minister of Japan, in his statement released upon the inauguration of the new Cabinet, expressed his intention to set up what he called \"headquarters of measures on the abduction issue\", while the new chief Cabinet secretary let loose a string of rubbish, claiming that the \"abduction issue\" should be discussed at the United Nations, too, and the opening of diplomatic ties between Japan and the DPRK was unthinkable without its solution.  It is needless to say that this is intended to increase pressure upon the DPRK by internationalizing the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"abduction issue\" over which the Japanese authorities are raising terrific outcries has already been solved. When it comes to this issue, it is a crucial matter over which the DPRK should file charges against Japan. Under the Japanese imperialists' military occupation and rule over Korea, well over 8.4 million Koreans were abducted and whisked away to be over driven at deadly battle fields and sites of backbreaking toil, at least one million of them meeting their death. And more than 200 thousand Korean women were abducted and taken away to be forced to sexual slavery for the Japanese imperialist aggression army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, anti-DPRK organizations and figures of Japan, under the backstage manipulation and instigation of the plot-breeding centers of the U.S. and Japanese governments and right-wing conservative forces, have swarmed into areas bordering on the DPRK and threw espionage and subversive networks to be engaged in the whole gamut of malicious maneuvers against the DPRK while abducting DPRK citizens by mean and crafty means including appeasement and deception and taking them to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan should do before anything else is to settle the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in abducting and taking away Koreans by force in the past and the issue of abduction of DPRK citizens in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan, like the guilty party filing the suit first, keeps raising a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue,\" seeking to internationalize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the criminal purposes sought by Japan in persistently kicking up dust over the \"abduction issue\" is to divert elsewhere the concerns and alert of the international community against Japan's moves for becoming a military giant and launching reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pressing issue in the DPRK-Japan relations is for Japan to atone for its past crimes against the Korean people at an early date. Japan can never evade the settlement of the past. The Japanese authorities would be well advised to be aware of this and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
