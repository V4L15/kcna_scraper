The army of the north will as ever sincerely implement the June 15 joint declaration, greatly proud of having reelected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il chairman of the National Defence Commission, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the armies of the two sides are tasked to fully guarantee the passage of persons and vehicles through the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) now that the overland tour of Mt. Kumgang, the construction of the Kaesong industrial zone and the project of reconnecting the inter-Korean rail and road links are making brisk headway, he underscored the need to sincerely discuss the issues raised at the talks and make them fruitful so as to bring great joy and hope to the whole nation strongly eager to see the divided land reunified so that the Koreans may freely visit each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward a proposal of the north side after underscoring the need to amend and supplement the tentative agreement on providing a military guarantee for the traffic on the temporary roads to ensure that the main roads the construction of whose beds have been completed are used instead of the existing narrow temporary ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides adopted a supplementary agreement on the temporary roads under the control of the north and the south on the east and west coasts and the change of the portions to be opened on the MDL and exchanged views on military matters of mutual concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement deals with the issue of temporarily using the main roadbeds under the control of the north and the south on the east and west coasts until a new agreement on providing a military guarantee for traffic on both sides' railways and roads is adopted to take effect, the issue of opening the MDL in the portion where the main roadbeds are reconnected and other issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the supplementary agreement has opened a prospect of ensuring a more satisfactory passage of persons and vehicles between the north and the south to boost the inter-Korean economic cooperation and exchange.    \r\n\r\n"

I extend sincere congratulations to him and wish the Korean people progress, prosperity and national reunification, he said.\r\n He expressed the firm belief that victory is in store for the Korean people under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, chairman of the Supreme People's Assembly, in a speech said that the founding of the DPRK by the President marked a historic event that brought about a radical turn in bringing prosperity and progress to the Korean nation and the DPRK is further prospering under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung, together with Yasser Arafat, provided the friendly ties between the two countries and these bonds of friendship and cooperation are invariably developing on good terms under the deep care of Kim Jong Il, he noted, adding that the Korean people would strive to strengthen the friendly and cooperative relations with the Palestinian people and positively support the just cause of the Palestinians in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there on invitation were Ryom Sun Gil, chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea who is chairman of the DPRK-Palestine Friendship Association, Pak Kyong Son, vice-department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kung Sok Ung, vice-minister of Foreign Affairs, and other officials concerned.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the height of sarcasm for the U.S. to talk about modern crimes in the DPRK. \r\n It is none other than the U.S. which is fraught with modern crimes. Over 34 million cases of crimes of all kinds are reported every year in the U.S. The reactionary U.S. ruling quarters, however, are lukewarm in combating them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is obtrusive enough to seek sanctions against the DPRK, crying over the lack of struggle against modern crimes there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's might is growing stronger as the days go by. On the contrary, the U.S. is running downhill to decay. The farce of applying sanctions against the DPRK reflects the U.S. reactionary rulers' uneasiness and nervousness over this. It is a foolish attempt to put the brake on the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are going to frighten the army and the people of the DPRK and isolate and stifle it by sanctions. This is, however, a ridiculous dream. They will get nothing in that farce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly understand this and stop running amuck.    \r\n\r\n"

They include Ri Hoe Chang, former president of the GNP, Pak Kwan Yong, speaker of the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea and descendents of those who cooperated with the Japanese army in its wars of aggression and took part in them and those who asserted and supported the change of Korean names into Japanese names, praised the Japanese imperialists' rule and took the lead in the \"campaign for Japanizing Koreans\" and those who acted henchmen in their ruling organs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary which says that all the heavyweights of the GNP groomed by pro-Japanese elements are either pro-Japanese lackeys or pro-U.S. elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the pro-U.S. conservatives of the GNP who beg the U.S. troops, who block the reunification of Korea and impose all sorts of misfortune and pain upon the Korean nation, to remain in south Korea forever. It is again these forces who call for suppressing by government force the people out in the struggle against the U.S. and war, branding them as \"pro-north\", \"enemy-benefiting\" forces and are kicking up rackets against the north, clamoring for \"cooperation\" with the United States to do harm to their fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those hell-bent on acts of treachery are bound to face a severe punishment by history.    \r\n\r\n"
