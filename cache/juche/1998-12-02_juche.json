            "content": "KPA will answer U.S. aggression forces'challenge with annihilating blow = Statement of KPA general staff spokesman = \r\n  Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the general staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) today published a statement solemnly declaring its stand in connection with the fact that the U.S. imperialists are driving the situation to the brink of war.\r\n   The statement says:\r\n   The U.S. imperialists have recently gone beyond the danger line in their arrogant aggressive attempts to stifle the DPRK with military strength.\r\n   According to a report, U.S. President Bill Clinton, during his visit to South Korea,  unusually made a final checkup of the preparedness of the units of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and readiness of its flying corps for sortie and raised the DPRK's nuclear issue, blaring that the united states is \"ready and able\" to do any things in defence of its citizens and an allied nation.\r\n   The South Korean puppet, who has prolonged his remaining days with flunkeyism and obedience, is trying to curry favour with his master, obtrusively crying that the north must accept demands for inspections of an underground facility. The Japanese reactionaries, who slandered the DPRK, branding its launch of an artificial satellite as the launch of a ballistic missile, have also raised their heads again.\r\n   Synchronising with this, the U.S. conservative hard-liners blared that if inspections of the DPRK's underground facilities failed to be realized, they would break the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and take a \"determined counteraction.\"\r\n   This is, in essence, like a declaration of war that they will not hesitate to wage a war against the DPRK.\r\n  What cannot be overlooked is the fact that publications of a third country have openly carried reports that the U.S. military \"has completed a new war plan for invasion of North Korea\" and the gist of the \"operation plan 5027,\" a plan for a second Korean war of aggression allegedly to \"retaliate\" against the DPRK for the U.S. defeat in the past Korean War.\r\n   The \"operation plan 5027\" we have learned through these publications envisages waging the second Korean war against the DPRK in five stages.\r\n   The first stage is a \"control stage.\" under the pretext of controlling the actions of the DPRK, the United States is to amass its aggression forces in and around South Korea and impose full-scale sanctions upon the DPRK by blocking its sky, seas and border.\r\n   In this sense,  it can be said that the operation of this stage is already being carried on in fact.\r\n   The second stage is the \"stage of strikes for neutralisation\" which aims to \"neutralize\" the DPRK by making long-term aerial strikes at the whole area of North Korea with large numbers of field artillery pieces, planes and cruise guided weapons.\r\n   To execute the operation of this stage, the U.S. imperialists have stealthily deployed naval and air forces including flying corps around the DPRK in various forms and methods and mastered methods of strikes, staging military training and exercises under  various names.\r\n  The third stage is the \"stage of ground offensive operation.\" envisaged in it are comprehensive ground offensive operations that combine large-scale operations for landing on the east and west coasts of the DPRK with airplane-and helicopter-borne paratroopers' operations and special commandos' operations. through these operations, the United States plans to encircle Pyongyang, the heart of the Korean revolution, and \"occupy\" the DPRK as far as the River Chongchon.\r\n   The fourth stage is the \"stage of expanding successes in war.\" It plans to \"occupy\" the whole area north of the River Chongchon in the DPRK.\r\n   The fifth stage is the \"stage of concluding war\" in which the U.S. plans to \"achieve unification through the liberal democratic system.\"\r\n   In order to put this operation plan into practice, the U.S. imperialists will hurl over 545,000 U.S. soldiers, 630,000-strong puppet army of South Korea and ultra-modern hardware and large-size striking means including 5 to 7 aircraft carrier flotillas, stealth fighter bombers F-117 and F-111, nuclear-capable strategical bombers B-1, B-2 and B-52.\r\n   The plan contains three methods whereby to unleash an all-out war -- the first method being to mount a strike at the DPRK while imposing sanctions upon it over the nuclear issue and human rights problems, the second to make a \"surgical operation-style\" strike at the \"suspected nuclear facilities\" in the DPRK and the third to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK under the pretext of aggravated situation while continuing to render it strained.\r\n Only recently, the U.S. has dispatched to South Korea senior officials of the U.S. Defense Department including the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, the commander of the U.S. pacific forces, unit commanders of the three services, commanders of the 1st and 3rd army corps, the commander of the 7th Fleet, commanders of the 1st and 3rd marine expeditionary corps and other commanders who are expected to be hurled into the Korean front, one after another to examine the feasibility of the operation plan on the spot. at the same time, it has stepped up preparations for war against the DPRK through Rsoi 98, Ulji Focus Lens 98, Foal Eagle 98 and other joint military exercises.\r\n   Nowadays, the U.S. imperialists are loudly crying that \"tensions have been heightened\" owing to the DPRK's \"underground nuclear facility\" and its launch of an artificial satellite.\r\n   What they seek in this is to find a pretext to ignite the train of war according to the \"operation plan 5027.\"\r\n   Clear is why the United States has begun executing the \"operation plan 5027\", throwing away the mask of \"appeasement\" and \"engagement\" which it had once worn for some time.\r\n   Unable to destroy our socialist system with its isolation and suffocation strategy and \"appeasement strategy\" to induce us to \"reform\" and \"opening,\" the United States has adopted a reckless adventure, losing reason.\r\n From the outset, our revolutionary armed forces have expected little from the \"appeasement policy\" of the United States that seeks to demolish our socialist system.\r\nParticularly, they have followed with sharp vigilance the behaviour of the United States, the other warring party,  which has turned away from the DPRK-proposed general-level officers' meeting.\r\n   The prevailing situation proves that the sharp vigilance and revolutionary position of our revolutionary armed forces are absolutely reasonable.\r\n   To answer fire with fire is a character of our revolutionary army and its unique mode of counteraction.\r\n   Although the U.S. imperialists intend to dispirit somebody by setting afloat their reckless operation plan, it is a foolish dream.\r\n   We have our own operation plan. \"surgical operation\"-style attack and \"preemptive strike\" are by no means an exclusive option of the United States. the mode of strike is not a monopoly of the U.S., either.\r\n   It must be clearly known that there is no limit to the strike of our People's Army and that on this planet there is no room for escaping the strike.\r\n   It must also be realized that the target of our strike in the war is not only the U.S. imperialist aggression forces who chiefly execute the \"operation plan 5027\" but also the South Korean puppets who are willing to serve as their bullet-shield and Japan and all others that offer bases or act servants behind the scenes.\r\n  We neither want nor avoid a war. If a war is imposed, we will never miss the opportunity.\r\n   Now that the U.S. imperialists, having thrown off the mask of \"dialogue\" and \"negotiation,\" are bringing the situation to the brink of war, we solemnly declare with the dignity of Juche Korea that our revolutionary armed forces will never pardon the challenge of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces but answer it with an annihilating blow.\r\n   The aggressors will never escape the fate of forlorn wandering spirits. \r\n\r\n"

Korea-Japan collusion\r\n Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" of South Korea Hong Sun Yong and Japanese Foreign Minister Masahiko Komura held a \"ministerial meeting\" in Kagoshima, Japan, some time ago.\r\n   At the meeting, they said that South Korea, Japan and the United States should continue to take a concerted action with regard to \"Pyongyang's development of missiles and suspicious underground nuclear facility\" and urge \"North Korea to accept demands for inspections.\" At the end of the talks, they reportedly reached a \"consensus of views.\"\r\n   As for Japan, it has conducted anti-DPRK smear campaigns over the DPRK's launch of an artificial satellite, branding it as a \"missile launch.\"\r\n   Therefore, Hong Sun Yong's misbehaviour of asking the Japanese reactionaries for concerted actions to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north is an open revelation of anti-national crimes.\r\n   What greatly enrages the fellow countrymen is the insistence of the South Korean authorities that they would join Japan in demanding inspections of \"underground nuclear facility.\"\r\n   We make it clear that \"underground nuclear facility\" is nothing but a trick invented by the U.S. conservative hard-liners to artificially aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula and stifle the DPRK with military strength.\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities and the Japanese reactionaries raised the issue again at the meeting, alleging that it is \"posing threats to security in northeast Asia.\" Their groundless anti-DPRK propaganda is like a thief crying \"stop a thief.\"\r\n   Who are seriously wrecking stability in northeast Asia and posing threats to this region? \r\n   They are none other than the United States and the South Korean warmongers who have ceaselessly staged powder-reeking war exercises against the DPRK on the Korean peninsula and the Japanese reactionaries who have rushed headlong along the road of becoming a military power and realising their old ambition for \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere.\"\r\n   Nothing cannot be gotten from such conspiracy and collusion.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should bear in mind that their attempts to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north in conspiracy with the Japanese reactionaries will lead to their own destruction.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries had better renounce their confrontation policy hostile toward the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

This great event in the history of the Korean nation gives the highest pride and honour to the 70 million fellow countrymen.   \r\n   With the launch of the satellite \"Kwangmyongsong No. 1,\" the north proved to be a strong country with inexhaustible economic potentials and ultra-modern science and technology and created a modern myth of a strong country by making the Korean nation the envy of all people in 50 years.\r\n   The satellite launch by the north displayed its strong defence capacity and the potentials of the north remind people of the fact that its statement is not an empty talk, the statement that the north would mercilessly annihilate any violator of its sovereignty, wherever he may be in this planet.\r\n   I want to call the north a \"Kwangmyongsong\" strong country, which is great for the Juche idea, enjoys respect from the people for its politics of independence, is powerful for independent economy and strong for invincible military power.\r\n   The \"Kwangmyongsong\" strong country is opening a new world in which big and small countries are equal, putting a period to the unreasonable U.S.-led unipolar world.\r\n   A new world centred on the \"Kwangmyongsong\" strong country means a new era of history which puts an end to arbitrariness and oppression by the western powers forever and opens a way of progress, development, equality and dignity for each nation and each state.\r\n   The 21st century will be a new century led by \"Kwangmyongsong\" strong country.\r\n   The \"Kwangmyongsong\" strong country is Kim Jong Il's strong country.
