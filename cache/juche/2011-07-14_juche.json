Looking far into the future of the triumphant country, he advanced a unique policy on founding factory colleges for training native technicians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the party's measures to massively set up colleges at big factories and enterprises as required by the developing reality, there appeared 23 factory colleges and seven branch colleges in the Juche 49 (1960)-Juche 50 (1961) academic year and the number of these colleges increased to more than 70 late in the 1970s and to over 100 in the 1980s, taking the country as a whole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This led to the appearance of more than a hundred factory colleges, fisheries colleges and farm colleges. Hundreds of thousands of workers and farmers became engineers and assistant engineers while on the job.
