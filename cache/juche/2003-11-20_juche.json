Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary carried in this regard holds that Japan can never evade from its responsibility to apologize and compensate the Korean victims and their bereaved families.\r\n The successive Japanese governments have not probed the truth about the crimes Japan committed against humanity in the past, asserting that \"there is no evidence proving that Koreans were forcibly drafted,\" the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists occupied Korea by force of arms and enforced an unprecedentedly harsh policy to reduce Koreans into slaves and exterminate the Korean nation. The Japanese government is obliged to own responsibility and apologize and compensate for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is illogical for the Japanese authorities to assert that there is no ground for Japan to make compensation in view of the existing law. It is an international system and practice recognized by international law for as assailant country to bear responsibility before the country which fell victim to it, victims and their bereaved families for its organized human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To properly settle accounts with Japan which committed crimes in the past and make it compensate for them would mean giving vent to the pent-up wrath of the Koreans including victims and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a human rights issue rather than a political issue for Japan to make apology and compensation to the Koreans for human losses it caused to the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unavoidable legal and moral obligation and requirements of the times and humankind for Japan to admit its past crimes and make an apology and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan should properly approach the issue of compensation, clearly understanding that it can never flee from its responsibility for compensation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

That is to evade a war of one-to-one clash and carry out a war of aggression by preemptive strikes and intensive offensives with aircraft and missiles launched from bases far from the frontline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relocation of the U.S. forces' bases in south Korea is a criminal act of inciting a face-to-face war between fellow countrymen on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists seek to keep Korea divided for an indefinite period and incite north-south confrontation and put the whole of Korea under their domination. They are now going to pull back their aggression troops from the forefront line and put south Korean soldiers in their place in a bid to bar the north and the south of Korea from achieving reconciliation and unity and incite the sense of confrontation and, on this basis, realize their policy of invading the DPRK without much difficulty. That's why they shifted on to the south Korean army the duty to guard the entire length of the frontline and special duties that had been undertaken by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops under the pretext of their relocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relocation of the U.S. bases is veiled with the cloak of \"peace\" and \"security,\" but it is nothing but a trite trick to cover up their aim of aggression, the article concludes.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK is a country of independence. Its steadfast stand for independence arouses sympathy from among many countries and humankind is all out to build a new world structure of independence and justice under the banner of independence held high by it. Hating this as a thorn in the flesh, the imperialists are working desperately to stifle the DPRK at any cost. Struggle for independence is inevitably accompanied by that against domination and imperialism and confrontation of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle also represents the fiercest confrontation of strength between socialism and imperialism. What the U.S. imperialists conjecture in its world supremacy is a world without socialism. The U.S. thinks that it could make a world without socialism if it succeeded in bringing down socialism in the DPRK. This is why it invariably makes it the main purpose of its anti-socialist strategy, Asia strategy, to contain the DPRK and destroy the man-centered Korean-style socialism. Confrontation with domination and imperialism is one between political, military and economic potentials and a decisive battle of who wins who. Therefore, it is necessary to possess a strong military muscle to emerge victorious in this confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is winning in the anti-imperialist and anti-U.S. struggle. The merit for this goes to the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A bright horizon is opening before the Korean revolution, the human cause of independence and the cause of socialism as leader Kim Jong Il is leading the army and the people of the DPRK along the road of victory in the struggle against imperialism and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
