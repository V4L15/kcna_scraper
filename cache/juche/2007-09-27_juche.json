Around the early sixth century, they established a state called Usanguk to control the two islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@It discloses that Japan had made more unscrupulous its wild ambition to seize Ulrung and Tok Islands in accordance with its intensified invasion of Korea after the \"Meiji Restoration\" and illegally \"annexed\" Tok Island to its territory at last in February 1905. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@The historical truth, the book stresses, patently shows that the assertion about the \"dominium over Tok Island\" on the lips of Japan is a preposterous sophism, a deceptive propaganda calling for militarism and a revelation of its scheme to re-inroad Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Its readers strongly demand that Japan should liquidate the crime-woven history against the Korean people, withdraw at once its anachronistic assertion about the \"dominium over Tok Island\" and the bill on instituting the \"Day of Takeshima (Tok Island)\".    \r\n�@ \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Importance of Ideological Work \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il provided progressive parties and people aspiring after socialism with the guideline of struggle and an invincible ideological and theoretical weapon by expounding the historical truth that socialism wins when ideology is tightly grasped and falls when the hold of it is missed. This is the great feat he has performed in the history of the global socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in an article Wednesday. The author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a working class party places the ideological work above all other work by grasping ideology as the main point can it discharge its mission and duty as a leading political organization guiding the independent cause of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The education of the people in socialist ideology cannot be easily done of its own accord even after the socialist system is established and its material and economic conditions are created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the ideological work is not carried on persistently, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people gradually cools down and there appears among them the tendency of seeking an easy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is proven by historical facts that socialism collapses when the ideological work is let loose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism in some countries collapsed in the past because the work of ideological education for arming the party members and working people with socialist ideas was neglected or abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Modern revisionists and renegades to socialism emasculated, first of all, the leadership of the working class party in the ideological work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also destroyed the system of political and ideological education of the army and the youth and children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in countries building socialism in the past were depraved politically and ideologically and seized with illusion about capitalism. No small number of people rolled up their sleeves in opposing socialism at the instigation of the reactionaries. As a result, socialism collapsed overnight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the traditional political mode of the Workers' Party of Korea to accelerate the revolution and construction with the might of ideology. There is no hibernation and stagnation in the ideological work of the WPK as it is guided by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
