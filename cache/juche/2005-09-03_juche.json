Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in an editorial.\r\n It goes on: At least 60 unconverted long-term prisoners were repatriated to the north at one time to enjoy the greatest happiness in their lives. This reality was the shining fruition of the noble comradeship and revolutionary obligation of leader Kim Jong Il, peerlessly great man and benevolent father of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great leadership provided by Kim Jong Il for solving the issue of the unconverted long-term prisoners finds its expression in such noble sense of revolutionary obligation as looking after the destiny of revolutionaries in a responsible manner to the last.\r\nKim Jong Il made up his mind to bring back the prisoners and translated it into reality, though it was the job of which no one could even think, and brought the highest honor and the greatest happiness to them. This miracle of history could be wrought only by him who is possessed of boundless fidelity to the revolution and noble sense of moral obligation towards the revolutionary soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are now faced with heavy yet honorable tasks to vigorously push ahead with the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and achieve independent reunification of the country, single-mindedly united around Kim Jong Il under the uplifted banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is an urgent task before the people in our generation.\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should give fresh spurs to the movement for the country's reunification with hope and firm confidence in the prospect of the reunification cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should frustrate the anti-reunification moves of the outside forces and dynamically propel the movement for independent reunification with the same patriotism and will as displayed by the former unconverted long-term prisoners.\r\n Kim Jong Il has pursued such benevolent politics as respecting and putting forward those patriots who devoted themselves to national reunification. He embraces all those having a will for reunification and patriotism irrespective of idea and ideal, political view and belief and past career. All the fellow countrymen with ardent patriotism should join in the movement for great national unity and make a tangible contribution to the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK united close around   Kim Jong Il on the basis of the Songun idea and confidence will surely build a reunified great prosperous powerful nation before long and powerfully demonstrate the dignity of Kim Il Sung's nation all over the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Remarks Made by Spokesman for U.S. Department of State\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the U.S. Department of State on Aug. 29 claimed that the appointment of the \"presidential envoy for the human rights issue of north Korea\" and the \"Ulji Focus Lens-05\" joint military exercises have nothing to do with the six-party talks.\r\n This is the reckless remark that can be made only by the U.S., the past master at sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States justified this appointment by asserting that this was done according to the act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the history of the U.S., all the acts reflecting its foreign policy were rebuffed by the times and history for being aggressive, arrogant and brigandish in their nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" which calls for the appointment of the \"envoy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but an act aimed at violating the human rights in the DPRK and an act for bringing down the system there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's worst human rights abuser as it is engrossed in the politico-ideological and military terrorism to spread the American style \"freedom and democracy\" under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. institution of the \"human rights act\" and its try to justify it is no more than a ridiculous and cheap charade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. appointment of the envoy on the eve of the day slated for six-party talks reveals its frantic efforts to resort to political terrorism aimed at bringing down the system in the DPRK, even risking the collapse of the six-party talks.\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the spokesman claimed the appointment was something both the president and the secretary of State deemed very desirable.\r\n This self-exposes that the \"overthrow of the system\" in the DPRK is a matter of utmost concern of the U.S. top officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This assertion of the U.S. clearly proved the DPRK was entirely just when it took the appointment to task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but sophism for the U.S. to claim that the \"UFL-05\" staged by the U.S. and south Korea was \"an annual drill of defensive nature\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past the U.S. suspended the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises in face of strong protest from the DPRK, thus admitting that the war maneuvers conducted by it around the Korean Peninsula could not go with the U.S.-DPRK dialogue.\r\n The \"UFL\" was totally aimed to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, its dialogue partner. If it had been designed to protect the U.S. mainland it should have staged it there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. planned to stage the exercises, timed to coincide with the resumption of the six-party talks and was brazen-faced enough to inform the DPRK of them, thereby making serious mockery of its dialogue partner and compelling it to change its approach to the resumption of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. flee from its responsibility for preventing the talks from being resumed as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If it is true that the U.S. is focusing its efforts on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it should stop such farce aimed at hamstringing its process with a hue and cry over \"human rights issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Washington's poor excuse in face of hard facts would only throw it into a more deplorable position.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Sub-Unit of KPA Unit\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, inspected a sub-unit of KPA Unit 292.\r\n He was greeted on the spot by commanding officers of the unit and the sub-unit.\r\n He acquainted himself with the unit's performance of duty before going round combat technical apparatuses and watching the training of soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He laid down tasks to be fulfilled to increase the combat capability of the unit, greatly satisfied to learn that the soldiers of the sub-unit are prizing and handling weapons of revolution with good care like the apples of their eyes and undergoing intensive training on a scientific basis in order to have a good command of them. \r\n Such shining achievements could be made by the unit because its servicepersons have used their brains and worked hard to successfully implement its training program, he said, adding that the basic guarantee for bolstering the combat power is to intensify the combat training. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Seeing the majestic appearance of the sub-unit as a regular force, he said that the voluntary iron discipline is the essential characteristic feature of a revolutionary army and an important guarantee for increasing the combat capability. He stressed the need to steadily push forward the work to thoroughly establish the revolutionary military discipline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round an education room, a bedroom, a mess hall, a wash-cum-bathhouse, a non-staple food store and other places, he learned in detail about the service and living of the soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Looking at their sideline fields where a variety of crops have grown so rich that furrows are hardly to be seen, he was very pleased to know that the commanding officers and men have worked hard together to bring a bumper harvest. He specified ways of boosting the yield in the sideline farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He stressed the need to positively develop the sideline economy so as to provide the soldiers with better living conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After receiving a report from the commander of the unit that the soldiers of the sub-unit helped farmers in a responsible manner with an attitude befitting master during the campaign for aiding the countryside by fully displaying the spirit of loving and aiding the people, he said that the People's Army, their sons and daughters and the main force of the Korean revolution, should become a model in aiding the countryside, too. He called upon all the servicepersons to come out for a harvesting campaign and discharge the duty as a revolutionary army once again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He gave the soldiers of the sub-unit a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and posed for a photograph with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
