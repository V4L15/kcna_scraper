U.S. troops in Japan are not subject to any legal punishment though they commit countless crimes. Even in case a legal action is taken against any perpetrator, it is nothing but nominal to enable him to live in luxury as before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then why is Japan behaving so? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this disgusting behavior is a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries frantically seek to hold military supremacy and become a \"leader\" of Asia with the help of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, GI crimes in Japan are attributable to the shackling U.S.-Japan alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese people are to live in peace free from GI crimes, they should put an end to the above-said alliance and drive the U.S. troops out of Japan to the last man.  This is the best way of rooting out the GI crimes in Japan, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reflected in the banner of Songun being held aloft by the DPRK are its firm will and independent mettle to defend sovereignty of the country and the nation and achieve independent reunification at any cost as unanimously desired by the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are frustrating every move of the U.S. imperialists to block reunification while increasing the defence capability of the country in every way under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years when the U.S. imperialists have become evermore undisguised in their moves to stifle the DPRK and hamper reunification its army and people have protected dignity and security of the nation and facilitated the implementation of the joint declaration, a milestone of independent reunification, with the might of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have made desperate efforts to ignite a war on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to reduce the June 15 joint declaration to a dead document, hamstring the efforts to develop the inter-Korean relations and torpedo the process of reunification but all this proved futile because of the tremendous vitality of the DPRK's Songun politics. It is the spirit and pluck of Songun Korea not to allow anyone to infringe upon the dignity and interests of the Korean nation. No one can encroach upon the interests of the DPRK as long as it is pursuing the Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is one for defending peace as it is aimed at preventing the danger of war and ensuring peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has frustrated the moves of the U.S. imperialists to invade it with the ever-victorious Songun politics. Through the \"Pueblo,\" \"Panmunjom\" and other incidents the army and people of the DPRK clearly showed what awaited the aggressors. No force can match the army and people who have grown stronger a thousand times under the banner of Songun. But for their strength, a new war would have broken out in Korea ten times. It is entirely thanks to the DPRK's Songun politics that peace has been preserved on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as always work hard to guarantee peace of the country and achieve peaceful reunification, shattering every reckless move of the U.S. imperialists to start a new war with the might of Songun, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- Commenting on the deployment of \"U-2 S Block 20\" high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane in the U.S. air force base in Osan, south Korea, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says:\r\n This is a grave military provocation and blackmail to the DPRK, being an indication that the U.S. is rapidly pushing ahead in various fields with the extremely dangerous war moves against the DPRK, driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the deployment of the plane, the U.S. warmongers claim that it had been planned long ago. But it is nothing but a sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nowadays, the U.S. is daily escalating military pressure upon the DPRK with reckless war exercises, massive arms buildup and persistent aerial espionage, while driving the six-way talks for a settlement to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue to a rupture by putting up absurd pretexts and fictions. So thick clouds of war are hanging above the Korean Peninsula and a touch-and-go situation is prevailing on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Realities make it crystal clear that the fond talk of the U.S. about \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" is a false advertisement to mislead public opinion at home and abroad and its criminal attempt to start a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost is entering the stage of practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military strain of the Korean Peninsula carried into extremes by the U.S. imperialists attests to the validity of the option of the DPRK in building up a strong war deterrent under Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Convinced that peace is defended only by arms, the army and people of the DPRK are now in full preparedness to answer a preemptive attack with a relentless annihilating strike and a nuclear war with a mighty nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should ponder over the possible consequences of their heedless provocation moves for a war against the DPRK and get out of south Korea promptly with all their military hardware including strategic reconnaissance planes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

One day Sinji went hunting and saw deer's footprints imprinted on a sandy land. In the footprints, he got a clue for creating letters. The name of the Sinji Characters was derived from the fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical books \"Samgukyusa\" (historic records of three kingdoms--Koguryo, Paekje and Silla), \"Topography of Pyongyang\" and \"Topography of Nyongbyon\" write that the Sinji Characters were used during and after the Tangun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earthenware vessels with Sinji Characters belonging to the period of Kojoson were unearthed in various places including Sinam-ri, Ryongchon County, North Phyongan Province. They prove the fact that the Korean people had used the Sinji Characters from 5,000 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Sinji Characters are phonetic and syllabic ones. Their forms differ from those of the ideographic characters of China and of the syllabic characters of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation created Hunminjongum (Korean alphabet) in 1444 by carrying forward the Sinji Characters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hunminjongum is phonetic one that was created on the principle of following the shapes of the vocal organs. It can express almost phonemes. The institution of Hunminjongum enriched the cultural heritage of language of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have consistently developed Hunminjongum into the Korean language with rich and refined vocabularies, expressions and styles.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was a shining result of President Kim Il Sung's Juche-oriented idea and line of national reunification and his indefatigable leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo put forward by Kim Il Sung as the three charters for national reunification and laid down the five-point policy of great unity of the whole nation. He provided the historic Pyongyang meeting and the June 15 joint declaration with his great patriotic courageous decision, bringing about an epochal phase of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration is a declaration of independence, peaceful reunification and great unity of the whole nation, as it is an embodiment of the three principles of national reunification, and a milestone of reunification in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the pro-U.S. conservative forces opposed to reunification are making desperate efforts to bar the June 15 era from making evermore dynamic progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wire-pulled behind the scene the fascist \"Yusin regime\" to challenge the historic July 4 North-South Joint Statement even before ink was dry on it. It is still today working hard to bring the June 15 era back to the era of confrontation during the Cold War and leading the situation on this land to an extreme pitch of tension by escalating the moves to isolate the DPRK and ignite a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" are getting frantic in their moves against the DPRK, going against the era of independent reunification in zealous pursuance of the U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People from all walks of life should turn out as one in the struggle to frustrate the moves of the U.S. and pro-U.S. conservative forces against reunification and preserve and more dynamically advance the June 15 era by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
