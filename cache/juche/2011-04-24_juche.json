It is also the sacred annals in which the KPA has made a glorious history of building the army of the leader and the party while preserving the tradition of loyalty created in the forests of Mt. Paektu generation after generation, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the whole course of his leadership over the Korean revolution, President Kim Il Sung held fast to the idea and principle of giving importance to the army and giving precedence to the military affairs and steadily built up the revolutionary armed forces and thus defeated the two imperialist formidable enemies and provided firm military guarantee for the victorious advance of the revolution and construction, the reporter said, adding: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The feats the President performed to build the revolutionary armed forces while firmly adhering to the idea and line of attaching importance to the army in the whole period of his protracted leadership over the revolution will shine forever in the history of the country as they are the most precious of the revolutionary feats performed by him in his lifetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA founded and strengthened by the President has entered a new higher stage of its development, glorifying the history of genuine continuity to the cause of army building under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Grasping the grim situation created due to the vicious moves of the imperialist allied forces to isolate and stifle the DPRK and the requirement of the developing revolution in the 1990s, Kim Jong Il pursued the Songun politics in an all-round way with the KPA as the main force of revolution to usher in the greatest heyday of army building.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has grown to be the elite forces strong in idea and faith and the matchless combat ranks equipped with modern offensive and defensive means. The DPRK has turned into a politico-ideological power and world-leading military power, any aggression forces dare not pounce upon, and won victory after victory in the showdown with the U.S. and other imperialists. This is the biggest miracle and the great victory of Songun Korea provided by Kim Jong Il's original idea of attaching importance to the army and his distinguished Songun leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter stressed the importance to build a thriving socialist nation at an early date, achieve the independent reunification of the country and win a final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche under the banner of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers have staged madcap maneuvers for mounting surprisingly preemptive strike on the DPRK with various nuclear attack means and hundreds of thousands of troops involved, despite the strong protest of people at home and abroad, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has already clarified its principled stand to cope with their ever-more reckless provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean group of traitors finally ignite a war against the DPRK, its revolutionary armed forces will give fullest play to the inexhaustible might of the revolutionary strong army of Mt. Paektu to wipe out the aggressors at one blow and achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail."

Este milagro y gran triunfo de la Corea del Songun residen en la original idea del Dirigente de dar importancia a los asuntos militares y en su destacada guía sobre la revolución mediante el Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebemos construir lo más pronto posible la gran potencia próspera socialista bajo la bandera del Songun y lograr la reunificación independiente de la patria y el triunfo definitivo de la causa revolucionaria del Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos y los belicistas títeres surcoreanos desarrollan frenéticos ejercicios de agresión contra la RPDC para atacarla preventiva y sorpresivamente introduciendo los medios de ataque nuclear de toda índole y cientos de miles de uniformados, pese a la fuerte protesta y rechazo del interior y exterior del país. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl EPC ya ha aclarado su posición de principios frente a las maniobras provocativas de los imperialistas norteamericanos y los belicistas títeres surcoreanos que se tornan cada día más imprudentes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los imperialistas yanquis y los traidores surcoreanos provocan finalmente la guerra de agresión contra la RPDC, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias aniquilarán de un solo golpe a los invasores y lograrán sin falta la causa histórica de la reunificación de la patria, explotando todo el poderío inagotable del ejército revolucionario del monte Paektu."
