On the same day U.S. secretary of State Kerry said at the Senate meeting that the U.S. cannot accept conditions raised by north Korea, adding that the U.S. can start negotiations with north Korea only when it makes a bold decision to dismantle its nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hypocritical talk about dialogue is nothing but rhetoric for confrontation with the DPRK as it is aimed to evade the blame for the tension on the Korean Peninsula and carry out its policy for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tension on the peninsula is bringing consequences contrary to what the U.S. intended.

In order to probe the truth behind the danger of a nuclear war on the peninsula it is necessary to grasp the essence of the Korean problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean problem which was spawned by the U.S. occupation of south Korea and has remained unsettled for more than six decades represents a pressing international issue, the article notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true colors of the U.S. are an aggressor and south Korea is a colony under its occupation. The Korean issue is, in essence, the one of showdown between the DPRK, a victim of the aggressors, and the U.S. imperialists who invaded Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the strategic scenario of the U.S. policy makers to invade the DPRK by every method and means, seize the areas along Rivers Amnok and Tuman as a bridgehead and invade China and Russia to put vast areas of Eurasia under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. authorities are putting spurs to carrying out the policy toward the DPRK and their Asian strategy to dominate the world by covering up their centuries-old ambition for aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is busy labeling the DPRK's legitimate and just steps for self-defence unjust ones in a bid to justify its moves for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. that escalated the showdown with the DPRK into nuclear confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists attempted more than once to use A-bombs against the Korean people as early as in the period of the Korean War. It has massively introduced nuclear weapons into south Korea since it suffered an ignominious defeat in the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was compelled to have access to nuclear weapons to cope with the U.S. adventurous moves for a nuclear war and defend the security of the nation and peace on the Korean Peninsula and in other parts of Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clear that the U.S. imperialists have no intention to drop their hostile policy to stifle the DPRK in a bid to disarm it and bring down its social system by every means and method. Hence, the DPRK set forth the line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force and codified the line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will counter the U.S. DPRK policy of aggression backed by nuclear weapons by implementing the new strategic line with nukes as the mainstay and defend the sovereignty of the country and achieve the cause of the building of a thriving socialist nation, concludes the article."
