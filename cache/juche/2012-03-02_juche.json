The units of the puppet army openly slandered and defamed the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK after creating a touch-and-go situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe internal affairs team of a puppet unit in Inchon carelessly hung portraits of the peerless great men born of Mt. Paektu on walls and doors, scrawling unspeakable defamatory words below them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis hysteric act can be committed only by the Lee group and it is a hideous provocation, pushing the situation to an uncontrollable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors' campaign for defaming the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK has reached a graver phase with each passing day.   Typical of the smear campaign were the case of \"targeting DPRK flags\" at units of the three services of the puppet army, slogans or placards hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK pasted at puppet army barracks and posts and military facilities and the case of \"firing at the supreme leaders\" of the DPRK that were perpetrated in firing ranges and drill grounds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe worst treason was committed against the nation grieving over the greatest loss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe gravity of the situation lies in that Lee Myung Bak masterminded the ideas and puppet Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin, chairman of the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff Jong Sung Jo spearheaded them as \"state tasks\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis hideous act of treachery aimed at escalating confrontation with the DPRK has drawn serious attention of the army and people of the DPRK, given that the dark clouds of a nuclear war is hanging heavily over the Korean Peninsula due to the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon hearing the above-said news, the officers and men of the three services of the strong revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are anxiously waiting for an order, shouting \"Destroy Myung Bak\" and \"Let's strike military warmongers\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven south Korean public denounces the incidents as \"reckless actions making people dreadful,\" \"deliberate plots to incite confrontation with fellow countrymen\" and \"behavior of the insane to invite another war\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army, reflecting mounting anger and revengeful thought of all the service personnel and people of the DPRK and south Korean people of different social standings, solemnly declares once again that it will indiscriminately stage its own-style sacred war to wipe out the group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee Myung Bak group is the sworn enemy with whom Koreans can never live under the same sky and the warmongers of the south Korean army are gang of traitors to be wiped out with arms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will continue its sacred war with main emphasis on physical attack till all acts of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK are brought to a definite end and Lee Myung Bak and military warmongers and other culprits are punished in the name of the nation and they make an apology before the nation for their high treason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK regard the dignity of the supreme leadership as dignity and honor common to the nation which is more valuable than their own lives.

Korean Defense Minister\r\nPyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea on Thursday issued information bulletin No. 991 denouncing puppet Minister of Defense Kim Kwan Jin, a heinous confrontation element of south Korea, for fanning up the war hysteria at units of the puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\tRecently touring the Command of the First Corps, the 18th Combat Air Division, the First Fleet of the Navy and other units of the puppet army under the pretext of \"field examination of defense posture\", Kim let loose coarse invectives that \"the north is likely to provoke the south\". He dared to decry the dignity and system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the live shell firing drills in the areas of Paekryong and Yonphyong islands, he appeared at the commanding control room of the puppet Joint Chiefs of Staff in which he cried out for immediate counteraction irrespective of reason, citing someone's \"provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is an intolerable insult and blatant challenge to the DPRK as it is an inveterate racket kicked up by the heinous confrontation element who is steeped in the enmity with the DPRK to the marrow of his bones, the information bulletin said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy nature, he is a pro-U.S. warmonger keen on racket for a war against the DPRK and confrontation with it. He is a despicable traitor who eulogized the moves of the U.S., his master, for a war of aggression against the DPRK and the confrontation policy of the south Korean authorities, it noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north-south relations have been plunged into complete deadlock and there created in the Korean Peninsula the touch-and-go situation in which a war may break out any time. Blame for this rests with traitor Lee Myung Bak, who took to sycophancy toward the U.S., stoked confrontation with fellow countrymen and escalated moves for a war against the DPRK as well as confrontation maniacs and war servants of foreign forces such as Kim Kwan Jin, a reckless warmonger following Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors is kicking up the moves for a war against the DPRK while flinging mud at the fellow countrymen. But this is no more than the last-ditch efforts of the traitors at the deathbed who are frightened at the might of the DPRK's Songun and cursed and forsaken by the people's mindset for their acts of treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will never pardon but punish traitor Lee Myung Bak and such confrontation maniacs as Kim Kwan Jin going on the rampage, not aware of how the world goes about."

The sky over Pyongyang looked gloomy as if the sun stopped giving out rays following the passing of Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il. But the sun of Songun Korea remained. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe sun of Mt. Paektu keeps shining and its history is given steady continuity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe compatriots in the DPRK sang of the hymn of February ardently longing for the father of the nation and brought into full bloom Kimjongilia, the flower of the sun, throughout the country revering the peerlessly great men. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFireworks were displayed to commemorate the February holiday in the sky over the Jongil Peak in praise of the immortal exploits of the son of guerrillas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDelegations of overseas compatriots took part in colorful commemorations, reminiscing about him. Progressive foreign friends visited Pyongyang to pay their respects to Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWitnessing the solemn and strong yearnings for him, I cherished the truth again that the spring of February is eternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSupreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un is the brilliant sun that glorifies the spring of February shining with the spirit of Mt. Paektu as the permanent spring of the great national fortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe is identical to the great men of Mt. Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe embraced service persons and people during his field guidance and even during the mourning period he took warm care of them and showed benevolence for overseas compatriots. I could feel his kind-heartedness time and again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, the spring of February is eternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe article said major media of the world gave wide publicity to the greatness of the dear respected Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrevailing in the DPRK is the idea of believing in people as in Heaven, the article said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnjoying the absolute trust from the people, Kim Jong Un adds shine to the spring of February with his ardent love for the country, the nation and the people which were shown by the great men of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the unanimous opinion of all overseas Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the stories telling about Kim Jong Un at home and abroad had commonality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA lot of people said \"KPA Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un took into careful consideration what people thought and did work favored by the people just like NDC Chairman Kim Jong Il…\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe compatriots in the DPRK, rallied behind Kim Jong Un, steadily advance the cause of February without any hesitation and vacillation overcoming the pain at the great loss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYearning for Kim Jong Il, they convert their sorrow into strength and courage and pledge loyalty to Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are convinced that as long as they have Kim Jong Un, the great sun of the nation, Songun Korea will shine forever as a country of the sun and all the Koreans will live in a flower garden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tI believe it because they do not make empty words. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking at them, I think the spring of February is eternal as long as they have Kim Jong Un, identical to President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il."

declaracion: \n\t\t\t\t\tAhora llegan al climax la indignacion y el revanchismo de nuestro ejercito y pueblo por los ejercicios de guerra que la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak y los bandidescos

los gangsteres brutos que llevan a la fase irremediable la situacion del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe torna cada dia mas grave la escalada de tales casos, a saber, el de \"tomar como blanco la bandera nacional de la RPDC\" ocurrido sucesivamente en las unidades terrestres, navales y aereas del ejercito titere, el de \"consignas y pancartas\" de la misma materia colocados en los cuarteles, puestos e instalaciones militares, y el de \"tomar como blanco de tiro la maxima dignidad de la RPDC\" reportado en los campos de tiro y entrenamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos crimenes cometidos

intelectual de tales provocaciones y el ministro titere de Defensa Nacional Kim Kwan Jin y el jefe titere de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor, Jong Sung Jo, y otros belicistas militares las ejecutan como una \"tarea de politica nacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo se ven obligados a considerar como una provocacion extremada nunca perdonable tal locura antinacional y de enfrentamiento anti-RPDC cometida por la banda de Lee cuando se crea en la Peninsula Coreana una situacion a punto de explosion de guerra debido a los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInformados de esa barbaridad, los oficiales y soldados de las fuerzas terrestres, navales y aereas del poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu esperan con ansia la orden alzando las voces de indignacion, tales como \"Matemos a golpes a Myung Bak\" y \"Aniquilemos a los belicistas surcoreanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien en la sociedad surcoreana denuncian el presente caso como \"acto imprudente que horroriza a todo el mundo\", \"complot de enfrentamiento fratricida de caracter primitivo\" y \"proceder de locos para repetir la guerra\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn representacion de la indignacion vehemente y animo de venganza de todos nuestros militares y civiles y la opinion publica de distintos sectores del Sur de Corea, la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea vuelve a declarar con solemnidad a todo el mundo que desarrollara, como ha anunciado ya al interior y exterior del pais, una sagrada e indiscriminada guerra a nuestro estilo para enterrar a la banda de traidores surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak es el enemigo jurado con que no podemos convivir bajo el mismo cielo y los belicistas del circulo militar surcoreano son la horda de traidores a que debemos aniquilar con las armas.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sagrada guerra al estilo nuestro, fundamentada en los ataques fisicos, no parara hasta que la banda de traidores surcoreanos elimine sin dejar rastros todas las practicas de difamacion de la maxima dignidad de la RPDC, ejecute en nombre de la nacion a todos los responsables, incluyendo el traidor Lee Myung Bak y los belicistas de la capa militar, y pida disculpas ante la nacion sobre sus tremendos crimenes de traicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo consideran la maxima dignidad como la dignidad y honor comunes de la nacion apreciandola mas que su vida y destruiran implacablemente a quienquiera que se atreva a insultarla o desprestigiarla aun en lo minimo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien han sido muy complicadas las relaciones intercoreanas en el pasado, nunca se han creado como ahora el estado de extremado enfrentamiento y gran peligro de guerra, de lo cual es totalmente responsable la camarilla de Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa escalada de la campana de enfrentamiento fratricida lanzada por la banda surcoreana hace imaginar al perro rabioso que acomete mas tenazmente cada vez que se le acerque la muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos fusiles de nuestro ejercito y pueblo, dispuestos a tomar la venganza despiadada, exterminaran consecuentemente a los traidores surcoreanos para que estos no vuelvan a insultar nunca mas nuestra maxima dignidad ni difamar nuestro digno regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera cuan tragico sera el fin de los provocadores de pesima calana en la sagrada guerra de nuestro ejercito y pueblo que se han levantado para defender a riesgo de vida a su Lider y su regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuienes se atrevan a ofender, aunque fuese a la ligera, nuestra maxima dignidad, no tendran refugio en este mundo."
