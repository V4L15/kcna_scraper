The Koreans should thwart and frustrate the U.S. plan to deploy the new-type missile with close national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The army and people of the DPRK will never lay down their arms unless the U.S. abandons its policy of aggression on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"disarmament\" doctrine is a sophism aimed to hamstring and destroy the armed forces of the DPRK. And it is a war doctrine intended to make a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK after gaining the military upperhand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is not the slightest change in the basic stand of the United States not to co-exist with the DPRK. The U.S. seeks to disarm the DPRK ideologically, morally and militarily and then swallow it up as it did Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK has no alternate but to answer this strong-arm policy of the U.S. with increased self-defense capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Self-defense capabilities are the life and soul of the DPRK and attaching importance to arms is the core of its Songun policy. Apart from arms, is it impossible to think of the nation's sovereignty, right to existence and dignity. The DPRK will give full play to the might of its self-defense capabilities under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should never dream of the DPRK's unilateral \"disarmament\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Why? Through this they seek to bring down the system in the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. and evade the responsibility for compensating for the crimes committed by Japan in the past come what may, instead of redeeming them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by them is to dramatize the abduction issue in a bid to stir up people's sentiment and use it for improving their image and thus create conditions favorable for grabbing power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They try to do harm to the dignified and strong socialist system of the DPRK. This is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. \r\n The DPRK is following Japan's every move with a high degree of vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK re-clarifies its stand that if Japan finally opts for an all-out showdown with the DPRK, it has no alternative but to take a corresponding physical counter-action.\r\n The Japanese ultra-right reactionaries are well advised to behave themselves, mindful of the serious political and physical consequences to be entailed by their reckless anti-DPRK racket.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Myolak area, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n The bird, found out in Kyonggi province for the first time in the summer of 1886, had inhabited in the area south of Mt. Songak and Mt. Chonma in Kaesong, Korea and in Tsushima, Japan. But the environmental deterioration and random fowling compelled it to disappear in Japan from October 1920. And it was hard to see the bird even in Korea.\r\n The DPRK government took a step to protect and propagate the bird in Juche 41 (1952) during the hard-fought Korean War, and designated the bird found in Mt. Songak as a natural treasure in 1956. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In September 1969 the DPRK Cabinet issued an ordinance on protecting and propagating white-bellied black woodpecker and the areas of Phyongsan and Rinsan Counties in North Hwanghae Province and Pongchon County in South Hwanghae Province were designated as reserves for the bird. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This made it possible to increase the number of the bird, which had been once on the brink of extinction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been living in the Mt. Myolak and Singye areas in North Hwanghae Province far north of the original habitat.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
