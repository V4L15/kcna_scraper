Sustainable development is a main part of the activities for achieving the development goal laid down in the UN Millennium Declaration and other international agreements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Touching upon the issues arising in achieving the objectives of sustainable environmental protection and development at present, he went on to say:\r\n  The government of the DPRK has focused its state concern on the land management and environmental protection from the viewpoint of implementing its national plan and ensuring sustainable development to carry out the resolutions and the millennium development goal of the world summit on sustainable development. \r\n  As ways of increasing the agricultural production the DPRK has successfully carried out large waterway and land realignment projects and conducted river improvement projects and the work to turn the whole country into a thick woodland and greenery on a nationwide scale with a view to minimizing damage to be done by natural disasters including flood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In April last the DPRK acceded to the Kyoto Protocol subject to the UN Framework Convention on Climatic Change as part of its efforts to join the international community in its efforts to achieve the above-said goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon the relevant international organizations of the UN to strengthen the cooperation with the international financial and development organizations in order to actively push forward the projects to substantially help the developing countries bolster their capabilities.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Sends Telephone Message to U.S. Forces Side \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- As already reported, the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army, in its spokesman's statement issued on Nov. 2, accused the U.S. forces side of deliberately deteriorating the situation in the conference area in Panmunjom and the areas along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) and warned that if it persistently disregards the agreed points and practice observed by both sides over the last several decades in the conference area in Panmunjom, this will only compel the KPA side to take measures to cope with its action.\r\n On October 28, 1987 both sides agreed to jointly use the \"conference room of the Military Armistice Commission\" on the MDL as a place to be visited with a view to contributing to easing the tensions and maintaining security in the conference area of Panmunjom, but the U.S. forces side recently locked up the \"conference room\" in a bid to prevent the visitors of our side from entering it in violation of the agreement, rendering the situation in the area unstable and creating extreme distrust between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side has not shown any response even after the spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission issued the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Senior Colonel of the KPA Kwak Yong Hun of the Panmunjom Mission sent a telephone message to his U.S. forces counterpart on Nov. 9.\r\n The message says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since Oct. 2 the U.S. forces side kept the door to the northern portion of the \"MAC conference room\" locked up to prevent the visitors of our side from entering it in utter defiance of the agreement on jointly using the \"conference room of the MAC\" on the MDL in the conference area of Panmunjom reached between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard our side warned several times the U.S. forces side of the grave consequences to be entailed by its base and unreasonable behavior and repeatedly demanded it open the door and remain true to the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side, however, has kept the door locked up to this date though more than one month has passed since the demand was made by us and obstructed the tour of Panmunjom by members of visiting groups of our side, defying our just demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As taught by lessons in the past, the area is so acute and sensitive that even a small accidental case may cause unpredictable grave consequences.\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. forces side has abandoned its commitment to implement the agreement which specifies the order of conduct to be observed in the area in defiance of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compels the KPA side to get rid of the binding force of the agreement of both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, the KPA side has decided to take the following measures: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. We will not allow any personnel, vehicles and equipment of the U.S. forces to enter the portion of our side beyond the MDL with a view to checking and repairing the three buildings under the control of the U.S. forces side in the area along the MDL in the conference area of Panmunjom.\r\n Second. We will stop the use and repair of facilities established by the U.S. forces side in the area of our side on the MDL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our side demands the U.S. forces side suspend the operation of the facilities installed in the area of our side outside the \"MAC conference room\" within 48 hours since the latter received our telephone message. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the operation of the facilities is not halted till this time limit, our side will take necessary measures on its own initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. forces side do not heed to our advice, the KPA side will continue to take more necessary counter-measures.\r\n The U.S. forces side should be held fully accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Ambition for Military Domination over Asia-Pacific under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- Lurking behind the U.S. escalated arms buildup in areas around the Korean Peninsula is its sinister purpose to retain its grip on Japan as an advanced base for preempting an attack on the DPRK and as a strategically important stronghold for realizing its ambition for military domination over Asia-Pacific, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary.\r\n The U.S. is contemplating the deployment of a latest type nuclear carrier in its naval base in Yokosuka. This is indicative of the increasing potential danger of the U.S. imperialists' moves to step up arms buildup behind the scene of dialogue and preempt a nuclear attack on the north, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reality makes the DPRK skeptical about the U.S. commitment not to invade the DPRK. The U.S. words do not agree with its deeds at all. In other words, the U.S. is whetting its sword for invading the north behind the scene despite its oft-repeated talk that \"it has no intention to invade the north.\" This is eloquently proved by the recent military measures taken by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. arms buildup and the realignment of its forces in Japan further escalate the tension in Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula as they are aimed at launching the second Korean war by using Japan as the \"biggest stronghold\" for this operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the U.S. remains unchanged in its criminal design to stifle the DPRK by force with Japan as an advanced base for aggression and realize its ambition for military domination over Asia-Pacific and its gravity and danger are growing as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are closely following the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war and keeping themselves fully ready to cope with it.\r\n The U.S. had better ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by its reckless war adventure and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This movement can grow vital only through this struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for national reunification serves as a powerful means for meeting anti-reunification forces' challenges and bringing about a steady surge in the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration has helped convert the nation's movement for reunification into a nationwide patriotic movement orientated to national unity and reunification irrespective of differing ideologies, political views and religious beliefs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conversion of the movement for national reunification into a nationwide patriotic movement representing the whole nation's desire and will and the participation in it of broad strata of Koreans in the north and the south and abroad have provided conditions favorable for pro-reunification patriotic forces even under the situation where the pro-reunification patriotic forces stand in acute confrontation with the anti-reunification traitorous forces.\r\n Nothing will be impossible for the Koreans if they consider the movement for national reunification as a powerful weapon for accomplishing the patriotic cause of reunification and wage a nationwide struggle to throw overboard the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
