A month ago, it rounded off the deployment of two battalions of PAC-3 in south Korea and is now contemplating the deployment of new type missile Bunker Burst there within this year.\r\n These facts clearly prove that the U.S. is, in fact, hatching a dangerous plot to stab the DPRK on the back, while paying lip-service to \"peace\" and \"dialogue,\" and this is being pushed forward at a more desperate phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's invariable mode of counteraction to the hostile forces to return fire for fire and respond to the use of force in kind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is left with no option but to move for increasing its defence capacity for self-defense now that it has become clear that the U.S. continues pursuing the policy to stifle the DPRK by mounting a preemptive military attack on the DPRK prompted by its inveterate negation of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop running amuck, clearly understanding who its rival is.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It represents the revolutionary will of the Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK to win a decisive victory in the struggle for national reunification in this significant year with the might of reunification forces favoring the June 15 joint declaration and national cooperation, tiding over all tests and difficulties lying in the way of the reunification movement.\r\n This is what Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stating that the three-point cooperation guarantees the sovereignty and dignity of the nation, peace and independent reunification of the country and common interests and prosperity of the nation, the author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of cooperation for national independence must be held high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are the age-old sworn enemy of the Korean nation and the common enemy of all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should turn out in the nation-wide struggle through cooperation for national independence to settle all the scores with the U.S., staking the nation's dignity and destiny. The Korean nation should reject the U.S., the very one responsible for Korea's division, and should never tolerate the U.S. domination and interference in its internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of cooperation for peace against war should be held ever higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUpholding the banner of close cooperation for peace against war, all the fellow countrymen should drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea and root out the very source of a nuclear war. Everywhere Koreans live, they should build up a fierce flame of the struggle to drive away the U.S. troops so that they cannot but return to their den, unable to stay in south Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for reunification and patriotism should be achieved. Solidarity and alliance of all the political parties, sections and social strata in the north, the south and overseas should be realized. All the fellow countrymen should fight against the domination and interference of outside forces, against the outside forces and the national traitors and anti-reunification forces following their lead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is the ever-lasting treasured sword for victory in the struggle for national reunification. The joint declaration is immediately three-point cooperation and the realization of three-point cooperation is immediately the way of implementing the joint declaration. All the Koreans should warmly support the joint declaration and devote themselves to its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main guarantee for the defense of peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and for the advance of the movement for independent reunification at present lies in Songun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
