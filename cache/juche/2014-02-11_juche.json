Similar reckless remarks are heard from officials of the U.S. administration, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t At present, an atmosphere for the improvement of the north-south relations is prevailing in the Korean Peninsula thanks to the DPRK's sincere efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, such accusations are nothing but a trick to divert elsewhere the attention of the world public supporting the DPRK's measures for improved north-south relations and throw a snag in the way of their development. They are also aimed to provide a favorable circumstance for the realization of the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy by keeping up the military tension in the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the DPRK's active measures, the U.S. is getting more vociferous about \"nuclear threat from north Korea\" than ever before, but it is a foolish act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As evidenced by its recent crucial proposal and open letter to the south Korean authorities, steadfast is the DPRK's will to put an end to the history of national division and confrontation, forced by the foreign forces, with united efforts of the Koreans and defend the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear threat in the peninsula has come from the U.S. through history, and it is none other than the entire Korean nation that has suffered from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is intensively illustrated by the recent developments. The U.S. sent formations of nuclear-capable bombers into the sky above the West Sea of Korea for a nuclear striking rehearsal just when an inter-Korean Red Cross working contact was taking place for the reunion of separated families and their relatives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Most of those separated families are victims of the U.S. blackmail wth atomic bomb made during the 1950-1953 Korean War. Therefore, how can they share feelings of kinship with each other in peace under U.S. nukes which may be dropped any moment, and how can the situation of the Korean Peninsula be led to peace and stability?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History and facts clearly show that the U.S. never wants to see peaceful atmosphere in the peninsula or to have the Korean nation's demands met, but only seeks the realization of its domination strategy and an excuse to provoke a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the very one that disturbs the reconciliation and unity of the Korean nation and wrecks the peace and stability in the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its story about \"nuclear threat from north Korea\" will further reveal its true colors as a peace breaker and a nuclear war provocateur."

Kim Jong Il with far-sighted wisdom, extraordinary leadership ability and matchless courage and grit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I wish the heroic Korean people greater success in building a thriving socialist country under the leadership of H.E.

De la administracion norteamericana salen tambien tales disparates. \n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que estas palabras salen en estos momentos en que va preparandose en la Peninsula Coreana el ambiente favorable a la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas gracias a los sinceros esfuerzos de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la expresion de la artimana tendente a poner obstaculos en el avance de la mejora de las relaciones Norte-Sur desviando la atencion de la opinion publica mundial que apoya las medidas de la RPDC por la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. intenta mantener la tension militar de la Peninsula Coreana y preparar el ambiente favorable al cumplimiento de su estrategia de hegemonia sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU., aturdido por las activas medidas de la RPDC, insiste mas que nunca en la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\", pero en vano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo muestran la propuesta importante y la carta abierta del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC, es invariable su voluntad de poner fin con las fuerzas unidas nacionales a la historia de division y enfrentamiento causada por las fuerzas extranjeras y de defender la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistoricamente, la amenaza nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana proviene de EE.UU. Y la victima es precisamente toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo demuestra intensivamente la situacion actual. Hace poco, se realizo el contacto de trabajo de la cruz roja entre ambas partes coreanas para el encuentro de familiares y parientes separados. En aquel entonces, EE.UU. recurrio a los ejercicios de ataque nuclear movilizando las escuadrillas de cazabombarderos nucleares en el espacio sobre el Mar Oeste de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl tomar en consideracion que la mayoria de los participantes en el encuentro mencionado fueron separados forzosamente por el chantaje de bombas atomicas de EE.UU., como podrian compartir el sentimiento fraternal bajo las bombas nucleares de EE.UU. y como la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se dirigira a la paz y la estabilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia y la realidad demuestran que EE.UU. no tiene interes en el ambiente pacifico de la Peninsula Coreana ni en la demanda de la nacion coreana, sino requiere solo el pretexto favorable al cumplimiento de su estrategia hegemonica y al estallido de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el autor que obstaculiza la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales y perturba la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl rumor de \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\" revela mas la naturaleza de EE.UU. como perturbador de la paz y provocador de la guerra nuclear."
