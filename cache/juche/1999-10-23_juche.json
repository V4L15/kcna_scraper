But, the present state of its implementation is quite contrary to expectation and concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Right after the adoption of the agreed framework  the DPRK began implementing its commitments with freezing of all nuclear activities and totally lifted economic  restrictions imposed upon the U.S.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. has persistently pursued its hostile policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK militarily and further intensified it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. attitude is quite shameless as regards the offer of LWR, the core of the agreed framework. It provides for completing LWR project with  a generating capacity of 2 million kw  and delivering LWR to the DPRK till 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut a proper foundation has not yet been laid though five years have passed since the adoption of the framework. And the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization in charge of funding the project is in an abnormal shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Pointing out that the implementation of the agreed framework needs political will from the two sides, the article stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It is time for the U.S. to kick the ball and to express its stand explicitly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. truly respects the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework  and wants to implement it, the U.S. should show its good faith by fulfilling its commitments at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

A ground-breaking ceremony for the project could be held as late as august 19, 1997 and the  construction of their main building has not  yet started. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has  kept throwing obstacles in the way of heavy oil supply, too, under various pretexts, thus creating  serious difficulties and confusion in our economic performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has shunned the issue of lifting economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt was not until September 17, 1999  that it took a very partial measure of lifting a few economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Meanwhile, the U.S. conservative hard-liners who have called for the abrogation  of the framework, very displeased  with its adoption from outset, raised the issues of \"nuclear suspicion\" and \"missile threat\" and used the framework as a \"political soccer ball\"  for the republican party to \"gain the political upper-hand.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The conservative hard-liners  within the U.S. congress   have never stopped criticism of the policy of the Clinton administration toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.  which has so far pursued a \"soft landing policy,\" believing in the theory of \"collapse of North Korea,\" is now coming out with a \"stick and carrot strategy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"operation plan 5027-98\"  mapped out by the U.S. to ignite the second Korean war has entered the phase of implementation. It is strengthening  the triangular military alliance of the U.S., Japan and South Korea in a bid to establish the sphere of its domination  over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has carried out provocations  without let-up in the sky and the land and at sea of the Korean peninsula  to ignite a war against the DPRK. In June this year, it nudged the South Korean warhawks to orchestrate the serious military provocation at the west sea, thus  leading the  situation on the peninsula to  an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these facts go to  prove that over the past five years the U.S. has followed the road of violating the agreed framework and only pursued military and nuclear confrontation behind the curtain of negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whether the framework will succeed or get nullified totally depends on what attitude the U.S. takes toward its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    If it really wants to put an end to the confrontation on the Korean peninsula and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations  to meet the requirements of the times when  the Cold War is over,  it should sincerely implement its commitments under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. \r\n\r\n"
