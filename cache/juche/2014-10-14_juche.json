            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Newly Built Wisong Scientists Residential District\r\nPyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to the newly built Wisong Scientists Residential District.\n\t\t\t\t\t The residential district consists of multi-storeyed apartment houses of 24 blocks, schools, hospital, nursery, kindergarten, public buildings including various welfare service facilities and parks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the district before a map showing its bird's-eye view, he overlooked it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the exterior of the apartment houses and public buildings nicely decorated with diverse color tiles, he was very pleased to see them. He said they looked very attractive, presenting fantastic scenery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned in detail about the construction of the district, looking round various places of the district including apartment houses, primary school, junior secondary school, pharmacy, polyclinic, the Wisong Health Complex and solar heated greenhouse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that not only the flats looked cozy and convenient for settlers but they are fitted with complete sets of quality furniture and fixtures, adding that scientists would not need to bring in anything for living if all flats would have color TV sets, quilts and household articles provided by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the same day he also visited the newly built Natural Energy Institute of the State Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various places of the institute, he praised the builders for constructing it qualitatively as intended by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, in the name of the Central Committee of the WPK, extended thanks to the service personnel and builders who completed the residential district at the best level within the period the party promised to scientists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the construction of the Wisong Scientists Residential District was not aimed to demonstrate the architecture of the country but to enable scientists to put their hearts and soul into scientific researches without any inconvenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \"Our scientists are patriots who are devoting all their lives to building a rich and powerful nation, convinced that though there is no frontier in science, they have a socialist motherland and are under the care of the mother party. There is nothing to spare for them. It is necessary to project and treat scientists preferentially and always take care of them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He proposed building more apartment houses and public buildings like the Wisong Scientists Residential District in the Unjong science area to turn it into a world-class science city. And he took necessary steps with loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing expectation and belief that all the scientists and officials of the State Academy of Sciences would make a positive contribution to the cause of building a rich and powerful nation by registering signal scientific and technological successes with a high ideal and beautiful dream, he had a photo session with the scientists who will move into the new apartment houses in front of the statues of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il at the academy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Choe Thae Bok, Choe Ryong Hae, Han Kwang Sang and Kim Jong Gwan."

Pero, el tribunal del Estado declaro al policia la inculpabilidad porque el hizo la \"defensa justa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta sentencia injusta exploto en todo el territorio estadounidense una gran manifestacion de protesta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema es que estos asesinatos salvajes y los actos discriminadores contra los negros son tolerados y amparados por la administracion norteamericana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien cuando un muchacho negro fue fusilado por un policia blanco en agosto pasado en la ciudad de Ferguson del Estado de Missouri, la administracion norteamericana respondio con la represion brutal a los manifestantes de protesta sin castigar al asesino ni tomar las medidas necesarias para que no ocurrieran los asesinatos de discriminacion racial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos prueban claramente que la \"defensa de DDHH\" de que habla EE.UU. no pasa de ser un engano para ocultar su vil naturaleza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de hablar del \"problema de DDHH\" de alguien, EE.UU. debe limpiar primero su nariz."
