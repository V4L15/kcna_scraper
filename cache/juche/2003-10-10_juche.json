The DPRK has never threatened Japan: Not only before the signing of the declaration but after it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the declaration calls for settling the issue of Japan's liquidation of its past, not the \"removal of non-existent nuclear and missile threat\" to Japan from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Much talk about the removal of \"threat\" and \"abduction\" apart from that issue is little short of refusing to implement the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shelving the issue of redeeming the past after the publication of the declaration, the Japanese authorities are busy floating the fiction of \"threat\" from the DPRK in collusion with the U.S. They have stepped up its militarization and put spurs to the establishment of the missile defense system. They, at the same time, put spy satellites into orbit and put sanctions upon the DPRK, disturbing the regular service of its ships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's vicious anti-DPRK smear campaign and violation of the declaration will only stoke the bitter anti-Japanese sentiment and pent-up wrath of the army and people of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is closely following the attitude of the Japanese authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will never allow Japan to encroach upon its sovereignty and dignity even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should not violate the basic spirit of the declaration, well aware that Japan's liquidation of its past is a legal and moral obligation whose fulfilment brooks not a moment's delay. \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Europe, he added, must not fail to advance along the road of independence to ensure global peace and security and make contributions to the building of a new independent world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Juche idea gives perfect answers to all the theoretical and practical questions arising in defending and realizing independence, it is the most advanced and scientific idea which can lead to the independent development of Europe and the rest of the world by awakening the popular masses to consciousness under the conditions of the present era, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point in the struggle for defending independence and rights to independence is to repulse the pressure of the imperialist, dominationist forces and baffle their high-handed practices, hegemonism and unilaterialism, he said. It is important here to learn from the achievements and experience of socialist Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the role of the study and dissemination of the Juche idea in the struggle for making Europe independent, he set forth tasks and ways for conducting such work as constantly enlarging the organizations for the study of the Juche idea and widely staging activities for studying and disseminating the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the seminar by over 20 figures from 17 countries including France, UK, Russia, the Ukraine and Germany. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Highly praising the greatness and immortal feats of  Kim Jong Il in constantly deepening and developing the Juche idea founded by President Kim Il Sung and guiding the cause of independence along a road of victory, they expressed their firm resolution to build an independent Europe and make energetic contributions to the accomplishment of the cause of making the whole world independent under the uplifted banner of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Adopted at the seminar was the Paris Declaration on the building of an independent Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to Kim Jong Il was also adopted there. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He, with a plan to found a Juche-type party, organized the Down-with Imperialism Union, a historic root of the Party, on October 17, Juche 15 (1926). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the line of founding an independent party at the historic Kalun Meeting in 1930 and organized the Society for Rallying Comrades, the first party organization, with young revolutionaries of the new generation. It was the origin of the Workers' Party of Korea guided by the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his energetic leadership and activities, armed units and many basic party organizations were formed at home and abroad in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the latter half of the 1930s, the President organized the Internal Party Working Committee, the Changbai County Party Committee and the East Manchuria Party Working Committee and established the Party guidance system through the Party Committee of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party leadership over the revolutionary movement strengthened the close relations between the Party and the masses and made it possible to awaken and organize people and arouse them to struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on this precious experience and foundation provided during the arduous anti-Japanese armed struggle, he founded the WPK within two months following the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Korean people, rallied close around leader Kim Jong Il, are vigorously striving to develop and strengthen the WPK as the glorious Party of Kim Il Sung forever. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Stop Anti-DPRK and Anti-Chongryon Moves\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- The Korean people will never tolerate the Japanese reactionaries' moves against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) but will certainly force them to pay dearly for their moves, warns Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n Referring to the fact that the Japanese authorities are becoming more desperate in their moves against the DPRK and Chongryon, betraying bitterer anti-DPRK sentiment, the commentary dismisses this as an intolerable challenge to the Korean nation and an unpardonable provocation to the dignified DPRK and Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' recent reckless anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves are aimed to attain its sinister goal, pursuant to the U.S. policy to lay an international siege to the DPRK and pressurize and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policies pursued by the U.S. and Japan are identical in their nature. The only difference is that Japan seeks to achieve its ambition for reinvasion with the backing of the U.S. while the U.S. is keen to realize its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK with ease with the help of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abduction issue raised by the Japanese reactionaries at the Beijing six-way talks was a playing card they wanted to use to hamstring a solution to the nuclear issue. In this Japan sought a sinister aim to avoiding redemption of its past under the pretext of \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's act of perpetrating more crimes, instead of redressing the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean nation in the past, has evoked bitterer resentment and hatred of the army and the people of the DPRK against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to stop such criminal acts as getting on the nerves of the DPRK and threatening Chongryon, bearing in mind that their anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves will only precipitate their self-destruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
