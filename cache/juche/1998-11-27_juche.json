It is a brigandish logic. \r\n   There is no denying the fact that military threat comes not from the DPRK but from the United States engaging itself in continued war games against the north.\r\n   This year alone, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities have ceaselessly staged war exercises including \"'98 Foal Eagle\" large-scale joint military exercises, posing a grave threat to peace and stability in east Asia as well as the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The facts show that the U.S. intention to stifle the DPRK with strength and dominate Asia remains unchanged and that the U.S. troops are the very one who brings military tension to the region.\r\n   Worse still, the United States recently \"founded\" a \"non-proliferation mobile strike force\" allegedly to \"cope with the DPRK's proliferation of mass destructive weapons\" in coordination with the South Korean authorities.\r\n   The \"foundation\" of the force, timing to coincide with the continued U.S.-South Korea war exercises, will undoubtedly aggravate the situation of the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Therefore, the regional tension can never be eased as long as the United States keeps its troops in South Korea and persists in its moves to stifle the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. should give up its insidious intention to establish military domination over Asia, taking issue with the DPRK, and unconditionally withdraw all its aggression forces from the region. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

What they seek in this is to bring the whole of the Korean peninsula under the sphere of their influence and, with it as a springboard, attain their strategical purpose of establishing domination over Asia without much difficulty.\r\n   If they earnestly want to make military confrontation with us, we will also readily turn out in the final battle.\r\n   If a war of aggression is unleashed, a strong counterattack will certainly be launched. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
