            "content": "Legal Environment for Respecting Women in DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The women are being ensured position and dignity on a high level in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean women, who had been subjected to humiliation and insult in society in the bygone days, have grown to be a proud and mighty unit which undertakes an important role of the Songun revolution today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOver the last 60-odd years tens of thousands of ordinary women have been elected deputies to power bodies at all levels and more than 8 000 women  become heroines and holders of honorary titles and academic degrees and titles. It eloquently proves that the legal environment for respecting the women has been arranged well in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPresident Kim Il Sung raised the woman's question as a fundamental issue of the social revolution in the early days of his revolutionary activities. After the liberation of the country, he saw to it that the Law on Sex Equality which provides the women with equal rights with men in the socio-political, economic and cultural life was promulgated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn order to consolidate and develop this legal system, the DPRK government defines clearly in the constitution that the women have the social position and right equal with men and the state provides the women with every condition for their participation in public life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe specific laws including the Socialist Labor Law, the Law on the Nursing and Upbringing of Children and the Family Law stipulate that a working day of the woman workers with three and more children is 6 hours and all the children should be reared in the nurseries and kindergartens at the state and social expense. This solid legal foundation makes it possible for the women to do their share in the social progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Article 20 of the Law on the Nursing and Upbringing of Children specially deals with the protection of mothers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn accordance with the article, the state ensures maternity leave to women and the state and social and cooperative organizations bear their salary, food and share. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe state also registers in time the pregnant women through medical institutions including maternity hospitals, renders systematic medical service and assistance to their childbirth free of charge and protects their health after childbirth. In this way, the state takes care of the promotion of their health in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMore laws and policies for women have been instituted and enforced one after another in recent years.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, for successful settlement of the national reunification problem it is important to keep the principle of defending the demand for independence and interests of the Korean nation and the principle of settling all the issues arising in realizing the cause of reunification by the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To settle all the issues by our nation itself on the principle of independence is the only way for opening up a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Enhanced Role of Ideological and Cultural Means Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- To let all the ideological and cultural means including the media and literature and arts in a  socialist society get rid of the party guidance is as foolish an act as laying down one's powerful ideological weapon before class enemies. This will end up losing the gains of the revolution to the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideological and cultural means in socialist society can be used as a counter-revolutionary tool if they get rid of the guidance of the working class party. This is evidenced by what happened in those countries where socialism collapsed and capitalism revived. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-socialist elements in the countries once engaged in socialist construction worked hard to get the ideological and cultural means freed from the party guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called for the \"independence\" of the ideological and cultural means, asserting that these means should reshape the work system, methods and contents as required by the policy for \"reform\" and \"restructuring.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They prodded the ideological and cultural means into beginning to slander and attack socialism, gradually discarding its mission as an ideological weapon for building socialism. This made it impossible for the working class party to establish its system of leadership over them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said means which had been reduced to counter-revolutionary tools, freed from working class party's guidance, played a big role in bringing down socialism and reviving capitalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialist idea represents the might and source of socialism. If a working class party is to successfully build socialism it should steadily increase the role of the ideological and cultural means, retaining a firm grip on them. This alone would help the ideological and cultural means successfully fulfill their mission and duty on the socialist ideological front and reinforce the ideological position of socialism, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
