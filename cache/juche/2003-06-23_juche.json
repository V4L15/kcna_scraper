It is, therefore, ludicrous for such a country to call for checking the sale of even secondhand tires and shampoo, labelling them \"goods for double purpose\" for fear that they be used for military purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the general ethics of commerce that dealings are made in the interests of both parties, be they individuals or countries, and they should refrain from faulting the other after selling or buying goods. Yet, Japan is now saying this or that about goods it has already sold out. This is a base way of thinking peculiar to Japan only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly recognized fact that Japan's madcap campaign to stifle the DPRK is aimed to support the U.S. in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK by internationalizing the nuclear issue, laying an international siege to it and escalating the blockade against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a sign of Japan's loyalty to its master the U.S. Japan has gone into the lengths of checking the sale of commodities, talking about the \"possible use of goods for a civilian purpose for military purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts suffice to prove that the \"economic sanctions\" publicized by the Japanese reactionaries have reached the phase of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified its stand that it would regard any economic sanctions as a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not surprising that Japan kowtows and follows the \"superpower\" as it is an island country accustomed to meeting its interests in reliance upon a big power.

Korea war gamble assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Rsoi exercise launched by the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean war hawks is a war gamble aimed at a surprise attack on the DPRK in every way. It is an anti-peace crime as it escalates the danger of war and military tension on the Korean Peninsula, says Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary.\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the tense situation on the peninsula where the DPRK and the U.S. are standing in the most acute military confrontation with the military demarcation line in between, any slight conflict may trigger off a nuclear war. However, the United States is conducting the dangerous war game, clean indifferent to the present situation, which is like an act of adding fuel to the flames. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists provoke a war in Korea at last, the aggressors will be bound to be forlorn wandering spirits in face of our powerful army and people and, in the long run, the second Korean war will end in the final ruin of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carried away by a \"peaceful solution to the nuclear issue\" on its lips the South Korean authorities blindly accept the U.S. brigandish demands and join it in its moves for pressure and war against the north. This is like jumping into fire with faggot on one's back, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
