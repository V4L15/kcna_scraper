            "content": "KCNA comments on \"rumour about March crisis\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- \"The rumour about March crisis\" on the Korean peninsula invented by the United States and Japan is spreading more rapidly as if  a war were imminent.\r\n   In floating this \"rumour\" they mean that an irretrievably dangerous incident may break out on the Korean peninsula because its military situation can  return to what was before the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework owing to its breakup towards March this year.\r\n   Underlying the \"rumour\" is a sinister purpose the United States and Japan seek to attain their political and military, diplomatic and strategical purposes.\r\n   It is a trite method of the United States to threaten the other party by putting military pressure upon it  when it  fails to achieve its purpose on any issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has tenaciously put tough pressure upon the DPRK or resolutely refusing  to accept inspections of its underground structure. What the U.S. seeks in this is to meet its unjustifiable demands before this spring, come what may.\r\n   This eloquently proves that the U.S. is using the \"rumour about March crisis\" as a pressure lever to obtain more concessions from the DPRK.\r\n   The \"rumour\" encourages the United States, Japan and South Korea to give a finishing touch to their triangular military alliance allegedly to \"cope with contingency on the Korean peninsula.\"\r\n   To perfect the triangular military alliance, in essence, means to form the Asian version of NATO.\r\n   The U.S. seeks to prevail over the DPRK militarily by forming the NATO-type military organisation involving the U.S., Japan and South Korea in Asia as they had contained the former soviet union during the cold war era by setting up the NATO in Europe.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another dangerous military purpose of the \"rumour about March crisis\" is that the U.S. wants to use this to underscore the urgent necessity to form the Asian version of NATO, and create preconditions for carrying out \"operation plan 5027,\" a war plan against the DPRK, through this military organisation.\r\n   The \"rumour\" is also part of a propaganda campaign aimed at containing countries surrounding the DPRK militarily.\r\n   The South Korean \"News Journal\" January 21 said in an article entitled \"mystery of 'rumour about crisis of Korean peninsula' unveiled\" it has already been a settled opinion of international political circles that the real target of a new U.S.-Japan security treaty is none other than China.\r\n   As was pointed out by the South Korean journal, the U.S. attempt to produce the \"March crisis\" can be interpreted by its plan to contain China, an obstacle to the execution of its Asia strategy.\r\n   The \"rumour\" also serves as a smokescreen to bury the issue of Clinton's impeachment in oblivion.\r\n   Clinton seeks to bring the \"spring crisis\" to the Korean peninsula so as to avoid being impeached for his affairs with former White House intern Luwinsky and mislead public opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In another development, there is an underlying reason why the Japanese reactionaries are acting as the No. 1 trumpeter of the \"rumour about March crisis.\"\r\n   They intend to get down to the development of the \"theatre missile defense system\" on a full scale under the pretext that the DPRK launched a \"ballistic missile,\" not an artificial satellite, and take the \"March crisis\" as a golden opportunity to pave the road to reinvasion.\r\n   The \"rumour about March crisis\" is floated so wide to make it sound real that, going beyond the boundary of public opinion, it gives green light to an overall war against the DPRK and arouses deep apprehensions among world progressive peoples aspiring after peace and stability.\r\n   Now, the Korean people and People's Army are in full combat preparedness to cope with the \"March crisis\" loaded with a time-bomb. They are also taking strong self-defensive measures to root out the source of war from the planet. \r\n \r\n"
