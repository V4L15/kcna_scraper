The rocket reflected the spirit, courage and will of the DPRK.

            "content": "U.S., S. Korean Forces' Spy Moves against DPRK under Fire\r\nPyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the U.S. set up a Korea mission centre, whose main duty is to gather and analyze information on the DPRK, at the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) allegedly to \"counter nuclear threat from the north\". Meanwhile, the south Korean puppet forces are busy test-flying a new type reconnaissance plane for eavesdropping communication information in the region of the DPRK and collecting signal information about each weapon system with the purpose of deploying it to go into action within this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such moves are another unpardonable provocation aimed to \"overthrow the social system\" of the DPRK and ignite a war for aggression on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. and south Korean forces have run amuck to stifle the DPRK from every direction, vociferating about the \"north's nuclear and missile threats\". But their desperate moves cannot prove effective in the face of the invincible might of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Eventually, they came to resort to the sinister scheme with hope pinned on the espionage against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The espionage serves as an open hostile act against the opposite side and a prelude to war provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality indicates that the U.S. and puppet forces' sinister scenario to undermine the dignified socialist system of the DPRK and realize a wild ambition to invade it has entered the practical phase of full-scale implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon in the least the provokers who dare go reckless to do harm to the inviolable sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK while getting engrossed in the despicable acts of espionage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean-style war on terrorism will be conducted in a consecutive and intensive way to root out the plot-breeding machines of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet group of traitors who are the most wicked and brutal in the world."

At the talks he said that the \"country without common sense\" has in its possession a dangerous weapon.\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Rodong Sinmun Sunday terms Aso's description of the DPRK's nuclear deterrence as a dangerous weapon a revelation of his low judging ability and ignorance of matters and phenomena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is most dangerous on the earth is the U.S. nuclear weapons which are used to put threat and blackmail on other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear weapon of the DPRK is a powerful deterrence for self-defence to prevent a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, and it is a treasured sword for safeguarding the security and peace in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an established fact that a thermonuclear war on the Korean peninsula which may break out due to the U.S. ruckus for nuclear war would bring catastrophic disaster to the Japanese archipelago that has been reduced to the U.S. nuclear outpost and logistic base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In such aspect, the DPRK's nuclear weapons are defending the security of Japan, too. The Japanese reactionaries are obliged to thank the DPRK, not slandering it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a height of folly which would make even a cat to laugh for Aso, a man ignorant of the elementary relationships between cause and effect, to talk about \"common sense\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries had better keep silent, mindful that their tongue-lashing would invite greater shame and disgrace."
