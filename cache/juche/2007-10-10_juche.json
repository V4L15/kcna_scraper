Represented in it is the resolute idea of national self-determination to achieve the reunification of the country by the nation's own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The question of national reunification, an internal issue of the nation, cannot be resolved in conformity with the will and interests of the nation by submitting to and relying on outside forces. The reunification of the country can be achieved under all circumstances only when the will and interests of the nation are put before everything and everything is oriented to it in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" reflects the purpose and desire of the members of the nation to get united as fellow countrymen of the same ancestry, regardless of differences in idea, ideal and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has created one cultural tradition with one language, inheriting the same blood for long five thousand years. It can well achieve unity, if it depends on its character and patriotic spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the joint declaration have been proved clearly in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the joint declaration that the Korean nation, over the last seven years, has brought the changes of the times-- reconciliation, unity and national cooperation--putting an end to distrust and confrontation through a nationwide patriotic movement for reunification.  It has laid a solid foundation to rejoin the nation's severed blood and territorial veins and open up a new era of reunification and prosperity by the efforts of the nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Immovable is the status of the joint declaration. The reunification movement of the Korean nation which has entered a period of new upswing will certainly emerge victorious when it dynamically advances along the road of national independence and the road of national unity indicated by the joint declaration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
