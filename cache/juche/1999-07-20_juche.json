The exercise was aimed to make a surprise landing operation deep into areas in the \"enemy\" rear and form a second front and disintegrate the \"enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean ruling quarters agitated a war by mobilizing armoured vehicles,  helicopters and various types of equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   This proves that their war provocation manoeuvres for implementing the \"operation plan 5027-98\", a scenario for a reckless war against the north, are being put into practice at an extremely dangerous stage.    \r\n\r\n"

At the final he beat the opponent by Ippon in just 45 seconds by discouraging the latter from displaying feint  and special technique. He thus took a gold cup and a gold medal. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   He, 26, is enrolled at Korean University of Physical Education.\r\n   He took a fancy to judo from his childhood and learned it at a spare-time sports school from the age of 12. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   His strong will, wisdom and nimbleness drew attention of experts. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Two years later, he cut a conspicuous figure, receiving professional trainings at Korean University of Physical Education. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Since 1993 he always finished first at \"Paektusan Cup,\"  \"Mangyongdae Cup\" and \"Pochonbo Torch Cup\" sports tournaments, annual national games, and national championships. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   He made his debut at an international game in 1996.

In addition, her pace-setter was replaced three times, a transfusion of blood of scores of litres was performed and very expensive medicine was given for the recovery of her health. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   But, she does not know that the benefits of medical treatment she has received so far reach astronomical figures, when counted in cash. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   In the DPRK where the greatest man-centred politics has been administered, the system of universal free medical service has been enforced since the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War period (June 1950-july 1953). &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Under the advanced section doctor system enforced later, everyone is given systematic medical service--regular checkups, consultation, preventive inoculation, etc.--By his or her section doctor. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Such practices can be seen anywhere in Korea as a doctor visiting a patient and a hospital sending a notice on health of a patient discharged from it. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The law on public health was adopted in April 1980 to ensure health of all working people.    \r\n\r\n"

The one to the east is the Sungryong Temple, built in 1429 and rebuilt in the 18th century.\r\n   At first, it was dedicated to holding memorial services for Tangun, the founder of ancient Korea, and was called the \"Tangun Temple\". It continued to be called this for nearly 300 years, although memorial services were held both for Tangun and King Tongmyong, the founder of Koguryo. It was finally renamed the Sungryong Temple in 1725. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   It is a relatively large building covering a space of 117.83 square metres, with a facade of 12.85 metres and a flank of 9.17 metres. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   A building that shows the long history of Korea and the architecture of the mid-ri dynasty, this temple is of significance to the research into architectural history.\r\n   It was destroyed in the years of Japanese occupation of Korea and during the fatherland liberation war (June 25, 1950-July 27, 1953). But  thanks to the correct policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on preserving cultural remains it has been restored to its former condition. In addition, the state ensured that it was preserved in the compound of the palace so that youngsters could acquire a first-hand knowledge of Korean history and ancient architecture. It is visited by many Korean children, working people and foreign guests daily.    \r\n   \r\n"

Under this situation the Korean people and people's army will never tolerate the military adventure of Japan which has neither liquidated its colonial past nor healed the wounds it inflicted upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries, hell-bent on overseas aggression, dare to unleash a war against the north, the Korean people and people's army will mercilessly wipe out the aggressors with a thousand-fold retaliation and certainly give the vent to pent-up resentment against the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   They are well advised to properly judge their opponent and act with discretion.    \r\n\r\n"
