            "content": "Japan's Intention in Faulting \"Threats\" from DPRK Exposed \r\n Pyongyang, February 13 (KCNA) -- Jang Chol, a researcher of the Institute for Asian Studies at the Institute of International Studies, issued an article titled \"We Expose Dirty Intention of Japan Persistently Faulting 'Threats' from DPRK\" on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation and the whole world are welcoming the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation being created on the Korean peninsula, a land that had been frozen with confrontation and mistrust, and are unanimously expecting it to lead to the thaw in spring.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Japan is making desperate efforts to chill the atmosphere, being displeased over the dramatic change taking place in the situation on the Korean peninsula, the article said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Abe group seeks while persistently calling for \"maximum pressure\" is none other than exacerbation of the situation on the Korean peninsula to the extremes, the article said, disclosing the reason why the Japanese authorities are persistently faulting the \"threats\" form the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, it is to lay a political groundwork for building a war state with \"threats\" from the DPRK as an established pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Throughout history, Japan has used \"foreign pressure\" for realizing its ambition for becoming a big country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan nurtured the vaulting ambition of the \"conquest of Korea\" after the \"1868 Meiji Restoration\". It annexed Korea as its colony while talking about threats from Qing Dynasty and Czarist Russia, and went crazy to put the Asian continent under its control with the Second World War as an occasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After its defeat, Japan used the Korean War and the Vietnamese War as occasions for \"rapid growth\" and rearmament and after the end of the Cold War, it paved the path for overseas dispatch of troops under the pretext of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present authorities of Japan are effectively using \"threats\" from the DPRK for suppressing the political forces standing in the way of establishing a war state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, Japan aims at rebuilding a socio-economic foundation of a \"country capable of fighting a war\" with \"threats\" from the DPRK as a golden pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over more than half a century since the defeat of militarist Japan, the feelings of frustration following the defeat and war-weariness has pervaded the Japanese society and the new generation who had not experienced a war has emerged as the main players of society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the economic structure, the munitions industry has markedly shrunken as compared with the civilian industry or it has been deformed after being held down by the U.S. munitions-industrial conglomerates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The awareness of urgency felt by the Japanese authorities is that unless Japan makes a fundamental change in such socio-economic structure, it would reduce into a country which can never fight a war. So they found \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK as the most appropriate pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, Japan's aim is to distract the international community's serious eyes from its push for emerging as a military giant by citing \"threats\" from the DPRK as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For over five years in office, the Abe regime made a giant stride forward for turning Japan into a military giant as evidenced by the identification of security strategy and the establishment of new state security council in 2013, institution of three principles on the transfer of defence hardware in 2014, the adoption of all-inclusive security law in 2015 and the revision of Japan-U.S. agreement on mutual provision of goods and labor in 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This arouses due vigilance and serious concerns of the international community including the neighboring countries as it is a vivid revelation of dangerous ambition to retake the old position of the \"leader of Asia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To calm down and distract attention from it, Japan is going to use \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK as a shield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article stressed that as a responsible nuclear power which loves peace, the DPRK will never use nuclear weapons nor threaten any country or any region with nuclear weapons unless aggression-minded hostile forces encroach upon the sovereignty and interests of the DPRK, but will resolutely counter any acts of harassing peace and security of the Korean peninsula."
