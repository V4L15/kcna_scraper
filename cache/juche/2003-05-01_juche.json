            "content": "KCNA on recent DPRK-U.S. talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. again seeks to refer the DPRK's nuclear issue to the UN in the wake of the DPRK-U.S. talks held in Beijing to find a solution to the nuclear issue.\r\n According to AP, the Bush administration on April 25 said \"it will confer with allies about possibly seeking un sanctions against North Korea\" and Reuters reported that the U.S. would again propose the un security council adopt a statement denouncing North Korea's nukes. The South Korean MBC said that the U.S. is contemplating referring North Korea's nuclear issue to the UNSC again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are one more intolerable challenge to the dialogue partner as they clearly prove that the U.S. is escalating its desperate moves to put international pressure upon the DPRK and bring it to its knees by internationalizing the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula under the abused name of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims it does so because the DPRK did not accept its demand for the dismantlement of its nuclear program before dialogue but made a bomb-like statement at the talks. This is, however, illogical as it can convince no one. These can not be construed otherwise than a mean trick to justify its deliberate act intended to prevent talks from making progress and slander the DPRK which has approached the talks from a sincere stand and attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the talks were to make progress the U.S. should have clarified its political will to make a brave switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK at the talks and proved it in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. Putting an end to the bilateral hostile relations is, therefore, a precondition for the success of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. unilaterally repeated its previous assertion that the DPRK should scrap its nuclear program before dialogue without saying anything about such issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the dismantlement of the nuclear program is concerned, it means disarmament presupposing a \"verifiable inspection\". The Iraqi war proved that inspection is a prelude to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the DPRK, small in its territory and population, becomes a \"respected member of the international community\" after being completely disarmed, what does this mean to it? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHow can it counter with acts of aggression on the part of the U.S. which defies even the UN and international law for its own interests? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which possesses the biggest number of nuclear weapons in the world and poses a constant threat to other sovereign countries with them should scrap its nuclear program before such a small country as the DPRK does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent talks the DPRK made a new and bold proposal to clear up at the same time the bilateral concerns of the DPRK and the U.S., parties concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. But the U.S. attended the talks empty-handed and kept urging the DPRK to accept Washington's worn-out proposal for the dismantlement of its nuclear program  in consequence, the talks ended without results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. did not attend the talks to have an in-depth discussion on outstanding issues between the two countries but misused them for seeking a pretext for isolating and stifling the DPRK and securing a leverage to put unilateral pressure upon it in a bid to bring the nuclear issue to the un from the beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks proved fruitless due to the U.S. misbehavior. But the DPRK, which wants to peacefully settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, does not think that the talks came to a complete rupture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the DPRK-U.S. talks entirely depends on whether the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. brings up the nuclear issue for discussion at the un and seeks a resolution on applying sanctions against the DPRK, far from renouncing its hostile DPRK policy, the DPRK will take self-defensive measures, regarding it as the green light to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has a self-defensive capacity and physical deterrent force strong enough to wipe out any aggressors at a single stroke. The U.S. air attack will be countered with the air attack of the Korean People's Army and its land strategy with KPA land strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will closely follow the U.S. moves.    \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the calls serve as a militant banner for encouraging the army and people of Korea in their general advance for the building of a great prosperous power.    \r\n\r\n"

It has been clearly evidenced by the unilateral U.S. military attack on Iraq launched on march 20 without any legal ground or justification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1983 invasion of Grenada, the 1986 air raid on Libya, the 1989 invasion of Panama, the 1999 indiscriminate air raid on Serbia and Montenegro, the Afghan war after the September 11 incident, etc. are just part of state-sponsored military terrorism that reveals the tyrannical and criminal nature of the U.S. terrorist policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Subversive activities and assassination are also part of the trite terrorist methods employed by the U.S. it conducted at least 900 assassination operations between 1961 and 1976 alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, there were the blowing-up of a Cuban airliner in 1976 and the hijacking of an Egyptian airliner in 1985. And military coups took place in Asia, Africa and Latin America in the 1950s to establish pro-U.S. regimes, which clearly proves that they were engineered behind the scene by none other than the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the Cold War ended and the world greeted a new century, the U.S. has brought up the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK for discussion at the United Nations. This is a trick intended to internationalize the issue and find a pretext to perpetrate political, economic and military terrorism against the DPRK by abusing the name of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seeking to spark the second Korean war, new state terrorism, any moment. Though it comes out to the negotiating table with the DPRK, but it will be no more than a deceptive peace offensive, a hide-and-seek play, if the U.S. is not ready to make a bold decision to renounce its policy to stifle the DPRK and provide the latter with a legal security guarantee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No deceptive trick, fraud and terrorism can ever work on the DPRK, the article declared.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman accuses U.S. of derailing denuclearization Process in Kore\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today as regards the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. that has entered a crucial phase.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was proposed by the DPRK and it has made positive efforts for it as it is the wish of the whole Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has long consistently called for the denuclearization of the peninsula from its peace-loving stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn January 1992 it adopted the \"joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" with South Korea and has striven hard to implement it by the efforts of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. however, has persistently pursued its strategic aim, going against the desire of the Korean nation. Finally it went to the lengths of torpedoing the process of denuclearization in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly recognized principle and requirements of international law that nuclear weapons states should respect the status of non-nuclear states and refrain from threatening those countries with all types of arms including nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But from the very day of its assumption of office, the present U.S. administration, not content with pursuing an undisguised hostile policy toward the DPRK, singled out it as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a target of U.S. preemptive nuclear attacks, wantonly violating the NPT and all other international agreements and virtually reducing the inter-Korean declaration on denuclearization to a dead document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK called for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula to ensure peace and protect the sovereignty and the dignity of the nation, not to disarm itself under the U.S. pressure and fall victim to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality requires the DPRK to deter the escalating U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK with a physical force, compels it to opt for possessing a necessary deterrent force and put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is entirely to blame for this development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. describes this stand of the DPRK as \"threat\" and \"blackmail\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, however, illogical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was the first to have access to nukes and is the world's biggest possessor of weapons of mass destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration asserts that it is just for the U.S. to mount preemptive attacks on other countries when it deems necessary and has already perpetrated them in Afghanistan and Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a war group of the superpower openly listed the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack. Isn't it a threat? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can the possession of means by such a small country as the DPRK for just self-defence along be \"threat\" and \"blackmail\"?. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is just like a guilty party filing the suit first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already set forth a practical proposal to cross over the prevailing crisis in a peaceful manner and fundamentally settle the nuclear issue at the recent Beijing talks and the U.S. delegation went back after properly hearing about the DPRK's stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration is now becoming increasingly assertive that the DPRK's issue be referred to the UN again in a bid to internationalize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN is not a body meant to control small countries in the interests of big countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UNSC is to discuss the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, it should take to task the U.S. blame for having derailed the process of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. finally brings up the nuclear issue for discussion at the UN and abuses its name again, the DPRK will be left with no option but to consider taking practical measures to cope with an emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be clearer that what the DPRK will decide will be neither a threat nor blackmail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the Korean Peninsula becomes denuclearized or not will entirely depend on the U.S. policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
