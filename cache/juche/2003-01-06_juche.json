This fully reflects the spirit of national independence all the Koreans should follow and uphold. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By Our Nation Itself\" is based on a high degree of national consciousness that a nation is responsible for carving out its destiny and great national pride and self-respect that our nation is the best in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea represents the firm belief that there is nothing impossible in the world if the entire nation unites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If reunification is to be achieved, our nation aspiring after reunification should pool its efforts, not depending on the foreign forces opposed to reunification. When all members of the nation of the same blood and with the same history, unite close with each other, nothing will be stronger than this unity and more powerful than its strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The idea of  \"By Our Nation Itself\" means the vitality of the movement for national reunification. All Koreans should wage a more vigorous reunification movement under the banner of national independence in line with this noble idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Let us bring earlier the independent reunification by the concerted efforts of our nation\". This is the slogan of faith and struggle that all the Koreans should always put up on the road of concord, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the united struggle of the nation that can foil the anti-reunification and aggression moves of foreign forces. Pro-reunification patriotic forces at home and abroad should strengthen solidarity and unity based on the achievements and experience already gained and conduct steadily and dynamically patriotic movement for reunification to bring hope to the whole nation. \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, it stresses, the U.S. is entirely to blame for the present complicated situation.\r\n To peacefully resolve the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is the consistent stand of the DPRK. Thus it proposed to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the U.S., the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason why the U.S. should not accept the proposal, the best way for peaceful solution of the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have shown due response to the patient efforts of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. intensified international pressure offensives against the DPRK, insisting on \"scrapping nuclear program first before dialogue\". This serious situation compelled the DPRK to start removing seals and monitoring cameras from the frozen nuclear facilities so as to normally operate them necessary for production of electricity. This is part of the DPRK's mode of revolutionary and independent counter responding to the U.S. imperialists' tough policy with the toughest one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation is very serious and unpredictable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a strong counter measure by itself in defence of the sovereignty of the country and the right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists misjudge the might and will of the DPRK and make a preemptive attack, the DPRK will deal a mortal blow to the war provokers with its powerful counter strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warhawks should contemplate.
