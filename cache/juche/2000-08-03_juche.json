            "content": "Dynamically pushing forward  global cause of independence \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a by-lined article calls for more dynamically pushing forward the global cause of independence in a signed article explaining the calls of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea published on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The calls clearly prove the firm stand of the WPK and the DPRK government to make a positive contribution to realising the global cause of independence as they clarify the basic idea of the WPK's foreign policy, i.e. independence, peace and friendship, and principles governing its activities, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The independence of all countries and nations of the world can be achieved only when the whole world is made independent. It is, therefore, a common task of the world people struggling to realise the independence of their countries and nations to build an independent new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An independent world can be built only by the concerted efforts of the world people advocating independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the monopoly of capital is assuming an international dimension while the imperialists are conspiring with each other in the moves to check the people's cause of independence. This shows that it is impossible to build an independent, new world unless the world people are united to defend independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should get united as one under the banner of independence to emerge victorious in the struggle to realise their independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is necessary to defend the socialist cause and vigorously push ahead with the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No force can stop humankind from going in for socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Pyongyang Declaration which calls for defending and advancing the socialist cause is giving strong impetus to the world socialist movement with tremendous attraction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to achieve the global cause of independence it is necessary to resolutely smash the imperialists' moves for \"globalization.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is essential to frustrate the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the imperialists and their dominationist moves and build a new international order based on justice, equality and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The victory of the human cause of independence would have been unthinkable without an anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one should harbor even the slightest illusion about imperialism. A determined struggle should be waged against the imperialists from a principled stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The non-aligned movement should be further strengthened and developed under the banner of independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The friendship and solidarity among the peoples who advocate independence are one of the fundamental guarantees for ensuring the independent development of each country and achieving the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Independence, peace and friendship are the basic principles which the world people should hold fast to in the struggle to make the whole world independent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The global cause of independence is sure to be achieved thanks to the joint struggle of the world's progressives. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. sophism assailed \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Republican Party in a draft program published on July 28 let loose a string of sophism with the DPRK in mind. It called for \"deterring actions of aggression, preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and building up effective missile shields\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such outbursts will convince no one and can never be justified as they were made by those who are keen on chilling the atmosphere of detente prevailing on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. conservative hard-liners obsessed by their wild ambition to become the \"world's only superpower\" consider the situation on the Korean peninsula developing in favour of detente as an obstacle in the way of achieving their strategic goal to establish the \"missile defence\" system at any cost and thus get unchallenged military strategic upper hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has so far kept its aggression troops in northeast Asia and steadily reinforced them under the pretext of the DPRK's \"threat\" and cited this \"threat\" as a pretext for establishing a \"missile defence\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the sign of detente on the peninsula has put the U.S. under worldwide fire and its conservative hard-liners in an embarrassing position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They get nervous and vexed about the defusion of the tensions because they want to see a divided and unstable Korea, not reunified and peaceful Korea. The U.S. should face up to the reality and drop its improper attitude. \r\n\r\n"

He is a benevolent teacher of the Korean scientists and technicians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK, though small in its territory and population, is protecting the sovereignty of the country from such world superpower as the U.S. and building a powerful nation. This is entirely ascribable to the politics of attaching great importance to ideology, the army and science and technology pursued by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's politics of attaching great importance to science and technology is a short cut to the construction of a powerful country, and the Korean people are sure to triumph thanks to this politics, he added. \r\n\r\n"

This brigandish logic can never come true as it is designed to hamstring and stamp out Juche character and national character of all the countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their moves for \"globalization\" are sure to misfire as it is a reactionary one going against the independent aspiration of the peoples in the present era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists' moves for \"globalization\" are preventing developing countries in southeast Asia, Africa and other parts of the world from operating their economies to meet their own wishes and interests and, worse still, encroaching upon even their political sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many developing countries are strongly opposed to the imperialists' moves for \"globalization,\" clearly seeing through the nature of their cunning machinations to impose unfair mode of politics and economy upon them under that signboard and its evil consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Unite to eradicate the consequences of the 'globalization'\". This is the slogan put up by developing countries today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Human history proves that with no moves can the imperialists stop or reverse the historic advance of the popular masses for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialist-touted \"globalization\" aimed at world domination is fated to misfire in face of powerful struggle of developing countries. \r\n\r\n"
