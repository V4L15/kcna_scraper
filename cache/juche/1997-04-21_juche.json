In this way, they hurriedly concluded the \"trial\" for them, which had continued nearly a year and a half since the \"first hearing\" took place. By doing so, they intend to keep in oblivion the crimes of the Chun and Roh and move up formalities of \"amnesty\" for the traitors. As soon as the \"trial\" came to an end, the \"granting of amnesty\" to the traitors has become an outstanding political issue. The \"new Korea party\" officials have openly said Kim Young Sam would announce the \"amnesty\" for them by May.\r\n   Kim Young Sam enacted a \"May 18 special law\", arrested Chun and Roh and sentenced them to death penalty and a life imprisonment. But the steps were only a popularity-hunting gesture for defending the murderers, assuaging public resentment against him involved in the largest-ever slush fund scandal and emerging from the serious crisis. \r\n\r\n"

He has been engrossed in treacheries, fascist sword-brandishing and unheard-of corrupt politics since he took office with the signboard of \"politics of reform\" and \"civilian politics\".

            "content": "On Juche idea \r\nTokyo 21 ( KNS) - We received many questions what is Juche idea by E-mail.\r\n   So the editor of Korea news service in Tokyo writes  simply on the Internet.  Juche is Korean word. It means the subject in English.\r\n   The Juche idea represents an invariable guiding idea of the Korean revolution and a  revolutionary banner of this time. \r\n  A progressive idea plays an important role in socio-historical progress. When the people are guided by a progressive idea, they can be a powerful creator of history.\r\n  Of course, it does not mean that all progressive ideas play the same role in socio-historical development. Their role is different according to how they represent the aspirations and interests of the popular masses and how correctly they show the path which�@must be followed in struggle. There were ideas which reflected the aspirations of progressive classes of society even before the emergence of the working class.\r\n  But due to their historical and class limitations the trends of thought in the past age could not but be hampered in the role they played in social development. The revolutionary ideas of the working class alone can correctly reflect the demands of the time and aspirations of people and give a powerful stimulus to socio-historical development by inspiring the people to wage the revolutionary struggle.\r\n Late President Kim Il Sung created Juche idea after acquiring a deep insight into the requirements of a new era when the oppressed and humiliated masses of the people became masters of their destiny. \r\n  Thus he developed their struggle for Chajusong(independence) onto a higher plane and opened up the age of Juche , a new era in the development of human history.\r\n  The revolutionary idea of the working class emerges as the reflection of the mature demand of history and the revolution in their development.\r\n  In order to advance the revolution under the new historical conditions, the working class and the people of every country, conscious of being masters, had to solve all problems in accordance with their actual situation. In Korea, this was a particularly important matter because of the peculiarities of historical development and the complexity and arduousness of the revolution. The Korean revolution demanded more urgently that the popular masses hew out the path of revolution in an independent and creative manner.\r\n  The Juche idea was created on the basis of such a practical requirement of the Korean revolution.\r\n\" The revolution in each country should be carried out responsibly by its own people, the masters, in an independent manner, and in a creative way suitable its specific conditions.\" \r\n   It is the essence of Juche idea.\r\n   The Juche idea is a new philosophical thought which centres on man. It raised the fundamental question of philosophy by regarding man as the main factor, and elucidated the philosophical principle that man is the master of everything and decides everything. \r\n   That man is the master of everything means that he is the master of world and of his own destiny; that man decides everything means that he plays the decisive role in transforming the world and in shaping his destiny.\r\n  The philosophical principle of the Juche idea is the principle of man-centred philosophy which explains man's position and role in the world.\r\n  The Juche idea was created by late President Kim Il Sung and is developed and enriched by Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
