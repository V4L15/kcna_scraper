His brilliant feats are recorded in the Korean people's history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He participated in many operations of the fraternal Chinese people to liberate northeast China after the liberation of Korea, thus setting a striking example of proletarian internationalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army during the Fatherland Liberation War fought to beat back the U.S. imperialists' armed invasion, he skillfully organized and commanded combat operations of the people's army units on the forefront pursuant to the strategic and tactical policies of the President Kim Il Sung and thus made a great contribution to wiping out enemies and defending the freedom and independence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was awarded the title of hero of the republic and central military academy no. 1 named Kang Gon Military Academy in recognition of the exploits he performed in building revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A Pyongyang city memorial service took place at the People's Palace of Culture today to commemorate his 50th death anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea, in his memorial address said that Kang Gon's life was a noble life of a loyal revolutionary who, holding Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the great leader of the revolution, devoted his all to the struggle for the victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche under his leadership. It was a brilliant life which fully displayed the staunch spirit and noble trait of a communist revolutionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called on all the party members, officers and men of the people's army and people to cherish loyalty to the party and the leader as a revolutionary faith and obligation as anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners did and uphold the respected Kim Jong Il's ideology and leadership with one mind and one purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the service were party and state leading officials including Kim Il Chol and Jon Pyong Ho. \r\n\r\n"

This is logic of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although a decade has passed since the demise of the Cold War, the imperialists are again triggering off an arms race in the world. The U.S. moves to establish the \"theatre and national missile defence\" systems are a main factor of the arms race. Imperialists' much publicized \"threat\" from someone is nothing but a subterfuge. The new arms race sparked by them is aimed at revamping military monopolies, saving militarized economy from its crisis and containing other big powers in a bid to realise their wild ambition to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists' arms race is always beset with dangers of a new world war, a thermo-nuclear war. Their arms race presupposes a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the world is embroiled in the arms race, no one can predict when a new world war, a thermo-nuclear war will break out, the article notes, calling for waging a dynamic struggle worldwide to check and foil the imperialists' nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Neither nuclear weapons nor biological and chemical weapons in the world can overpower a united force, the article observes, concluding that only when progressive humankind struggle in unity, can they surely foil the imperialists' arms race. \r\n\r\n"
