He expressed full support to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   P.K. Kodiyan, chairman of the All India Agricultural Trade Union, in a statement dated Jan. 6 supported the joint editorial which describes the New Year 2000 as a year of all-out forward march to make a decisive advance in building a powerful nation under the leadership of the Worker's Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed belief that the heroic Korean people would make a great success in the New Year under the leadership of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the joint editorial was disseminated in Guyana and Uganda. \r\n\r\n"

It is the will of the Korean people to delve into the crimes of the U.S. who covered the land with blood and corpses of our fellow countrymen to the end and make them pay dear. The international law does not require applying of prescription to the war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should clearly know that the more they try to conceal the crimes fully exposed to the world, the more they reveal their true colors as wicked aggressors and murderers. \r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the confab they stressed the need for the U.S. and Japan to \"unify their policies\" toward the DPRK, asserting that it poses short-term \"threat\" to them and continues missile development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This betrays the intention of the U.S. and Japan to continue their anti-DPRK moves conspiring with each other as in the past, so in the year 2000, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They regard the DPRK as an obstacle to carrying into practice their strategies of Asia and world domination. They seek to grip the Korean peninsula as a \"dagger\" with which to cut off a big piece of fat, that is Asia, as they please and, furthermore, put the whole world under their control. Hence, they are making so desperate efforts to swallow up the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such anti-DPRK moves at the beginning of the year compel  us to keep ourselves on a high alert and increase our self-reliant defence capabilities.

Jin Kwan by the South Korean authorities clearly shows that the \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" on their lips are nothing but a jargon and hypocrisy to cover up their anti-reunification and anti-national nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present rulers of South Korea should properly judge the will of the Buddhists to see a reunified country without fail, a paradise of the century, in which the desire to get rid of pain and attain happiness comes true,  and immediately halt the suppression harmful to national reunification and great national unity. They should also withdraw the prison sentence passed upon rev. Jin Kwan and release him without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement expressed the belief that all the Buddhist orders and organizations in South Korea would take positive actions to expose and frustrate the fascist repression of the pro-reunification patriots by the South Korean authorities and get rev.

They are working hard to realize \"globalization\" by painting it as  \"humanitarian.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The progressive people of the world are urged to clearly see through the true aims and deceptive nature of all sorts of unsound reactionary ideologies of imperialism and thoroughly frustrate them to realise their desire. \r\n\r\n"
