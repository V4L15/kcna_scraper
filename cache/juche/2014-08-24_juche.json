He also formulated the Songun politics as the most powerful, main political mode under socialism in the present era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun revolutionary idea of the WPK the validity and the scientific accuracy of which were clearly proved in the rigorous and arduous struggle is fully displaying its attraction and vitality as the days go by. It is also shedding its rays before the whole world as the encyclopedic Songun revolutionary idea giving perfect answers to all the theoretic and practical issues required by the era and the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter underlined the need to thoroughly establish the unitary commanding system of respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un within the whole army, make it politically, ideologically and morally stronger and firmly train all its service personnel to be a-match-for-a-hundred fighters and Mt. Paektu tiger-like ones with Kim Il Sung's and Kim Jong Il's military strategies and tactics, heroic fighting spirit and perfect ability for fighting a real war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Army should always take the lead in achieving the great army-people unity and displaying the might of army-people coordinated operations and demonstrate its honor as the standard-bearer and shock brigade in carrying out the plan of the supreme commander for building a thriving socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those in the field of national defence industry should produce quality Korean-style ultra-modern weapons and equipment at the best level to raise the level of modernization of the weapons and equipment of the People's Army, and further consolidate the all-people, nation-wide defence system to turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the officials, party members and other people should regard their work sites as outposts for defending socialism and raise a stronger wind of the campaign for creating the new Korean speed by learning from the fighting spirit and creative work style displayed by the People's Army, thus foiling the moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and bringing about a radical turn in the building of an economic power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers finally ignite a nuclear war, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will make them bitterly realize what a true war is like and how miserable end those who are fond of playing with fire will meet, and accomplish without fail the historic cause of national reunification, the long-cherished desire of the Korean nation, by dint of arms of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Immensely rosy is the future of the service personnel and people of the DPRK and the final victory is in store for them as the great Juche idea and the Songun revolutionary idea is clearly indicating the road to be followed by them and there is the outstanding and tested leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un, the reporter concluded."
