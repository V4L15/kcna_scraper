This is a blatant violation of the DPRK's sovereignty, a serious threat to world peace and security and the height of the brigandish arbitrary practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with fabricating the illegal \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK in the UN arena, the U.S. is wooing its followers to put mean independent sanctions including sanctions against enterprises of the third country having business with the DPRK, openly talking about filling the gap.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unilateral sanctions being imposed by the U.S. to stifle the DPRK are an illegal and unethical action to bring down the social system of a sovereign state and encroach on its right to development and existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As it has become clear that the hostile forces' moves to impose harsh sanctions on the DPRK to stifle it are aimed to infringe upon its right to existence and bring down its \"social system,\" its toughest countermeasures are entirely just in the light of not only international law but also the right to self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The harsher sanctions to be slapped by the U.S. and its followers against the DPRK would only make its self-development capability stronger and precipitate their miserable end."

Y ateniendose al principio de la ley internacional, desde el XX periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, efectuado en 1965, ha venido aprobandose como resolucion la \"declaracion sobre la intolerable intervencion en los asuntos internos estatales y la defensa de la independencia y la soberania\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC no tiene restriccion por haber declarado la retirada del Tratado de No Proliferacion en marzo de 1993 frente a la grave situacion creada en aquel entonces por la amenaza de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y haberlo puesto en vigencia en enero de 2003. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC tampoco puede ser problematico, porque es el ejercicio del derecho al desarrollo de cosmos, atribuido por la ley internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. fabrico la \"resolucion de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU cuestionando el derecho legitimo de la RPDC incluso el de autodefensa de un Estado soberano, lo cual deviene brutal violacion de la soberania de la RPDC, grave amenaza a la paz y seguridad del mundo y climax del despotismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecho con la fabricacion de la ilicita \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-RPDC, instigo a las fuerzas seguidoras a ejercer las sanciones independientes incluso la sancion sobre las empresas extranjeras relacionadas con la RPDC, insistiendo en la necesidad de llenar el vacio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana de sancion y aplastamiento unilaterales de EE.UU. resulta un crimen antietico que persigue el derrocamiento de regimen de un Estado soberano e infringe los derechos al desarrollo y subsistencia de otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon mil veces justas las contramedidas superintransigentes de la RPDC tanto en virtud de la ley internacional como desde el punto de vista del derecho a la autodefensa, ya que se ha evidenciado que la brutal campana de sancion y aplastamiento de las fuerzas hostiles persigue la privacion del derecho a la subsistencia de la nacion coreana y el derrocamiento del regimen socialista de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas EE.UU. y sus satelites intensifiquen la sancion anti-RPDC, tanto mas se hara fuerte la capacidad de autofortalecimiento de la RPDC y se adelantara el fin tragico de ellos mismos."
