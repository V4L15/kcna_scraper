And he established the Worker's Party of Korea, the revolutionary government and the revolutionary armed forces and thereby provided a sure guarantee for firmly defending and glorifying the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He set it as the supreme task of the nation to reunify the country and wisely led the struggle to put it into practice. Even when he was in the last days of his life, he worked out a blueprint for the country's reunification and opened up a bright vista for reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The most brilliant  revolutionary exploit performed by him for the country and the revolution, the times and the history was that he successfully solved the issue of successor to leadership long ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Gifted with unbounded love and trust in the people, he always mixed with them  and soldiers all his  revolutionary life, bestowed deep benevolence upon them and enabled them to fully enjoy the dignity and worthwhile life as independent human beings.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A recognized veteran of world politics, he illumined the road ahead of the world progressives and conducted untiring activities for the global independence, thus performing undying exploits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was the great founder and leader of Juche Korea who highly displayed the dignity and might of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd he, together with the eternal prosperity of the country,  will  live in the hearts of the Korean people as the founder of socialist Korea and as the eternal banner of victory of the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean revolution has unswervingly advanced along the road of Juche under the guidance of Kim Jong Il, who has faithfully carried forward the cause of Kim Il Sung, thus bringing in a new phase of upsurge.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The respected leader Kim Jong Il made sure that the President is preserved in state at the Kumsusan Memorial Palace, the sacred temple of Juche, and the Juche era and Sun's Day were instituted and Kim Il Sung constitution announcing that he is the eternal President of the DPRK was adopted so as to make him remain always alive with our people. This is the most precious feat made by Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The past five years have been marked by rigorous and grim ordeals unprecedented in the history of the Korean revolutionary struggle. But Kim Jong Il, taking the heavy burden of the country and revolution on his shoulders, has led the party and the army, thus providing the surest guarantee for certain victory in the struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to his invincible policy of giving priority to the army, we have been able to win one victory after another in the confrontation with the imperialists scheming to stifle the DPRK and firmly defend Korean-style socialism and open a shortcut to the building  of a powerful nation with firm confidence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We, under his experienced and tested leadership, will continue to dynamically advance with conviction in victory of revolution and optimism, and certainly achieve the cause of socialism, the popular masses' cause of independence, with flying colors. \r\n \r\n\r\n"
