Kumgang Resort, July 19 (KCNA) -- A pro-reunification meeting of educational workers in the north and the south of Korea was held at Mt. Kumgang resort Monday to implement the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n Amid the playing of the song \"Glad to See You\" the members of the delegations of the north and the south entered the meeting place hands in hands, chanting slogans for reunification such as \"National Reunification\" and \"We Are One.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large Korean peninsula flag was hoisted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at a meeting of representatives of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yun Jong Gon, chairman of the General Federation of Teachers Organizations of south Korea who is heading its delegation, referred to the immeasurable sufferings the fellow countrymen have undergone owing to the division of the country by foreign forces. He expressed the firm belief that the meeting would lay another cornerstone to bring earlier the day of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Kim Yong Do, chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Educational and Cultural Workers Trade Union who is heading the delegation of the north side, stressed the need to lift voices demanding the total withdrawal of the U.S. forces from this land. He also underscored the need for the educational workers in the north and the south to closely cooperate, solidarize and unite with each other to lay a solid foundation for building a reunified prosperous powerful nation on the basis of national cooperation provided by the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Won Nyong Man, chairman of the south Korean Teachers Union who is heading its delegation, said educational workers in the south and the north have gathered with the ardent desire to bring earlier the day of the country's reunification by carrying forward and applying the spirit of the joint declaration. The educational workers also have a duty to fulfill to pave the way for the divided nation to become one, the way of achieving independent reunification, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory art performance was given by schoolchildren from the north side and sports and amusement games and joint art performance of educational workers in the north and the south took place at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A joint resolution of the meeting for implementing the joint declaration was adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The educational workers in the north and the south will make all efforts to actively implement the joint declaration with love for the fellow countrymen so that their disciples may stoutly live as the masters of the peace-loving reunified country free from foreign forces and war and to further strengthen solidarity and cooperation between them, the resolution noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the educational workers in the north and the south looked round the fine art and handicraft exhibition sponsored by the north side as part of the meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but a dangerous move to wind up the preparations for the second Korean war according to its strategy of preemptive attack in order to inflict another disaster of war upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to stem the trend of the development of the inter-Korean relations characterized by the growing atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation and foster the confrontation between the north and the south. Their ulterior aim is to keep south Korea under a permanent occupation and provoke a new war of aggression against the DPRK with it as a military springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and preparations for a war can not go together. Success of the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula depends on whether the U.S. drops its hostile policy towards the DPRK or not. The \"dialogue\" on the lips of the U.S. is not aimed to solve the problem but to earn time to complete the war preparations. The war preparations stepped up by the Bush bellicose forces through the increase of their combat power behind the curtain of \"dialogue\" only compel the DPRK to bolster its physical deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the principled stand and the mode of defending the sovereignty maintained by the people of the DPRK that it should be fully prepared for both dialogue and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson notes that if the U.S. imperialists unleash a war against the DPRK at any cost the latter will fully demonstrate the might of the defence capability for self-defence its people have built up by tightening belt.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its proposal to post its \"resident military attache\" in Taiwan in the future is also pushed forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Taiwan is part of the inseparable territory of China. China has consistently stood for the national sovereignty and territorial integrity based on the principle of \"peaceful reunification, one country and two systems\" and worked hard to preserve them in various ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S., however, is overtly and covertly rendering political and military aid to Taiwan, giving a shot in the arm of its \"forces advocating independence\", while voicing  support to the \"one China\" policy. This is an open interference in the internal affairs of China, an indication that the U.S., regarding China as a major rival in establishing domination over Asia, seeks to contain that country and block its reunification by supporting Taiwan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. double-dealing behavior is touching off strong concern and opposition of China as it runs counter to the three joint communiques adopted between China and the U.S. and reneges on the promise made by the U.S. to oppose \"Taiwan's independence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese People's Liberation Army is now staging joint military exercises of its three services in its southeastern waters to command air and sea by mobilizing its missile units and other types of modern weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis proves China' strong counter-measure against the unjust U.S. interference in the issue of Taiwan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stand of China to make a \"comprehensive plan for reform\" aimed to boost the military capability to check the U.S. military interference in the issue of Taiwan and thoroughly implement it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. \"Proliferation Security Initiative\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- A U.S. assistant secretary of State, raising a hue and cry over the non-existent DPRK's drug smuggling, let loose sophism that it sponsors the drug smuggling and its income is likely to be spent for the ballistic missile development.\r\n This is nothing but a sinister attempt of the Bush administration to tarnish the image of the DPRK on the international arena and justify the \"proliferation security initiative (PSI)\" in a bid to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized PSI is a product of its hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed to blockade and suffocate it in the light of the background against which it was set out and the aims sought by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After setting out PSI in April last year, the U.S. came out with a \"proposal\" on setting up \"a proliferation security system for weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\" at the G-8 summit in June. On September 4 the so-called eleven member nations of the PSI met to adopt the \"principle of control over WMD.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to prove that the U.S. loudmouthed PSI is a foolish trick to justify the inspection, control and blockade against the independent sovereign countries including the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the Bush administration keeps floating all kinds of lies about the DPRK in a bid to justify PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hue and cry over \"state-sponsored drug smuggling\" and \"the use of its income for the missile development\" is nothing but a sinister ploy to charge the DPRK with \"proliferating WMD\" and internationalize the sanctions and blockade against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified more than once, drug abuse and smuggling are banned by law in the DPRK as it reduces man to a mental cripple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The production, use and export of drug and mental stimulant for health care and scientific researches are under way in the country under a strict state control and they are subject to laws and order. And they are successful thanks to the exchange of information and cooperation between the DPRK and the International Narcotics Control Board. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The absurdity of the U.S. loudmouthed \"state-sponsored drug smuggling\" was clearly evidenced by the fact that an Australian court handling the case of the DPRK trading ship \"Pongsu\" this year ruled that the state was not involved in the case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has strictly based itself on its strong independent national industry in building such powerful war deterrent force as missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S., the world's biggest criminal proliferating weapons, is linking the DPRK's development of missiles, its means for self-defence, with the \"drug smuggling\". This is an insult to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. topped the world's list of arms exporters by selling weapons worth some 13.3 billion U.S. dollars or 45. 5 percent of the world's total earning by sale of conventional weapons in 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which has done illegal acts in arms export, posed a threat to other countries and gained huge profits from it. Yet it has kept mum about these criminal acts. It is ridiculous of the U.S to try to isolate and stifle the DPRK by charging it with \"proliferating WMD,\" labelling it a \"rogue state\" and putting PSI into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should own its responsibility for being the world's biggest proliferator of WMD and give up its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
