            "content": "Minju Joson comenta ultimas medidas militares de la banda de Abe\r\nPyongyang, 20 de abril (ACNC) -- En estos dias, los reaccionarios japoneses dan movimientos ajetreados como organizar la \"comandancia general de fuerzas terrestres\", encargada de la direccion unificada sobre las operaciones militares de las \"Fuerzas Terrestres de Autodefensa\", y librar el \"ejercicio de rescate de la isla apartada\" movilizando el recien fundado \"cuerpo de movilizacion anfibia\" llamado como \"infanteria de marina de version japonesa\". Por otra parte, impulsan el montaje final de F-35A tras importar del complejo de industria belica de EE.UU. las piezas para 42 aviones de ese tipo con el fin de emplazar 10 de ellos dentro del ano en curso y pusieron en servicio uno tras otro el ultramoderno submarino de ataque Seiru y el dragaminas Hirado.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual divulgado hoy, el periodico Minju Joson califica tales movimientos de expansionismo militarista a ultramar de la desesperacion agonica para alcanzar a toda costa el siniestro objetivo politico, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, en el circulo politico de Japon se arma un hormigueo debido al escandalo de corrupcion en que esta involucrada la familia de Abe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara salir de la desfavorable situacion politica, Abe trata de levantar la oleada del militarismo. Asi, quiere esquivar las criticas sociales dirigidas a si mismo y realizar su ambicion de la toma perpetua del Poder y la reagresion militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, los reaccionarios japoneses temen mucho a que fracase su ambicion de convertir el pais en potencia militar debido al cambio de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana hacia la distension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben actuar con prudencia al conocer bien que sus maniobras para el renacimiento de militarismo y la reagresion llevaran el archipielago japones al abismo de aislamiento y ruina."
