Korean authorities under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) made public a statement on Feb. 20, denouncing the U.S. and South Korean authorities for planning large-scale war drills, according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korea-U.S. combined command officially announced that the \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration exercise\" would be staged from March 19 to 26 and the \"Foal Eagle\" joint military drill from march 4 to April 2. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These U.S.-led joint military drills are a very dangerous exercise for an attack on the north designed to unleash a total war on the Korean Peninsula with a preemptive nuclear strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the escalating U.S. reckless war moves to invade the north, the situation of the Korean Peninsula is reaching the brink of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a war is ignited by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula, all the Koreans in the south and north will fall victims to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyone who wants the existence of the nation and peace on the Korean Peninsula should not remain a passive onlooker to the present rigorous situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean people from all walks of life should wage a nationwide anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle to frustrate the U.S. moves for a nuclear war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces should face up to the firm will of the South Korean people to prevent a nuclear war and defend peace in unity with brothers in the north and should immediately withdraw the nuclear war exercise plan which will only precipitate their self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the war-like forces in this land join the outside forces in the war moves for invasion of the north, taking no account of the interests and the dignity of the nation, they will face strong denunciation and stern judgment by the whole Korean nation.  \r\n\r\n"

It calls for advancing with redoubled courage, singing the song more loudly.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vitality of the revolutionary army song representing the idea and politics of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il was fully demonstrated in the period of the \"arduous march,\" the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary army song known to the world as a solemn echo in the era of the army-based policy served as life-giving water that helped significantly consolidate the single-hearted  unity of the DPRK around the headquarters of the revolution and as a powerful weapon as it struck the imperialists and enemies with mortal terror. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to follow Kim Jong Il and share intention and will and feelings with him, loudly singing the revolutionary army song representing his idea and will, courage and pluck and confidence of sure victory and rich emotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people should certainly emerge victorious in the life-and-death struggle against the imperialists. It is the revolutionary army song they should sing loudly in the confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once the imperialists come in attack to stifle the DPRK by force the ten million people and servicepersons should become human bombs to crush them and the further they escalate their economic blockade and pressure upon it, the more loudly the whole country will resound with the revolutionary army song replete with the firm faith of sure victory and optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should carry on the staunch struggle along the road of the army-based revolution, sonorously singing this song. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicemen and people of the DPRK will as always remain true to Kim Jong Il's idea and cause, loudly singing the revolutionary army song, a song of worship of the leader and devoted defence of him.    \r\n\r\n"

Involved in those exercises will be hundreds of thousands of troops and military equipment.\r\n Branding these projected anti-DPRK exercises as an open challenge and a grave provocation to the Korean nation working hard to achieve peace and reunification of the country, Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since it took office, the bellicose bush administration has hindered the process of the Korean nation's reconciliation in every way. Such obstruction is intended to keep the situation on the Korean Peninsula from developing in favor of national reconciliation, unity and reunification, block the reconciliation and reunification process of the Korean nation and, furthermore, ignite a war against the northern half of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities are following the U.S. criminal policy of aggression on the DPRK in violation of the June 15 Joint Declaration, thus escalating the military threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those traitors to the nation, who are seeking to hamper the implementation of the joint declaration in conspiracy with the outside forces, paying no heed to the fellow countrymen's call for reconciliation and cooperation, can never go scotfree.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
