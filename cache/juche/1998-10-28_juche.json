Korean war games against DPRK \r\n \r\n   Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- The Korean National Peace Committee published a statement on Tuesday denouncing the United States and the South Korean authorities for their large-scale military exercises against North Korea.\r\n   The statement said the war maneuvers evidently prove that the U.S. and the South Korean ruling quarters are scheming to finally finish their preparations for an invasion of the north and make a surprising attack on the DPRK any moment.\r\n   Owing to the dangerous war moves, the thick clouds of war are hanging over and touch-and-go situation is prevailing in the Korean peninsula, the statement said, and went on:\r\n   The facts clearly show that \"dialogue\" and \"peace\", \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" on the lips of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities are a lie and that they seek only confrontation and war.\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities are trying to bring the Korean people  with military threat and pressure and war moves to their knees and gratify their aggressive design, but in vain.\r\n   They must not run amuck but stop their reckless war moves at once.\r\n   If they continue resorting to the anti-DPRK confrontation and war moves in despite of the condemnation and protest of all the Korean people and the world's peaceloving people, they will face only disgraceful destruction and death. \r\n\r\n"

Korean rulers' opening doors to Japanese culture\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) published a statement on Tuesday as regards South Korea's opening doors to Japanese culture.\r\n   Describing the opening as one more pro-Japanese flunkeyist treachery, the statement said:\r\n   On October 20 the South Korean rulers decided to totally lift the ban on import of Japanese culture and allowed the introduction of Japan's films, video tapes and cartoon films into South Korea.\r\n   This is a declaration of the humiliating open-door policy toward Japan and an anti-national crime intended to gratify their foul political greed and secure an easy and comfortable life by selling the dignity and interests of the nation to outsiders.\r\n   The South Korean chief executive has defined it as a \"policy\" to open doors to Japan, which the preceding rulers dared not do. This  fully reveals that he is a notorious pro-Japanese element as well as an out-and-out pro-American element.\r\n   It is an indelible crime that the South Korean rulers are turning South Korea into a dark land where national identity has been eradicated by the Japanese way of life  as well as the western style.\r\n   The history and the nation will never pardon the unprecedented criminal acts of the South Korean rulers who are repeating the crime of \"five traitors of 1905\" and make them pay for them.\r\n   The South Korean rulers should stop opening doors to Japan's culture at once, mindful that such heinous flunkeyist acts will  lead to their own destruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thus it has come to have a larger volume and ranges of sound, with a greater possibility of expression.\r\n   Its sound range is divided into lower, low, high, and higher. The lower part produces a soft sound, the low part gives off a graceful and melancholic sound, the high part a clear sound and the higher part a sharp sound.\r\n   Tanso can be used for both lyric and fast, cheerful melodies. Its vibration and flowing sound is unique for expressing different feelings, for example, the note of birds and the murmur of river. This high-pitch instrument is used for solo, and also makes a good harmony with other types of traditional wind instruments in ensemble and for accompaniment. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
