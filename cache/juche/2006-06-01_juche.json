In case the GNP wins a sweeping victory, it will mean a disaster for the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a group of conservative forces keen to revive its past history characterized by dictatorship, tyranny, irregularities and corruption and swindle and a group of anti-national and anti-reunification forces as they have worked hard to chill the desire and efforts of the fellow countrymen to implement the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the joint declaration precisely means a rosy future of the Korean nation, the appeal called upon the electors to cast their ballots for those candidates who would dedicate themselves to the implementation of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean People Urged to Discharge Their Responsibility to Nation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson Wednesday carries a commentary with regard to the \"election to local self-governing bodies\" scheduled all over south Korea today.\r\n Calling upon the south Korean people, mindful of their responsibility to the nation, to take part in the poll without exception and turn all the polling booths into courts of judgment on the \"Grand National Party\", the analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"election\" is, in essence, an acute showdown between the pro-June 15 forces and the anti-June 15 forces. The GNP is the stronghold of the anti-June 15 forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP, prolonging its days on bread crumb falling from Washington's table, is trumpeting about its \"certain victory\" in the \"election\" through the ultra right conservative media. Hidden behind this is its crafty scheme to lead the forces for progressive reforms standing behind the June 15 joint declaration to give the match up in the voting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the GNP is most afraid of is judgment by the broad popular masses. The miserable defeat suffered by it in two \"presidential elections\" and the last \"election to the national assembly\" resulted from the stern judgment passed on it by the broad popular masses participating in the voting. The advertisement of \"a sweeping victory\" at every polling booth is what it invented to make the people abstain from voting at any cost. If the south Korean people stay away form voting, playing into its hand and losing confidence, the GNP which attaches more importance to the U.S. than the fellow countrymen will grab \"local self-governing bodies\" and use them for seizing \"power\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether such development is checked or not depends on how the south Korean people exercise their right to vote. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when the highly important issue related to the life and death of the nation is decided, the south Korean people should fulfill their obligation to the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The work has also served as important guidelines clearly indicating the ways for the WPK to successfully fulfill its mission and duty in the era as a guide of socialism.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article dedicated to the 20th anniversary of the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is Kim Il Sung's great party because it has been trained in the crucible of the struggles waged for over half a century and has grown stronger to be an invincible party which has enjoyed the undisputed support and trust of the people under the wise leadership of the President, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important among the immortal exploits the President performed by creating a model of a revolutionary party in the era is that he built the WPK into an independent Party guided by the Juche idea and a militant Party strong in the sense of organization and discipline in such a far-sighted manner that it can successfully carry forward its cause generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and leadership of the President have been steadfastly carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. The 40 odd year-long history of his leadership over the Party work is shinning as an immortal history in which he has developed it into the party of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last more than one decade occupies a distinguished place in the revolutionary history of Kim Jong Il who has led the cause of building the WPK.
