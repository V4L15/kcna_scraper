E introdujeron en el ejercito titere muchos pertrechos belicos estadounidenses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDicen por una parte que los simulacros conjuntos nunca vistos en la historia, que se desarrollan constantemente en contubernio con EE.UU., son para frenar las \"provocaciones adicionales\" de alguien, y por la otra, intentan asestar el ataque preventivo contra la RPDC en cualquier momento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy obvio que tales acciones militares agravan la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y acarrean el peligro de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es que los titeres surcoreanos abusan del incidente de \"Cheonan\" para inculcar a los habitantes y las generaciones venideras la conciencia belicista y de confrontacion fratricida con el Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los actos de memoria y otros realizados desde el dia 24 al 28 en Seul y otras localidades, calificaron el caso de \"Cheonan\" de una \"provocacion\" de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, llevaron a los habitantes a los campos de entrenamiento militar y levantaron en la isla Paekryong el \"monumento en memoria de los caidos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los pasos arriba mencionados no pasan de ser una locura para preparar el ambiente militar y politico que de lugar al segundo y tercer casos de \"Cheonan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC no estaran con brazos cruzados ante tal proceder imperdonable de las autoridades militares surcoreanas y les responderan rotundamente."
