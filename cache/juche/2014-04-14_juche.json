            "content": "CPRK Secretariat Blasts Smear Campaign of S. Korean Regime against DPRK\r\nPyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Sunday released an open statement denouncing the south Korean regime for driving the inter-Korean relations into a catastrophe through a malignant smear campaign against the DPRK in violation of the agreement between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t Accusing the south Korean authorities of malignant mud-slinging at the DPRK's efforts for dialogue and peace, the statement goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, the south Korean authorities have not ceased the smear campaign against the DPRK and are still persisting in it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This campaign has gone on under the Park Geun Hye regime, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the outset of the year, the Park group has gotten frantic with mud-slinging, talking about \"the instability of the north's social system\" and \"provocations.\" It responded to the historic New Year Address and the important proposal of the DPRK by groundlessly denying and slandering them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her foreign junket on January 18, Park termed the DPRK's important proposal a \"propaganda offensive\" and cried out for taking a strong security posture to firmly cope with provocations against the south whenever the north launches a propaganda offensive.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the prodding of the authorities the conservative media malignantly slandered the proposal of the north as an \"appeasement gesture\", \"camouflaged peace offensive,\" \"red herring for creating instability in the south\" and \"scheme for sparking conflict in the south.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities noisily grumbled about the DPRK's self-defensive nuclear and missile force, terming it \"provocation\" and \"violation\" and calling for \"sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On February 7 Park talked rubbish that \"the north is still sticking to the line on simultaneously pushing forward nuclear and economic development and the situation remains unstable.\" She further said it seems the \"north has launched a peace offensive all of a sudden these days, but the south should not slacken the vigilance even under this situation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a congratulatory speech made on March 6, she spoke ill of the north's above-said line and incited confrontation, asserting that it is the nukes of the north that are throwing a stumbling block in the way of economic cooperation between the south and the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Addressing the 3rd \"nuclear security summit\" held in Netherlands on March 24 she let loose provocative sophism that the settlement of the issue of the north is indispensable for building a world without nuclear weapons and it is necessary to  send a stronger message to the north urging it to dismantle its nukes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group has never ceased its malignant smear campaign against the DPRK as regards the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While persisting in its madcap drills for a nuclear war, the puppet clique justified them through sheer sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Late in March and at the beginning of this month they launched a large-scale joint landing drill aimed at \"occupying Pyongyang\" and joint air strike exercises Max Thunder designed to make air strikes at all areas of the DPRK, pushing the situation to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' mud-slinging has reached its height by letting loose a whole string of invectives against the dignity and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park let loose a torrent of malignant outbursts slandering the DPRK during her German tour in March last. She blabbered that \"orphans roaming about streets are not taken care of and they are enduring hunger in the cold due to economic difficulties\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Daily NK, Chosun Ilbo and other wicked conservative media made such intolerable reckless behavior as daring slander the field guidance given by the supreme leadership of the DPRK to the baby home and orphanage and the election of deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Espionage and intelligence organs including the Intelligence Service took away those who fled to the third country after committing crimes in the north and abandoning their parents, wives and children and are hurling them into a false propaganda against the DPRK after giving them a petty amount of money. Agents of those institutions are also taking them to foreign countries and using them as \"witnesses\" in their anti-DPRK smear campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is busy hurling the human scum into the operations for scattering leaflets into areas of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities can never shirk the responsibility for having pushed the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe through the above-said smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should be careful about their tongue wagging, bearing in mind that their mud-slinging would get them nowhere but ruin and the collapse of the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities persist in their smear campaign against the social system and dignity of the DPRK despite its repeated warnings and denunciation at home and abroad, they will not be able to escape the most shameful fate, cursed and censured by all Koreans."

            "content": "Inspection Group of NDC of DPRK Opens to Public Truth about Drone Case Touted by S. Korean Authorities\r\nPyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- The inspection group of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK on Monday opened to public the truth about the drone case touted by the south Korean authorities, terming the fiction about the \"drones sent by the north\" a replica of the Cheonan warship sinking case from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the open statement, it was reported that crashed drones were found in various parts of south Korea recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military authorities on April 2 hastily announced the \"results of the first investigation\" in which they concluded that the drones were sent by the north. On April 11 they announced the \"results of intermediary investigation\" insisting that the drones \"belong to the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They claimed those photos available from the drones are the most convincing evidence proving that the \"drones belong to the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one follows the south side's assertion, flying bodies coming from the north to the south and from the south to the north should belong to the north and if photos of south side areas are available from the flying bodies, all of them should belong to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If then, flying bodies coming from the south to the north and from the north to the south in the areas north of the Military Demarcation Line should belong to south Korea and if photos of areas of the north side are available from the flying bodies, they should belong to south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"central joint inspection team\" produced the writing style in the north marked on the engine battery as one of the most convincing evidence proving that the drones belong to the \"north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said that the front side of the engine battery of a drone at present bears the trade mark \"date of kiyong (use) June 25, 2013\" and \"date of stop using June 25, 2014.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They insist that this is the method of writing trade mark commonly used in the north and to write \"naltsa (date)\" used by south Korea as \"nalja\" is the writing of the north Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People in the north never use the word \"kiyong\" on any product. There is no explanation about the word \"kiyong\" in the large Korean dictionary in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent \"results of investigation\" claimed that Chinese and Japanese letters are seen on the back of the battery and the device supporting the flying posture of the drones was made by Futaba of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they assert the drones belong to the \"north\" as they bear Korean letters, how they will explain the Chinese and Japanese letters and Japan-made device.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fingerprints were cited as one of the evidence proving the claim that the drones belong to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one with normal way of thinking insists that the fingerprints they claim found on the drones belong to north Koreans simply because they are not south Koreans', no one can trust the assertion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the south Korean Ministry of Defense announced at the outset that \"it would not be easy to find the place where the north's drone took off even if over 30 trillion won was spent out of the defense budget.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days later, he claimed that the take-off point of the drone was confirmed, adding that it was Onchon airfield in South Hwanghae Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Onchon airfield of the DPRK is situated in South Phyongan Province, not in South Hwanghae Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days later, he corrected the take-off point of the drone announced earlier, noting that an airfield near Ongjin in South Hwanghae Province was the place where it took off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People in the north have never heard there is an airfield near Ongjin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities cited the blue color of the drone as evidence to proving that the drones belong to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They claim blue and white colors are \"colors used in north Korea\". Is there anyone who can agree with this?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"One cannot but construe that drones were sent by the north as it is a short distance for neighboring countries to launch  such drones and they were not launched in the south either\". This is one clause of the \"intermediary investigation results\" which judged on the basis of the flying range that the drones were sent by the \"north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If then, do all flying bodies in the world with either short or long flying range belong to the \"north\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Ministry of Defense on Mar. 31 claimed it confirmed those drones were launched from the area of the north side as a radar of E-8 detected a drone flying to Paekryong Island from the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It made a poor excuse that the south side fired at least 300 shells from Vulcan artillery pieces three times the moment the drone was detected but could not shoot down the drone flying at the altitude of 5-6 km because the maximum firing range of those guns is just 2 km.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"central joint inspection team,\" as if it had forgotten  all what it had said, made public that the drone discovered on Paekryong Island crashed due to the lack of fuel, flying zigzag at the speed of 100-120 km per hour at the altitude of 1.4 km.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When public became increasingly skeptical about its announcement, the team asserted that another drone which the authorities did not know might be sent to Paekryong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Besides, the south Korean authorities made the claim as evidence proving the \"north's involvement\" that the drones were \"cast in iron mould\", electronic circuit board attached to wood is not the south Korean style and there is neither witness nor informer who said  that they found a launching pad and additional equipment needed for the drone take-off in south Korea. This is the \"results of the intermediary investigation\" full of lies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing these ambiguous behaviors, people whisper that it was not an easy job to cook up and prove the story about the \"north's involvement.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more water flows under the bridge and the more facts are known to public, the more saliently they will bring to light truth that the story about the \"north's involvement\" is a sheer lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The open statement laid bare the sinister criminal aims sought by the south Korean authorities through the drone case:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first aim sought by the south Korean authorities is to blame the DPRK for orchestrating the drone case and shift the responsibility for the acute north-south relations and the situation on the Korean peninsula inching close to a war on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second aim is to take the second \"May 24 anti-north measure\" by fabricating the second Cheonan warship sinking case in a bid to keep the north-south relations in the state of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third aim is to plug their American master into their arms buildup under the pretext of \"strengthening the security posture\" and thus make up for the \"vacuum of force\" and stifle the DPRK by force of arms at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an inveterate bad habit of the south Korean authorities to cook up shocking cases and kick up anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria by linking those cases with the DPRK whenever they are driven into a crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inspection group of the NDC has the willingness to make everything clear now that the south Korean authorities have not yet ceased floating the story about \"the north's involvement\" in Cheonan warship sinking case and are fabricating the second and third Cheonan cases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to jointly investigate all cases including the Cheonan case as they claim the north was involved in them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Security room chief of Chongwadae Kim Jang Su, who allegedly looks after \"state security\" of south Korea, may take part in the investigation on behalf of the south side as it will draw great attention of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities have no compunction, there will be no reason whatsoever for them to shun the just and reasonable claim made by the DPRK from the very day of the occurrence of the Cheonan case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will wait for the south Korean authorities' response."

He declared a war against the Japanese imperialist aggressors and found the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA), the first armed forces of Juche type in Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The armed struggle with the formidable Japanese aggression army was a bloody war as the KPRA had to settle by its own efforts everything from drawing up lines to securing arms and bases and creating war tactics. However, Kim Il Sung led the anti-Japanese revolutionary war to victory, tightly taking arms, and thus accomplished the historic cause of the national liberation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period of the Korean War (1950-1953) provoked by the U.S., the army and people of the DPRK shattered the myth of the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. imperialists under the ever-victorious command of the President. During the war he went to the front line to give confidence in sure victory to the servicepersons and unfold and command brave and adroit military operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the title of the DPRK Marshal was awarded to him, who had worked military miracles unprecedented in the world history of wars, in reflection of the unanimous demand of the army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The showdown with the U.S. and its allied forces after the war had clearly shown the greatness of the President as a brilliant commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early 1960s Kim Il Sung set forth the line of simultaneously carrying on the economic construction and the defence up-building and smashed with his unique strategy and undaunted pluck every provocative move of the U.S. imperialists, arousing great admiration from among the world progressives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his wise guidance, the DPRK could win in the face-off with the U.S. in the 1990s, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people in the country conferred the title of the DPRK Generalissimo on the President representing the banner of eternal victory on the occasion of his 80th birthday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His immortal feats for the country and the revolution will be always remembered along with the star of Generalissimo."

Moreover, it can not be overlooked as wiretapping against any other country means espionage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, a spokesperson for the National Security Council of the White House insisted that an action is needed to cope with new threats, adding that the sustained media report about specified technology to be applied in the U.S. legitimate intelligence-gathering activities is harmful to the security of the U.S. and its allies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This assertion shows that the U.S. is the kingpin of human rights abusers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to data available, the U.S. National Security Agency has eavesdropped on more than 95 percent of the world communications and photographed almost all the objects on the earth by use of satellites, with 200 000 agents, lots of spy satellites and huge-scale database. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A budget bill of the national intelligence planning for the fiscal year 2013 showed that the U.S. had doubled the budget for its intelligence regime after the \"Sept. 11 incident\", turning itself into an intelligence kingdom with 107 000 members. And the U.S. intelligence budget for 2013 amounted to 52.6 billion dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cases of wiretapping by the U.S. are still now reported without letup throughout the world. The U.S. collects about two hundred millions of mobile phone messages on a daily average, including those of state leaders of different countries. In particular, more than 300 pieces of information on Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel were reportedly gathered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. is the kingpin of human rights abusers and an evil country that does not hesitate to encroach even upon its allies' sovereignty for its own interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The global electronic espionage, being conducted by the U.S., is a serious crime violating other countries' sovereignty as well as human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deserves bitter curse and condemnation by the world community for its high-handed and arbitrary practices in disregard of the elementary usage among countries and international laws."

            "content": "Secretario de CRPP denuncia censura de Sur de Corea contra RPDC\r\n　Pyongyang, 14 de abril (ACNC) -- El Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria publico el dia 13 la nota abierta para revelar el verdadero aspecto de las autoridades surcoreanas que llevan a la fase catastrofica las relaciones Norte-Sur recurriendo a la difamacion perversa contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea a contrapelo del acuerdo de ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t  El documento revela la vil calumnia de las autoridades surcoreanas a los esfuerzos por el dialogo y la paz de la RPDC como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Historicamente las autoridades surcoreanas nunca dejaron de censurar a la RPDC y hasta la fecha han seguido perpetrandolo atrozmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde los primeros dias de este ano la banda de \"poder\" de Park Geun-hye ha recurrido a la censura disparateando sobre la \"inestabilidad del sistema y la provocacion del Norte \" y respondio al historico mensaje del Ano Nuevo y la propuesta importante de la RPDC con la negacion y la denigracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dia 18 de enero en que estaba de visita al extranjero Park ordeno \"mantener la perfecta disposicion segura frente a la provocacion del Norte\" acusando la propuesta importante de la RPDC de \"ofensiva de propaganda\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Bajo la instigacion de las autoridades los medios de prensa conservadores censuraron perversamente que la propuesta del Norte es el \"gesto de apaciguamiento\", \"ofensiva de paz disfrazada\", \"desviacion de la inquieta opinion publica interna\" y \"para el conflicto dentro del Sur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y acusan las fuerzas armadas nucleares y las de misiles de autodefensa de la RPDC de \"provocacion\" y \"violacion\" abogando por la \"sancion\" contra el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El 7 de febrero, Park dijo que \"El Norte sigue manteniendo la linea de desarrollo paralelo de las fuerzas armadas nucleares y la economia y sigue inestable la situacion del Norte\" y \"en estos dias el Norte fingen tomar de repente la ofensiva de paz, pero no hay que relajar la vigilancia precisamente en este tiempo.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El 6 de marzo, en el supuesto mensaje de felicitacion, dijo que el obstaculo principal que impide la cooperacion economica entre el Sur y el Norte es precisamente las armas nucleares del Norte\" calumniando la linea de desarrollo paralelo de la RPDC e inculcando la confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　  En la III \"Cumbre de Seguridad Nuclear\", efectuada el 24 de marzo en Holanda, solto los disparates provocativos tales como \"es imprescindible resolver el problema nuclear del Norte de Corea para construir el mundo sin armas nucleares\" y \"es necesario enviar al Norte de Corea el mensaje mas fuerte para que este renuncie sus armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En cuanto al incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\", los titeres surcoreanos siguen calumniando a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En tanto, libran con frenesi los ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC justificandolos con  pretextos injustos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Desde finales de marzo y hasta abril desarrollan los ejercicios conjuntos de desembarco de gran envergadura con la meta de \"conquistar Pyongyang\" y el simulacro conjunto aereo \"Max Thunder\" para asestar el ataque aereo contra toda la extension norcoreana llevando la situacion al borde de la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La demagogia de las autoridades surcoreanas llega al climax con las calumnias a la dignidad y el regimen de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Durante su visita a Alemania realizada en marzo pasado, Park Geun-hye dijo que \"por la crisis economica, los huerfanos norcoreanos estan vagabundeando en las calles y sufren por el frio y el hambre\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Daily NK, Chosun Ilbo y otros recalcitrantes medios de prensa conservadores tambien cuestionaron atrevidamente la visita de orientacion de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC a hospicio y orfanato y las elecciones de diputados a la Asamblea Popular Suprema, lo cual es un intolerable insulto a la maxima dignidad de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　El Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia y otros organos intrigantes de inteligencia lanzan a la demagogia anti-RPDC a los fugitivos norcoreanos secuestrados al Sur de Corea que tras haber cometido delitos en la patria se huyeron a un tercer pais abandonando hasta a sus familiares, dandoles un punazo de dinero y presentandoles como \"testigos\" hasta en la escena internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Los titeres surcoreanos recrudecen el lanzamiento de volantes de contenido anti-RPDC hacia la parte norcoreana instigando a las escorias humanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Las autoridades surcoreanas no pueden liberarse jamas de la culpabilidad de haber llevado a la fase catastrofica las relaciones intercoreanas con las calumnias a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Las autoridades surcoreanas deben cuidarse con su boca teniendo presente que la demagogia anti-RPDC traera solo el arruinamiento de si mismas y la ruptura de los vinculos Norte-Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Si siguen recurriendo a las calumnias al regimen y dignidad de la RPDC, pese a las reiteradas advertencias y denuncias del interior y exterior, ellas seran repudiadas y rechazadas por toda la nacion y no podran eludir el destino mas vergonzoso."
