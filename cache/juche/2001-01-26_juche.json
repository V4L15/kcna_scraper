It is reinforcing its \"Self-Defense Forces\" with sophisticated military equipment while undisguisedly calling for the amended constitution so as to legalize their overseas operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's \"missile threat\" is a main pretext invented by Japan in a bid to let down domestic and foreign vigilance against such dangerous militarist tendency. Under this pretext Japan is joining in the drive to establish the \"theatre missile defense\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this situation, defense agency officials are these days conducting solicitation diplomacy for \"security.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saito's current trip to France and his remarks are an evident expression of it. This only reveals once again the shamelessness of Japan which has seen in the new century without redressing its heinous crimes committed in the 20th century.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, ecological environment was seriously polluted and a large number of people are subjected to mental and physical sufferings and damage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the U.S. conducted \"peace-keeping operation\" in Kosovo to test its new-type weapons.  \r\n\r\n"
