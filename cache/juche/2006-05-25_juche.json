Their faith and will are unshaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon should preserve the exploits of President Kim Il Sung, the founder of Chongryon and the sun for the destiny of the Koreans in Japan, and intensify its work as taught by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Chongryon officials and Koreans in Japan should revere Kim Jong Il with a single mind and remain boundlessly loyal to his leadership, true to the behests of the President. And they should wage a more vigorous struggle for achieving the independent reunification of the country with concerted efforts of our nation under the banner of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration together with the people in the north and the south.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says:\r\n Thus the United States and other countries of the West tasted a bitter cup of failure in their \"human rights diplomacy\" though they sought to make the Council a theatre of their solo performance in a bid to interfere in the domestic affairs of the progressive countries and put pressure upon them under the false cloak of \"defense of human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., styling itself an \"international human rights judge\", laid obstacles in the process of the foundation of the UN Human Rights Council, coming out with unreasonable argument only to fail even to have a finger in its election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a proper judgment passed by the international community on the U.S. outrageous human rights abuses, \"spread of U.S.-style democracy\" and the reactionary and preposterous nature of its \"human rights\" policy. The U.S. dared not poke its nose into the election. This proved once again that it is very afraid of strong denunciation and fair judgment of its human rights crimes by the international community.\r\n The U.S. imperialists have used the human rights issues as a means of overthrowing the governments and systems of other countries. This is a downright challenge to the trend of global independence and a mockery of international justice and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world cannot be stable and the human rights issues cannot see a fair solution without holding at bay the U.S. imperialists' maneuvers to use the \"human rights issues\" as a means of interference in the internal affairs of other countries and nations and infringement upon their sovereignty, shelving their own brutal human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the UN Human Rights Council has been founded to deal with international human rights issues, it cannot fulfill its mission as an international organization with impartiality as its principle, if the politicization of human rights issues and double standards, especially the attempts to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries under the pretext of these issues are allowed again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To defend international justice and human rights, all the countries and nations should resolutely frustrate the criminal moves of the U.S. and other countries of the West to trample other countries underfoot with the \"human rights stick\", seeking the politicization of human rights and double standards    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The \"anti-terrorism war\" started by the United States with the \"September 11 incident\" as a momentum was, in essence, a reckless use of strength to put the anti-imperialist independent countries under control and realize its ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. escalation of the \"anti-terrorism war\" is throwing the world into confusion and disorder while bringing unspeakable misfortune and disasters to peoples.\r\n The Afghan and Iraqi wars were typical examples disclosing the reactionary, aggressive and criminal nature of the \"anti-terrorism war\" being waged by the U.S. imperialists. As the world community comments, their aggression brought these countries not freedom and democracy but a vicious cycle of socio-political confusion, disorder, terrorism and revenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only fear of terrorism and uneasiness prevail in the world as it is sunken deep into a whirlpool of a vicious cycle of terrorism, revenge, destruction and death due to the U.S. \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fear of terrorism is the nightmare that has haunted the international community since the U.S. start of the \"anti-terrorism war.\" What is clear is that this war is the root cause of this worldwide instability and fear of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. imperialists seek to steadily escalate the war. \r\n Bush's \"theory of the third world war\" is a manifestation of the U.S. dangerous intention to use even nuclear weapons without hesitation in a bid to carry out its strategy for world domination.  The reactionary nature and potential danger of Bush's theory lie in that his forces seek to put the world under their control by use of nukes. \r\n With nothing can the U.S. imperialists ever cover up the criminal nature of their \"anti-terrorism war\" and shirk the responsibility for having driven the world to a vicious cycle of terrorism and revenge, the article concludes.    \r\n \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
