            "content": "DPRK's Test-fire of SLBM Is Just: Foreign Ministry\r\nPyongyang, April 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday in connection with the fact that the U.S. is ratcheting up the pressure on the DPRK while citing the DPRK's test-fire of submarine-launched ballistic missile:\n\t\t\t\t\t The big success in test-fire of the SLBM brought about by the DPRK's scientists and technicians in the field of national defence marked a historical event as it provided another means of powerful nuclear attack of Juche Korea. It was the exercise of the just right to self-defence to safeguard the sovereignty and right to existence of the country and the nation from the U.S. escalating threat of nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. and its followers spew out sophism that the test-fire is a violation of \"resolutions\" of the UN Security Council and renders the situation in the region and the world unstable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. even set in motion the UN Security Council to work out a statement which \"denounced\" the DPRK's ballistic missile activities, while terming them \"an act of escalating regional and world tensions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have flatly denied all the \"resolutions\" of the UN Security Council that sided with the U.S. vicious moves against the DPRK and have firmly safeguarded the peace on the Korean peninsula and the region by dint of the military capabilities for self-defence with the nuclear force as a pivot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace and security on the Korean peninsula are being wrecked by the U.S. which is keen on nuclear war moves targeting the DPRK with the mobilization of all nuclear strike means including strategic nuclear submarine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. is rendering the situation extremely tense while persisting in hostile policy and nuclear threats to the DPRK, the only way for the DPRK to avert thermo-nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and the region is to ensure balance of force by dint of powerful nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the U.S. is branding the measures taken by the DPRK to bolster nuclear force including the test-fire of SLBM as a threat to the peace and security in the region and the world. This is illogical and will only increase the danger of armed conflict and war on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. continued pursuance of extreme hostile policy and nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK will only make the latter make drastic progress in bolstering nuclear attack capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will bolster the nuclear force pursuant to the Workers' Party of Korea's strategic plan to counter the nuclear weapons in kind no matter what others may say."

Pursuant to this scenario, the U.S. is pressing forward the plan to develop five types of new nuclear warheads including the development of supersonic warheads and their delivery means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Center for Strategic and International Studies said in a report released last year that the U.S. should have in place nuclear warheads of diverse power fit for use at every phase of increasing nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. publicly declared  that it would put greater spurs to the modernization of nuclear weapons including nuclear warheads-tipped  missiles, nuclear strategic bombers and  nuclear-powered  submarines by investing 1 trillion dollars in 30 years to come, sparking off a new nuclear arms race. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has been loudmouthed about the \"nuclear disarmament\" so far. This was nothing but a hypocritical slogan to weaken its strategic rivals, while covering up its moves to modernize nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia is not hiding the fact that it is not interested in the unilateral nuclear disarmament any longer and goes its own way, now that it has become clear the U.S. has an axe to grind while playing a trick as regards the issue of nuclear disarmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia has begun to deploy long-range ballistic missiles of the new generation tipped with four smaller nuclear warheads and the Russian Navy is going ahead with the development of submarine nuclear strike means capable of reducing coastal cities to debris through radioactive contamination by exploding smaller nuclear weapons in coastal waters of the rival forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China has also mounted several smaller nuclear warheads on many long-range ballistic missiles and is stepping up the development of \"ultra supersonic glider\" capable of mounting a nuclear attack on any target in any place on the earth within one hour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means the start of a hot nuclear arms race in the 21st century among the U.S., Russia and China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the director of the CIA testified at the Senate Armed Services Committee it is highly likely that the nuclear arms race will be under way among the above-said countries in a manner similar to that in the Cold War era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prospect of the denuclearization of the world is becoming dimmer because the U.S. trumpeting about \"nuclear disarmament\" turned out to be hypocritical and a new nuclear arms race has become hot among big powers."

However, it is a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately they may resort to sinister plots and subversive activities and sabotage, they can never hold in check the dynamic advance of the DPRK towards a rosy future of a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistent anti-DPRK provocations of the Park Geun Hye group of traitors on the deathbed would only precipitate its doomsday."

Ahora, las fuerzas navales de Rusia estan desarrollando los medios de ataque nuclear submarinos capaces de convertir en zonas muertas las ciudades litorales mediante la contaminacion radiactiva causada por la explosion de armas nucleares minimizadas en la profundidad litoral del pais rival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, China carga las ojivas nucleares minimizadas en los misiles balisticos de largo alcance y acelera el desarrollo de \"aeroplano supersonico\" capaz de dar dentro de una hora el ataque nuclear contra el cualquier blanco en el globo terraqueo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, se empezo la enconada carrera armamentista nuclear del siglo XXI entre EE.UU., Rusia y China, potencias nucleares mundiales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl director de la Agencia Estatal de Inteligencia de EE.UU. dijo en la Comision Senatorial de Servicios Armados que es muy posible que la carrera armamentista nuclear entre las potencias nucleares se desarrolle con el modo semejante de la guerra fria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que se ha revelado completamente que la insistencia de EE.UU. en la \"reduccion de armas nucleares\" es un engano para tomar la supremacia estrategica y que se acelera la nueva carrera armamentista nuclear entre las potencias, se hace mas tenebrosa la desnuclearizacion del mundo entero."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun anatomiza esencia criminal de \"sancion\" anti-RPDC de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 26 de abril (ACNC) -- Los compinches de Obama inventaron la \"resolucion de sancion\" no. 2270 de la ONU contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y tomaron sucesivamente las medidas de \"sancion independiente\" junto con Japon y los titeres surcoreanos. Insatisfechos con esto, adicionaron en los \"rubros de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU la \"lista de mercancias prohibidas de exportacion e importacion\" hablando de \"impacto\" y \"acabo\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un articulo publicado este martes, el comentarista del diario Rodong Sinmun lo califica de mas brutal violacion de la soberania de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, producto del despotismo y arbitrariedades de EE.UU. y crimen para \"derrocar el regimen\" de la RPDC, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?por que EE.UU. ejerce la \"sancion\" sobre la RPDC? No es porque la RPDC cuenta con armas nucleares y satelites. El verdadero motivo reside en que el baluarte socialista levantado en el Oriente ensena a la humanidad la inevitabilidad del arruinamiento del capitalismo, el pueblo coreano vive dignamente a su propia manera sin atarse al orden internacional establecido por EE.UU. y la dominacion de dolar, y frena la realizacion de la estrategia de hegemonia mundial de EE.UU. manteniendo la posicion antiyanqui e independiente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC, aprobadas hasta la fecha en la ONU, fueron inventadas por EE.UU. y aprobadas a la fuerza, razon por la cual no reflejan la \"voluntad unanime\" de los paises miembros de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que la RPDC califique de crimen y rechace la fabricacion de tales \"resoluciones de sancion\" ilicitas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"sancion\" anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y sus satelites centuplica la conviccion revolucionaria y la capacidad de autofortalecimiento del ejercito y pueblo coreanos y redobla su ferrea voluntad de enfrentarse a la ofensiva reaccionaria de los enemigos con la ofensiva revolucionaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia conociendo claramente a su rival."
