No force on earth can pounce upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the DPRK has a bright future as it has Kim Jong Il, an illustrious commander of Mt.

            "content": "Nat�fl Meeting Marks 13th anniv. of Kim Jong Il's Election as NDC Chairman\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture here on Saturday to celebrate the 13th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission.\r\n The meeting was attended by Kim Yong Nam, Jo Myong Rok, Pak Pong Ju, Kim Yong Chun, Jon Pyong Ho and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army Kim Il Chol, member of the DPRK NDC and minister of the People's Armed Forces, in a report said that Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the NDC marked an event of special mention as it was of epochal significance in guaranteeing a bright future of the country and the development of the Korean revolution in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The course of the revolution covered by the DPRK with him holding the chairmanship of the NDC represented years of a historic change as it has achieved a miraculous victory in its endeavors to defend socialism in the do-or-die spirit despite the unprecedentedly grim hardships and difficulties and paved a broad avenue for building a great prosperous powerful nation, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shouldering upon himself the heavy responsibility as NDC chairman,\r\nKim Jong Il has fully provided the Songun revolutionary leadership to all aspects of state construction and activities, consolidating the Korean-style socialist state system and bringing about a great turn in the revolution and construction. The military position of the Korean revolution with the invincible KPA as the core has been consolidated as firm as an iron wall and the DPRK proudly emerged a world military power with nuclear deterrent for self-defence. This is a great victory of the outstanding Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il and the Workers' Party of Korea's Songun politics and a most striking proof of its validity and might.\r\n On the tasks facing the whole party and army and all the people to implement the WPK's Songun leadership, the reporter underscored the need to defend and glorify President Kim Il Sung's idea and line on self-reliant defence building and his immortal exploits for it generation after generation and resolutely safeguard Kim Jong Il politically and ideologically and with lives in any adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army should intensify the movement to win the title of the O Jung Hup-led 7th regiment and thus augment its politico-ideological and military technological might and fully demonstrate its invincible capability as the ranks of human bullets and bombs devotedly defending the leader and a strong revolutionary army that has inherited the spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to establish the trait of attaching importance to the army throughout the society, organize and conduct all work on the principle of giving priority to the military affairs and thus thoroughly implement the Party's military line for self-defence with a view to consolidating the achievements already made in the efforts to place all the people under arms and turn the whole country into a fortress.\r\n We should give priority to the development of the national defence industry as required by the Songun era so as to convert it into a powerful defence industry in the 21st century capable of providing a sure military technological guarantee for the security of the country and the victorious advance of the revolution and increase the military deterrent of the country in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an essential requirement for the successful implementation of the Party's Songun revolutionary line to fully ensure the function and role of the NDC. It is necessary to unconditionally accept and implement to the letter any order and instruction of the NDC and thus more thoroughly establish Kim Jong Il's unitary leadership over the defence work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important task facing us today to step up the general march for Songun revolution once again and thus augment the overall state power of the country with the military power as the core and bring about a decisive turn in economic construction and in the improvement of the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to wage a dynamic patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in order to decisively foil the machinations of the separatist forces at home and abroad and bring about a fresh epochal phase in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation is growing tenser and more acute on the Korean Peninsula than ever before due to the U.S. ever-more undisguised hostile policy toward the DPRK and its reckless military provocations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now talking about the six-party talks but in fact, it is zealously inciting hostility toward the DPRK while floating all sorts of sheer fictions, utterly indifferent to the talks. It is only watching for every chance to attack the DPRK while staging large-scale war exercises after listing it as a target of \"preemptive attack.\"\r\n A preemptive attack is not monopoly of the U.S. and the DPRK will never sit idle till it is exposed to a preemptive attack of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will closely follow the every move of the U.S. with high revolutionary vigilance. Should the U.S. ignite a war of aggression at any cost, they will mobilize their politico-ideological might and military potentials built up generation after generation under the leadership of the great illustrious Songun commander and mercilessly wipe out the enemies and thus victoriously conclude the stand-off with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S., regarding aggression and war, exploitation and pillage as the principal means of its existence prompted by misanthropy, has set up prisons in Iraq, Guantanamo and various other parts of the world and practiced mediaeval torture methods only to stun the world. Is it not the worst human rights abuser in the world?\r\n It is the U.S. that has earned an ill-fame as a modern-type fascist state.\r\n Such being a hard fact, the U.S. is talking about \"human rights performance\" in sovereign states. This only provokes the world people's laughter.\r\n That is why the international community ridicules the U.S., urging it to mind its P's and Q's whenever it cries out for \"human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is pressurizing other countries to accept American-style \"liberal democracy\" rejected by the people in different parts of the world. This is a vicious challenge to genuine freedom and democracy as it is intended to remodel the world on the American pattern at any cost. This is nothing but a day dream unrealizable in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush fascist group's hysteria of \"human rights and democracy\" is no more than a vivid expression of contemporary megalomania of the U.S. and its mental and moral frustration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The evermore frantic anti-DPRK smear campaign of the U.S., the enemy of freedom and democracy, only reinforces its people's faith in Korean-style socialism centred on the masses and makes the single-minded unity of its army and people around the supreme headquarters stronger than ever before.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
