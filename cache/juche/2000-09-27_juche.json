In other words, it is the exploit of the people and party of Korea and its leader Kim Jong Il, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our party pays deep concern to the measures taken by the DPRK for peaceful reunification of the country.

This is the U.S. calculation and policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the United States is desperately obstructing the Korean nation from taking the road of reconciliation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are very proud of the fact that they have strengthened the self-reliant defense capability in every way to cope with the U.S. moves against the DPRK, the commentary says, refuting Cohen's assertion on the military capability of North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the north and the south agreed to independently solve the issue of national reunification by concerted efforts of the Korean nation, its master, it stresses that the United States must abandon its anachronistic Korea policy and the design to permanently occupy South Korea and go home at an early date, swimming with the changing trend of the Korean peninsula toward reconciliation. \r\n\r\n"
