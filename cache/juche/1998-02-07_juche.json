Commission on human rights and other international organisations requesting them to render active help for their early repatriation.\r\n   The family members who live in North Korea said in the letters:\r\n   Kim In So, Ham Se Hwan and Kim Yong Thae were taken prisoner by the enemy while fighting during the past Fatherland Liberation War and kept in prison in South Korea for scores of years. Even now when they are invalid, they are kept in South Korea without being repatriated to North Korea. Today, they are in delicate conditions. \r\n   This notwithstanding, the South Korean authorities have persecuted and excruciated these unconverted long-term prisoners, putting them on trial for the mere reason that they called for their repatriation and the abrogation of the \"National Security Law,\" allegedly violating the \"Law on Supervision for Public Peace.\"\r\n   The letters earnestly requested the international human rights organisations to take humanitarian measures to force the South Korean authorities to stop human rights violations against the unconverted long-term prisoners and repatriate them to their hometowns at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In dealing with the enemy's invasion, it is merciless and determined. The escort craft, \"Pueblo\" ship, \"EC-121\" reconnaissance plane and helicopter incidents are some of the good examples offering glimpse of the KPA's disposition.\r\n   The KPA means what it says.\r\n   Talks are necessary sometimes. But the KPA keeps tabs on what position the U.S. takes at the talks.\r\n   Double-dealing game never works on the DPRK.\r\n   The United States must clearly know of the KPA's military disposition and stop presenting military threat to the DPRK. \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "CPRF on Kim Young Sam's crimes in five  years of office\r\n  Pyongyang, February 7 (KCNA) -- As the tenure of the  Kim Young Sam is expiring, the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement  exposing his crimes in five years of office.\r\n   The statement dated February 5 said:\r\n   The most serious crime which was committed by  Kim Young Sam during his term of office was that he sold off the dignity and interests of the nation through unheard-of despicable flunkeyism, treachery and dependence upon outsiders. \r\n   No sooner had he seized the \"Presidential office\" than he visited his masters in Washington and Tokyo, not the fellow countrymen within the hailing distance. This resulted in further deepening the political, economic and cultural dependence of South Korea.\r\n   By concluding a large number of subordinate pacts and agreements with outsiders, he allowed them to fully dominate South Korea and begged for the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea, offering an estimated 3 billion dollars as costs for their upkeeping.\r\n   It is none other than Kim Young Sam who made South Korea saddled with foreign debts amounting to 200 billion dollars and placed South Korea under \"trusteeship\" by foreign monopoly capital.\r\n   He took the lead in the anti-DPRK moves launched by the allied imperialists over the \"suspected development of nuclear weapons\" by the DPRK and put brakes on internal and external humanitarian assistance to the fellow countrymen in the north hit by serious natural disasters with outcries over \"crisis\" and \"exaggeration.\"\r\n   Another unpardonable crime which was committed by him during his office was that he  froze the inter-Korean relations against the ardent desire of the nation for the peaceful reunification,  thus aggravating confrontation between them and turning south korea into an hotbed of a new war.\r\n   When he came into office, he promised that he would give priority to the nation.         Against his promise, however, he challenged the DPRK with the declaration of confrontation that he \"cannot shake hands with the north\" and \"the northerners must not be viewed merely as fellow countrymen.\"\r\n   In the latter half of his tenure, he went the length of announcing a policy of closing all doors with the north, thus cutting all contacts with the north.\r\n   When he was in office, South Korea's military expenditure increased 50 percent and the puppet army was further reinforced.\r\n   During his term, South Korea staged many war exercises against the north separately or jointly with the U.S. aggression forces. Taking only the large-scale manoeuvres as an example, their number increased from 16 in 1993 to 88 in 1996 and 120 in 1997.\r\n   While he was in office, South Korea was ruined due to his unheard-of misrule and tyranny.\r\n   Wielding the fascist \"National Security Law\", he frantically suppressed the patriotic movement for reunification and persecuted patriotic democrats on charges of \"sympathising with communism\" and \"spying.\"\r\n   He launched an ill-gotten campaign to wipe out the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) which had existed at the time of former military regimes. The brutal campaign was as terrible as the Kwangju massacre.\r\n   He is the kingpin of irregularities and corruption who converted South Korea into an ill-famed \"kingdom of corruption.\"\r\n   During his office, South Korea's foreign debts increased five times and its trade deficit more than 10 times, and large business groups as well as minor enterprises collapsed in succession.\r\n   The South Korean economy was driven into the worst-ever financial turmoil and South Korea is now on the verge of the \"state bankruptcy.\"\r\n   Fives years of Kim Young Sam's office were years of the most despicable treachery, disgrace, collapse and self-destruction.\r\n   Kim Young Sam, the traitor without an equal in history, must face stern judgement by the nation and history and kill himself.    \r\n  \r\n"
