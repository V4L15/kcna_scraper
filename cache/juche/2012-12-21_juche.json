He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists and technicians wound up the scientific research for improving the reliability and precision of the carrier rocket and the satellite in a short span of time through persevering inquiry and painstaking efforts. They successfully launched off the satellite despite severe cold in winter without exerting any influence on neighboring countries and thus powerfully demonstrated our space science and technology at the ultra modern level before the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 which the scientists, technicians and workers successfully launched is a Juche satellite as everything including designing, manufacture, assembly, lift-off and monitoring devices after the blast-off was indigenously produced 100 percent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful satellite launch is the greatest gift our people presented to Kim Jong Il and a shining review of the heroic struggle of the party and people this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The launch on which hinged the dignity of the nation was a grand declaration that demonstrated the DPRK's independent and legitimate right to use space for peaceful purposes before the world and a historic event that showed the over-all national power of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t You successfully launched the satellite, true to the behests of Kim Jong Il on the historic day when President Kim Il Sung conducted a test-fire of the first submachine gun manufactured in the country. So you are genuine soldiers and disciples of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and the most admirable heroes of the country. Our country is strong and the revolutionary cause of the party is steadily making victorious progress as we have such genuine patriots as you.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our party and people will never forget the heroic feats you performed by bringing about the great auspicious event of today but brilliantly record them in the history of dignified Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Korea for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fixed determination and will of our party to achieve the final victory of the revolution under the uplifted banner of Juche and build the strongest power, people's paradise looked up by the world on the 3 000-ri land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our party believes all present here as the most loyal comrades-in-arms and expects that you would continue to play a pioneer role in the general charge for building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present era is the age of science and technology and the age of knowledge-based economy and the national power is decided by the level of the development of science and technology. The position and prospect of the country and the nation hinge on it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our party pays deep attention to developing space science and technology which constitute the acme of ultramodern science and technology and regards the possession of satellites and carrier rockets as an important issue in building a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for cherishing the party's idea and intentions, further raising the hot wind of pushing back the frontiers of the latest science and technology to occupy space and thus glorifying our country as a space power admired by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He continued: You should develop and launch a variety of more working satellites including communications satellite and carrier rockets of bigger capacity with the same spirit and stamina with which you successfully launched satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief that they would tower high over the world by waging a campaign of brains and a campaign of ability under the uplifted motto of looking at the world, keeping their feet planted on the ground and demonstrate the honor of the country and the resourcefulness of the nation before the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only victory and glory are in store for the Korean people dynamically advancing amid blessings of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can block the advance of the powerful country unshakable in ideology and strong thanks to science and technology and the great people united close around the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us leap forward higher and faster on swift horses of science and technology for the prosperity of the great Paektusan nation and the happiness of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us make redoubled efforts to bring earlier the day when we will fly the red flag of victory on the eminence of a thriving nation."
