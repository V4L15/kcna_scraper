But their advertisement is nothing but a hypocrisy.\r\n   The shameless nature of the present regime is clearly manifested in the fact that it takes workers and students as the first target of suppression.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Historic truth cannot be concealed = KCNA commentary =\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are persistently kicking up a row over the non-existent \"suspected abduction of Japanese by North Korean operatives.\" \r\n   There is no need to say that what they seek in this third-rate racket is to bury their heinous crimes against the Korean people in the oblivion of history by incriminating the DPRK.\r\n   However, history never forgets national chauvinistic massacres committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people.\r\n   A strong earthquake, which erupted in the Kanto district of Japan on September 1, 1923, reduced it to ashes and caused fires in many places, driving Japanese people panic-stricken.\r\n   Instantly, the reactionary Japanese government, in a bid to divert elsewhere the public feelings, spread rumours that groups of Koreans \"kindled fires\" and rose in revolts. \r\n   In this way, it incited extreme national chauvinism.\r\n   The then minister of home affairs, Rentaro Mizuno, issued an order on merciless killing of Koreans to all parts of Japan. On his order, the army, military police, police, other armed groups and even rightwing organisations including the \"vigilance committee\" were mobilized in the butchery of Koreans.\r\n   Slaughters committed by the Japanese imperialist were cruel beyond the imagination of humankind.\r\n   Japanese Sakaguma Kikawa and Kenjiro Arai, eyewitnesses of the killing of Koreans in those days, had this to say:\r\n   \"The belly of a young Korean woman  was cut off, with a 6 to 7  month old unborn baby writhing in it. Moreover, I withdrew, terribly frightened to see a bamboo spear deeply driven into her womb.\" \"First of all, they beheaded children in turns in the eyes of their parents. Adults were bound to wooden walls and pillars so that they could not shake, and then they were mangled with swords.  Some Japanese with no swords began to cut limbs of living people with saws.\"\r\n   As many as 6,160 Koreans were killed in Tokyo, for instance,  from September 1 to 18. Those who were murdered in all parts of Japan are countless.\r\n   The oswiecim concentration camp is a place exposing racial chauvinistic massacres by fascist Germany, while the bloodshed committed at the time of the great Kanto earthquake is the height of the national chauvinistic slaughters by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n   In the whole period of their occupation of Korea, the Japanese imperialists massacred more than one million innocent Koreans at random.\r\n   The Korean people will make the Japanese brutes pay for their crimes without fail.\r\n   Leaving aside their heinous crimes, the Japanese reactionaries are clamouring about \"suspected abduction\" without presenting clear substances and evidences. It is certain that they have lost even their reason.\r\n   They must clearly see the trend of the times and act with discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan, instead of urging the pullout of U.S. Forces, is craftily calling for their \"transfer\" in favor of the U.S. intention for a permanent military presence, it says, and continues:\r\n   The United States intends to keep hold on Japan and use it as a shock brigade for the execution of its Asia strategy, while Japan seeks overseas expansion with the backing of the U.S.\r\n   Japan will take part in U.S. military operations under the pretext of \"support\" according to the new \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines,\" even though the U.S. Forces are \"transferred\" to South Korea and other areas outside Japan.\r\n   This is just what the Japanese reactionaries seek. By calling for \"transfer\" of the Okinawa-based U.S. marine corps, they want to pacify public demand for the U.S. troop pullout, take part in U.S. military operations without restrictions and launch a reinvasion.\r\n   Minju Joson says Japan should not seek transfer of U.S. Forces outside Japan but bring forward their complete withdrawal from the Asia-Pacific region for discussions.    \r\n\r\n"
