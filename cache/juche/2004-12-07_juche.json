Korea Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People in a statement Sunday called upon the peace-loving people of the world and international bodies and organizations to lift up louder voices demanding a thorough probe into the truth behind the secret nuclear development of south Korea and a total stop to it.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, the International Atomic Energy Agency covered up south Korea's secret experiments of nuclear substances under the manipulation of the United States. This stripped bare once again the true colors of the U.S. which is resorting to high-handed, outrageous and unilateral practices without hesitation, styling itself a police officer and a judge in the international arena, and the ugly sight of the IAEA which has been reduced to a dyed-in-the-wool servant of the U.S. paying no heed to justice, impartiality, international law and world opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear development of south Korea which has been carried on for decades with the patronage of the U.S. was obviously based on the latter's nuclear war strategy and it poses a grave threat to the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world and the destiny of the Korean nation and the security of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon the world people aspiring after independence and peace to unite and resolutely reject any attempt to turn the world into a unipolar world dominated by the U.S.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
