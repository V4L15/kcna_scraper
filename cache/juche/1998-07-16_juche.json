And the work has been disseminated and studied by Juche idea study groups and other public organisations in more than 50 countries in various forms and ways.\r\n   It was published on July 26, Juche 85 (1996). It is clarified in the work that with the establishment of the Juche outlook on social history, the Juche view of history, on the basis of the man-centred philosophical principle, the Juche philosophy has overcome the limitations of the preceding socio-historical outlook and brought a radical change in the socio-historical  view and standpoint.\r\n   A seminar on the work was held in Moscow with the attendance of political, public and academic figures and men of the press and similar seminars by the Mongolia-Korea Friendship Association, the Bulgarian Group for the Study of the Juche Idea and the Peruvian National Association for the Study of Kim Jong Ilism. It was stressed at the seminars that the work indicates the most principled and fundamental guidelines that parties and governments of all countries as well as Korea should maintain. \r\n\r\n"

Korean rulers for anti-north campaign\r\nPyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) released a statement on Wednesday accusing the South Korean rulers of escalating the anti-north campaign.\r\n   The statement said in part:\r\n   They, in a bid to harass the north, have infiltrated spies into the north in diverse ways and through sea and borders and persistently tried to destroy major establishments.\r\n   Even abroad, South Korean agents bribed, abducted or terrorized north Koreans.\r\n   Some time ago, a councillor of the South Korean embassy in Moscow was deported from Russia for espionage activities. \r\n The fact is well illustrative of how active South Korean agents are abroad for espionage on the north.\r\n   The South Korean puppets have also poured a colossal amount of money into arms buildup for war preparations against the north while continuing the anti-north smear campaign through radio and information activities abroad.\r\n   Nevertheless, they are now maliciously slandering the north by inventing a \"case\" and charging the north with \"intrusion\" and \"disturbance\" in the hope of camouflaging their anti-north campaign.\r\n   The anti-north campaign has become all the more frantic since Kang In Dok, an ultra-rightist, took the post of \"Minister of National Unification\" which is a variant of the \"Agency for National Security Planning.\"\r\n   The South Korean puppets must give up the foolish attempt to get something from disturbing the north, promptly stop infiltration of spies into the north, sabotages and subversive activities and dissolve the \"ANSP,\" the general headquarters of anti-north plots.\r\n   They must also dismiss Kang In Dok from his post at once.\r\n   If they fail to take such practical steps, improvement of inter-Korean relations and any sort of dialogue can hardly be expected.\r\n   If they continue seeking confrontation with the north and infiltrating spies into the north in defiance of our warnings, they should shoulder all the responsibility for the ensuing consequences. \r\n\r\n"

He has taken a long journey of 3,700-odd-day- on-site guidance equivalent to more than 10 years over the past 30 odd years since he began to work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, so as to have miracles and innovations wrought in different domains of the national economy.\r\n   In March 1975 he unfolded a grand blueprint to bring a new turn in the construction of the capital and led the construction of Rakwon Street. As a result, a street lined on each side by modern, high-rise houses for 3,000 households equipped with complete sets of high-quality furniture and goods for cultural life was built in a short period of six months. In this way Changgwang, Munsu, Kwangbok and Thongil streets took shape.\r\n   He visited the Ryongsong Associated Machinery Bureau in May 1984 and said that if a cold roller, key to meeting the ever growing need for iron and steel, is to be produced, a 10,000-ton press should be made. The workers under the bureau, in hearty response to his intention, succeeded in manufacturing a 10,000-ton press by their efforts in a  little over one year in the spirit  they displayed in making the 3,000-ton, 6,000-ton presses before.\r\n   The Anbyon Youth Power Station, symbol of the miracles in the 1990s, is the creation of his on-site guidance on more than 100 occasions.\r\n   People's Army soldiers, holding high the slogan \"When the party is determined, we can do anything \" completed the vast construction project including waterway tunneling and damming, only in a few years. \r\n   The West Sea bBrrage across the 8-km rough sea, long-distance belt conveyor lines  at the Unryul Mine and the Komdok Mining Complex and oxygen separators of 6,000 cubic metres and 18,000 cubic metres are the fruition of his ceaseless on-site guidance. \r\n\r\n"
