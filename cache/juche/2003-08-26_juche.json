But, this time, too, they not only connived at the anti-north rally but protected it by mobilizing police force instead of blocking it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean side should be held accountable for the incident, punish its mastermind, apologize to the north for it and give the north assurances against the recurrence of similar incident, the statement urged, adding that the north would closely watch the future attitude of the south Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

At the same time, bullets were shot at the center of the Nishi Credit Association of Korean Bank in Okayama City, another grave terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that those involved in the criminal act in the \"crime-related statement\" had threatened that they would resort to terrorism to prevent the entry of Mangyongbong-92 at Niigata Port on August 25, the statement continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a hideous criminal act not only of trampling down the ardent wish of a number of Koreans and students in Japan to visit their dear homeland where their families and relatives live but of violating the right of Koreans in Japan to visit their motherland based on noble humanitarianism and threatening their safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the massacre of Koreans at the time of the Kanto quake, the 80th anniversary of which falls on September 1, Chongryon vehemently denounces with towering national indignation the Japanese ultra-right reactionaries for their frequent terrorism threatening the life and property of Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Niigata Port has been put on the same grim maximum alert and the ultra-right terrorist group is creating a terror-ridden atmosphere as in early June when the entry of Mangyongbong-92 into the port was expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon representatives recently visited the Cabinet Office of the Japanese government to submit a written request addressed to the prime minister which had been adopted at the \"meetings of Koreans in Japan wishing a normal home visit by Mangyongbong-92\" held at Tokyo and Hyogo. However, the criminal act was perpetrated again. We can not but take a serious note of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should guarantee the status, human rights, safety and right to live to the Koreans in Japan in the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, following the trend of the times for peace, co-existence and co-prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should take into consideration the seriousness of the crimes committed in Fukuoka and Okayama and probe the truth behind them together with a series of incidents that occurred in Niigata and Kanagawa and take responsible measures to prevent the recurrence of such anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly urge the Japanese authorities to refrain from doing acts of inciting anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon sentiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nam Sung U answered questions put by pressmen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
