            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japanese LDP Heavyweight's Anti-DPRK Remarks in U.S. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- Abe, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, made reckless remarks against the DPRK, when meeting with some high-ranking officials of the Bush administration during his recent junket to the U.S.\r\n It was a visit of a servant aimed to be closeted with his master over ways of stifling the DPRK and garner support for Japan's hostile policy towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before them Abe zealously supported the U.S. in its unilateral assertion that the DPRK should \"scrap its nuclear program first,\" the stumbling block in the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. He, at the same time, again raised the issue of \"abducted Japanese\" and asked the U.S. to back Japan in its efforts to seek the Diet's passage of a \"bill on banning the entry of specified foreign ships,\" aimed to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, the U.S. was pleased with this behavior of Abe who represents the special class pro-U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rice, special assistant to the U.S. president for national security, and Kelly, assistant secretary of State, actively supported the intention of Japan, a junior ally of the U.S., to tighten economic sanctions against the DPRK, terming Japan's plan very effective and such option significant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the dialogue with the DPRK touted by the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries is nothing but hypocrisy and they are clinging to a sinister move to isolate and stifle the DPRK behind the curtain of dialogue, pursuant to an extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. has used the Japanese reactionaries as a shock brigade in laying an \"international siege\" to the DPRK. During Abe's American trip the U.S. disclosed its intention to retain a tighter grip on Japan and egg it on to an all-out showdown with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Echoing Abe's hue and cry over the issue of \"abducted Japanese\" which had already been solved with the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and with which Washington has nothing to do, American officials uttered the U.S. understands Japan's stand and the \"issue of abduction\" should be settled at the six-party talks. This reveals the U.S. ulterior design to use Japan as an advance party in its stand-off with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on history, one may know that the Japanese reactionaries are accustomed to meeting their interests with the backing of big countries. This time, too, they seek to implement their Asia policy for aggression, backed by the U.S., and isolate and stifle the DPRK politically and economically and thus lay a stronger springboard from which to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is known to be an ultra right-wing element who cried out for a \"preemptive attack\" upon the DPRK last year. But the fact that he hatched an undisguised plot to hurt the DPRK even in the U.S. goes to prove that what he remarked was by no means his personal view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should think twice over the disastrous consequences to be entailed by the confrontation with the DPRK before dancing to the tune of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already adopted the economic sanctions against the DPRK as a state policy by seeking the Diet carriage of \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange.\" It seems to calculate it can pressurize the DPRK as it pleases if the \"bill on banning the portcalls of specified foreign ships\" is adopted. This is, however, a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will regard any form of sanctions against the DPRK as a declaration of war and will promptly take a corresponding self-defensive measure when it judges its sovereignty has been infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries are well advised to bear in mind that their drop of the anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK would do them good either.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The world conscientious progressives who love justice and respect human rights should join efforts and mercilessly punish this group so as to prevent the recurrence of such monstrous human rights abuses. And they should never allow those forces to deliberately encourage such human rights abuses, slandering those anti-U.S. and independent countries and currying favor with the U.S., while shutting their eyes to the U.S. human rights abuses and dancing to its \"human rights ballad.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This once again clearly shows to the world that the United States is the world's worst violator of human rights as it has wantonly violated international laws such as \"Geneva Convention on the Protection of Civilians in Wartime\" and \"Geneva Convention on the Treatment of POWs\" and perpetrated acts diametrically contrary to the universally accepted ethics and common sense related to civilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such human rights abuses by GIs in Iraq teach a serious lesson to the world community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries are pulling up such anti-U.S. independent countries as the DPRK over \"the issue of human rights,\" shutting their eyes to the U.S. hideous human rights abuses, and fawning up the U.S., toeing its line. This is nothing but a criminal act of deliberately encouraging the infringement upon human rights as it is prompted by a sinister political intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. invasion of Iraq, such worst violation of human rights as ill-treatment of POWs would not have occurred. Had the Iraqi people defended their country through a life-and-death struggle, they would not have suffered such shame and tragedy as today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi situation teaches a lesson that for the protection of human rights it is necessary to defend the national sovereignty. It hardens the determination of the army and people of the DPRK to increase its deterrent force strong enough to beat back aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries and forces that respect human rights should join efforts and counter with just human rights offensive the hypocritical \"human rights campaign\" of the United States and the West.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This principled stand of the DPRK remains unchanged, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary carried as regards the opening of the meeting for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. in Beijing on May 12.\r\n The DPRK side advanced the proposal of \"reward for freeze\" at the last round of the six-party talks as the first-phase measure for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. The proposal is the most realistic and flexible proposal for peacefully settling the nuclear issue as the present relations between the two countries were taken into full consideration, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal commands unanimous understanding and support from those countries concerned and many countries of the world as it is part of the DPRK's sustained efforts to make a positive contribution to the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the two countries and the development of the overall situation on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will participate in the meeting to discuss the proposal of \"reward for freeze\" to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. turns aside this and takes the meeting as an opportunity to insist on its assertion that the DPRK should make CVID, that will entail very serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is of the view that there would be no need for it to sit with the U.S. at the negotiating table if the U.S. seeks to force the DPRK, not a defeated country, to accept its absurd demand, talking about \"irreversible and the like.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will participate in the meeting with patience and magnanimity but the efforts made by the DPRK side alone would not be enough to make the meeting fruitful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything depends on the U.S. attitude. If the U.S. seeks to waste time, insisting on its old assertions as it did at the last round of the talks, that will only result in throwing hurdles in the way of the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue, to say nothing of scuttling the meeting itself and the U.S. will be held fully responsible for its improper behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to see how the world goes by and make a proper option with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
