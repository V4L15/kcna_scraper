This is an unpardonable act of conspiring with the U.S. in its moves to ignite a war of aggression against the north as this helps it achieve its purpose while minimizing the casualties of its forces in case of \"contingency\".

This alarmed the U.S. more than anyone else. It has egged the ultra-right conservative forces including the GNP which regards it as the savior on to grab power. What is worth notice is the \"impeachment of the president\" just before the NA election last year. But this plot was checked and frustrated by the south Korean people who saw through the criminal scheme hidden behind it and the pro-U.S. conservative forces suffered a dismal defeat even in the NA election that followed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in which the progressive reform forces gained strength and the GNP and other conservative forces got inferior in strength in the NA could not but be a crisis shaking the last stronghold of the U.S. colonial rule. Utterly dismayed by this, the U.S. is orchestrating the current coup to maintain the pro-American nature of the political camp by means of elbowing out of the NA lawmakers from the political parties seeking progress and reforms on charges of \"illegal acts\" through another plot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Catastrophic will be the consequences in case such reactionary conservative forces as the GNP get its clutches on the NA again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever values the future of the country and the nation should deal a devastating blow to the criminal moves of the GNP and other ultra-right conservative forces to occupy the NA again and wrest \"power\" in south Korea under the backstage manipulation of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This fact was revealed by a telegraphic message discovered in September of 2002 from the \"diary of the secret operation of the Japanese troops stationed in Korea\" which had been preserved in the library for defense studies of the Japan Defence Agency since it was worked out by the imperial Japanese army on April 8, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The list of the Korean victims of forcible drafting obtained and disclosed last year dealt with the fact that at least 7,000 young Koreans were drafted into the \"agricultural service corps Nos. 3, 4 and 5\" for the imperial Japanese army. They were taken away from almost all parts of the Korean Peninsula including North and South Phyongan, Hwanghae, South Hamgyong, North and South Chungchong and Kangwon Provinces in about spring of 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear from the data that at that time each corps was made up with 7 companies and each company comprised more than 250 Koreans on an average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The results of the analysis and investigation into the above-said list confirmed the fact that the person registered with the Japanese name \"Taihan Umenobu\" on the list of  corps No. 3  was victim Jin Thae Bom (born on August 23, 1925) who lived in Taedonggang District, Pyongyang, and died in December 2004 and another person registered with Japanese name \"Chirin Kanemura\" on the list of corps No. 4 is victim Kim Chi Rin (born on March 11, 1924) who now resides in Central District of Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report gives a detailed account of how Kim Chi Rin and Jin Thae Bom were drafted into the corps respectively early in January of 1945 and in March of 1945 together with more than 3,000 young and middle-aged Koreans by the force of the evil law called \"law on state general mobilization\" and were forced to do slave labor there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report said that the committee obtained not a few materials proving the slave labour forced by the imperial Japanese army upon many young Koreans drafted into the corps. It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists drove those Koreans to the shambles of their war of aggression and dreadful places of drudgery as their \"soldiers\" and \"civilian employees for the army\" in the past. This was the crime related to the forcible drafting and forced labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This crime was a grave encroachment upon human rights. It was a crime against humanity and a crime related to slavery as it seriously challenged the justice and morality of the international community and wantonly breached international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government is, therefore, obliged to admit its responsibility for the crimes and take practical steps to restore the honor of those victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it has evaded the state responsibility for the crimes for the last six decades since the end of the war, insisting that the issue of Japan's postwar settlement has already been settled through a multi-national treaty and a bilateral treaty despite the resolutions and recommendations of the UN and other international organizations and juridical bodies demanding a fair solution to its crimes related to the forcible drafting and forced labor imposed upon Koreans including the issue of \"soldiers\" and \"civilian\r\nemployees for the army.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the Japanese authorities staged a farce of paying \"consolation money\" to some foreigners in Japan who had been taken away as \"soldiers\" and \"civilian employees\" for the imperial Japanese army to gloss over this issue. But they are persistently insisting that there is \"no reason to compensate\" for the forcible drafting of over 8.4 million Koreans and the abduction of Koreans and other crimes committed by Japan against humanity in the past \"in view of the existing law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing reactionaries falsified historical facts by claiming that those crimes are groundless and those Koreans went to Japan of their own accord. They unhesitatingly disallowed victims of the forcible drafting and bereaved families of the DPRK to enter Japan to participate in the meeting to hear testimonies and memorial services held there on several occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that though 60 years have passed since Japan's defeat the present Japanese government has not made any honest apology and even a small compensation to the victims and the bereaved families in the DPRK who suffered more than any others from the inhuman crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government must take this year as an opportunity to liquidate the history of its aggression and crimes in the past, thoroughly probe the truth about the serious human rights abuses committed by Japan in the past including the forcible drafting of Koreans and fully open them to the public, punish those responsible for the crimes and take practical measures to make honest apology and compensation to all the victims and the bereaved families as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, Japan has not yet redeemed its monstrous crimes perpetrated against humanity though a century has passed since then. Moreover, it is still busy raising a hue and cry over the issue of \"a few abductees\" which had already been settled.\r\nKoreans can not but ask Japan if it has the face to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary as regards the recent disclosure of a confidential document of Emperor Kojong informing the international community of the injustice of the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The disclosure of this document scientifically proved that the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" which the Japanese imperialists used as a pretext for depriving Korea of her diplomatic right and enforcing the \"governor-general rule\" was a false and fraudulent document as it failed to go through elementary procedures and lacked a necessary form as a treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the document fully disclosed, Japan is the century-old sworn enemy of the Korean people as it usurped the sovereignty of the Korean nation and reduced them to colonial slaves in the most savage manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, Japan is citing what it calls the issue of \"abduction\" to intensify its smear campaign against the DPRK over \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how Japan hypes the issue of \"abduction\" in a desperate bid to evade its responsibility to redeem its past crimes this will only add to its crimes. With nothing can Japan beautify or cover up its shameful past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past are the most monstrous ones baffling human imagination. It is, therefore, an important political task of the international community to force Japan to redress them for the sake of peace and development of humankind and the building of a new just world structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people in the DPRK will hold Japan accountable for all crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in Korea including what they perpetrated in 1905 and force it to pay a dear price for those crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Slogan Calling for Following Anti-Japanese Guerrillas \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have turned out in onward march for Songun revolution under the slogan \"Let us produce, study and live like the anti-Japanese guerrillas!\"\r\n The slogan reflects the revolutionary will of the Workers' Party of Korea to follow the revolutionary spirit, fighting trait and mode of life of the anti-Japanese revolutionary war veterans and to carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu down through generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan was set forth in the 1970s. It, however, is still seen everywhere in Korea--towns, villages, factories and farms and mines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that the Korean people harden their determination to defend and carry forward the revolutionary traditions established by President Kim Il Sung during the anti-Japanese armed struggle and to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche pioneered by him with the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people of the DPRK have won victory at each stage of the revolutionary development, overcoming all the difficulties and trials like the anti-Japanese guerrillas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the years of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march they keenly realized that no way is better than that of the revolutionary veterans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese guerrillas made bombs by themselves. In the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, the Korean people put factories into operation again, consolidated the foundation for Songun and safeguarded socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The will of the Korean people is well illustrated by the fact that they have facelifted the revolutionary battle and historic sites in the Mt. Paektu area, KPA soldiers, working people of all strata, youth and students visit them in an endless stream and they study hard the reminiscences of anti-Japanese guerrillas as a true textbook of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the slogan, the Korean people will certainly register signal successes this year in which the 60th anniversaries of the Workers' Party of Korea and national liberation fall and thus build a great prosperous powerful nation at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Doctors Prove Successful in Cardiac Surgery\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The Cardiovascular Surgery Department of  the Hospital attached to Pyongyang University of Medicine in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has proved successful in heart operation of a three-year-old girl suffering from tetralogy of fallot coupled with atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus and pulmonary atresia.\r\n Now the patient is in normal condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The department, founded in the 1970s, has been made up of competent doctors who are capable of doing any complex heart operation including tetralogy of fallot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the team successfully carried out surgery of a baby under five months with congenital cardiac malformation in the 2000s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has made more than 300 operations every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rate of successful operation is 97 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prof. and Dr. Sin Jae Chon, a Labor Hero, said in an interview with KCNA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of the DPRK are enjoying free medical service. It is the duty of the medical workers to let the people fully enjoy benefits from the socialist health system. We thus have striven hard to do our bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have established a system in which our department carries on functions of various departments such as diagnosis before operation, anesthesia, surgery, extracorporeal circulation and intensive cure in a comprehensive way. And a special attention is paid to pooling medical arts and minds of doctors and nurses. As a result, the treatment processes have been organically linked to bear a fine fruition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
