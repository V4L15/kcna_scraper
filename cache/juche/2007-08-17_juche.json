Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes that this proves the U.S. is chiefly to blame for disturbing peace in Mideast and proliferating weapons of mass destruction there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pretending to be concerned for the regional peace, talking about the convocation of an \"international conference for Mideast peace\" and the like. But its real intention behind the curtain of \"Mideast peace\" is to bring profits to its munitions monopolies, split and alienate Arab countries and thus isolate anti-U.S. countries and establish an unchallenged domination over the regions rich in oil resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan for huge weapon sale to Mideast countries is, in a nutshell, aimed at deterring Iran and Syria advancing along the road of independence against the U.S. from exerting influence upon other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said U.S. plan is a dangerous act as it fosters division and arms race among Mideast countries and disturbs regional peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. implementation of the plan would accelerate the arms race in the region and aggravate the conflict between Sunni and Shiite forces and render the regional situation more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking a lot about \"peace\" in public, while working hard to beef up its armed forces behind the scene. This double-dealing tactics of the U.S. convince the Korean people of the justice of the DPRK's principled stand that \"the principle of action for action\" should be observed in the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can achieve its sinister political aim through such huge weapon sale to Mideast.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an unpardonable criminal act to turn the flow of the times toward national reconciliation and unity, peace and reunification back to the pre-June 15 state of confrontation by forcing the war exercises against the north at whatever cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP once again stands naked, revealing its treacherous colors as a pro-U.S. pet dog by persisting in the military maneuvers which would impose a holocaust of war upon the nation, under the plea of \"military alliance\" denounced by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must not go unnoticed that the GNP dare to cast a slur on the DPRK, abusing the public opinion opposed to the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" as \"something playing into the hands of the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the GNP seeks is to worsen the inter-Korean relations, what come may, by getting on the nerve of the army and people of the DPRK with such assertion. By this it has been vividly revealed that \"the change of policy toward the north\" advertised by it is nothing but a sheer lie to win over the popular sentiments.
