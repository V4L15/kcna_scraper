The U.S. should stop its criminal moves for space militarization and arms race at once.  Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush warlike forces are contemplating going ahead with a program to develop satellites equipped with interceptor missiles. This is a dangerous military move as it will spark a new space arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have already deployed ground interceptor missiles in Alaska and California. As if it were not enough with this, they are going to spend an exorbitant amount of money for pushing ahead with the above-said development program. This is aimed at building missile bases not only on the ground and the sea but in space as well in a bid to cover the world with a dense network of missiles, threaten, blackmail and contain other countries with its unchallenged military edge and realize its ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stepped-up moves to develop satellites equipped with interceptor missiles and establish the missile defence system (MD) are designed to establish a military monopoly on space and secure an absolute strategic edge and an unchallenged position there. Through this it seeks to aim at any region and country of the world from its space military bases and mount a preemptive attack on them any time without difficulty in a bid to establish world supremacy. Herein lies the reactionary and dangerous nature of the above-mentioned U.S. moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush warlike forces persist in their frantic moves to develop and deploy new-type space arms, obsessed by an anachronistic daydream, this will compel other countries to take actions against them.

The DPRK will continue to increase its self-defensive nuclear deterrent as the U.S. gets evermore desperate in its moves to stifle the DPRK intended to bring it to its knees by military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are now fully prepared to cope with the U.S. moves to stifle it which are getting more malicious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should look straight into this and promptly abandon its extremely dangerous arms buildup.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's Anti-DPRK Human Rights Racket Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Grand National Party is working hard to hold a \"seminar on legislation calling for the improved human rights of the population in north Korea\" at the \"National Assembly,\" while busying itself to fake up an evil \"north Korean human rights law.\" In this regard a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement Wednesday terms this an unpardonable provocation of a puppet joining the U.S. in its anti-DPRK human rights campaign and an unbearable challenge to it.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's loudmouthed \"human rights issue in north Korea\" is nothing but a U.S. sheer fabrication aimed at inventing a pretext for stifling the Korean-style socialist system which was chosen and has been defended by the Korean people themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's moves are no more than crimes against the nation as they are intended to throw a wet blanket over the south Koreans' pro-north and pro-reunification tendency which has grown strong in the run-up to the 5th anniversary of the historic June 15 joint declaration and support the U.S. in its efforts to provoke a war against the DPRK and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never remain an on-looker to the criminal acts of the GNP whose days are numbered but surely settle accounts with it in the name of the entire Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
