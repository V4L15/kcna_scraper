Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- The youths and students bitterly denounce the U.S. and the right-wing conservative forces for trying to build up opinion hostile to the north by falsifying facts and will join all Koreans desirous of the peace and the reunification on the Korean Peninsula and true human rights in the dynamic struggle against \"a rally on the human rights issue in the north.\" \r\n The Joint Conference of Youth and Students for Peace against War and the Withdrawal of U.S. Forces from south Korea clarified this stand at a press conference held near the U.S. embassy in Seoul on Dec 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A press release read out at the conference charged that the purpose of the rally to be held by the U.S. and right-wing conservative forces is to bedevil the improving inter-Korean relations and throw a hurdle in the way of achieving the peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Reunification Solidarity for Implementing the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration and Achieving the Peace on the Korean Peninsula in a statement issued on the day bitterly condemned the above-said rally, terming it an extension of the U.S. hostile policy toward the north.\r\n The U.S. should give up its foolish hostile policy toward the north and approach the dialogue from a sincere stand and immediately halt the anti-human rights, anti-peace and anti-north political offensive, the statement urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Taejon and South Chungchong Provincial Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration in a statement released on the same day declared that there should be a rally in the south to demand the repeal of the \"National Security Law\", a pronoun of human rights abuses. \r\n The Bush administration's economic sanctions against the north, the railroading of \"a resolution on the human rights issue\", the projected rally on the human rights issue in the north and others are aimed to isolate and stifle the north, the statement said, strongly demanding an immediate cancellation of the plan to hold the rally.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This was attributable to the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of south Korea, it added. \r\n Accusing the U.S. of listing all vital fields of south Korea including agriculture and education as principal targets of its neo-liberal \"globalization\" in a bid to plunder its people and putting it under constant pressure, the appeal continued: It has sought to dump its rice in the south keeping officials of the government and media under its tight control. The U.S. ceaseless interference in the internal affairs of south Korea and its moves to pressurize it are not confined to the opening of the rice market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Calling for giving vent to the farmers' indignation through a nationwide struggle against the U.S, the appeal underscored the need for the youths and students to take the lead in the struggle to put an end to the U.S. interference in the internal affairs of south Korea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "EU Urged to Behave Itself as Befitting Its Status \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- There is a widespread rumor worldwide that the U.S. operates secret prisons in East European countries and CIA planes with \"POWs\" on board are using airports of European countries in secrecy. European countries have now buckled down to probing the case, asserting if it is true that those secret U.S. prisons exist in East European countries, it is a serious human rights abuse and a wanton violation of international law.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe European countries are now demanding a thorough probe into the truth about the presence of the U.S. secret prisons there and the involvement of some countries in the region in the case because it constitutes a crime against humanity which should never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But some dishonest forces within the EU, while  keeping mum about the hideous human rights abuses committed by the U.S., are talking this or that about \"human issues\" of those countries that incur their displeasure in a bid to use that as a leverage for attaining their sinister political purpose. A typical example of their behavior was the EU's recent lobbying for the introduction and adoption of the human rights resolution against the DPRK at the UN, a product of the U.S. instigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the EU truly stands for settling human rights issues on the principle of impartiality it should hold the U.S. accountable for its human rights abuses and bring them to the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something beyond common sense for the EU to shut its eyes to the U.S. massacre of civilians as evidenced by its act of using chemical weapons called white phosphorus against peaceable citizens to burn even their bones to ashes, to say nothing of its savage suppression of POWs and orchestrated the farce of adopting the anti-DPRK human rights resolution as if it were not enough with taking issue with its non-existent human rights issue. \r\n Such behavior of the EU is a clear indication of its double standards as regards human rights and the policy of extreme discrimination.\r\n Britain that currently chairs the EU and some other forces have not yet rolled back their policy of toeing the U.S. line. They are so mean-spirited as to save their faces and preserve their clout by currying favor with the U.S. This is certainly not befitting the EU status. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never taken negative approach towards the EU nor sought to keep it at a distance. The EU should behave with principle from the stand of impartiality if it wants to exercise its influence and remain dignified in the international arena.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they have not yet been rooted out even in the June 15 era of reunification. They are laying obstacles in the way of hewing out the destiny of the nation. In actuality, the sycophantic traitorous forces such as the Grand National Party of south Korea are now zealously encouraging outside forces in their moves against Korean reunification and for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The awareness of the nation as a driving force provides ideological strength for combating flunkeyism and the idea of depending on foreign forces.\r\n This awareness reinforces the will and enthusiasm to wage an indomitable struggle for the victory of the cause of independent reunification.\r\n If one is equipped with this awareness, one will be replete with patriotic enthusiasm to hew out one's destiny through the concerted efforts of the nation and through its struggle, not depending on foreign forces, and the resolution and principle to beat back outsiders' intervention and pressure and settle everything from a Juche-based viewpoint and stand of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era witnesses fierce confrontation and struggle between the pro-reunification patriotic forces aspiring after independent reunification and the anti-reunification forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the driving force means the might of unity. If all Koreans deeply cherish the above-said awareness, irrespective of ideology, this will help the north and south go united close and achieve stronger great national unity and the June 15 era of reunification will make a dynamic advance, meeting all challenges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The awareness of the nation as a driving force constitutes ideological might and source of strength that make the nation strong and accelerate the independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in a statement issued Thursday in this regard.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also a premeditated political operation aimed to contain the June 15 forces standing for reunification and realize its ambition to wrest power through the next \"presidential election\" by isolating and ostracizing progressive and reformist forces as \"pro-north leftist forces.\"\r\n The statement recalls that the GNP representative at a function for pinning yellow ribbons to urge the safe repatriation of south Koreans abducted to the north held at the party head office on Nov. 30 let loose extremely provocative remarks that she wished to see an earlier improvement of the human rights performance in the north through the rapid spread of the yellow waves, urging the government to exert utmost efforts to realize the earliest possible repatriation of abducted south Koreans and ROK POWs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the north side has clarified more than once, the issue of \"south Koreans abducted to the north and ROK POWs\" touted by the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea including the GNP does not exist, the statement stresses, branding the GNP as a despicable fascist terrorist criminal group which has lost its face to talk about \"abduction\" and the \"POWs issue.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
