            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Terms U.S. Human Rights Abuser \r\n Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Tuesday as regards the serious racial discrimination in the U.S. sparking off world public uproar:\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, a black teenager was shot to death by a white policeman in Ferguson City, Missouri State, the U.S. and police ruthlessly cracked down on protesters, leveling their rifles at them and firing tear gas and smoke shells. Against this backdrop, there occurred a shuddering incident in another city in which a policeman shot another young black man to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, a country wantonly violating the human rights where people are subject to discrimination and humiliation due to their races and they are seized with such horror that they do not know when they are shot to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The protests in Ferguson City and other parts of the U.S. are an eruption of the pent-up discontent and resistance of the people against racial discrimination and inequality deeply rooted in the American society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent cases brought to light the human rights performance in the U.S. and underscored the urgent need to force the U.S. to sit in the dock of a human rights court.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. issued every year a report taking issue with \"human rights performances\" of other countries as if it were an \"international human rights judge\" but this time suffered disgrace and became a laughing stock of the world owing to what happened in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better honestly accept the unanimous accusations of the broad international community and mind its own business, instead of interfering in the internal affairs of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should not seek solutions to its problem in suppressing demonstrators but bring to light the real picture of the American society, a graveyard of human rights, and have a correct understanding of what the genuine human rights are like  and how they should be guaranteed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should know that it is bound to get itself into a big trouble unless it behaves with discretion, not knowing where it stands."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Terms U.S. Chief Culprit of Counterfeit Notes Printing and Circulation\r\n Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- Various U.S. papers on August 14 reported about the disclosure of the biggest-ever counterfeit note case.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to them, the U.S. investigation authorities in May this year arrested ten Americans and three Israelis who had printed 100 US dollar notes and circulated them since the 1990s. The bogus notes printed by them reportedly amounted to 77 million U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The papers also disclosed that forged notes to the tune of 156 million US dollars were confiscated, 262 illegal mints discovered and 2 668 criminals arrested.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. is the center for printing counterfeit notes and a prime mover of their circulation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is worth noting that CIA and other government institutions of the U.S. have taken the lead in perpetrating such crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some years ago, the German paper Frankfurlter Allgemeine disclosed that CIA had forged notes at a secret print shop in the suburbs of Washington by using the research findings made by experts on counterfeit notes in Europe and Asia and on the basis of the testimonies made by those related to printer manufacturing business. An author of a book about note-fakers and the secret lurking behind bank note printing claimed that such bogus dollar notes are illegally printed at the same time when genuine ones are printed and the forging of such top-class counterfeit notes can be done only by such U.S. government organ as CIA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world community is unanimous in recognizing that the U.S. administration has forged notes for spending a lot of money for secret operations to stamp out freedom and democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration is the A-class criminal printing counterfeit notes and circulating them. It is, indeed, the most hideous criminal state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is accusing the DPRK of \"printing counterfeit notes\", a height of impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a bid to make its false \"story about north's counterfeit notes\" sound plausible, the U.S. has floated such false rumors that north Korea has forged US dollar notes by importing equipment and paper from a certain country and ink from a certain country. It even claimed that the above-said story was testified by \"defectors from the north\" and the \"super notes\" faked by north Korea are so sophisticated that only ultra-modern note discriminating machine can identify them and criminals and equipment should be handed over to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. has failed to produce evidence proving its assertions. On the contrary, the U.S. public is becoming increasingly vocal expressing suspicions and objections.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, and some other hawks in the U.S. confessed that they had no convincing evidence proving \"north Korea's forging of notes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even U.S. papers disclosed that the figure 100 on a \"north Korea-made super note\" was written by special ink which is being supplied only to the Bureau of the Mint under strict control and, moreover, the \"witnesses\" are all incredible \"defectors from the north\" and swindlers who had never seen the process of making \"bogus US dollars\" but only seek to get money by making false testimonies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. investigation authorities formed a group and conducted investigation for almost a year but what it found at last was the fact that \"the story about north Korea's counterfeit notes\" was incredible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the \"story about the DPRK's involvement in forging notes\" is nothing but a conspiratorial charade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disgusting true colors of tricksters who slander others, not knowing where they stand, are bound to be revealed any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Counterfeit notes printing, drug trafficking and other crimes are chronic ills of the U.S. The world public is ridiculing the U.S. for frequently orchestrating such charades in a bid to carry out its hegemonic scenario."

But those were not sent to their parents as yet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 18 of them are kept in cold storages as their parents refused to take over them and send them to crematories till the truth about their deaths is probed, because they declared they could not agree with the military authorities' confirmation of their deaths as suicides. The rest of the remains were those of the soldiers whose families refused to take over them, infuriated by their refusal to keep their promises that they would treat them as the service members who died while in service after their bodies are cremated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows how desperately the present ruling forces of south Korea are working to reduce the puppet army to a colonial mercenary army of the U.S. imperialists and a means for confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north by fostering violence in its units."
