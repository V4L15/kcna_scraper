Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The participants in the 635th Wednesday Meeting for the settlement of the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Japanese army held in south Korea on Dec. 8 made public a statement demanding the Japanese government's formal apology and compensation, according to a news report.\r\n The statement noted with bitter indignation that the minister of Education and Science of Japan recently let loose a rigmarole that \"it is very good to find less words about comfort women for the Japanese army and forcible drafting\" in the history textbook published by the \"Society to Make New History Textbook,\" an ultra-right conservative organization. It branded the act of distorting and concealing the wrong doings as another crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should immediately stop tampering with Japan's history in a bid to justify its war of aggression and formally apologize and compensate the victims of the crime related to \"comfort women,\" urged the statement. \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Action to Disconnect Internet Sites under Fire Abroad \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) - The British Association for the Study of the Songun Policy, the British Group for the Study of the Juche Idea and the Society for the Independence and Unity of England on December 5 issued a joint statement condemning the action taken by the south Korean authorities to disconnect the Internet sites related to the DPRK.\r\n The statement said: Their action runs counter to the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration as it is a grave act of doing harm to the north-south relations and obstructing the reunification of Korea. This is little different from the erstwhile puppet fascist regimes' suppression of the press. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the south Korean authorities' loudmouthed \"reconciliation and cooperation\" are nothing but hypocrisy and their real intention is to stand in confrontation with the DPRK, the statement noted, demanding the south Korean authorities withdraw at once their anachronistic and reactionary measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. Group for the Study of Songun Politics, the U.S. Solidarity Committee to Support the National Democratic Front of south Korea and the south Korean People's Struggle in a joint statement on December 9 held that it is not a crime but patriotism for the progressive masses of south Korea to follow the stand of the DPRK to achieve the reunification of Korea. It assailed all moves of the south Korean authorities to crack down upon them.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Police Fascist Outrage Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- The south Korean police authorities forcibly walked away in broad daylight Paek Jong Ho, chairman of the 12th-term south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon). The security investigation team of the Seoul District Police Office tried to justify its action, charging that Paek violated the \"National Security Law (NSL),\" a leftover of the era of confrontation, after joining the \"enemy-benefiting Hanchongryon\" and spearheaded \"illegal demonstrations.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a fascist outrage intended to arrest the just struggle of the south Korean students for independent reunification, social progress and reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should have praised Hanchongryon for having stood in the van of the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification reflecting the aspiration and will of the south Korean students. It is preposterous, indeed, for them to label it \"enemy-benefiting\" and \"illegal\" and suppress and persecute its members. It is the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration in which the north and the south are working hard to achieve independent reunification through national cooperation, while getting reconciled and united with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the south Korean police authorities are indiscriminately arresting members of Hanchongryon on charges of violating the NSL after branding it as an \"enemy-benefiting organization.\" This unwarranted suppression is intolerable as it is anachronistic and fascist rowdyism against the reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces including the Grand National Party are desperately working to keep the evil law, much upset by the development which may lead to depriving them of the leverage for their existence. The south Korean authorities, however, are incriminating the just activities of Hanchongryon, instead of exercising their authority to stop the ultra- right conservatives from maneuvering against reforms. This only reveals their limitation and precipitates their frustration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities persist in their anachronistic and suppression of Hanchongryon against the nation's will, they will not be able to escape a stern judgement of the history and the nation. \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

On the contrary, warm days continue and it often rains much. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the result of the high temperature which has continued in winter season for several consecutive years. The high temperature makes snow fall like rain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year there was much rainfall around the beginning of winter as compared with other years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Ryong U, vice director of the Central Meteorological Institute under the Hydro-meteorological Service, told KCNA that such abnormal weather will continue until December 20 or more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lowest temperature in the morning is expected to be 5-8 degrees centigrade below zero in most areas of Korea except the northern inland in this period, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that the lowest temperature in the morning in the Pyongyang area is 3 degrees centigrade higher than the usual temperature which recorded 11 degrees centigrade below zero. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This abnormal phenomenon has been caused by the atmospheric circulation changed by the global mild climate. It makes it impossible to form the Siberian continental high pressure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
