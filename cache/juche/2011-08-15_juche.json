Korean Warmongers of Their False Propaganda\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, August 15 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean warmongers staged such farce as perpetrating a retaliatory shelling, mistaking the blasting in the site for the reclamation of Ryongmae-do Tideland for shelling from the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe head of the north side delegation at the north-south military working talks irrefutably probed the truth behind the incident.

The above-said reclamation site was very near from Yonpyong Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the trite method of the south Korean warmongers to spark off a shocking incident to pull the north and kick up a war racket under that pretext. The recent case was little short of the \"Cheonan\" warship and Yonphyong Island incidents, given that it was far-fetchedly cooked up and a provocation was made under that pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was not once that the south Korean warmongers staged such poor charade to brand the north as a \"provocateur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is the aim sought by them in making much fuss over the north's shelling \"provocation\" and the like. It was aimed to chill the desire for detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula and escalate the confrontation at any cost. Such provocation goes to clearly prove who sincerely stands for dialogue and peace on the peninsula and pursues confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey would be well advised to stop such ridiculous burlesque, mindful that they will have to pay a very price for escalating the confrontation with compatriots going against the trend of the times."
