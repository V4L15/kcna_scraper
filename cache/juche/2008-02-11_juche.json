Paektu between Feb. 3 and 9 on the occasion of the birthday of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The members of the group placed floral baskets and bunches of flowers before the statues of President Kim Il Sung in the Pochonbo Revolutionary Battle Site, on the shore of the Lake Samji and the Chongbong Camping Site before paying tribute to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They deeply grasped the preeminent military tactics and strategy of the President, looking round the then command post of the Pochonbo battle and the police post of the Japanese imperialists, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They arrived at the secret camp in Mt. Paektu after visiting the Posori spring site, the Junghung tableland, the Phothae Revolutionary Site and the Rimyongsu Revolutionary Site. They held a meeting before the old home of Kim Jong Il in the secret camp to vow their loyalty to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey went round the group sculptures of the Samjiyon Grand Monument and visited some places in the area of Samjiyon including the Paektu Hall, the Samjiyon Schoolchildren's Palace and the sports village in the area of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the study tour, they conducted diverse political and cultural activities including a question-and-answer contest on the revolutionary traditions of the Workers' Party of Korea and a joint editorial for this year and a public presentation on the reminiscences of anti-Japanese guerrillas, a poem-reciting and singing contest and competitions in choruses of revolutionary songs and issuing combat flash news.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is an original and Juche-based perfect orchestra of Korean style incomparable with any other preceding orchestra in view of its organization, tone and representation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mixed orchestra of Korean style is characterized by that it combined the western musical instruments with national ones with a clear purpose from the Juche-oriented stand and that its scientific accuracy is fully guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The creation of the mixed orchestra of Korean style helped establish the Juche character and national character in production and creation in all fields of music and art and make progress in depth while satisfactorily meeting the growing aesthetic demand of the popular masses and put an end to the development of the European-centered orchestra. It also showed in practice a valuable example that all countries can achieve the genuine development of orchestra only when they draw on the experience and tradition of the western orchestra based on musical instruments and music of their own countries to meet their people's aesthetic and emotional demand.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Guaranteeing peace on the Korean Peninsula ensures world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now it is a common requirement and duty of the progressives to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula as it is directly related to world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish ambition for the United States to try to stifle the DPRK by force. If the U.S. imperialists ignite a war of aggression in this land again the army and people of the DPRK will wipe out all aggressors with thousand-fold merciless blow of retaliation and remove the root cause of war, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
