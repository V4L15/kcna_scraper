            "content": "KCNA on CIA chief's remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) director Tenet reportedly told the senate intelligence committee on Feb. 6 that the DPRK continues to develop weapons of mass destruction including ballistic missiles fitted with nuclear warheads, adding that the worldwide proliferation of weapons of mass destruction has definitely reached a dangerous level.\r\n This is a clear indication that a string of unprecedented war outcries heard from U.S. political circles and military are a direct product of the U.S. foreign policy and the CIA is directly involved in this fuss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The so-called \"concrete testimony\" made by the CIA chief at the committee to the DPRK's non-existent development and \"threat\" of nukes and weapons of mass destruction proves that moves for a war against the DPRK as evidenced by harsh remarks calling for an \"preemptive attack\" are being put into practice in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tenet's testimony clearly indicates that information and analysed materials provided by the CIA, the center for subversive activities and sabotage, plot-breeding and the fabrication of lies, have always been nothing but sophism designed to slander and do harm to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's biggest possessor of nukes and weapons of mass destruction.      Yet, it shaped a war budget of astronomical figures taking the world by surprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard reality the U.S. is vociferating about \"threat\" to it, insisting that a small country's conventional weapons for self-defence are the \"weapons of mass destruction.\" This is challenge to the independent right of the sovereign states and a mockery of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its day-dream to stifle the DPRK with a strong-arm policy, stooping to any infamy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should stop running amuck, clearly understanding the faith of the people and army of the DPRK that the world can not exist without Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

According to it, 40 cases of GIs' mass killings were reported to the Defence Ministry from October 1999 to January 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs' mass killings were reported from the then Yongchun-myon, Tanyang county, North Chungchong Province, Konmyong-myon, Sachon city, South Kyongsang Province, Nam-myon, Ryosu city, South Jolla Province, and Songol, Phohang city, North Kyongsang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the ministry authorities ordered to conduct only in a form of papers the investigation into almost all areas under the pretext that this may be another dispute, the news report said.    \r\n\r\n"

This clearly explains that the core of the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK and its strategy for world domination are to mobilize even multi-national forces for the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, the U.S. pressure can never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists unleash the second Korean war, the army and people of the DPRK will mete out deadly blows to the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is also an option for the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

Rice must know about this fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for her call for \"renouncement of terrorism\", the DPRK has already made clear its principled stand that it is opposed to all forms of terrorism and any support to it. It also acceded to international conventions on prevention of terrorism and has strictly abided by its international commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a stark fact recognized by the U.S. authorities themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Rice again pulled up the DPRK over \"terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her argument this time is little short of deliberate and provocative war outcries designed to put political pressure and make a military attack on the DPRK under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such outbursts made by advocates of the cold war in the wake of Bush's recent argument about \"axis of evil\" are timed to coincide with the U.S. massive arms buildup and the ill-boding moves of its forces, posing a serious threat of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never overlook this touch-and-go situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not act rashly, mindful that there is a limit to our warning and self-restrain.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
