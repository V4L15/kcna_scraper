Korea Accused of Using Channel of Military Exchange for Confrontation\r\n Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- Brisk bilateral and multilateral military cooperation is under way in the international arena to defuse military tensions among countries and regions and promote stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean Lee Myung Bak regime, the worst confrontation maniacs, is using even the channel of military exchange of good faith as a theatre for such confrontation as hurling mud at fellow countrymen and perpetrating new provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesperson for the Bureau of Military External Affairs of the Korean People's Army on Friday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the Lee regime's misbehavior:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gangsters of the puppet military, yes men of traitor Lee Myung Bak, were reported recently to have held \"dialogue on defense strategy\" in neighboring country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the dialogue they talked nonsense that the constant tensions on the Korean Peninsula were attributable to the DPRK's \"military adventurism\" and resultant \"provocations\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have courageously stood against the DPRK-targeted reckless war maneuvers and adventurous and hideous provocations of the U.S. and the south Korean regime of rat-like Lee Myung Bak. They, however, termed these just countermeasures \"military adventurism\" and \"provocations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of their ignorance of the situation where peace and stability are preserved on the peninsula thanks to the DPRK's just counteractions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These military gangsters even claim that the DPRK was to blame for the \"cyber attack\" which drove the whole of south Korea into extreme uneasiness and fear and caused the \"paralysis of its tele-communication network\" and \"GPS disturbance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just like trumpeting that the north was to blame for the sinking of the south Korean warship \"Cheonan\" and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident which was sparked by the south Korean side's wrong doing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with crying at home, those hoodlums visited their American masters and others whom they considered more helpful. Their behavior cannot be construed otherwise than a foolish attempt to make a noisier trumpeting outside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This only brought to light once again the true colors of the Lee regime as lackeys steeped in sycophancy and submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Vociferating about confrontation with fellow countrymen after the \"dialogue on defense strategy\" was over, the Lee group floated such lie intended to mislead public opinion that the counterpart expressed \"understanding\" of what it asserted and \"positively responded\" to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is ridiculous is that the Lee group talked about \"a decisive self-defense action,\" forgetful of its pitiful plight as colonial stooges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that the Lee's regime is uttering such word as \"self-defense action\" as it requires an approval from the U.S. when it wants to use even a bullet or shell after being deprived of the operational control, a symbol of national dignity and sovereignty, by its U.S. master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We, availing ourselves of this opportunity, would like to state clearly as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a Korean saying \"a rabid dog makes a village unstable.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with bringing the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse, the group is making much fuss in a bid to turn the whole of Northeast Asia to theatres of confrontation and war as dictated by its master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why we had already declared at home and abroad that we would never deal with the Lee group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the nature of a rabid dog to bark more desperately and run amuck when it is backed by its master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rat-like Lee group is that of rabid dogs as they unhesitatingly sold off the destiny of the country and the nation to please the U.S. master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rabid dogs must be beaten to death instead of getting close to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever loves justice and hates injustice should heighten vigilance against all the sinister plots of the U.S. and its followers like the Lee group and bravely frustrate them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies a sure guarantee for defending genuine peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity."

            "content": "DPRK History Society Discloses Truth about \"Yusin\" Dictatorship\r\n Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The History Society of the DPRK released a memorandum Thursday disclosing the truth about May 16 military coup and the nature of fascist dictator Park Chung Hee who ruled south Korea for 18 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t Unraveling the truth about the May 16 military coup, the memorandum said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 16, 1961 an artillery battalion of the 6th army corps belonging to the field army command, the first air-borne unit and the marine brigade received an order to occupy Seoul. It was the prelude to the May 16 military coup which traitor Park Chung Hee, then deputy commander of the 2nd corps of the south Korean puppet army, pulled off with his clan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rebels occupied the army headquarters and seized \"National Assembly\" building, \"Capital Building\", city hall, public security bureau, Central Telegraphic Office and Pando Hotel which was temporary lodging of the \"prime minister\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only Seoul but Taegu, Pusan, Kwangju and other major cities went under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park occupied Broadcasting Station, set it as the headquarters and announced that he took over the control of administration, legislation and jurisdiction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He in the name of Army Chief of Staff Jang To Yong proclaimed \"martial law\" across south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proclamation of the \"martial law\" led to the arrest of all the ministers of the Jang Myon regime, dissolution of \"National Assembly\" and local \"national assemblies\", ban on activities of political parties and social organizations, assemblies, strikes and travel, enforcement of nighttime curfew, pre-check of media, press and broadcasting, freezing of finance and sealing of airports and harbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the coup, Park invoked evil laws to suppress political rivals and formed \"Democratic Republican Party\" in secrecy as part of his preparations to come to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 27 he became the \"presidential candidate\" from the \"Democratic Republican Party\" dominated by the coup forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On October 15 he became \"president\" in a fraud-tainted election amid terror-ridden atmosphere under the \"martial law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After seizing power, Park purged 70,000 dissidents and arrested even Jang To Yong whom he used for his purpose, charging him with hatching a plot against the coup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. was behind the May 16 military coup all the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea provided south Korean troops in areas under his control to Park to be used for the coup. But when the clan of the Army Chief of Staff made a report about the coup to him, he issued a secret order not to interfere in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dulles, the then director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, in his BBC appearance later confessed that the most successful overseas CIA operation during his office was the May 16 military coup.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the coup was not an unavoidable option but a planned one for the extortion of \"power\" by Park according to the U.S. scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On October 17, 1972 Park proclaimed \"martial law\" across south Korea, disbanded \"National Assembly\" and suspended all political activities with the mobilization of tanks and armored vehicles. He then drew up the \"Yusin Constitution\" which made him \"president\", chairman of the Cabinet meeting, chairman of the National Security Council and chairman of the National Council for driving force for unification. This granted him unlimited rights including the rights to control all power means, revise \"Constitution\", take national referendum, effect \"emergency measure\", proclaim martial law and disband the \"National Assembly\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also set up the \"lifelong presidential system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing how south Korea turned into barren land devoid of right politics, democracy, civil rights and unbiased media under the \"Yusin\" dictatorship, the memorandum continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For 18 years since Park took power, at least 14 million innocent people were arrested and persecuted, 700,000 to 800,000 on an annual basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole of south Korea turned into a big prison and theatre of rowdyism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park declared \"anti-communism\" as the No. 1 state policy. He pledged his support for American master, calling for \"building capabilities for coping with communism\". He said that he would not unify Korea if it endangers the U.S. interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a statement in June 1965, Park said his \"supreme task is unification by prevailing over communism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1970s Park regime reluctantly came out for north-south dialogues and signed the July 4 joint statement the keynote of which is the three principles of national reunification. But ink was barely dry on the statement before he began to violate it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park worked hard to make \"two Koreas\" at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June 1973 he released a \"special statement\", openly making public \"two Korea\" policy aimed at the permanent division of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park sent the then minister of Foreign Affairs to the UN, imploring it to recognize \"two Koreas\".  He submitted \"resolution on simultaneous entry of the south and north of Korea into the UN\" to the 28th UN General Assembly with the help of the U.S. and run the whole gamut of trickery to secure approval votes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When this came a cropper, the U.S. imperialists and Park regime made desperate efforts to ensure south Korea's separate entry into the UN at the 30th UN General Assembly in 1975.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime committed spying activities and armed provocation against the DPRK backed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From 1977 it built a concrete wall in the areas south of the Military Demarcation Line with the use of huge fund, labor and materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wall severed 122 villages, 8 counties, 3 railways and more than 220 big or small roads and rivers and streams between the north and the south, to say nothing of mountains and flatland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park reduced the south Korean economy into a colonial economy, lame economy totally dependent on foreign capital.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He massively introduced foreign capital under the spurious signboards of \"industrial modernization\" and \"economic development\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This allowed foreign capital to find its way to south Korea and plunder it unhindered with special privileges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foreign loans that were introduced to south Korea during Park's tenure of office reached 22.5 billion U.S. dollars while the direct foreign investment more than 1 billion U.S. dollars. They were used for squeezing the people to gain huge profits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The introduction of foreign capital made south Korea's foreign debts reach 25 billion U.S. dollars in late 1979, 227 times increase from 1960.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now south Korea faces huge deficits standing at 30 billion U.S. dollars in trade with Japan annually. This is attributable to its economy dependent on Japan which is blamed on Park who brought Japan's equipment and raw materials at random.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea which was known as one of the world's granary is now forced to import 70 percent of cereals from abroad, a result of Park's policy of relying on foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Big conglomerates became fat, resulting in deepened relations between the power and big businesses and wide-spread corruption and irregularities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gap between the rich and the poor became wider as never before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's pro-conglomerate and low-salary policy helped the big businesses and reactionary government officials, who accounted only for 0.3 percent of the total south Korean population, hold approximately 60 percent of the national income. Toiling masses making up the 70 percent of the population, however, held only 15 percent of the national income.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's 18-year long rule sends shivers down to the spines of the people, the memorandum said, stressing that the revival of \"Yusin\" dictatorship should never be allowed."

He covered 353,576 km for his long journeys of forced march till the last moments of his life.   This is brilliantly recorded in the history of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his journey for Songun leadership, he personally planted trees together with servicepersons and gave precious names such as \"unit of patriots\" and \"persimmon-tree company\" to those servicepersons who set examples in sprucing up the land of the country. This warm love shown by the peerlessly great man made the whole country pervade with patriotism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us live not merely for today but for tomorrow! This was his patriotic outlook on the life. This outlook was established throughout the country to kick off a drive for carving out happiness for all generations to come. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the patriotic slogan \"Let us spruce up our land and villages more beautifully!\" a patriotic movement was launched across the country to spruce up provinces, cities and counties as befitting socialism and the number of villages of patriots has increased day by day. In the last decade there sprang up modern dwelling houses for more than hundreds of thousands of families to sing songs expressing thanks to the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many famous mountains and scenic spots turned into people's pleasure grounds and witnesses of patriotism. Among them are unique mountaineering courses on Mt. Myohyang, the Ullim Falls and ponds to which people had no access and caverns which had been unknown to people for thousands of years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a popular song \"The General Goes to Front While Children to Camps\" singing of the warm love of Kim Jong Il. There appeared a lot of new university buildings including modern e-libraries and swimming pools and other talent-training centers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 233,800 paddy and non-paddy fields turned into 65,500 fields of standardized shapes and there appeared a new land covering more than 1,760 hectares in Kangwon Province in a matter of less than half a year. More than hundreds of thousands of hectares of land across the country have been realigned to befit the land of socialist Korea, a dramatic change. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national mobilization movement for improving the management of the land was waged as an all-people patriotic movement. As a result, recent years witnessed the planting of billions of trees and the building and improvement of roads extending tens of thousands of km and many rivers. From ancient times people said it was impossible to build any saltern on the east coast of Korea. But the Kwangmyongsong Saltern was built to be followed by Wonsan Saltern and Odaejin Youth Saltern on the east coast. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A total of more than 10,000 km-long gravity-fed waterways were built across the country. Among them are Kaechon-Thaesong Lake Waterway, Paekma-Cholsan Waterway and Miru Plain Waterway. There appeared the Nyongwon Power Station, the Ryesong River Youth Power Station No. 1 and other hydropower stations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Huichon Power Station is a great monumental structure in the era of Songun and the precious patriotic legacy bequeathed by Kim Jong Il to the country and its people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His words \"Korea does what it is determined to do\" instilled patriotism and intense loyalty into all service personnel and people of the country. As a result, a vast area of reclaimed tideland on the west coast turned into a large socialist farm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that satellites of the DPRK were put into space and sturgeons bred by experts of the DPRK went to the sea. Inspired by his words people in different parts of the country turned out in the drive to build modern stock farms including pig, chicken and fish farms on the basis of latest science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People's ideals came true wherever he visited. There sprang up modern cultural and entertainment facilities including Majon Hotel, Kalma Theatre and Art Theatre in Hwanghae Province, and Mansudae Street, Changjon Street, scenery of socialism Poman-ri and Hwangjin Hot-spring village, Amusement Park of Kaeson Youth Park and the Meet and Fish Shop in Pothongmun Street. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il's life was totally dedicated to the people as proven by his words that his career is characterized by the word people. He made sure that the People's Theatre was built for the people, saying that a theatre going by the word people should be successfully built to hand it to posterity. The people are moved to tears when recalling that this was his last legacy bequeathed to the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il paved the way for the rapid development of knowledge-based socialist economy on the basis of the eternal foundation he laid for the industrial revolution in the new century. His life was, indeed, the life of the peerlessly great man which moves every Korean to tears. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when the country was in the most difficult period, he decided to spend precious funds for putting the national economy on a CNC basis, foreseeing the future of a prosperous country. It was a bold decision and the best choice, a product of his patriotic will to let the country proudly rank among advanced countries of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the first CNC-based machine of Ryonha in April 1995 and visited many machine plants to boast Ryonha machines before the whole world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everywhere he went, he instilled great will to look out over the world with one's feet planted on one's own land and the spirit of self-reliance of the nation into the scientists and technicians calling upon them to turn out in the drive for pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology. He said that they should have the idea that one who remains a slave of technology is bound to be a traitor but if one masters technology, one becomes a patriot. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was in this unforgettable course that the DPRK's CNC technology led the world in it and kicked off the nationwide drive for pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology. This put great spurs to the industrial revolution in the new century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il pushed forward the industrial updating in all aspects and at the highest level, foreseeing the future. His ideas and policies have been implemented one by one in the crucible of the industrial revolution in the new century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made the DPRK emerge a nuclear weapons state, a satellite producer and launcher and demonstrated the national power before the whole world with his noble patriotic signpost to make it look up to the great party and Kim Il Sung's Korea as his faith. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His undying feats will always shine along with the history of the country."

Korean Regime Accused of Evading Blame for Terrorism\r\n Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Lee Myung Bak regime is claiming that the DPRK's assertion about its involvement in the recently attempted terrorism against the DPRK is groundless.  But truth about this is being brought to light with each passing day. \n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, Kim Song Min, representative of the \"Voice of Free North Korea \" appeared at a press conference as what he called \"witness\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He at the press conference let loose a spate of jargons as regards the time he met Jon Yong Chol only to play a tragicomedy admitting himself the fact that the attempted terrorism was carefully pushed forward under a scenario of the U.S. and its south Korean puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Su Bok who introduced Jon to Kim was found dead at his home.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This undeniably proves the hypocrisy of their claim. It is a hackneyed method employed by the U.S. and the south Korean regime to destroy evidence by killing those concerned with the case in secret.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even information available from south Korean media and conservative forces also gives the lie to the regime's claim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dong-A Ilbo on July 21 said that the \"society for demolition of statues\" has become a focus of public attention as far as the recently attempted terrorism is concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The society was formed with Kim Song Min as its head in October 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim is a defector from the north and representative of the \"Front for the Liberation of the North Korean People.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is known to have six branches according to areas of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese hooligans did not hide its existence on the basis of the conception that to let people know such society exists amounts to giving hope to north Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A defector from the north confessed that he worked out a plan to blow up a revolutionary site in the north, but he gave it up because of strict guard and the difficulty in smuggling explosives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chosun Ilbo on July 19 carried an article that there is an \"Amnok River Fellowship Society\" among anti-DPRK terrorist groups and the man surnamed Ma of the organization failed to carry out the operation to blow up a monument and statue in a revolutionary site in the north last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are many more cases proving the truth behind the terrorism attempted by the rat-like Lee regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime is now bitterly censured and condemned not only by the people of the DPRK but the world people for attempting such gruesome terrorism in wanton breach of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story spread by the Lee group that it has nothing to do with the attempted terrorism and the terrorism was attempted by non-governmental organizations in a bid to mislead public opinion is nothing but sleight of hand to escape such criticism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the group hide the above-said facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits particular attention are the remarks made by Yun Sang Hyon, legislator from the \"Saenuri Party\", who earned an ill-fame as a cur of the conservative group on February 13.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said statues and other \"idolization\" facilities in revolutionary sites in the north are being blown up one after another, adding he cited information available from the south Korean intelligence service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being a chatterbox, this lawmaker divulged even the abortive operations, thus disclosing gangsters' secret terrorist operations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means already at that time the Lee group opened to public that its terrorist operations were pushed forward under plans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a lot of evidence proving that the U.S. was behind the recent incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Yong Hwan, a renegade who was expelled from China recently, admitted, when interviewed by Kyunghyang Daily News on August 2, that the human scum and the anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations are funded by U.S. Congress.

The number of those families abducted to south Korea by such method in 2010 accounted for more than 40 percent of the abductees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Allurement and abduction operations are also prevalent under the signboard of \"exchange of separated families through a third country.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime brought \"separated families\" in south Korea to northern boarder areas to arrange the reunions with their kith and kin after finding them out through a secret channel. In this way the group abducts them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February this year, the south Korean \"Ministry of Unification\" revised the \"guidelines for increasing the funds for supporting exchange of separated families through a third country\" in a bid to drastically increase the funds for the above-said operation."

            "content": "AHC revela la trayectoria de dictadura de \"renovacion\"\r\nPyongyang, 10 de agosto (ACNC) -- La Asociacion de Historiadores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (AHC) hizo publico el dia 9 un memorandum para dar a conocer la verdad del Golpe de Estado del 16 de Mayo en el Sur de Corea y la trayectoria de 18 anos de la dictadura fascista de Park Chung Hee.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento revelo primero lo ocurrido realmente en el Golpe de Estado del 16 de Mayo ejecutado por Park Chung Hee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 16 de mayo de 1961, el batallon de artilleria, la unidad no.1 aerotransportada, la brigada de marina, etc., del Cuerpo No.6, adscrito a la entonces Comandancia del titere Ejercito Surcoreano en Campana, recibieron la orden de movilizacion para ocupar a Seul. Esto fue el preludio del golpe que dieron el traidor Park, quien era subcomandante del Cuerpo No.2 del ejercito titere, y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras conquistar el cuartel general de fuerzas terrestres, las tropas rebeldes tomaron simultaneamente el edificio de la Asamblea Nacional, el capitolio, la municipalidad, el buro de seguridad publica, la Oficina Central Telegrafica, el Hotel Pando que fue residencia provisional del \"primer ministro\" y otros establecimientos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCayeron tambien otras ciudades principales como Taegu, Pusan, Kwangju, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Park instalo la comandancia en la ocupada Estacion de Radio y publico que ha tomado totalmente el poder administrativo, el legislativo y el judicial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, decreto a nombre de Jang To Yong, jefe del Estado Mayor de las fuerzas terrestres, la \"ley marcial de emergencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la ley marcial, fueron tomadas muchas medidas, entre otras, el arresto a todos los consejeros de Estado del \"regimen\" de Jang Myon, la disolucion de la \"Asamblea Nacional\" y las \"asambleas\" locales, la prohibicion de las actividades de partidos politicos y entidades sociales, mitines, huelgas y viajes, el toque de queda en horas nocturnas, la censura de prensa e imprenta, la congelacion de fondos, el bloqueo de los aeropuertos y puertos, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInmediatamente despues del golpe de Estado, el traidor Park reprimio en virtud de leyes infames las actividades de sus rivales politicos, por una parte, y por la otra, impulso los preparativos para tomar el poder organizando en secreto el \"Partido Democratico Republicano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 27 de mayo, Park ha sido elegido candidato \"presidencial\" del citado Partido organizado principalmente con las figuras protagonicas del Golpe de Estado y el 15 de octubre, fue investido de \"presidente\" con fraudes e irregularidades y en medio del estado de emergencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego de su llegada al poder, Park elimino a 70 mil opositores y arresto hasta a Jang To Yong, a quien utilizaba para sus objetivos, culpandole de la conspiracion contra los golpistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Golpe de Estado del 16 de Mayo fue ideado y controlado por EE.UU. detras de las cortinas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl entonces comandante de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea entrego sin vacilacion alguna al traidor Park las fuerzas titeres surcoreanas bajo su mando para que diera el golpe y cuando recibio el parte del inicio del golpe, que le dieron los compinches de Jang To Yong, impartio a las tropas norteamericanas la orden secreta de que no intervinieran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDulles, director de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia de EE.UU. (en aquel entonces), confeso luego a BBC que \"el golpe de Estado del 16 de Mayo fue la operacion mas exitosa de la CIA en ultramar durante su mandato\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi, el golpe del 16 de mayo no fue opcion inevitable sino el robo del \"poder\" a plena luz del dia ejecutado por el traidor Park segun el guion que le trazo EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 17 de octubre de 1972, Park decreto en toda la extension surcoreana la \"ley marcial de emergencia\",  disolvio y suspendio toda forma de actividades politicas movilizando tanques y carros blindados. Y fabrico la \"Constitucion de renovacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de la \"Constitucion de renovacion\", el traidor se hizo \"presidente\", presidente del \"consejo de gabinete\", el \"consejo de seguridad nacional\" y del \"consejo nacional de las fuerzas encargadas de unificacion\". Ademas, tomo en su mano el poder ilimitado como el derecho de controlar todos los medios del poder, el de enmendar la \"constitucion\", el de convocar el referendum, el de tomar las \"medidas emergentes\", el de declarar la ley marcial, el de disolucion de la \"Asamblea Nacional\" y otros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, establecio el \"sistema de presidente vitalicio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl memoradum revelo tambien que bajo el regimen dictatorial de \"renovacion\", el Sur de Corea se convirtio en la tierra estancada en la politica, la democracia, los derechos del pueblo y la prensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 18 anos del regimen de Park, 700 mil - 800 mil habitantes inocentes fueron encarcelados y asesinados como promedio anual y el numero de tales victimas se totaliza en mas de 14 millones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl declaro el \"anticomunismo\" como \"primera politica estatal\". Hablando de \"adquirir la capacidad de enfrentarse al comunismo\", juro a su amo gringo que \"no unificaria el pais si eso afecta los intereses de EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su declaracion publicada en junio de 1965, chismeo que \"nuestra tarea apremiante es la unificacion basada en la victoria sobre el comunismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la decada de 1970, la banda de Park, que salio a desganas a la mesa de dialogo intercoreano, firmo la Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio fundamentada en los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria y comenzo a hacerla papel mojado aun antes de que se secara la tinta de su firma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, a instigacion del imperialismo norteamericano, actuo freneticamente para fabricar \"dos Coreas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn junio de 1973, publico la \"declaracion especial\" oficializando su politica de \"dos Coreas\" orientada a la division perpetua del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, envio al ministro de Relaciones Exteriores a la ONU para que solicitara el reconocimiento de \"dos Coreas\". En el 28o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU en 1973, presento con el apoyo de EE.UU. el \"proyecto de resolucion sobre el ingreso simultaneo del Sur y el Norte de Corea en la ONU\" y recurrio a todas las artimanas sucias para ganar los votos a favor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando fracaso el intento de aprobar ese proyecto, EE.UU. y la camarilla de Park presentaron el proyecto de ingreso solitario del Sur de Corea a la ONU e hicieron todo lo posible por validarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la incitacion de EE.UU., el traidor Park cometio brutales acciones hostiles a la RPDC como el espionaje y la provocacion armada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 1977, inicio en la zona surena de la linea de demarcacion militar la construccion de una muralla de hormigon armado malgastando enormes fondos, mano de obra y materiales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta muralla dividio 122 aldeas y 8 distritos y corto 3 lineas ferroviarias, mas de 220 carreteras anchas y estrechas y hasta los recursos fluviales que unian el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark convirtio la economia surcoreana en la dependiente, colonial y desequilibrada bajo el control del capital extranjero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el rotulo enganoso de \"modernizacion de industria\" y el \"desarrollo de economia\", introdujo en gran medida el capital extranjero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante el mandato del traidor Park, el emprestito extranjero y la inversion directa de extranjeros introducidos en el Sur de Corea sobrepasaron 22 mil 500 millones de US$ y mil millones de US$, respectivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, la deuda externa de la economia surcoreana crecio hasta finales de 1979 227 veces en comparacion de 1960 para ascender a 25 mil millones de US$.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Sur de Corea, famosa zona de produccion cerealista, se vio a obligado a importar del extranjero el 70 % de los cereales necesarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe enriquecieron cada vez mas los plutocratas, se estrecharon las relaciones entre estos  y el poder, asi como prosperaron los actos de corrupcion e irregularidades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la politica para la plutocracia y el bajo salario a los obreros, los plutocratas y burocratas reaccionarios, que representaban a mediados de la decada de 1970 un 0.3 % de la poblacion surcoreana, se apoderaron de casi 60 % de los ingresos nacionales y las masas trabajadoras, que ocupaban el 70 % de la poblacion, se quedaron con el 15 % apenas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mandato de 18 anos de Park fue el tiempo de pesadilla y no se puede permitir jamas el renacimiento de la dictadura de \"renovacion\"."
