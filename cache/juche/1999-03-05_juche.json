Accordingly, it is the most heinous treachery that cannot be pardoned in any case.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should show their will for national reconciliation and reunification by renouncing the \"National Security Law\" defining the fellow countrymen in the north as \"enemy\" and affirmatively responding to our proposal. \r\n\r\n"

Korean people's struggle for cancellation of \"fisheries accord\"\r\n  Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- The struggle of the South Korean people for the cancellation of the submissive \"fisheries accord\" the South Korean authorities signed with the Japanese reactionaries is an eruption of resentment at the rulers of the \"government for the people\" who sold off the territory and waters of the country to outsiders to gratify  their greed for power and luxury, says Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today. It continues:\r\n   It is entirely just for the people of all walks of life to have risen up in the struggle to defend the interests of the country and the nation and their vital rights.\r\n   The South Korean authorities pardoned Japan's crimes during her colonial rule over Korea, called Akihito, a mastermind of crimes, \"emperor\", flung the door open to the corrupt Japanese culture and even traded off Tok Islet,  and territorial waters, part of the Korean territory. Such treacheries can never be justified.\r\n  With the treacherous \"fisheries accord\" remaining in force,  it will only impose more unbearable misery and sufferings and death upon the South Korean people.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their pro-Japanese flunkeyist behaviour and cancel the treacherous \"fisheries accord\" without delay. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S., Japan hit for projected \"missile defense\" system\r\n Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the disarmament and peace institute of the DPRK released a statement denouncing the united states for pushing their plan to establish a \"missile defense\" system in real earnest, which poses another grave threat to world peace and security in northeast Asia.\r\n   Last December the U.S. and Japan agreed to a joint research into the development of the \"Theatre missile Defense\" system in the wake of the launch of an artificial satellite in the DPRK, the statement says.\r\n   It says they are now using the launch for the purpose of justifying their sinister strategic design.\r\n   It cites data saying that judging from the historic background against which the \"missile defense\" system was coined, the DPRK has nothing to do with the matter.\r\n   As a result of acute nuclear rivalry between the U.S. and former soviet union during the cold war development of interceptor missile with which one side tried to neutralize missile attack capabilities of the other side was high on the agenda.\r\n   The two sides, bowing to the growing pressure from the international community, signed the \"anti-ballistic missile treaty\" in 1972.\r\n   The U.s. design to get the upperhand in nuclear rivalry with the Soviet Union at any cost remained unchanged, though.\r\n   It entered a new stage of practice with  the then U.S. President, Reagan, setting forth a \"strategic defense initiative\" in 1983.\r\n   The \"initiative\" was pigeonholed following the dissipation of more than dlr. 9 billion in a matter of a few years. In this course the U.S. brought the cold war to the extreme.\r\n   In view of the U.S. strategic design which underlies the \"missile defense\" system it is not hard to guess that the \"missile threat from North Korea\" on the lips of the U.S. is an absurd pretext. \r\n   Even after the collapse of the Soviet Union and the end of the Cold War the U.S. ambition for world supremacy has been confronted with new challenges.\r\n   Russia, which still has significant nuclear missile attack capabilities, is reorienting itself from its early pro-western policy to a more autonomous foreign policy. \r\nMeanwhile another nuclear missile state, china, has grown to be a potential rival of the United States.\r\n   Under this situation, the U.S. had secretly stepped up research and development of \"missile defense\" system. In January 1991 it reduced the \"star wars\" project to a more practical scale and in 1993 officially changed the \"strategic defense initiative\" into an \"anti-ballistic missile system.\"\r\n   However, the U.S. could no longer allocate funds for such development of the system unless it was formally made a fait accompli.\r\n   The U.S. has had no more pretext to define China and Russia as enemies as it was left with no  option to squeeze tax from its people since the Cold War ended and it advocated \"strategic partnership\" with the two countries.\r\n   So, it needed a plea for justifying the U.S.-Japan joint research into the \"missile defense\" system in order to screw money out of Japan.\r\n   To this end they were compelled to single out \"enemy\" \"capable of posing missile threat\" to Japan and the U.S. among  the nations which were not their \"partners.\"\r\n   It was against this backdrop that \"missile threat by North Korea\" was advertised after DPRK's launch of artificial satellite for peaceful purposes was misinterpreted as \"missile launch.\" \r\n   The United States circulated \"data\" about possible strike of the DPRK's missiles against any part of Japan, so that Japan agreed to provide funds for missile defence system. \r\nAnd then the U.S. lost no time in claiming that the DPRK's missiles could reach the U.S. mainland and finally announced its project for the study and development of the \"National Missile Defence\" system.\r\n   Meanwhile, Japan received a promise from the U.S. to offer it modern missile technology and to agree to the formers miniaturization such as possession of its own reconnaissance satellites and mid-air refueling tankers and expansion of the operation sphere of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in exchange for Japan's offer of funds.\r\n   These days, the South Korean authorities join in the U.S.-Japan duet over \"missile threat from North Korea.\"\r\n   China and Russia have already expressed deep concern, sharply reacting to the \"missile defence\" system development project of the United States and Japan.\r\n   It is self-evident that if any of the two sides possessed of nuclear attack missiles has a \"shield,\" the other side will be inferior from the strategic point of view.\r\n   In order to avoid this inferiority, the other side will have to react at the risk of losses in economic development. \r\nThis will eventually trigger confrontation and a new arms race among big powers and will probably lead to the revival of the Cold War.\r\n   Any country weak in this arms race is bound to be a slave of other nations totally bereft of its position as a strong power.\r\n   It was for this strategic purpose that Japan, which benefited more than any others by the cold war, decided to contribute money to the development of the \"missile defence\" system.\r\n   Japan, too, does not wish to see any  other stronger power than itself in northeast Asia and, furthermore, in the Asia-pacific region.\r\n   This is the development which makes the DPRK to be more vigilant.\r\n   The grave situation prevailing in the areas surrounding the DPRK eloquently proves how justifiable and far-sighted the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on giving priority to military affairs is.\r\n   We will never remain an onlooker to the dangerous moves of the hostile forces for the establishment of the \"missile defence\" system and, in particular, the despicable act of slandering the DPRK's activities for the peaceful use of the space over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK, but counter it our own way. \r\n"
