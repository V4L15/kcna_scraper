Korean Vessel Slams into DPRK's Boat in East Sea of Korea, Damaging It\r\n Pyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- There occurred a grave provocation in the East Sea of Korea at a time when the south Korean authorities' anti-DPRK confrontational racket is casting a dark shadow over the efforts for mending the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t At around 01:25 on October 1 a south Korean vessel deliberately rammed into Turubong-3, a boat belonging to the Foreign Trade Administration Bureau of North Hamgyong Province when it was conducting fishing operation at location 39 °12´56゛north latitude and 131° 31´26゛east longitude, wounding five crewmen and damaging its body before taking to flight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bulwarks on the portside in the distance of about 20 m from the bow to the middle part of the boat were damaged and the deck of the portside was completely destroyed. The bow mast became bended and lots of lamps in the bow were crushed to pieces, the steel plate in the bow was dented and several structures were destroyed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time, the surrounding was very bright as the boat was in a standstill position to catch squid with 12 1kw lamps on. But the south Korean vessel deliberately slammed into the boat before taking to flight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Witnesses said that the hull of the south Korean vessel had its name \"HIGHNY\" and letter reading \"Jeju\" signifying port of registry was seen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The captain of Turubong-3 called the south Korean vessel over walkie-talkie to talk to its captain. The south Korean vessel replied that it would tell its captain and wait for him. But the vessel fled away towards 230°course at high speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was not only a crude violation of the compulsory requirements of the UN Maritime Law calling any ship which caused a clash in the open sea to help the other ship and an inhumanitarian act bereft of an iota of compatriotism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not pay lip-service to \"humanitarianism\" but strictly investigate the vessel and prime movers, make apology for the piracy and pay proper compensation for the damage done to our crewmen and boat."
