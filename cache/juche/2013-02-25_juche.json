This was the ulterior aim sought by Lee in bringing the inter-Korean relations to a collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group kicked off a frantic anti-DPRK campaign in collusion with outside forces, taking issue with its satellite launch for peaceful purposes and the third underground nuclear test. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past five years of nightmare teaches a bitter lesson that the nation should never allow such inhuman scum as the Lee group to come to power again and play with the destiny of Koreans and that such group of traitors should be eliminated to the end from the very  day of its emergence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans will chase the Lee group on the way of going to its graves and force it to pay for all its hideous crimes committed against the inter-Korean relations."
