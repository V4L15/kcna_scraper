Culture Sunday to mark the 15th anniversary of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's election as general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the WPK and first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, was present there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Attending the meeting were senior party, state and army officials including Kim Yong Nam, Choe Yong Rim and Choe Ryong Hae, officials of the party, armed forces and power bodies, social organzaions, ministries and national institutions, service personnel of the Korean People's Army and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces, officials in the fields of science, education, literature and the arts and media, labor innovators and working people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the participants observed a moment's silence in memory of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Ki Nam, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK, made a report.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter said that Kim Jong Il's election as general secretary of the WPK was an epochal political event in the development of the WPK and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il performed immortal feats before the party and the revolution, the country and the people with his outstanding idea and leadership, iron-willed courage and inexhaustible patriotic devotion while standing in the van of the WPK for half a century, he noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was the gifted thinker and theoretician who indicated the road to be followed by the WPK and the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He formulated the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung as Kimilsungism and proclaimed the program of modeling whole society on Kimilsungism, and thus successfully realized the historic cause of clearly indicating the guiding idea and supreme program of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the theory and leadership method in all fields including party, state and armed forces building and provided the encyclopedic guidelines with which the WPK could lead the revolution and construction to the correct road. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Kim Jong Il developed the Juche idea and the Songun idea on a new level to significantly increase attraction and vitality of Kimilsungism and enrich the treasure house of human thinking. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was a prominent statesman and a great leader who developed the WPK into an ever-victorious one and created a new history of building a thriving socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He took it as a lifelong task to strengthen the WPK into the party of the President and saw to it that Kimilsungism was applied to party building and its activities, while adhering to the principle of building the Juche-oriented party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il formulated the Songun politics as a leadership mode of the WPK and developed it into headquarters of Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the greatest exploit of Kim Jong Il to shine in the history of the WPK that he built it into a revolutionary party that established steadfast ideological and leadership system of the leader, a mother party that formed a harmonious whole with the popular masses and served them and an invincible party with iron-like disciplines and high fighting efficiency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leading the WPK, Kim Jong Il demonstrated the dignity and might of Kim Il Sung's Korea and laid a foundation for building a thriving socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He oriented the party work towards implementation of the Songun revolutionary line to bolster the national defense capacity in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He increased the party's role as a guide, ushering in golden days in building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t True to the behests of the President, Kim Jong Il formulated the Three Charters for National Reunification and provided the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 Declaration with his broad magnanimity, bringing about a turning point in the reunification movement that advances in the idea of By our nation itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Always preserving the independent stand and revolutionary principles, he steered the trend of the world policy to increase the external prestige of the WPK and the state, thereby making immortal contributions to accomplishing the cause of independence against imperialism and the cause of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His idea and cause of building the Juche-oriented party have successfully been carried forward by Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un opened up a new chapter in accomplishing the cause of perpetuating the memory of the leader to glorify Kim Jong Il's undying revolutionary life and exploits for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also made sure that Kim Jong Il is held in high esteem as permanent general secretary of the WPK to develop it into a glorious party of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his leadership, the WPK's prestige and might have remarkably increased and the people's support and trust in it have deepened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called on all the officials and party members and other working people to firmly establish a monolithic leadership system of Kim Jong Un in the party and society and closely rally behind him."
