            "content": "DPRK Permanent Mission to UN Issues Press Statement\r\nPyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Permanent Mission to the United Nations issued a press statement on Oct. 21. It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Permanent Mission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) to the United Nations issues this press statement with regard to the continuing forced adoption of the anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolutions\" of the UN Security Council, which do not carry legality, morality and impartiality at all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolutions\" adopted so far in the Security Council are all illegal criminal documents fabricated by arbitrariness of the United States encroaching upon the UN Charter and other recognized international laws.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is heart of the issue that the UN Security Council is continuing to fabricate those anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolutions\" under the pretext of its determination that DPRK's nuclear tests and satellites launches pose \"threats to international peace and security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If our nuclear tests and peaceful satellites launches pose threats to the international peace and security, then why has the UN Security Council never taken issue with the nuclear tests and satellites launches conducted by other countries?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the UN Security Council has any authority to prohibit nuclear tests and satellites launches whosoever conducted by them?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UN Security Council has the authority to prohibit nuclear tests and satellites launches whosoever conducted by them, here is the question raised again why the Security Council has never prohibited the nuclear tests and satellites launches of other countries until now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are already relevant international treaties pertaining to the nuclear tests and satellite development, and therefore sovereign states can strictly join in these treaties fully on a voluntary basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK requested the UN Secretariat to clarify legal basis of the anti-DPRK \"sanctions resolutions\" imposed by the UN Security Council, but the Secretariat has not answered yet to these questions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless these questions are addressed, none of the UN member states could accept or implement any of the \"sanctions resolutions\" of the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t UN member states should pay primary attention to the reason of why discussion on having fundamental reform of the UN system centered on power countries is not yet making any progress, although it came a long way of discussion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UN member states tolerate and blindly follow the acts of arbitrariness of power countries who are misusing the Security Council, the Council then will merely turn into a ground where the power countries go rampant and behave as an emperor more than ever before. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 17th Summit of Heads of State and Government of the Non-Aligned Movement held last September and in the G-77 Ministerial Meeting held on the margin of the 71st session of the UN General Assembly, there were adopted the Final Document and Declaration respectively opposing and rejecting both the UN Security Council \"sanctions resolutions\" and unilateral sanctions of the U.S. and western countries against the DPRK. This opposition and rejection is an answer and the voice of justice of the international community to the questions raised above."

At the 4th meeting of vice-foreign ministers of the U.S., Japan and south Korea the U.S. sought measures for boosting cooperation among them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a recent period, the U.S. staged a missile alert drill together with Japan and south Korean puppet forces in the waters off Hawaii for the first time in history. Most recently they held joint drill called \"naval interception operational drill\" in the open sea east of Jeju Island. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to deploy THAAD in south Korea are a product of its hegemonic scenario to hasten the formation of the triangular military alliance and thus build a missile shield in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Viktor Poznikhir, first vice general director of the General Operation Bureau of the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation, said that the purpose of THAAD deployment is to neutralize the two countries of Russia and China, adding that the \"U.S. decision is not to cope with the missile threat from the DPRK. The decision is aimed to seize military edge over Russia and China\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appearance of NATO of Asian version with the triangular military alliance involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea as a parent body has become a reality and now it is impossible to avert a new arms race and a new Cold War in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal wrecking global peace and stability as it is talking about \"extended deterrence\" under the watchword of \"preemptive nuclear attack.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is called upon to be vigilant mainly against the U.S. dangerous hegemonic scenario."

Park's desperate anti-DPRK burlesque will only precipitate her death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rule of traitors is bound to lead to destruction and crimes are bound to bring punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park can never redeem the thrice-cursed crimes she has committed before the nation during the tenure of her office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to tell the south Korean persons of culture and arts. If they are true persons of culture and arts, they should not follow the confrontational racket of Park who is more dead than alive, forsaken by the people, but immediately stop the provocative performance."

Las califica de documentos ilegales fabricados por el despotismo de EE.UU. en desprecio a la Carta de la ONU y las leyes internacionales reconocidas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa esencia del problema reside en que el Consejo de Seguridad describe la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos de la RPDC como \"amenaza a la paz internacional\" y a base de esto, inventa de manera continua las \"resoluciones de sancion\" sobre la RPDC, critica el comunicado y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Por que el Consejo de Seguridad no ha aplicado hasta la fecha la sancion sobre la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de satelite artificial de otros paises si estas cosas fueran amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Acaso tiene el Consejo de Seguridad alguna autoridad de prohibir la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de satelite artificial de algun pais?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la tiene, ?por que no ha podido prohibirlos hasta ahora?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con las actividades nucleares y el desarrollo de satelites, existen los acuerdos internacionales correspondientes, a que pueden afiliarse los Estados soberanos de manera voluntaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Secretariado de la ONU no puede dar todavia la respuesta a la demanda de la RPDC de que aclarara los fundamentos legales de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" sobre la RPDC del Consejo de Seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de que sean aclaradas tales dudas, los paises miembros de la ONU no podran aceptar ni ejecutar esas \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos paises miembros de la ONU deberan prestar atencion debida al motivo por el cual no se ha resuelto ni en lo minimo el problema de reformar radicalmente el sistema de la ONU centrado en las potencias que se debate desde hace mucho tiempo en los escenarios de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los paises miembros de la ONU toleran y siguen a ciegas los actos arbitrarios de las potencias que abusan del Consejo de Seguridad, estas se portaran mas como Zeus en este aparato de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento final, adoptado en la XVII Cumbre de los Paises No Alineados efectuada en septiembre pasado en Venezuela, y la declaracion de la reunion ministerial del G-77, efectuada durante el 71o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, expresaron el rechazo a las sanciones unilaterales de Estados Unidos y el Occidente contra la RPDC. Esto es la respuesta de la sociedad internacional sobre todas las dudas arriba planteadas y la voz de la justicia."

            "content": "CRPP condena alborotos intrigantes contra el partido de oposicion en el Sur de Correa\r\nPyongyang, 24 de octubre (ACNC) -- A la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC formulada en relacion con que la banda conservadora del Sur de Corea perpetra un vil terrorismo politico de acosar al opositor Partido Democratico Dobulo como las \"fuerzas pro-Norte\" vinculandolo obstinadamente con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria dio el dia 23 la respuesta siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, la banda conservadora surcoreana incluyendo el \"Partido Saenuri\" insiste en que un libro escrito por el ex ministro de Asuntos Exteriores y Comercio revela el hecho de que en noviembre de 2007 el gobierno de Roh Moo Hyun se abstuvo de los derechos en la votacion por aprobacion del \"proyecto de la resolucion de derechos humanos del Norte\" en la ONU de acuerdo con la \"opinion del Norte\". Y desarrolla los freneticos alborotos de \"tildar a los opositores de las fuerzas pro-Norte\" diciendo que el citado caso deviene un \"serio desorden de la disciplina nacional\" y tienen que revisar estrictamente la \"concepcion sobre el Norte\" de los relacionados de aquel tiempo y se necesita la investigacion fiscal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel tiempo, la parte surena no habia presentado a la parte Norte ninguna opinion relacionada con la supuesta \"resolucion de derechos humanos\", ni avisado su postura de \"abstencion de votar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"Partido Saenuri\" y otros conservadores surcoreanos tildan al partido opositor de las \"fuerzas pro-Norte\" insistiendo en que el ex \"gobierno\" de Roh Moo Hyun se \"confabulo\" con la RPDC, lo cual no pasa de ser otra conspiracion cobarde tendente a crear un ambiente favorable a su intento de retomar el Poder en las \"elecciones presidenciales\" del ano que viene y arreglar la crisis de gobernacion que se profundiza mas con el paso de los dias conduciendo en otro la flecha de la opinion publica concentrada en los actos ilicitos y corruptos de la traidora Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso volvio a demostrar claramente la naturaleza sucia del \"Partido Saenuri\" y otras fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas, colectivo anti-reunificacion que niega las declaraciones intercoreanas, y se ha evidenciado fehacientemente que el \"problema de derechos humanos del Norte\", de que hablan tanto EE.UU. y la banda de Park Geun-hye, parte solo de la intencion malsana de frenar el mejoramiento de relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y buscar la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda conservadora surcoreana recurre en la invariable \"teoria de colores\" y la campana de \"tildar a los opositores de las fuerzas pro-Norte\", lo cual constituye una tonteria de acelerar su destruccion."
