This is the stark reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, traitor Park tried to justify the moves to deploy THAAD with her clumsy act. This goes to clearly prove that she is a foxy woman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more detestable is that the puppet traitor is working hard to link the inside confusion and collapse in south Korea over the THAAD deployment with the DPRK. This is just a crafty trick to divert elsewhere the anger of the people, tide over the crisis and deploy THAAD in south Korea at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Park group of traitors keeps making steady efforts in their criminal racket to deploy THAAD while acting as a lackey of its U.S. master, despite strong denunciation and protest at home and abroad, it would bring about only the result of hastening its shameful end."
