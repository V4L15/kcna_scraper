The Koreans from all walks of life in South Korea and overseas  are waging a courageous mass struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces, the cancer-like existence obstructive to the peace and reunification of Korea, from South Korea and the dismantling of their military bases there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This struggle of the Korean nation for its independent reunification against the U.S. policy of cold war is commanding support from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither pretext nor ground for the u.s. imperialists to persistently pursue their anachronistic policy of strength now that the north and south of Korea are heading for reconciliation and cooperation after resuming the dialogue and this process is being supported by broad strata of peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should give up its policy censured by the Korean nation and the world peace-loving people and stop doing anything obstructive to the peace and reunification of Korea.   \r\n"
