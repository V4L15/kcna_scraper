This, however, proved futile. By nature, Japan's subservience to the U.S. is well known to the world.  The LDP ultra-right conservatives' much touted economic sanctions against the DPRK and \"human rights issue\" are prompted by their black-hearted intention to please the U.S. conservative hardliners and draw water to their mill, backed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-party talks are now deadlocked due to the obstructive moves of the U.S. conservative hardliners. The U.S. is imposing financial sanctions upon the DPRK on the one hand and working hard to build up international public opinion through its \"human rights\" racket on the other in a bid to pressurize and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservative forces are dancing to the tune of the U.S., their master, bent on its anti-DPRK campaign, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of folly for the Japanese reactionaries to seek to isolate and stifle the DPRK and dodge the liquidation of Japan's past through the economic sanctions and the \"human rights\" row. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves are nothing but a base attempt to scuttle the DPRK-Japan talks which began to go ahead with much effort and stoke the atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservatives of Japan had better bear in mind that the confrontation with the DPRK is by no means a simple game.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first song eulogizing President Kim Il Sung is the revolutionary paean \"Star of Korea\" written and composed by revolutionary poet Kim Hyok in Juche 17 (1928), the early days of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song reflects the unanimous will of the young revolutionaries of new generation and people to have   Kim Il Sung in his teens as the center of the unity and cohesion and the leader of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The song also mirrors the ardent reverence of the Korean people for the President brightly illuminating the road of the Korean revolution like the morning star in the dark sky over Korea and their will to invariably remain true to his leadership and to lead a happy life in liberated country.\r\n The Korean people created and handed down a lot of oral stories on President Kim Il Sung who stroke terror into the aggressors and instilled the confidence in victory in the minds of the people with his protean tactics and lofty virtues during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. The legends of Mt. Paektu, based on the oral stories, show how ardent the respect of the people for him was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The literature portraying the leader entered a new phase of development with the creation of the immortal revolutionary paean \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" and the long epic \"Mt. Paektu\" after national liberation as an occasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drama \"Thunder\" (1946) and feature film \"Flames Spreading over the Land\" (1977) are the first artistic works depicting the leader. They impressively show the great personality of the President, who is the peerless patriot, national hero and invincible and iron-willed commander.\r\n The first art works depicting the leader are his statue at Mangyongdae Revolutionary School (1948), the oil painting Torch of Pochonbo (1948) and the grand monumental edifice Monument to the Victorious Pochonbo Battle (1967). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal revolutionary paean \"Song of General Kim Jong Il\" is typical of works carrying the high praise and boundless reverence of the Korean people and world progressives for leader Kim Jong Il.     \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
