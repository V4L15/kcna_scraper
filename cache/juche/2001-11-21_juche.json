Only when the nation struggles in firm unity, can it reject foreign forces, defend its sovereignty and dignity and achieve independent reunification.     \r\n\r\n"

The statement strongly demanded a stop to suppressing them and their immediate release. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the joint declaration is a milestone for building a reunified country, the statement earnestly called on the 70 million fellow countrymen to vigorously turn out to reunify the country in the near future under the banner of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anecdotes about President Kim Il Sung \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- It happened in autumn, Juche 50 (1961) when President Kim Il Sung gave field guidance to the Chonsam Cooperative Farm in Anbyon county, Kangwon Province.\r\n While talking to farmers, the president pointed to a persimmon tree in front of the managerial board of the farm and asked them to guess how many persimmons it was laden with. When the chief accountant of the farm put them at about 500, he guessed that they might be about 800. As it was the time to harvest persimmons, the farmers picked all the persimmons from the tree after seeing the president off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They could count 800 persimmons except three unripe ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president's rare guessing took them by surprise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president posed for a photograph in his generalissimo uniform for the first time on April 22, Juche 81 (1992), complying with requests repeatedly made by officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that he would like to have a photo taken with a guard, he let the guard be relieved from his duty and stood with him under an apricot tree with flowers in full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials were deeply moved to see the president having a picture taken with the guard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened when the president was talking to the general secretary of a political party of an  European country. The general secretary carefully looked at a small pocket book placed before the president when several hours' talks were drawing to an end. listening to the president eloquently speaking about issues related to all fields, political, economic, military and cultural, even without a paper carrying the main purport of his speech, he asked the president what was recorded in the pocket book. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the president showed him the book with a smile, he could see only some words written after a triangular mark in the book.    \r\n\r\n"

Unbounded is the greed of the monopoly capital for maximum profits. This wild ambition is realized through overseas expansion. This is bound to be accompanied by aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever the imperialists face a crisis, they seek a way out of it in aggression and war. This was proved by the first and second world wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1929-1933 economic crisis, which swept the capitalist world, and a new economic crisis which began in 1937 were the principal cause of the outbreak of the second world war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are still seeking a way out of their political and economic crises in a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Class contradictions between the reactionary ruling class, which arrogates state power and means of production to itself, harshly cracks down on the people in their struggle for independence, and the people vigorously struggling against it are daily growing sharp in the capitalist countries. The current economic crisis that is sweeping the whole capitalist world is an unprecedentedly serious and catastrophic one as it involves fuel, raw material, financial and all other crises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature of the imperialists seeking a way out of crisis in a war will remain unchanged unless their social and economic foundation is rooted out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialism is aggressive in its nature. It is not imperialism that is not aggressive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be always aggression and war as long as imperialism exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a country increases its defense capability for self-defense and always keeps itself fully ready under this situation can it defend its revolutionary gains and protect the people's lives and properties from the imperialist aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries advocating independence and peace should give priority to military affairs and exert efforts to increase capability for self-defense and vigorously struggle in unity to smash the imperialists' moves for aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n"
