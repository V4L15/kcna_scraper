Lots of media and experts of the world are now worried that the resumption of the large-scale joint military exercises by the U.S. after the Winter Olympics would without doubt rattle the DPRK and chill the north-south ties that are showing positive sign, and would again push the regional situation to the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already clarified that we will resolutely counter any act of harassing peace and security on the Korean peninsula, and this is by no means any rhetorical threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However valuable the improvement of the north-south ties and the peaceful environment may be, the army and people of the DPRK will never remain an onlooker to the gangster-like acts aimed to encroach upon the security and interests of a sovereign state and to interfere in its internal affairs. The U.S. has to clearly understand this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the principled stand and unshakable will of the army and people of the DPRK to counter provocation by prompt counterstrike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK which has towered as a new strategic state will never flinch even an inch back from the path of defending independence and justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump group has to ponder over the catastrophic consequence to be entailed by its reckless saber-rattling, and make a responsible choice."

If the U.S. dares to ignite a war against the DPRK, there will be left no one to keep a written will and bury a coffin. This is the answer of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is left with little option."

Esto no es una amenaza retorica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe saber bien que aunque son muy valiosos el mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas y el ambiente pacifico, el ejercito y pueblo coreanos no estaran con brazos cruzados ante las acciones gangsteriles encaminadas a violar a plena luz del dia la seguridad y los intereses de un Estado soberano e intervenir en sus asuntos internos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResponder a la provocacion con el contraataque inmediato: esto es la posicion de principios y la voluntad inconmovible del ejercito y pueblo coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, emergida de repente como nuevo Estado estrategico, no dara ni un paso atras en el camino de defender la independencia y la justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos compinches de Trump tendran que tomar una opcion responsable reflexionando seriamente de las consecuencias catastroficas de sus acciones belicosas."
