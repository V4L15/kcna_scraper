Kumgang and its \"human rights issue\" and describing the north as their \"principal enemy,\" the spokesman accused his party heavyweights of opposing the \"June 15 Grand Seminar on National Reunification.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He termed Ri Hoe Chang's such act of blocking the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, indifferent to the country, the nation and the reunification, an unpardonable anti-national move as it challenges the desire and aspiration of the nation for reconciliation and unity and a despicable pro-U.S. flunkeyist and traitorous act of meekly following the U.S. hardline policy to stifle the DPRK in utter disregard of the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such traitors and stumbling blocks lying in the way of reunification as Ri Hoe Chang should be immediately eliminated today when there is a bright prospect of national reunification, the spokesman said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang should stop behaving indiscreetly, well aware of the will of the people for the independent reunification of the nation in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people will decisively smash the splittist moves of a handful of anti-reunification traitors such as Ri Hoe Chang and join hands with the compatriots in the north in the efforts to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country as early as possible and build a strong and prosperous nation on this land without fail.    \r\n\r\n"

National reunification can be achieved only through a vigorous struggle against outside forces and for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to protect national dignity and sovereignty and realize national reunification in conformity with the will and interests of the nation it is necessary to reject flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces and resolutely struggle against foreign forces' aggression and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole Korean nation should continue to make a dynamic advance for independent national reunification in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

The leftovers of the old era such as isolationist and conservative policy and high-handed and arbitrary practices can no longer go down with anyone in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to behave itself,  properly understanding the changed times and the aspiration and demand of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to say that the U.S. will stand more strongly protested and denounced and thoroughly isolated at home and abroad in the future if it continues behaving as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to draw a lesson from this and change its attitude.    \r\n\r\n"
