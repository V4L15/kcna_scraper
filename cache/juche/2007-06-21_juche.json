This is as ridiculous as insisting that a crow can be whiter for often washing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not without reason that the Japanese politicians are busy talking nonsense in a bid to falsify hard facts.

            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work Observed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today dedicates an article to the 10th anniversary of the publication of Kim Jong Il's famous work \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preserving Juche character and national character at present is an important matter decisive of the destiny and the future of the development of each country and nation, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any country and nation fail to maintain the firm Juche-oriented viewpoint in settling their issues, they will allow their destinies to be trifled with by big powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a nation or a country has a steadfast stand to settle matters related to its sovereignty and dignity its own way as intended by its people in conformity with its actual conditions, taking full responsibility for them, can it stand dignified, demonstrating the self-respect and honor as a sovereign and independent state even under the present complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity and cooperation based on independence and mutual respect should be achieved on the premise that each country maintains its independence. Only then can this kind of cooperation prove to be genuine one that can serve its people and can be helpful to promoting global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing itself on a correct view on the advantages of its nation, each country should firmly preserve and actively project them and fully embody what is Juche-oriented and national in all fabrics of state and social life including politics, economy and culture. This is the short cut to bolstering the national power and achieving the national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality of the DPRK proves that the Songun politics serves as politics perfectly ensuring national independence and a treasured sword for achieving national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It provides a firm guarantee for achieving the prosperity of the country and the nation its own way with its own view and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for preserving the Juche character and national character is to build a rich and powerful country its own way on the basis of its independent faith and view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics calls for regarding the work to bolster armed forces as the most principled one related to protecting the supreme interests of the state and the fundamental interests of the revolution and giving priority to military affairs as the most important state ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK where the Songun politics originated, the army has grown to be an invincible army and an independent and modern defence industry has been built, the whole country has turned into an impregnable fortress which no formidable enemy can ever invade thanks to the implementation of the policy for putting all people under arms and fortifying the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also thanks to the strong military power and invincible strategy and tactics, both results of the Songun politics, that the Workers' Party of Korea has held aloft the banner of independence even under the present complicated and tense situation and successfully carried on the revolution and construction its own way in line with the actual conditions of the country and the interests of the Korean revolution, guided by its own idea and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great history is like a precious treasure as it implants among the servicepersons and the people the pride and self-confidence that their leader and their country, their ideology and system are best and encourages them to turn out in the struggle to exalt the dignity and honor of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary history of the WPK, which was pioneered by President Kim Il Sung and has been successfully carried forward by Kim Jong Il, is the greatest treasure of the nation and the bottom line of the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism of Juche is the fruition of the historic struggle waged by the people of the DPRK to create and develop their own and a cradle for the Korean nation to enjoy its life and happiness for generations. A dignified and worthwhile life and a rosy future of the Korean nation are fully guaranteed as invincible Korean-style socialism stands unfettered by any political disturbances and economic difficulties.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So, it was called a \"country of mountain castles.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well proved by the fact that sites of over 350 castles have been discovered in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having a lot of high and steep mountains, Koguryo attached importance to mountain castles to suit its topographical conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mountain castles were divided into three kinds according to the topographical conditions--the mountain walls linking steep and high mountain peaks, ones built on flat mountain ridges and ones built between plain and mountainous areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the high and steep mountain walls were built along mountain ridges and cliffs, they were favorable for defence, and vice-versa for the attack. Such mountain castles, with rich water resources, could accommodate many people for a protracted war and the enemy could not watch the inside of the castles. Typical of them is the mountain walls on Mt. Taesong in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mountain castle has watchtowers, lofts on its corners, a secret gateway to surprise the enemy forces, fortified walls near wall gates, battlements, fortresses and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Millions of enemy forces were impotent to attack the densely built mountain castles of Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe castle relics of Koguryo tell about the ardent patriotism displayed by its courageous people in the battles for defending the country along with their prominent wisdom and talent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
