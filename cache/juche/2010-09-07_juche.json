In case a war breaks out there, it will quickly develop into a world thermonuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defusing the tension and ensuring peace on the peninsula are not only a regional problem but also the most important and responsible task to save the world from a nuclear war disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. shuns the conclusion of a peace treaty and seeks to bring down the DPRK by force of arms from the stand of strength to stifle the DPRK, the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. will fester and a war on the peninsula will be unavoidable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether a war is averted and peace is ensured on the peninsula or not entirely depends on the U.S. attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will be a beneficial option for the U.S. to defuse the danger of a war and make a bold decision to build a new peace-keeping regime on the peninsula."

            "content": "Minju Joson denuncia exportacion de armas de EE.UU. al Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 7 de septiembre (ATCC) -- Segun el \"informe anual de la ayuda militar\" publicado hace poco por el Departamento de Defensa de Estados Unidos, este pais suministra en grandes cantidades al Sur de Corea las armas y equipos militares de diversos tipos, en particular, en el ano pasado, vendio al segundo los armamentos sofisticados valorados en 462 millones de US$.\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho muestra el siniestro intento de EE.UU. de preparar a los titeres surcoreanos como fuerzas capaces de hacer la guerra independientemente, completar los preparativos de la segunda guerra coreana y fortalecer las relaciones de alianza militar EE.UU.-Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi subraya el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual difundido este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el que incita a los titeres surcoreanos a la confrontacion con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y destruye la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy, debido al aumento de la combatividad por EE.UU., el Sur de Corea se va convirtiendo en el foco de nueva guerra, la nuclear, y la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se acerca al borde de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi estalla una guerra en la Peninsula Coreana donde en su parte surena y su contorno estan ubicadas densamente las armas nucleares de EE.UU. y estan enmaranados los intereses de las potencias, ella se extendera facilmente a la guerra termonuclear de alcance global.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAliviar la tension y preservar la paz en la Peninsula Coreana no es un simple problema regional sino el asunto muy importante y responsable para salvar Asia y el resto del mundo de los desastres de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. sigue dando espaldas como ahora a la concertacion del convenio de paz y recurriendo a la campana hostil a la RPDC para atentarla por via militar, las relaciones bilaterales iran de mal en peor y sera inevitable la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe la actitud de EE.UU. deciden la prevencion o no de la guerra y la preservacion o no de la paz en dicha peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomar la valiente decision de eliminar el peligro de guerra y establecer el nuevo sistema que garantice la paz en la Peninsula Coreana sera una opcion conveniente tambien para EE.UU."
