It is regretful that the road has not been managed well, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Putting his finger on the faulty arrangement of the bases of Oriental arborvitae and Sabina Chinensis, he said it would be good to have gravel stones planted in various shapes around the trees. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the weeds grown in between pavement blocks in the compound of the funfair, he, with an irritated look, plucked them up one by one. He said in an excited tone that he has never thought that the funfair is under such a bad state and a proverb that the darkest place is under the candlestick fits the funfair. He scolded officials, saying why such things do not come in their sight and querying could the officials of the funfair work like this, had they had the attitude befitting master, affection for their work sites and conscience to serve the people. Plucking up weeds can be done easily with hands as it is different from updating facilities, he added.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the amusement facilities have been put into operation with the paint scraped off, he noted that the officials and care-takers of the funfair have below-zero spirit of serving the people. This is not just a business issue but an issue concerning ideological viewpoint, he said in a serious tone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at the fountain pool where he stressed the need to tidy up the place even though it may not go operational for this or that reason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials should draw a serious lesson from the tour of Mangyongdae Funfair, he said, adding that this occasion should be taken to issue a serious warning to the officials so that they can have proper spirit of serving the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for sprucing up the Mangyongdae Funfair as required by the Songun era. This process should be made an occasion of removing outdated ideological point of view from the heads of officials and ending their old work-style, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks for sprucing up the funfair. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave Choe Ryog Hae, director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, the task for sprucing up the funfair as required by the new century by dispatching strong construction forces of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officials of the relevant fields including the Pyongyang City Committee of the WPK, ministries and national institutions should fulfill their duties and responsibilities in sprucing up the funfair to implement the WPK's intention of serving people in practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae and Ma Won Chun, vice- department director of the WPK Central Committee."

It is said that the test would be the most complicated and largest-ever military element test. To be involved in this test are Patriot, Aegis and other interceptor missile complexes of various types and mobile radars.\n\t\t\t\t\t This suggests that the U.S. moves to establish MD reached a new grave phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. asserts the MD is targeted against the DPRK and Iran, saying that these countries are pushing ahead with a plan for developing inter-continental missiles capable of reaching even to the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is no more than an excuse for the U.S. to insist that MD is aimed at coping with their missile attacks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to build a missile shield are designed to put the world within the range of its missile attack and strike other countries as it pleases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. MD makes clearer the structure of pressurizing the Eurasian Continent from both the east and the west.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seeks to plug into its MD the member states of NATO in Europe, Japan and Australia in Asia-Pacific, Israel in the Mideast, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The keynote of the U.S. strategy for world supremacy since the demise of the Cold War era is to prevent the emergence of the forces that may challenge it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the view of the U.S. that there are powers on the Eurasian Continent likely to challenge it and their potentials are growing stronger more rapidly than expected in recent years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With this situation in view, the U.S. seeks to steadily expand and round off the MD in a bid to disable other powers' capability of nuclear retaliation and make its military edge unchallenged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also its calculation that this is also good for plugging them into an arms race and making their strength exhausted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the facts that the U.S. spent a huge amount of money for MD every year and is contemplating drawing more countries into MD under the pretexts of \"joint defense\" and \"joint research\" and is planning to conduct a test for intercepting three medium- and short-range ballistic missiles and two cruise missiles simultaneously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves for unchallenged MD are fraught with the potential danger of escalating international tensions and sparking off an arms race among countries and thereby starting a new Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal wrecking global peace and stability and sparking off an arms race."
