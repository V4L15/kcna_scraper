He said the solid foundation of the powerful self-reliant industries enables the Koreans to manufacture any modern machine at will and that this is a clear demonstration of the validity and great vitality of the Worker's Party of Korea's line of building an independent national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the June 1 Youth General Electric Appliances Plant, he went round production processes, highly praising the workers of the plant for having produced electric appliances in time needed for different domains during the \"arduous march\" and the forced march and greatly contributed to making the national economy Juche-oriented, modern and scientific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to the Hamhung disabled soldiers' plastic daily necessities plant and the Hamhung Songchongang Garment Factory. At the plant, he showed warm loving care and favors for the disabled soldiers, saying that they are valuable treasures of the nation as they fought for the motherland and the people at the cost of blood and, therefore, they should be given best conditions for work, rest and life. He met with disabled soldiers and their wives, had a pep-talk with them and posed for a picture with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At Songchongang Power Station no. 22, he looked round the inside, saying that when officials use their brains and organise the work well, they can tap a lot of potentials for electricity anywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also visited the Sinhung fish farm and the Sinhung pleasure ground. He noted with great satisfaction that the county had done good things for the sake of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After that, he gave important tasks to further develop the industries in the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He highly praised the party members and other working people in the province for having done a lot of things in all domains including the normalization of production and the building of power stations by speeding up the grand march to build a powerful nation after their successful completion of the \"arduous march\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Great changes are taking place in every part of the province, resulting in miracles and innovations every day, he noted, adding that this is an expression of the indomitable will of the heroic Korean people who have withstood all trials of history and won victory after victory and a proud demonstration of the inexhaustible strength of the wholeheartedly united Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said further development of the industries in the province is of great importance in developing the national economy as a whole because the province has extracting, power, chemical and many other key industries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He advanced concrete tasks to further develop the chemical and power industries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  He urged the province to supply lots of delicious and nutritious fresh-water fishes to the people through extensive fish culture because the province has many areas with favorable conditions for fish culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also called for building more pleasure grounds on the scenic seaside and mountains so that the working people can fully enjoy themselves and take a rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe was accompanied by chief secretary of the south Hamgyong provincial committee of the Worker's Party of Korea Ri Thae Nam, chairman of the south Hamgyong provincial people's committee Kim Phung Gi, secretaries Jong Pyong Ho and Kim Kuk Thae and first vice department directors Pak Song Bong, Jang Song Thaek and Choe Chun Hwang of the WPK Central Committee. \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the revolutionary theory of the working class on perpetuating the memory of the leader has been consummated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His steadfast will to faithfully carry forward the revolutionary idea of the President without the slightest deviation is fully reflected in his strong resolution that no change should be expected from him and in his works  including \"on preserving the Juche character and national character of the revolution and construction.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also set forth the army-first revolutionary idea which can confidently guarantee the building of a powerful nation and the idea of revitalizing the socialist economy, the idea of running at a canter on steed and many other ideas and policies based on an analysis of the realistic requirements of the developing Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His ideological and theoretical activities are based on the noble mission to lead the destiny of humankind, the destiny of the overall socialist cause in a responsible manner. He clearly indicated the way of rebirth of the socialist movement and its final victory in many works including \"socialism is a science.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He could perform the great ideological and theoretical feats which will shine forever with the century over the past five years through his extraordinary ideological and theoretical activities as he has clairvoyant philosophical wisdom, superhuman extraordinary passion, a history of prolonged revolutionary activities and exceptionally rich experience of revolutionary leadership as the thinker and theoretician whom no one can match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the faith and courage of the Korean people that there are nothing to fear and no insurmountable obstacles before them as they are guided by his outstanding ideas and theories, despite manifold trials. \r\n\r\n"
