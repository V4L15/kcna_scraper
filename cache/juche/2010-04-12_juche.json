He expressed great satisfaction with the successful construction of the modern library which meets the need of the age of knowledge-based economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that all structures of the wonderfully-built library are associated with the warm patriotic devotion of soldier-builders, he highly appreciated the feats performed by the servicepersons of the unit who have always played a vanguard role in the socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the happy students absorbed in scientific inquiry, fully enjoying the benefits of the advantageous socialist educational system at the library, he was very pleased with the fact that it has become possible to hand over to posterity an edifice of eternal value which may remain impeccable even in the distant future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to always pay deep attention to the study and life of the students intensely loyal to the Party and the revolution as they are treasures of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that in order to build more structures in the era of Songun as required by the aesthetic desire and need of the Korean people it is necessary to actively explore and apply new, unique and peculiar architectural style and steadily bring about innovations in the formative art of the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After going round the Educational and Scientific Exhibition of the university, he highly appreciated the shining feats performed by the university. He said that the university has trained a lot of revolutionary talents for the last more than six decades, thus playing a pivotal role in implementing the nation's policy of training native cadres and its policy of intellectualizing all members of the society. The university has rendered great services for the development of the nation's science and technology by actively conducting scientific researches, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met the teachers and researchers who have performed distinguished feats in the education and scientific researches at the university and gave a warm pep-talk to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched a swimming contest of students under way at the indoor swimming pool before commanding a bird's-eye view of the university town covering a vast area of Ryongnam Hill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the school buildings, dormitories, libraries, indoor stadium and various other facilities for education and upbringing standing in good order around Ryongnam Hill, he said that it is the high pride of the WPK and people of the DPRK to have prestigious Kim Il Sung University, the highest seat of Juche-based education. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the university is a precious treasure for national prosperity to be handed down to the generations to come, he set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for developing the university.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Kyong Hui, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Yong Il and Kim Yang Gon, department directors of the C.C., the WPK, and its other senior officials."

But, it was exactly at that time that the mass-production of Juche iron and fiber of our own invention was kicked off in the DPRK. In future its people will witness the successful operation of light water reactors built entirely with locally available raw materials and indigenous technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the fruition of the full display of the inexhaustible mental power by the army and people of the DPRK single-mindedly united around the leader. This will be a clear message to the hostile forces keen to tighten the sanctions against the DPRK and escalate their moves to isolate and stifle it and a striking demonstration of the solidity and invincibility of its Juche-based socialist system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK form a community with the headquarters of the revolution in which they share the same destiny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces are making much fuss, ballyhooing about instable society of the DPRK. This charade, however, only renders its army and people more keenly aware of who is their enemy and what it seeks. It, at the same time, helps demonstrate the unbreakable single-minded unity of the headquarters and them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks to disturb the mindset of people and tear the army and people off the headquarters of the revolution, threatening their right to existence through unprecedentedly harsh sanctions, but this will get it nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rash acts of the U.S. and its followers only bring their ulterior motives into daylight. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mainichi Shimbun commented on the fact that the remarks made by the commander of the U.S. marines in the Pacific that north Korea is the main operational theatre of the U.S. marines in Okinawa disclosed the U.S. intention to contain the influence of China. There is some sense in saying so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the long-pursued Korean strategy of the U.S. to turn the whole of the Korean Peninsula into a strategic springboard from which to establish domination over the Asian continent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After fleeing to the south from the northern half of Korea during the last Korean war the U.S. forces prattled they would come back when azaleas come into bloom. The U.S. regards the present time as a golden chance to realize its wild ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. staged such reckless war exercises as Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises as a challenge to the efforts of the parties concerned to push ahead with the process for peace and the denuclearization of the peninsula. It is by no means fortuitous that it is taking a bellicose attitude towards the DPRK, declaring for the first time that the DPRK is the operational theatre of the U.S. marines in Okinawa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. talk about \"contingency\" means a call for stifling the DPRK, a scenario for the second Korean war and a theory for unchallenged domination over the peninsula and the rest of Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. and its followers including confabs on a war scenario, military exercises, economic sanctions, psychological warfare, etc. and the general orientation of the U.S. Korea policy are all designed to achieve \"unification of systems on the Korean Peninsula\" through the creation of \"contingency\" in the DPRK. It will never remain an onlooker to this grave situation but will steadily bolster up its war deterrent for self-defence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a war breaks out in Korea, the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces can never dodge the merciless and just strikes of the Korean People's Army, be they in Okinawa or in any other place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK warns the U.S. and other hostile forces busy talking about the fictitious \"contingency\" not to run amuck.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that the trumpeting about \"contingency\" is bound to go bust just as all the propagandas about \"crises in north Korea\" made by the enemies for years proved to be false.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will be proved by a great event--the victory to be won in the drive for building a thriving nation thanks to the Juche idea and Songun idea, the truth of the DPRK."

Immeasurable is the economic loss the north suffered for nearly two years due to the suspension of the tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is darn ridiculous for the south Korean authorities to make outcries over the so-called \"violation of agreement\" though they are to blame for it. According to international practice, when any economic agreement or contract is left unimplemented for a certain period, it is bound to lose its validity. Every country of the world severely punishes those who violate its law. The action to be taken by the north is in line with the universally accepted order and practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The lesson the Korean nation came to draw once again from the present situation where the tour is on the verge of collapse is that it is impossible to improve the north-south relations, achieve the reunification of the country and the common prosperity of the nation nor is it possible to properly conduct tour as long as the conservative group of south Korea veiled with \"pragmatism\" is allowed to stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By blocking the tour of Mt.

Tiene razon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde hace mucho tiempo, EE.UU. ha venido persiguiendo la estrategia sobre Corea consistente en convertir toda la Peninsula Coreana en la base estrategica para establecer su dominio sobre el continente asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante la pasada guerra coreana, al verse obligadas a retirarse, las tropas norteamericanas juraban que volverian a avanzar hacia la RPDC en la proxima primavera. EE.UU. piensa que ahora es la oportunidad para cumplir ese juramento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No es casual que EE.UU. haya desplegado los imprudentes ejercicios belicos como \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\" en desafio a los esfuerzos de las partes interesadas por impulsar el proceso de paz y desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y anunciado por primera vez que la RPDC es el teatro operacional de sus infantes de marina acampados en Okinawa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como se ve, la teoria de la \"situacion de emergencia\" de EE.UU. no es otra sino la doctrina para atropellar a la RPDC, desatar la segunda guerra coreana e implantar el dominio monopolico sobre la Peninsula Coreana y el resto de Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todas las campanas anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles como el debate de los planes de guerra, ejercicios militares, sancion economica, guerra psicologica y la meta general de su politica sobre la RPDC estan orientadas al \"derrocamiento del regimen\" y la \"reunificacion de sistemas sociales en la Peninsula Coreana\" mediante la creacion de la \"situacion de emergencia\" en la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC no se mostrara indiferente ante esta situacion grave y seguira fortaleciendo su disuasivo de guerra para la autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t De desatarse la guerra en este territorio, las tropas agresoras norteamericanas no podran esquivar el implacable golpe de justicia del Ejercito Popular de Corea, esten en Okinawa o esten en otras partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La RPDC advierte a EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles que actuen con prudencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como historicamente resultaron erradas todas las teorias de los enemigos sobre la supuesta \"crisis de la RPDC\", el rumor de la \"situacion de emergencia\" tambien sera condenado al fracaso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo dira el gran evento, o sea, el triunfo de la causa de construccion de la gran potencia prospera que van trayendo el Juche y el Songun, verdad de la RPDC."
