It is self-evident where the troop dispatch would lead under this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe south Korean authorities and political circles, responding to the demand of the whole nation, should promptly abandon the planned troop dispatch to Iraq which would invite unpredictable sacrifices and worldwide denunciation and should retract the decision on troop dispatch itself  The election to the 17th \"National Assembly\" in south Korea clearly showed what doom awaited the traitors estranged from public sentiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time the south Korean authorities and political parties made a right option, squarely facing up to the trend of the times and public feelings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
