This is evidenced by the Balkan war, the Afghan war and the Iraqi war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said wars ignited by the U.S. imperialists under the plea of \"the guarantee of freedom and democracy\" and \"anti-terrorism\" brought nothing but indiscriminate destruction and horrible genocide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has described all this as actions for \"freedom and democracy\". Lurking behind this is a sinister intention of the U.S. to justify its human rights abuses and escalate its acts of aggression against the independent countries in the future. \r\n Drawing attention to the barbarous abuses of the prisoners in the U.S. navy base in Guantanamo, the commentary describes this as a typical example of the most cruel treatment and torture perpetrated by the U.S. against human beings, while styling itself a \"protector of human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has resorted to all manner of evil deeds against Cuban patriots since it illegally put them into custody. Moreover, it has protected the ill-famed international terrorist Posada Carriles and projected him as an \"anti-terror champion.\" This behavior of the U.S. clearly shows how nonsensical and hypocritical its much publicized \"defence of human rights\" and \"anti-terrorism\" are. If the U.S truly stands against terrorism, it should not only handle the case of Carriles as required by international law but extradite him to Cuba to be judged by its people as demanded by the Cuban government. But the U.S. has defiantly protected him. The U.S. touted \"anti-terrorism\" and \"protection of human rights\" are nothing but outcries for aggression and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is becoming increasingly vigilant against the U.S. talk about \"anti-terrorism\" and \"protection of human rights\". A resolute struggle against the U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\" and human rights abuses alone can guarantee sovereign rights and human rights.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Aso's Assertion for Settlement of \"Abduction Issue\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Before and after the recent DPRK-Japan talks in Beijing, the Japanese authorities insisted that the \"abduction issue\" is a core issue to be settled at the talks. \r\n Japanese Foreign Minister Taro Aso has been most vociferous in this regard.\r\n He asserted at the session of the House of Representatives that there would be no normalization of bilateral relations without a solution to the \"abduction issue\". He went the lengths of saying that it was quite wrong to think that such action as infiltrating into other country to take its people as hostage could work on anyone and that such deed is a mockery of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, why has Aso been so keen on the issue of whereabouts of a few Japanese only out of major agenda items at the talks and why is he so vociferous about the \"abduction issue\" which had already found a solution? Is he behaving so because he is more concerned for \"people's sentiment\" than any others or because he is foreign minister of Japan? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To explain the reason, we can not but tell the behind-the-scene story about Aso and his clan. \r\n Aso is a descendent of one of the blood-suckers as they took away many Koreans to Japan to force slave labor upon them and accumulated wealth at the cost of their sweat and blood in the last centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asos' history has been woven with monstrous crimes. Aso's great-great-grandfather set up Aso Coal Mine Co. in 1872, forcing Koreans to do medieval slave labor for many generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to data, many Korean workers were forcibly taken to the coal mines run by Aso's great grandfather early in the 1930s to toil and moil there. The number of those workers ran up to 1.12 million after 1939. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are graves of hundreds of unknown Korean workers at a Buddhist temple around the Tsikuo coal field abandoned by the Asos in the 1960s.\r\n This makes one easily guess how many Korean workers the Asos drove to death, taking the company as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts go to prove that the Asos are directly responsible for the issue of slave labor forced on Koreans and not a small share of responsibility for Japan's compensation for its past crimes rests with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Aso has uttered no word about the large-scale forcible drafting and abduction and the forced slave labor perpetrated by his ancestors and about the settlement of those crimes, but is persistently insisting on the solution to the issue which had already been solved. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\r\n Had the above-said case happened in Western Europe, such family would have already been ostracized socially. But, in Japan, a descendent of the criminal family was allowed to take the office of foreign minister speaking for the government. How can this country properly approach the issue of settlement of its past? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The forced labor Japan perpetrated against the Korean people was a horrendous human rights abuse and a hideous war crime as it put the slave labor in the medieval ages into the shade in view of the exploiting manner, ferocity and barbarity.\r\n Nevertheless, Japan has refused even to admit the crimes, while paying no compensation for the forced labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aso has zealously supported this stand of the government prompted by his black-hearted intention to conceal forever the heinous crimes committed by his clan against humanity as well as Japan's crimes against the Korean people.\r\n That is why he is busy as an active supporter of the \"Society for History Textbook Reform\", an ultra-right organization which embellishes the history of aggression committed by the Japanese imperialists against Korea and other parts of Asia in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's past crimes related to the forced labor imposed upon Koreans can never be justified nor concealed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Aso should do to settle this issue is quite clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As foreign minister and a descendent of the criminal family, he should take the lead in settling Japan's past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu explorer\".\r\n Ri has explored Mt. Paektu 37 times for the last 25 years and made a number of photo albums and video tapes related to the exploration results.\r\n Many photos of grandeur and curious peaks, renowned rocks, animals, plants and wonderful natural phenomena of Mt. Paektu taken by him were widely introduced through mass media including Rodong Sinmun. \r\n He and his exploration team have observed the mountain without letup defying severe natural gales. In this course they found out animals' movements in and around the Lake Chon of the mountain which had been talked about only as a rumor. One day they saw a two-meter long bear weighing 500 kg swimming across 2.5 km section of the lake from the foot of Piru Peak to the place between Chongsok and Paekun Peaks and thus proved that big animals inhabit the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He discovered new materials. Among them are tens of Mt. Paektu and Rimyongsu waterfalls, distribution, the number of sorts and ecological features of the plants on the shore of the Lake Chon and materials of rare plants growing in the area of Jong Il Peak.\r\n He went round tens of valleys in Mt. Paektu to survey and confirm in detail the sizes, shapes, areas and heights of many peaks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hyangdo and Ssangmujigae Peaks and Pom, Korae, Chongdae and Roket Rocks and so on which were named in reflection of earnest desire of the servicepersons and people of the country are associated with his such efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also Korean map-shaped pumice layer, yellow and white pumice layer, gemlike fountain, ice cave, Chongunbawi of Mt. Paektu which consists of some 1,000 rocks and other curious natural phenomena are also associated with meditation and tireless efforts exerted by Ri.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
