Obama's strategy has faced three challenges called \"imbalance of resources\", \"imbalance of energy\" and \"imbalance of power,\" they added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hegemonic position is sinking in different parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian magazine Expert said that the U.S. military edge will be contained and disappear in the end due to the regional conflict in which this country is locked, adding that the U.S. is being restricted in the sphere of its action where he employed all possible means such as alliance, division, estrangement and engagement over geo-political issues. The U.S. obviously lack of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is at its wits' end over the civil war sweeping Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the issue of Afghanistan, the U.S. is also finding itself in a quagmire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is in a weak position in the all-out confrontation with Russia over the issue of Ukraine.

Efforts are being made in different parts of the world to introduce single currency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This trend of multi-polarization in the financial field would destroy the U.S.-led international economic system affected by pressure and arbitrary practices and lead to the establishment of a new order based on justice, equality and democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days when the U.S. swayed over the world economy by brandishing dollars and the dollar empire is sure to collapse any time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is on the verge of ruin due to the fin de siecle lifestyle in the material life as well as mental and cultural life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. capitalists are widely spreading reactionary ideology and culture and corrupt bourgeois lifestyle to benumb the independent awareness of the toiling masses and make them slave of money subservient to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is systematically training criminals at \"gangsters university\" and \"pickpockets school\" unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All kinds of crimes like gun-related crimes and drug crimes are everyday occurrences among Americans who are corrupt in their mental and cultural life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gun-related crimes have become an incurable disease. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Drug-related crimes have become another headache in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The education in the U.S. is all the more deplorable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-Wall Street demonstration that took place in 2011 is the largest-ever anti-capitalist struggle in the U.S. history, an inevitable product of the extremely acute social and class contradictions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the collapse of \"American empire\" is becoming a reality."

Ningun pais podra dominar esta region\" (de acuerdo con el reporte de ITAR-TASS en enero de 2010).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste disparate provoco gran repudio y rechazo de los paises regionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la nueva estrategia norteamericana, las fuentes extranjeras informaron que el proyecto estrategico de Obama y el proceso de su ejecucion causan discrepancias no solo en el Congreso sino tambien en el interior del Partido Democratico. En sentido general, la estrategia de Obama tropieza con tres desafios: el desequilibrio de recursos naturales, el de fuerza mental y el de dinamica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor todas partes del mundo se debilita la posicion hegemonica de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa revista rusa Expert transmitio que \"La superioridad militar de EE.UU. sera cohibida por los conflictos regionales en que se involucra este pais y desaparecera finalmente\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgrego que \"se restringen los espacios de accion en que EE.UU. utilizaba a sus caprichos la alianza, la division, la discordia, la atraccion y otros medios en el trato de los problemas geopoliticos. Evidentemente, le hace falta la fuerza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. se mantiene inactivo ante la guerra civil que azota a Iraq y se encuentra en dilema en el problema afgano. En el enfrentamiento frontal con Rusia en el problema de Ucrania, EE.UU. se encuentra en desventajas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque esgrimio el garrote de sancion contra Rusia que muestra actitud intransigente de no conceder su interes nacional, China y la India se opusieron a las medidas de sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al ambiente antiyanqui que se extiende rapido, EE.UU. es golpeado, aislado y rechazado en todas partes del mundo.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. perdio hasta la confianza de los paises aliados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos demuestran claramente que el imperio yanqui esta pagando en el ambito mundial por las guerras desatadas por si mismo y sus actos de intervencion y se queda nominalmente su posicion de \"superpotencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde hace mucho tiempo, EE.UU. ha tomado el arma nuclear y el dolar como dos pilares para realizar su ambicion dominar el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero la economia estadounidense, que se basa en el dolar, necesita fuertes medidas de socorro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa crisis financiera, que comenzo a azotar EE.UU. desde 2008, devino el factor que acelera la bancarrota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"El callejon no.1\" sin salida es la \"direccion\" de la economia estadounidense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a tal situacion economica, la organizacion internacional de estimacion de credito bajo el nivel de credito estatal de EE.UU. por primera vez en los 70 anos despues de su fundacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos medios extranjeros advirtieron que eso deviene golpe al \"corazon\" de la economia norteamericana y esta caera en la \"segunda decadencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgregaron que ahora es para EE.UU. el tiempo de reflexionar sobre su modo de pensar y acciones de corte hegemonico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero ya se hizo tarde y la economia estadounidense esta vagabundeando como barco sin velas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa deuda estatal y el deficit presupuestario llegan al estado irreparable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la crisis financiera, el gobierno norteamericano sufre desde 2013 muchos casos traumatizados como barrera financiera, recorte de gastos automaticos de gobierno federal, cierre de las oficinas del gobierno y el impago de deudas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tales circunstancias, se debilita bruscamente la posicion del dolar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el siglo XX, el dolar norteamericano perdio su valor al acoger la tercera crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, esta en colapso el actual sistema financiero internacional que tiene el dolar como moneda de base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRusia se esfuerza mucho por expandir la zona del rublo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ano pasado, quedo firmado un convenio sobre el intercambio de divisas entre el Banco Popular de China y el Banco Central Europeo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras declarar la suspension de las transacciones de petroleo por US$ para hacer frente a la tenaz sancion financiera de EE.UU., el gobierno irani cobra desde 2012 algunas sumas provenientes de la exportacion de petroleo en monedas de los paises importadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, BRICS trabaja intensamente para cumplir su consigna de construir un mundo mas igualitario e imparcial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde hace unos anos, los paises miembros de ALBA usan Sucre como medio comun de pago en el comercio exterior y preven introducirlo en todos los paises de America Latina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos 5 paises africanos, situados en la parte occidental de Africa, decidieron la circulacion de moneda comun para fundar la zona de moneda de Africa Occidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre tanto, los miembros de la Comunidad de Desarrollo de Africa Austral (SADC) publicaron el plan de instituir hasta el 2018 la moneda unica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY los paises productores de petroleo del Golfo Persico discutieron la introduccion de moneda unica y en otras regiones del mundo se esfuerzan por el mismo fin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tendencia multipolar en la rama financiera sacudira el viejo orden economico internacional, protagonizado por EE.UU., y dara paso al establecimiento de nuevo orden basado en la justicia, igualdad y democracia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa paso el tiempo en que EE.UU. controlaba la economia mundial con US$ y es una cuestion de tiempo el derrumbe del imperio de dolar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se hizo una sociedad deformada en la vida espiritual y cultural y la material.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos capitalistas norteamericanos divulgan la idea y la cultura de caracter reaccionario y el modo de vida burguesa para adormecer la conciencia independiente de las masas trabajadoras y convertirlas en esclavas del dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. fundo hasta la \"universidad de bandidos\" y la \"escuela de ladrones\" en que se forman de modo sistematico los delincuentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos estadounidenses degenerados ideo-culturalmente cometen sin parar los crimenes horribles asociados con armas de fuego y narcoticos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs deplorable la situacion de educacion de ese pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa manifestacion anti-Wall Street de 2011, lucha anticapitalista de mayor envergadura en la historia de EE.UU., es el producto inevitable de las contradicciones sociales y clasistas agravadas al extremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa deformada vida material y la ideologica y cultural empobrecida aceleran la destruccion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos demuestran claramente que se hace realidad el derrumbe del \"imperio norteamericano\"."
