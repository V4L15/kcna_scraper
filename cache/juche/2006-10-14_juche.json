            "content": "KCNA Ridicules U.S. Futile Waste of Money \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- The United States decided to annually offer a million U.S. dollars in financial aid to the non-governmental \"human rights\" organizations in south Korea which specialize in anti-DPRK broadcasting service.\r\n This is part of the U.S. hostile moves to destroy the socialist system chosen by the Korean people themselves by tarnishing the image of the DPRK and pressurizing it to bring about a \"change\" by every possible means and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. trite method to use its propaganda machines for hurting the dignity of those countries which stand in the way of attaining its aims or forcing them to effect \"changes\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past period, the U.S. used broadcasting media and publications as leverage for stepping up its interference in the internal affairs of many countries and precipitating their collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is still widely using those media for spreading American-style \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" all over the world in a bid to create illusion about the U.S. and spark political conflict and instability, confusion and disorder in other countries. It is also setting in motion those media to float information to be used as pretexts for interfering in politics, culture, economy and other internal affairs of those countries that court its displeasure and spread misinformation about them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now hatching every conceivable plot to bring down the DPRK, while directing the spearhead of attack against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its hostile policy toward the DPRK has gone beyond the tolerance limit and a dangerous atmosphere of confrontation reminiscent of that on the eve of war is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this backdrop that the U.S. is escalating its financial sanctions against the DPRK worldwide while being busy spreading sheer lies in a bid to intensify its operations to destabilize the DPRK as evidenced by the reinforced operation of \"Voice of Free Asia.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even foreign public opinion commented that such sharp increase in funding as the recent action is an indication that \"it is aimed to lead north Koreans to bring about a substantial change in their consciousness\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of the U.S. to escalate its anti-DPRK moves even offering a large amount of money to betrayers of the nation hell-bent on slandering their fellow countrymen and fanning up confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said plots and smear campaign of those forces hostile towards the DPRK are nothing but the last-ditch efforts of those who know nothing of the DPRK where the leader, the party and the people form a harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be sadly mistaken if it calculates it can break any moment the Korean people's unity in political and ideological aspects and in the sense of moral obligation, the unity that was achieved and has grown strong through their practical experience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. financial support to the anti-DPRK broadcasting services would get it nowhere.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In particular, it does not call for taking any legal action against those who abuse human rights in the course of torturing and interrogating \"suspected terrorists.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what the U.S. has sought in the adoption of such highhanded act. Through this the U.S. seeks to justify and incite its imperialist aggression forces' human rights abuses and punish a great many innocent people on charges of being \"suspected terrorists\" in a bid to whip up an atmosphere of terror in the international community. Their ulterior motive is to escalate the \"war on terrorism\" to realize its design for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. desperate efforts to attain its aims for aggression and domination through such act will only reveal its true colors as the world's worst abuser of human rights and invite its international isolation and worldwide condemnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its arbitrary and highhanded practices are the root cause of wrecking global peace and stability and challenging international justice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
