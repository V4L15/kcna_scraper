            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group's Hideous Provocation to Be Shattered-- KPA Supreme Command\r\n Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army released the following statement on Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t These days the Lee Myung Bak group's anti-DPRK confrontation racket is going beyond such danger line that it cannot be left to take its own course.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of this was that the Third Infantry Division of the puppet Fifth Army Corps in the central sector of the front and other units in the forefront areas again seriously hurt the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK and deliberately spoke ill of its system and army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They displayed slogans and placards at lots of barracks and posts of the puppet army, military facilities and guideboards and walls on nearby roads. This was hysteria which can be kicked off only by the group of traitors and a hideous provocation which can be perpetrated only by hooligans who go wild like \"puppies knowing no fear of a tiger\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The developments go to clearly prove that the bellicose and blatant challenges daring hurt the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK and slander its inviolable system are nothing new but have been perpetrated in a systematic and premeditated manner on the script of traitor Lee Myung Bak and the military hooligans since long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, south Korean inhabitants are labeling such provocations as \"something shocking\", \"reckless acts of sending a chill to the hearts of even strangers\", \"a premeditated plot to foster confrontation with fellow countrymen\" and \"behaviors of psychopaths reminiscent of the war atmosphere in the 60s and the 70s\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that such ceaseless hideous provocations have not been committed by a few individual hooligans of the puppet military but perpetrated by the group as part of its \"state policy\" and pursuant to \"the guidelines\" of the group of puppet military warmongers for stoking bitterness towards the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that a whole string of reckless remarks calling for confrontation with fellow countrymen were let loose by Lee Myung Bak at Chongwadae and high-ranking military officers including puppet Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin were locked in confabs over the issue of hurting the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK in their office rooms. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK cannot but regard all these hideous crimes against the nation and the DPRK as the highest treason as they stunned the public at home and abroad and cannot but deal with this open military provocation as an urgent case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Supreme Command of the KPA will regard the reckless behaviors of the group of traitors adding to its hideous crimes against the nation as a new declaration of war against the DPRK from now on and will take corresponding military retaliatory measures in reflection of the towering resentment of all servicepersons and people and their pledge to take revenge upon the enemy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group of traitors is the sworn enemy with whom the Koreans cannot live under the same sky and the bellicose forces of the puppet military are the group of traitors to be wiped out by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will take merciless military retaliatory measures with every means and method involved till the group puts an end to all acts of hurting the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK and defiling its system and army and makes an apology to the nation for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the compatriotic military steps so far taken by the army of the DPRK for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations would prove to be stringent sanctions of DPRK style against the puppet authorities and military warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the worst confrontation maniacs in the world dared to perpetrate such extreme provocation against the DPRK as not ruling out even a war against it, there will be only physical stand-off between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will come to clearly realize what stern punishment by force of arms will be meted out by the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can match the servicepersons and people of the DPRK, their hearts burning with the determination to take a thousand-fold revenge upon the enemy. There is a limit to their patience. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only sledge-hammer blows of the nation await those who direct accusing fingers at the sky, not content with denying the socialist system in the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its servicepersons and people will foil the reckless heinous provocations of the group with merciless retaliatory blows and certainly accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, the desire of all Koreans, at an early date."

It also strongly demanded the south side immediately make apology, punish the prime movers and take measures to prevent the recurrence of similar incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side, in fact, apologized to the DPRK, describing it as an \"inappropriate happening\" and saying it \"took relevant measures in the units.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent hideous provocations prove these were just lies and that Chongwadae and senior military officers were the architects of the provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side should immediately make apology for the recent provocations, punish the prime movers, remove all the foul slogans and stop reckless provocations at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south side continues to connive at the provocations defiling the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK and its system and army, the DPRK will resolutely counter them with an all-out military retaliation and merciless measures for punishment as it had already warned in statements."

Y los belicistas de la capa militar son precisamente la horda de traidores que debemos aniquilar sólo con las armas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuertes medidas militares de represalia, que tomarán nuestro ejército y pueblo, se ejercerán despiadadamente por cualesquier medios y métodos hasta cuando la banda traidora elimine todos sus actos que denigran la máxima dignidad, el sistema y el ejército de nuestra parte y pida disculpas ante la nación. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas medidas militares de carácter fraternal, que ha tomado hasta la fecha nuestro ejército en el marco de las relaciones Norte-Sur, se convertirán en las fuertes sanciones a nuestro estilo sobre las autoridades títeres y los belicistas de la capa militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que los maníacos de confrontación sin pares en la historia se atreven a cometer las provocaciones extremadas, inclusive la guerra, sólo queda en las relaciones Norte-Sur el saldo físico con armas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, probarán desde ahora el golpe severo de las armas de nuestro ejército y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie en el mundo podrá frenar la decisión de nuestro ejército y pueblo de tomar la venganza mil veces más fuerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra paciencia tiene su límite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA los bribones que calumnian el prestigioso régimen socialista de la RPDC y se atreven a criticar hasta su máxima dignidad, les tocará nada más que la severa sentencia de la nación. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militares y civiles de la RPDC frustrarán con las armas de represalia implacable las imprudentes provocaciones nunca vistas de la banda traidora y lograrán sin falta con antelación la histórica causa de reunificación de la patria, anhelo de toda la nación coreana."
