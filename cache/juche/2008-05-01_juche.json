Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il that Korean-style socialism could demonstrate to the whole world its invincible might as it dynamically advanced along the road of Juche, firmly preserving the fundamental interests and principles of the revolution despite the grim situation in which the world socialist movement underwent failure and turns and twists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest happiness and honor of the working people of the DPRK to glorify the new era of the Juche revolution as the annals of the most brilliant prosperity full of confidence of victory under the banner of Songun, holding Kim Jong Il, the great man of Mt. Paektu born of Heaven and the great defender of the socialist cause, in high esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for pushing ahead with the general advance of the Songun revolution true to the leadership of Kim Jong Il and thus flinging open the gate to a great prosperous powerful socialist nation as early as possible and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will resolutely shatter the pro-U.S. sycophantic south Korean conservative ruling forces' moves for confrontation with the DPRK and vigorously struggle for independent reunification, peace and prosperity by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation and thus achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail, the reporter said, extending positive support and firm solidarity to the south Korean working people in their just struggle for independence against the U.S. and for the democratization of society and the reunification of the country in the name of all the working people in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter declared that the working people in the DPRK would as ever discharge their historic mission in defending the world peace and security and promoting the human cause of independence and boost the international solidarity with the working people the world over in the idea of independence, peace and friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
