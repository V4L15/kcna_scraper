Korean Regime for Relying on Sworn Enemy of Nation\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet regime is tightening political and military nexus with Japan in response to the measures for bolstering the nuclear force taken by the DPRK for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the consecutive launches of intermediate-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 over the Japanese archipelago, the chief executive of south Korea frequently exchanged phone calls with Abe in which he called for \"increasing the pressure on the north to the extremes\" while expressing \"deep sympathy and concern\" and talking about an \"outrage against a neighboring country\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the third East Economic Forum-2017 in Russia some time ago, he held a talk with Abe where he mentioned the urgency of close relations between south Korea and Japan and even let out such rubbish that Japan's past crimes \"should never be a stumbling block in improving the bilateral relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is in the extension of this pursuance to Japan that the abolition of past crimes including the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army were shunned and the validity of an agreement on protecting military intelligence between south Korea and Japan was extended despite the strong protest and denunciation by the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nothing surprising that the puppet forces are taking to flunkeyism and treachery to retrieve from its clumsy position strategically inferior to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that they are resorting to Japan whose situation is nothing better than them, the island country hardly breathing within the striking range of the nuclear force of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that the puppet forces do not mind even the sworn enemy to get rid of a pretty fix just like a drowning man catching at a straw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The American master whom they relied so much is snubbing them as they fail to play its role, being at a loss how to carry out its north Korea policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the owner of the White House called the Japanese prime minister to discuss the DPRK's measure for bolstering nuclear force, leaving south Korea in the cold.

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- The miserable end of the Park Geun Hye regime was a stern judgment of the public mind-set on the group of traitors who pushed the inter-Korean relations to the worst catastrophic phase, getting hell-bent the fascist dictatorial rule and irregularities and corruption, backed by outside forces, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in an article\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group in south Korea are now going reckless to prevent them from meeting the final ruin and prolong their dirty remaining days, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They raise a hue and cry over \"security crisis\", malignantly pulling up the DPRK's measures to bolster up the nuclear deterrence for self-defense. This is a revelation of their cynical ploy to take the initiative in the south Korean political landscape and retake the lost position by rallying the conservatives under the cloak of \"security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their desperate efforts are an unpardonable action against the aspiration and wishes of the south Korean people for independence, democracy and reunification and against the demand of candlelight holders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the people's vigilance and their fighting spirit are weakened, the group of traitors will raise their heads again, and a new society for the popular masses can be built only through the steady and staunch struggle. This is a lesson taught by the history of the south Korean people's movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For their worthwhile life, the south Korean people should clean sweep away the conservative group which are still going against the trend of the era and the public mind-set though it underwent the stern judgment of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation in south Korea calls for more vigorous struggle against the conservatives seeking revival so that they can never raise their heads again."
