Al contrario, en el mandato del rey japones decretado el mismo dia se ven su sello y firma, senala la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La falta de la firma imperial en ese documento comprueba que el emperador coreano Sunjong no firmo ese \"mandato imperial\" oponiendose a los imperialistas japoneses que pretendian apoderarse de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los hechos demuestran que el \"Tratado de Anexion de Corea a Japon\", que puede ser inventado solo por los gangsteres japoneses, es un documento fraudulento ilegitimo e invalido que no satisface ni los elementales requisitos de un tratado internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta la fecha en que se cumple el centenario de la invencion de este \"tratado\", los gobiernos sucesivos y los politiqueros conservadores reaccionarios de Japon niegan su caracter ilegal pronunciando sofismas de toda indole para atribuirle la \"legalidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En cuanto a ese \"tratado\", Japon mantiene hasta la fecha la actitud y el punto de visita de que ese documento fue concertado legalmente en aquel entonces y por lo tanto, no tiene ninguna responsabilidad legal de la dominacion colonial de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si los reaccionarios japoneses reconocen la historia de crimenes del pasado, se veran obligados a comprometerse ante la sociedad internacional a no repetirla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto no les conviene en ningun caso porque les significaria buscarse la traba que les impide lanzar la nueva agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La otra razon por la cual las autoridades japonesas no reconocen su historia criminal de agresiones y saqueo reside en eludir la responsabilidad legal de la indemnizacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si Japon, siendo un miembro de la sociedad internacional, evade su responsabilidad legal y deber por los archi-crimenes de lesa humanidad cometidos en el pasado por los imperialistas japoneses, revelara por si solo a la faz del mundo que es un Estado ilegal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hacer a Japon reconocer la historia de crimenes e indemnizarlos no es un problema especifico entre Corea y Japon, sino es una tarea comun de todos los paises y pueblos que fueron agredidos por este pais isleno y sufrieron muchas perdidas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Reconociendo que la liquidacion del pasado criminal de Japon no es un simple problema entre este y los paises victimas, sino un problema relacionado con la paz y la seguridad del mundo y para defender la justicia y el principio de la ley internacional, el Comite de Juristas de Corea desplegara con mas dinamismo junto con los pueblos pacifistas, las entidades juridicas y los juristas progresistas de Asia y el resto del mundo la justa lucha por saldar la cuenta de los crimenes del pasado del pais isleno."
