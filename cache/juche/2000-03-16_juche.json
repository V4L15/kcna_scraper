A hammer symbolizes the working class, a sickle farmers and a writing brush working intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The emblem is associated with the noble intention and immortal leadership feats of the President Kim Il Sung who regarded intellectuals as well as workers and farmers as the motive force of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In those days of realizing the cause of building a mass political party after the liberation of the country in August Juche 34 (1945), the President initiated the work to make the party emblem and assigned the officials concerned to its design making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their initial design depicted a worker with a hammer in his hand and a farmer at plowing. A smelter holding a metal rod was also depicted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President examined the draft design of the party emblem and said it was necessary to depict a worker, a farmer and an intellectual. He instructed that it would be better to portray a hammer to represent a worker, a sickle to mean a farmer and a writing brush to represent an intellectual our own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A few days later the officials showed him a design in which a hammer was standing upright and a sickle and a writing brush were depicted on its right side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After examining the design, he said that a hammer, a sickle and a writing brush should be depicted in such a way as to show the first two standing crossed from the middle of the stem of the writing brush in order to symbolize the unity and cohesion of the working masses of Korea including the workers, farmers and working intellectuals. He also said that the emblem would look nice if a writing brush was placed slightly higher than the other two while a hammer was put on the left side and a sickle on the right. He added that placing a writing brush a little higher would mean that every worker and farmer should acquire rich knowledge and culture in the future to greatly contribute to building a rich and strong, civilized, independent and sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK's emblem thus came into being under his meticulous guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This party emblem is also inscribed on the flag of the WPK. \r\n\r\n"

He is far better known by his voice than by his face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Originally a  drama actor, he earned a speedy appeal because of the distinctive charm of his voice and intonation. Later he was taken on by the Korean Film Studio and had since been preoccupied with dubbing imported foreign films. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His premiere cue was the dubbing-in for the leading character of the former Soviet feature film \"King Lear\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThen followed similar roles for over 1,000 foreign films such as the soviet films \"17 Moments In Spring\" and \"The Story of Office\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His idiosyncratic recital carries the audience away when it comes to his role for young actors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His impressive dubbing-in for the soviet film \"At the Mercy of Fate\", the Chinese film \"Zhou Enlai\" and the Indian film \"Lawyer and Son\" came when the was well over 60. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is granted special favors by the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His prowess of acting and recital passed on to his two sons and two daughters, all of whom are on the active list of the film world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The eldest daughter O Mi Ran is one of film stars. She succeeded her father as a drama actress until Juche 67 (1978) when she made her film-starring debut in \"Up Go the Fireworks\". She took a fancy to literature from childhood and was endowed with artistic accomplishments derived from her father. She creditably played major and minor roles for widely divergent characters and occupations and soon established herself as People's Artiste. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her younger brothers, O Song Chol and O Song Jun, and sister O Kum Ran are up-and-coming actors and actress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   O Hyang Mun is wont to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"You must take over not only our family's film tradition but also the lineage of Korean movie\". \r\n\r\n"

Japan should apologize for the recent gangsterism and punish those responsible for it. \r\n\r\n"

Korean \"people's government\" blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- It is two years since the present South Korean chief executive installed what he called \"people's government\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These years are recorded with many indelible crimes against the country and the nation. It was the biggest crime committed by the present \"government\" that it sold off the independence of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief executive of South Korea claimed that \"his victory in the Presidential Election was a victory for the United States\" and asserted that the U.S. troops \"should remain in South Korea even after the reunification.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the issue of apology and compensation for GIs' brutal mass killings during the Korean War (June 1950-july 1953) was raised, he simply asked his U.S. master to make a \"joint investigation\", talking about \"friendly relations with the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He set a \"new record\" in terms of pro-Japanese treacheries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He repeatedly invited Akihito, a symbol of Japanese militarism, to visit South Korea, calling him \"Emperor\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He displayed his skill as a pro-Japanese traitor when he flung the door open to Japanese pop culture which  his predecessors dared not do and abolished the \"system of diversified channel of import.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"economic reform\" intended to \"handle foreign exchange crisis\" turned out to be a \"campaign to sell South Korea\". As a result, businesses, banks and land fell into the hands of foreigners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least 53,000 enterprises went bankrupt owing to the \"layoff\" and \"restructuring\", products of the anti-social rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korean foreign indebtedness has hit the 170 billion dollar mark. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gap between the rich and the poor is further widening despite the noisy advertisement about \"combating corruption and irregularities.\" At least 13 million people are below the poverty rate. The number of jobless and homeless people is 12 times that before the present rulers' coming into power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two years of the \"people's government\" are characterized by its escalated moves for division and confrontation as it has thrown a wet blanket over the ardent desire of the nation for reunification and increased the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As long as the \"people's\" ruling quarters are allowed to stay in power, it is impossible to regain the dignity and sovereignty of the nation trampled underfoot by outside forces or achieve the reunification of the country. Nor is it possible for the South Korean people to enjoy a worthy life and for the whole nation to avoid the disasters of war. \r\n\r\n"
