An official concerned of the U.S. Department of Defense said this deployment is not because the carrier is not necessary in the Persian Gulf area but it is to give priority to the deployment in the Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Sunday says the U.S. attempt to deploy the carrier is a product of the U.S. pivot to Asia-Pacific policy, its hostile policy toward the DPRK, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable scenario of the U.S. to isolate and stifle the DPRK by force, the news analyst says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attempt proves that the moves of the U.S. to create constant danger of war on the Korean Peninsula and stifle the DPRK by force at any cost have entered a more undisguised phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Asia-Pacific is becoming a key region in carrying out the U.S. scenario for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some years ago, the U.S. set forth its pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy, considering that whether it maintains its hegemonic position in the region or not is decisive of its destiny in the 21st century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sought the deployment of the carrier as a way of pushing forward the above-said strategy.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that regional countries will not remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. reckless arms buildup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK equipped with tremendous capability for self-defense views the U.S. imperialists' deployment of such latest carriers as no more than a ridiculous attempt to show off their muscle."
