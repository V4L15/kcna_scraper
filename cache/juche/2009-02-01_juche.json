The moves intensified by the successive reactionary ruling quarters to strengthen their fascist dictatorship in south Korea have been accompanied by confrontation with the DPRK without exception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Lee and his group seek are, in the final analysis, not democracy but fascist dictatorship and not national reconciliation but inter-Korean confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is unable to survive without terrorism at the point of bayonet and prolong his political career without turning south Korea into a prison without iron bars and drenching it with the blood shed by people. His true colors as a fanatic fascist dictator have been brought to light. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fascist suppression is by no means a cure-all and a fanatic fascist dictator can never live out as he is forsaken by the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves to strengthen the fascist dictatorial system can never stem the trend of the times toward independence, democracy and reunification in south Korea but this violent trend will only precipitate the doomsday of the dictator."
