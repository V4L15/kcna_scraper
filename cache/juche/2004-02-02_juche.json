This is the first grave development ever since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And this is a prelude to the overseas aggression of the Japanese militarists which may bring immeasurable misfortune and disasters to humankind again in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revival of Japanese militarism and overseas expansion moves are evoking great alertness in the surrounding countries and at home and abroad. As the desire and demand for independence and peace are the main trend of the present times, Japan should understand that no one will pardon those enemies going against the trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters, oblivious of this and overheated by the revival of militarism and overseas expansion moves, recklessly run amuck, they would follow in the wake of Tojyo clan, special-class war criminals who were ostracized by history, for launching the war of aggression to realize a foolish dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The United States, however, has left no means untried to hamper the process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and that of peace on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. imperialists fabricated the \"nuclear suspicion\" of north Korea and kicked up a frantic anti-DPRK campaign. The U.S. instigated some elements of the International Atomic Energy Agency to threaten the DPRK with \"special inspection\". It brought up the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean peninsula for discussion at the U.N. and had an unjust resolution on applying sanctions against the DPRK adopted there. This resulted in totally freezing the hard-won north-south dialogue which had produced some results and blocking the implementation of the north-south agreement and the joint declaration on denuclearization.  The U.S. is kicking up a nuclear racket again and persisting in its moves against the DPRK and reunification though the Koreans are striving hard to glorify the era of independent reunification ushered in by the adoption of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
