And he developed the KPRA into the Korean People's Army (KPA), modern and regular armed forces, on February 8, 1948.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his commandership the KPA won in the 1950-1953 Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and thus brought about the beginning of a decline for the U.S. imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the war, he had wisely led the KPA to play a pivotal role in bolstering up the national defence capability and reliably discharge its honorable mission in the confrontation with the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made ceaseless inspection of military units, giving primary attention to the strengthening of the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also attached importance to the strengthening of the country's militia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In mid-January 1959 when visiting a village in South Phyongan Province, he matured his plan to found a new type of militia. Then he reorganized the self-defence corps into the Worker-Peasant Red Guards, putting up the slogan \"Rifle in one hand and hammer or sickle in the other!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And he founded the Young Red Guards in September 1970 and guided it to discharge its mission as part of the militia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to turn the country into an impregnable fortress, he saw to it that strong defences were built not only in frontline areas but also other parts of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, he set forth a unique line of simultaneously carrying on the economic construction and the defence building and further developed the nation's self-reliant defence industry so as to realize on a higher level the work for modernizing the entire army, putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into fortress. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President's feats for the strengthening of the country's defence capability are now shining more brilliantly under guidance of supreme leader Kim Jong Un."

It had to explore a new path of the cause of the anti-imperialist national liberation and the socialist cause under the unprecedentedly arduous and grim situation where the people have stood in confrontation with the imperialist formidable enemies. It proudly reached the eminence of victory by weathering the severe upheaval of the century which mercilessly brought to collapse even those countries with a long history of struggle and tremendous national power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The closing period of the last century which could likely be recorded as the end of socialism is registered as years of the victory of socialism and marked as the period in which the DPRK embarked upon building a thriving nation after proudly emerging an indomitable country. All this was the miracle brought about by the unshakable faith and pluck of the peerlessly illustrious commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun Korea succeeded in the H-bomb test at the outset of 2016 and demonstrated its might as a space power, weathering a stern trial in the indomitable spirit. It is courageously dashing ahead to surpass the world's level after breaking the ground for the construction of Ryomyong Street, remaining unperturbed even under the situation where the enemies are bringing the danger of a nuclear war to  heavily hang over the Korean peninsula, vociferating about \"beheading operation\" and \"high-density strike\". The world clearly sees in this gigantic appearance of the DPRK the unshakable faith and pluck of Marshal Kim Jong Un."

Esto es una histeria de los ignorantes de la potencialidad de la RPDC y de los psicopatas muy desesperados por no alcanzar sus objetivos necios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor muy tesoneras las cooperaciones entre los titeres surcoreanos, EE.UU. y Japon para aislar y aplastar la RPDC, no se lograra el objeto de impedir el avance vigoroso de la Corea del Juche, sino se redoblara mas el sentimiento de venganza despiadada de los militares y civiles coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas yanquis, los reaccionarios japoneses y los traidores surcoreanos deben actuar con prudencia sin olvidar que sus anacronicas maniobras de aislamiento y aplastamiento anti-RPDC adelantaran solamente su autodestruccion."
