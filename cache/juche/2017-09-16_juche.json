            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Hwasong-12 Launching Drill Again\r\n Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, guided once again a launching drill of the medium-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greeted by Ri Pyong Chol, Kim Jong Sik, Jo Yong Won, Yu Jin and other leading officials of the C.C., WPK, General of the Strategic Force Kim Rak Gyom, commander of the KPA Strategic Force, and Jang Chang Ha, Jon Il Ho and other officials in the field of defence scientific research.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Participating in the drill were scientists and technicians in the field of rocket research and the Hwasong-12 rocket operation unit of the KPA Strategic Force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The launching drill was conducted with the aim at calming down the belligerence of the U.S. which has recently cried out for using military muscle against the DPRK, and at bolstering up operation capability for attack and counterattack to counter it with swift and powerful military counteraction, examining the order to deal with nuclear warheads and confirming action procedures of actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Hwasong artillerymen were rapidly deployed to the launching ground at early morning under a sudden order of respected Supreme Leader Kim Jong Un. They were waiting for the moment to launch ballistic rocket after launching preparation under skillful organization and command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He arrived at the launching ground, learned about the launch plan and preparation and issued an order to launch the medium-and-long range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the moment, Hwasong-12 zoomed to the sky with dazzling flash and big explosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fired ballistic rocket crossed the sky above Hokkaido of Japan along the preset flight track and accurately hit the preset target waters in the Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Highly appreciating that the current launching drill of very great meaning in increasing combat power of the nuclear force attained its aim, Kim Jong Un expressed great satisfaction over the successful launching drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Praising the Hwasong artillerymen for handling the rocket well with skilful firepower service, he said with pride that the combat efficiency and reliability of Hwasong-12 were thoroughly verified, operation members' capacity for actual war is also very perfect and the work for increasing combat power of Hwasong-12 has been realized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that all drills should become meaningful and practical ones for increasing combat power of the nuclear force like the current drill in the future, and the order to deal with nuclear warheads should be strictly established suited to their deployment for actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined for the scientists and technicians in the field of rocket research and Hwasong artillerymen to put rockets on a modern and ultra modern basis and develop the operation level onto a higher stage with their close combination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told leading officials of the Department of Munitions Industry of the Party Central Committee and the field of defense scientific research accompanying him that our final goal is to establish the equilibrium of real force with the U.S. and make the U.S. rulers dare not talk about military option for the DPRK. And he stressed the need to run at full speed and straight, continuing to qualitatively consolidate the military attack capacity for nuclear counterattack the U.S. cannot cope with. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As recognized by the whole world, we have made all these achievements despite the UN sanctions that have lasted for decades but never made them from any \"benefit\" of the UN, he said, adding it is very stifling for those countries styling themselves big powers keeping their minds on bringing to their knees the DPRK through UN sanctions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should clearly show the big power chauvinists how our state attain the goal of completing its nuclear force despite their limitless sanctions and blockade, he said, underlining the need to put an end to them with the all-state efforts as it has nearly reached the terminal."

The magazine added that now it is necessary to hand over the danger to countries that regard it as the most important interests to deter the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So poor is the despicable behavior of the puppet forces going desperate to keep the Pandora's box, being unaware of whom their destiny depend on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWritten by Ri Kyong Ju"
