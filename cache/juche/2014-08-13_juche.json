            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Construction Site of Apartment Houses for University Educators\r\nPyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), gave field guidance to the construction site of apartment houses for educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology near completion.\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the skyscraping apartment houses of a sailing ship style, he said that they look very nice as their outer walls are decorated with tiles. He  expressed great satisfaction, noting that they are the structures which reflect the WPK's  idea of attaching importance to science and talents and the ones to which formative art of architecture has been fully applied and monumental edifices demonstrating the daily developing architecture of Songun Korea before the whole world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said, his face beaming with a broad smile, that they look more attractive when their outer walls are covered with heated reflection glass as required by the design, adding that he felt relieved of long fatigue when thinking that educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology would be provided with the apartment houses to be proud of before the world before long.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round flat No.1 on the fourth floor of block No. 2, shop and restaurant and other service facilities being built on the ground floor of the apartment houses, he learned in detail about the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dropping in at various rooms including drawing room, couple room, kitchen and study, he looked at the surface of wall and floor with attention and highly appreciated the quality of construction. Seeing an arch like pillar of the entrance between corridor and drawing room, he said that it would look peculiar when it was fitted with decorative board.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to furnish the flat with every trifling thing necessary for living, he told officials to let the educators devote themselves to the work for training talents and scientific and researches without any inconvenience in their living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pleased that the service facilities including shop and restaurant are under construction as required by the design, he  instructed  officials of the unit which would operate them to come out to check and make advance preparations for providing service when the apartment houses are completed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to simultaneously push forward the arrangement of environment including greening work as the day of completion of the project is drawing near.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the longer one watches the apartment houses for educators of Kim Chaek University of Technology, the more fashionable they look and they will appear more attractive when one watches them from the opposite side of the Taedong River, he stressed that the structures which are suited to the modern architectural beauty and which meet the requirements of the Juche and national characters, originality and convenience have appeared in the era of the Workers' Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the soldier-builders at the construction site for doing their work well as a model unit in the nation's construction in hearty response to the call of the Party Central Committee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that it is the pride of the WPK and the country to have KPA Unit 267 which rushes to wherever the party calls it to work and devotedly implements the task in the best quality by the fixed date, he gave it the highest appreciation, calling its service personnel modern day Chollima riders racing against time in ushering in a great heyday of building a rich and powerful country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the KPA General Political Bureau, Han Kwang Sang, department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Army Lieut.

Korean Military for Shelling Peaceable Fishing Boats of DPRK\r\nPyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The command of the southwestern front of the Korean People's Army (KPA) released the following report Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military hooligans committed such a serious military provocation as indiscriminately shelling peaceable fishing boats of the DPRK engaged in their routine fishing operations in the waters off the southwestern coast on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reckless provocation has pushed the already tense situation in the waters to an unpredictable phase of explosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation lies in that this military provocation was perpetrated under a carefully worked out premeditated plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The units of the three services of the puppet forces were put on alert and F-16 fighter bombers hovered in the sky above the waters while five speed boats intruded deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK in succession to indiscriminately fire shells at the peaceable boats. This was truth about the recent provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The officers and men of the KPA on the southwestern front were already well aware of the despicable true nature of the military gangsters who committed such provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A sinister aim sought by the puppet forces was to divert elsewhere the public criticism of them thrown into the quagmire by the development of the murder of private first class Yun, a product of vulnerability of the puppet forces who are no more than cannon fodder for the U.S. war of aggression and corrupt and ailing south Korean society, into the ferry Sewol incident of military version and the occurrence of all sorts of slackened military discipline and scandals shocking the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another aim sought by the puppet forces was to cause the KPA to take a countermeasure for self-defence through reckless shelling provocation in the hotspot waters and thus create a pretext for conducting Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation is compelling the officers and men of the KPA on the southwestern front to lose the last chance of patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their hearts are burning with the will to take merciless actions to blow up Paekryong Island, Yonphyong Island, Taechong Island and others where military gangsters are entrenched to use the hotspot waters in the West Sea as a starting point of a war and to send to the bottom of the sea the pirate ships intruding into the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the southwestern waters where bullets and shells are fired regardless of time, where guiltless fishermen of the DPRK were taken away and hair-raising atrocities were perpetrated against them, and where frequent intrusions into territorial waters of the DPRK are committed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies should not forget that artillery pieces of the KPA are waiting for the moment to open fire, keeping the headquarters of provocation within their sight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unshakable is the will of the officers and men of the KPA on the southwestern front to make retaliatory shelling to reduce the provokers' reckless shelling to their final destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces should not misunderstand the patience of the KPA officers and men on the southwest front."

Korea\r\nPyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute in a memorandum it released Wednesday in the run-up to the 69th anniversary of the liberation of Korea revealed the crimes the U.S. committed by inflicting unbearable misfortune and pain on the south Korean people through its colonial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t Nearly 70 years covered by south Korea after the liberation of Korea were a history of disgrace in which it has been thoroughly dependent on the U.S. in the political, military, cultural, economic and all other fields with its political sovereignty and the right to existence wantonly violated by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is a colony of the U.S. with its political sovereignty violated by the U.S., the memorandum said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the ruler over south Korea as it has decided everything in south Korea since the liberation of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime was installed according to the will of the U.S. and pro-U.S. stooges who were groomed by the U.S. were elected as \"presidents\" to faithfully serve the U.S. This is the stark reality in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime is unable to exercise the elementary right to sovereignty as it kowtows to the U.S. The relations between the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are master-servant relations, those of domination and subjugation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The right to command the armed forces in south Korea has been exercised by the U.S. under brigandish military treaties imposed by the U.S. on south Korea since the south Korean army was organized as a colonial mercenary army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the present conservative regime took power in south Korea, the U.S., by taking advantage of the chief executive's ignorance of the military affairs, pushed the situation in south Korea to the brink of a war and created \"insecurity\" through various forms of north-targeted war drills in its persistent bid to extend again the transfer of the right to command the wartime operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, the present south Korean chief executive, who committed herself  \"not to extend again the transfer of the right to command the wartime operations\" during her \"presidential campaign\" in 2012, could not but stage the farce of imploring the U.S. to extend the right to command the wartime operations, seized by extreme \"security uneasiness\". Therefore, it was decided shortly ago to extend the transfer to the period after 2020. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum noted that the U.S. employed all sorts of mechanisms, means and methods to turn south Korea into its permanent colony and military base in a bid to realize its ideological and cultural domination over south Korea. It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is distributing anti-DPRK books, publications and literature that preach the corrupt American way of life, Yankee culture in different parts of south Korea. And it is pressurizing the south Korean authorities to reduce the institutional mechanism for limiting the showing of foreign films and screen more U.S. films, claiming that movies are very effective for disseminating the idea of worship towards the U.S. and the American way of life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S. cunning and vicious ideological and cultural domination, the south Korean people's consciousness of independence and national culture and their beautiful manners and customs were stamped out and the idea of flunkeyism and subjugation and corrupt American culture and way of life are prevalent in the south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that south Korea is a colony totally dependent on U.S. economy, the memorandum went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean economy has been reduced to an empty one due to the protracted U.S. colonial enslavement policy. It finds itself in such miserable position that it always suffers an acute shortage of raw materials and funds and undergoes marketing difficulties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea depends on the U.S. and other foreign countries for 87-100 percent of raw materials and fuel needed for industrial production, for 70 percent of spare parts and materials and for 100 percent of core technology and resource technology for the production of goods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Multinational capitals in the U.S. found their ways into south Korea by various forms and methods such as direct investment, indirect investment, loan, technical cooperation and joint bank and are raking up excessive colonial profits, being granted all sorts of special privileges by the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces can never get rid of such miserable plight as colonial stooges and the south Koreans cannot escape disgrace, misfortune and pain as long as the U.S. colonial domination and their sycophancy toward it and treachery persist, the memorandum concluded."

Sobre todo, impone a las autoridades surcoreanas reducir los aparatos institucionales que limitan la proyeccion de filmes extranjeros y a proyectar mas filmes norteamericanos, diciendo que estos son muy eficaces para divulgar la ideologia proyanqui y el estilo de vida norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al astuto y barbaro dominio ideologico y cultural de EE.UU., se suprimen la concepcion independiente, la cultura nacional y la original costumbre de los habitantes surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvidentemente, el Sur de Corea es la colonia subyugada de punta a cabo a la economia estadounidense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado de la prolongada politica de EE.UU. en materia de colonizar y subyugar al Sur de Corea, la economia de este sufre la permanente escasez de materias primas, fondos y ventas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el Sur de Corea depende de EE.UU. y otros paises extranjeros el 87-100% de materias primas y combustibles necesarios a la produccion industrial, el 70% de accesorios y materiales y el 100 % de las tecnologias nucleares y de base para la produccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos capitales multinacionales de origen estadounidense se infiltran en el Sur de Corea en diversas formas y metodos como la inversion directa e indirecta, prestamo, cooperacion tecnica, banco comanditario, etc. y sacan superganancias gozando de las prerrogativas de toda indole otorgadas por los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras continuen el dominio colonial de EE.UU. y los actos serviles proyanquis de los titeres surcoreanos, estos no podran salir nunca de su miserable situacion de lacayos coloniales y la poblacion surcoreana vivira siempre en verguenzas, desgracias y sufrimientos."
