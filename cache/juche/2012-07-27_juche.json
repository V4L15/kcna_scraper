They shared weal and woe in the same trench with the army and people of the DPRK, thus setting a noble example of internationalism in the struggle against common enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We always remember this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the war the acute stand-off with the imperialists went on,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il pursued the Songun politics in an over-all way and wisely led the nuclear stand-off with the U.S. and defended socialism, thus ushering in the era of fresh victory in the confrontation with the imperialists and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military parade that was held this year to celebrate the Day of the Sun on the initiative of Generalissimo Kim Jong Il was a grand festival of victors that showed the military and technological superiority is no longer monopoly of the imperialists and gone never to return are the days when the U.S. threatened and blackmailed the DPRK with nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un's leadership a lifeline of the People's Army and banner of all victories, the reporter continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From his early years the dear respected Kim Jong Un was together with Kim Jong Il in his long journey of Songun leadership and made remarkable contributions to strengthening the KPA into reliable scout forces and core forces supporting the Songun revolution, and demonstrating the country's might as a world-level military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are fully demonstrating the fighting spirit of annihilating enemies with fixed conviction that victories will be in store for them as long as they advance under the leadership of Kim Jong Un who is possessed of offensive temperament of Mt. Paektu, outstanding commanding arts and iron luck and will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nearly six decades have passed since fireworks were displayed to celebrate the victory in the war but peace has not yet settled on this land and the situation still remains tense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists remain unchanged in their aggression nature to stifle the DPRK by force and occupy the whole of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK do not want war but are never afraid of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers are gravely mistaken if they think they can survive and their bases will be safe while working out scenario for war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists ignite a new war on this land, the party will believe in the people and the people in the party and they will wage an all-people war to make the enemies sign the document of surrender, not armistice agreement and thus achieve the nation's cherished desire for reunification."

The U.S. is entirely to blame for this, says Minju Joson Friday in a bylined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t For the last 59 years the U.S. has turned its face away from the principled demand and sincere efforts made by the DPRK for replacing the Armistice Agreement (AA) by a peace accord and ensuring a lasting peace in the Korean Peninsula. On the contrary, it has wantonly violated AA, the commentary notes, citing data to prove this. It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brought to light its undisguised attempt to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. It compelled the DPRK to take a counter-measure for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the DPRK's warning, the U.S. has persisted in its hostile policy toward the DPRK. As a result, the Korean Peninsula has become the world's most dangerous hotspot and a source of nuclear war for which the anachronistic and reckless military moves of the U.S. are to blame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, it will go beyond the boundary of Korea in no time and lead to a World war, imposing tremendous disasters upon mankind again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only way for heading off a war is to immediately end ceasefire and establish a lasting peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly proved by the history of confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. that lasted for nearly six decades since the ceasefire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of ending the state of ceasefire and building a new peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula will serve as a touchstone judging who truly wants peace and who does not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly wants to see peace on the Korean Peninsula, it should respond to a fair and reasonable proposal raised by the DPRK for the replacement of the AA by a peace treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to act with responsibility for the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula."

por el 59o aniversario de la victoria en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t En la ocasion estuvieron presentes Kim Yong Nam, Choe Yong Rim, Choe Ryong Hae, Hyon Yong Chol y otros cuadros directivos del partido, el Estado y el ejercito, los funcionarios de las instituciones del partido, fuerzas armadas y el poder, las entidades sociales, ministerios, organos centrales, los delegados veteranos participantes en la pasada guerra, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular de Corea y el Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea, los funcionarios de las ramas de ciencia, educacion, literatura y arte, salud publica, prensa e informacion, los benemeritos, los trabajadores capitalinos, el representante de la sucursal del Frente Democratico Nacional Antiimperialista en Pyongyang y los compatriotas en ultramar que permanecen en la patria socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El discurso de la ocasion estuvo a cargo de Choe Ryong Hae, miembro del Presidium del Buro Politico del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y jefe de la Direccion Politica General del EPC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El informante dijo que el 27 de Julio es el dia de la segunda liberacion en que bajo la direccion del Presidente Kim Il Sung, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea lograron la brillante  victoria tras vencer a los agresores imperialistas norteamericanos que se jactaban de la \"superpotencia\" del mundo y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La pasada guerra fue la justa para defender la libertad y la independencia de la patria y la mas enconada sin precedente en la historia de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El imperialismo norteamericano movilizo en pasada  guerra coreana mas de 2 millones de los agresores armados de 16 paises lacayunos inclusive sus colosales tropas agresivas y el ejercito titere del Sur de Corea y se valio de todas maneras y metodos mas crueles de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sin embargo, no pudo arrodillar al ejercito y el pueblo de Corea dirigidos por el Presidente    Kim Il Sung, genial Comandante invencible y destacado estratega militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al margen de la autoctona idea militar y la sabia estrategia y tactica del Presidente Kim Il Sung y el espiritu indoblegable de lucha del ejercito y el pueblo que combatieron en acato a la direccion del Lider, no pueden pensar en la victoria de la RPDC en la guerra contra los poderosos enemigos imperialistas norteamericanos y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Durante la guerra, el pueblo hermano chino y los pueblos del mundo amantes de la paz siempre estaban al lado del pueblo coreano que libra la sagrada guerra justa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bajo la bandera de \"resistir a los yanquis, ayudar a Corea, y defender el hogar y el pais propios\", los excelentes hijos del pueblo chino acudieron al frente coreano y compartieron la vida y muerte en la misma trinchera con el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea dedicando su vida, creando asi el noble ejemplo de internacionalismo en el combate contra el enemigo comun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y el pueblo no lo olvidaran jamas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues del cese de fuego de la guerra, la batalla ardua de confrontacion con los imperialismos se ha venido continuando.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Dirigente Kim Jong Il practico en todas las ramas la politica del Songun y condujo sabiamente el enfrentamiento nuclear con EE.UU. y la batalla por la defensa del socialismo, de manera que abrio la nueva epoca de victoria en la batalla antiimperialista y antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El desfile militar por el Dia del Sol del presente ano efectuado por la iniciativa directiva del Generalisimo Kim Jong Il fue un gran festival de los triunfadores que demostro que la superioridad militar y tecnica no es mas el monopolio de los imperialistas y paso para siempre la era en que EE.UU. amenazaba y chantajeaba a la RPDC con las armas  nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La direccion del Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un deviene la vida del EPC y la bandera invencible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El estaba siempre desde temprano al lado del Dirigente Kim Jong Il en el camino largo del Songun, para fortalecer el EPC como fidedigna patrulla y firme sosten de la revolucion del Songun e hizo el aporte excepcional en glorificar la patria como potencia militar de talla mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y el pueblo de Corea bien conscientes de que al seguir la direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un, poseedor del temperamento de ataque de tipo del Paektu, el destacado arte de mando militar, la audacia de acero y la determinacion fuerte, la victoria sera siempre la nuestra, manifiestan sin reserva el temperamento y la voluntad de aniquilar a los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque pasaron casi 60 anos desde el cese de fuego, no se mantiene la paz en esta tierra y la situacion sigue siendo tensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No se ha cambiado la naturaleza agresiva del imperialismo yanqui de ocupar a toda la Peninsula Coreana tras aplastar con las fuerzas a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuestro ejercito y pueblo no desean la guerra, pero, no la temen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El imperialismo norteamericano y sus fuerzas seguidoras provocando la guerra agresiva piensan equivocadamente en quedarse en vivo y sano su territorio por encontrarse lejos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si EE.UU. desencadena otra vez la guerra en esta tierra, todo el partido y pueblo confiandose mutuamente libraran la guerra de todo el pueblo y alcanzaran sin falta el deseo historico de la reunificacion de la patria obligando a los enemigos  a firmar no en el acuerdo de armisticio sino en el acta de capitulacion."
