They are the reunification programme that is consistent with the spirit of national independence regarding the sovereignty and dignity of the nation as life and soul and carries the warm love for the country and the nation, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is stipulated in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration that the problem of national reunification should be solved independently by the concerted efforts of the Koreans responsible for it. This basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration was reaffirmed in the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts go to prove that the inter-Korean declarations reflect in an overall way the idea of national independence contained in the three charters for national reunification and, accordingly, they are the continuity of the three charters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the said declarations is based on the idea of great national unity laid down in the three charters. And it carries the will to unite all the compatriots loving the country and the nation through reconciliation and unity between the north and the south and thus reunify the country and make a new history of prosperity for the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The federation formula is the most realistic way for realizing Korea's reunification now that differing ideologies and systems exist in the north and the south for more than half a century and both sides refuse to abandon their own.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the June 15 joint declaration, the north and the south recognized that the north-proposed low-stage federal system and the south-proposed federation system have something in common with each other and affirmed to the entire nation that the reunification would be realized in this way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite possible to achieve the independent reunification, peace and prosperity if the inter-Korean declarations, which carry the blueprint of the independent and peaceful reunification clarified by the three charters, are sincerely implemented."
