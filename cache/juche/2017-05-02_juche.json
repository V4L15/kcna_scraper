            "content": "KCNA Commentary Condemns S. Korean Conservatives' Scheme to Stay in Power\r\nPyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The south Korean group of conservatives cries out for \"retaking power\", cheating the public under the spurious signboard of \"reasonable and pure conservatism\" ahead of the imminent \"presidential\" election.\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Liberal Korea Party\" and the \"Parun Party\" have buckled down to taking initiative, trading insults with each other though they originated from the former \"Saenuri\" Party. They are making last-ditch efforts, talking about \"great unity of conservatives\" and \"single candidate from conservative parties\" in a bid to prevent the opposition forces from taking power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a clear proof of the desperate efforts of the remnants of the pro-Park Geun Hye cult to prolong their remaining days and stay in power though they are on the verge of ruin after being sternly punished by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conservatism in south Korea just serves as a \"lever for preserving interests\" only as it has neither philosophy nor political view, not being the one as thought and ideology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One can easily judge what the conservative group, a group of disgusting philistines and human scum, would do if they stay in power from the fact that the preceding puppet conservative regimes of south Korea were all enemies of reunification and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative regimes regarded it as a \"state policy\" to remain desperately opposed to communism, the north and reunification. Such a policy served as the \"most valuable one\" of pro-U.S. conservatism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the national division and the inter-Korean confrontation festered, the U.S. and the pro-U.S. conservative group of south Korea worked hard to take advantage of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative regimes mercilessly cracked down on the progressive democratic forces and pro-reunification patriotic forces by branding them as \"pro-north leftist forces,\" crying out for achieving \"unification by overthrowing or prevailing over communism\" and \"unification of social systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Syngman-Rhee regime set it as a \"principal state line\" to persist in anti-communism. The Park Chung-Hee military fascist regime ruthlessly nipped in its bud the spirit of democratization growing among the south Korean public with the April 19 popular uprising as a momentum and quenched the public desire for reunification mounting with the July 4 joint statement as an occasion by pursuing the \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship. The brutal Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo regimes cruelly suppressed the righteous public campaign for independence, democracy and reunification, turning Kwangju City into a sea of blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Kim Yong Sam regime pushed the north-south relations to a complete catastrophe by rubbing salt into the wounds of the compatriots in the north who lost their great leader. The Lee Myung Bak and Park Geun Hye regimes caused havoc in the June 15 era of reunification by chilling the atmosphere for national unity and independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the conservative regimes in south Korea were all keen on doing evils only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, Hong Jun Phyo, \"presidential candidate\" from the \"Liberal Korea Party\" openly cried out for \"introducing tactical nuclear weapons\", welcoming THAAD deployment. What he uttered are just reckless outbursts of a thrice-cursed traitor seized with the conservative ill habit of escalating confrontation with the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that if such conservative elements stay in power, the north-south relations already plunged into a catastrophe will come to total collapse and the Korean territory will turn into a theater of nuclear war of outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now south Korean people are criticizing the behavior of the conservatives keen on committing frauds under the pretext of \"security\" as a \"risky gambling on the lives of 50 million south Koreans\" and \"war game of political philistines for taking power.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group is just dregs of the times and reactionary one of history as it goes against the trend of times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To eliminate the hateful conservative remnants to the last one is the only way out for the south Korean people."

            "content": "Japan's Aim in Spreading Story about Crisis on Korean Peninsula Disclosed\r\nPyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The Japan chief executive took the lead in spreading the story about the crisis on the Korean peninsula soon after the report about the U.S. preemptive attack on Syria was made as if had being waited for it to happen.\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan ministers are following his lead in getting vocal about the story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says the aim sought by Japan in spreading the story is to step up the constitutional modification which it has so far attempted with the possible crisis on the peninsula as a pretext, and to put spurs to the \"Self-Defense Forces\" overseas dispatch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another aim is to stimulate its reeling economy with the orders of new war supplies from the U.S. after a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula and thus gain a windfall just as it did during the past Korean war, the news analyst says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on the peninsula, those keen on doing harm to the DPRK, to say nothing of those who backed them, can not go scot-free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case of a nuclear war on the peninsula, Japan that houses logistic bases, launching bases and sortie bases of the U.S. forces will be put under radioactive clouds before any country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan is truly concerned about its interests, it has to make due efforts for the peaceful settlement of the Korean peninsula issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the first country in the world that suffered A-bomb disaster, Japan knows better than others how terrible the nuclear disaster is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities should behave with discretion, clearly understanding that it is Japan which will be affected most once a war breaks out on the peninsula."
