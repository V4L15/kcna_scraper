            "content": "Japan hit for its reckless remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the Japanese government said that it would help the United States by taking charge of aerial espionage on the DPRK during the Iraqi war. \r\nPursuant to this, the Japan Defense Agency decided to set up a \"headquarters of emergency measure\" and use an aerial alert and control plane of its air \"self-defense force\" for intensifying \"alert and watch\" on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson on Tuesday in a signed commentary terms this a reckless move of those seized by extreme hostility toward the DPRK. The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aerial espionage against a sovereign state is an act of encroaching upon its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries decided to take upon themselves aerial espionage against the DPRK in a sinister bid to take advantage of the present complicated and tense situation for realizing their invariable ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There exist between the DPRK and Japan the deep-rooted hostile relations, a product of the crime-woven past of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe hearts of the army and the people of the DPRK are always burning with the determination to force Japan to pay for its past crimes a thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully capable of doing so. But it is exercising patience out of maximum magnanimity. It is as clear as noonday that Japan will get nothing by provoking the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, the Japanese reactionaries are zealously following the U.S. moves to militarily stifle the DPRK. This will only precipitate their self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persist in their reckless moves to reinvade Korea, backed by the U.S., they will have to pay dearly for this.    \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. escalates espionage flights against DPRK in March \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist warhawks committed more than 220 espionage flights against the DPRK in March.\r\n Many strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes of various missions were involved in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane spied on areas deep in the DPRK and its major military targets on the east coast while U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance plane and RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane photographed strategic targets of the DPRK and spied on them by using electronic devices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n E-3 plane commanded pursuit assault planes and fighter bombers and spied on military targets of the DPRK in the fore-frontal areas. EP-3 electronic reconnaissance plane flew above the east and west coasts searching underwater. RC-12 and RC-7B tactical reconnaissance planes spied on the frontal and coastal line areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists carried out aerial war exercises under the simulated conditions of a war against the north as part of Foal Eagle and Rsoi war exercises in March. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They transferred more than 50 strategic reconnaissance planes, refueling tankers, electronic jamming planes, special operational planes, pursuit assault planes and fighter bombers from the U.S. mainland and overseas bases to South Korea to be involved in these exercises for a war of aggression. \r\n They also mobilized a F-117 stealth fighter bomber in a drill to attack land targets, supported by E-3 control plane. And they hurled F-117 stealth and F-16 fighter bombers into a drill of getting familiar with topographical conditions and a drill of supporting the front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aerial war exercises were a very dangerous mobile exercise intended to secure the command of air by the U.S. air force, increase the capability of its preemptive attack and contain the DPRK at an initial stage in case of \"contingency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aerial espionage and war exercises go to clearly prove that the U.S. is going to invade the DPRK at the end of the Iraqi war.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes anti-DPRK bill adopted at U.S. Congress \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- The U.S. continues interfering in the internal affairs of the DPRK, talking about its \"suppression of religion\" and \"human rights issue.\"\r\n The U.S. not only groundlessly accused the DPRK of \"suppressing religion\" but adopted a \"bill on the human rights in North Korea\" at congress and referred it to the UN commission on human rights recently. The DPRK strongly protests against these actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is citing the \"nuclear issue\" and \"religious and human rights issues\" in the DPRK, fictions, as pretexts to increase pressure upon the DPRK and launch a military attack on it. Such crafty trick can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of the DPRK are single-heartedly united as a big harmonious family because religious freedom and human rights are fully guaranteed by law. With nothing can the U.S. justify its groundless accusation against the DPRK and it will only invite condemnation of unbiased world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the international community is unanimous in denouncing the U.S. over its religious and human rights issues the U.S. is not in a position to fault other countries over those issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has, indeed, the poorest human rights record. In the U.S. murder is committed once in every 24 minutes, rape once in every 5 minutes and violence once in every 18 seconds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. human rights abuses are clearly evidenced by its war moves for carrying out its strategy to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its wars against Islamic Afghanistan and Iraq are a clear proof of its typical religious and human rights abuses as it regards heretics as a group of satans on the basis of Christian fundamentalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that an infringement upon the sovereignty of a country by a military attack is the gravest violation of human rights of its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., which is killing innocent people after violating the sovereignty of Iraq, is faulting other countries, behaving as if it were a human rights judge. How brazen-faced and ridiculous it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, deeply aware of the superiority of Korean-style socialism chosen by themselves and regarding it as their life and soul, are increasing the self-defensive capacity by all means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly frustrate the U.S. military moves to stifle it and protect the socialist system to the last.    \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA blasts Japan's reckless call for \"preemptive attack\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 1 (KCNA) -- Ishiba, director general of the Defence Agency of Japan, reportedly called for a \"preemptive attack on the missile launching site\" on March 30 during his South Korea visit, raising a hue and cry over the DPRK's missile launch.\r\n His outcry is a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and can not but touch off bitter anti-Japanese sentiment among the Korean people as it undisguisedly revealed Japan's attempt to mount a preemptive attack upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK more than once, the DPRK's production and deployment of missiles are aimed at increasing its self-defensive capability. This can in no way be a threat to those countries which do not attack it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan cried out for a preemptive attack on the DPRK over its \"missile threat\". Such behavior of Japan clearly suggests what a dangerous phase its wild ambition to reinvade Korea has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese bellicose forces' talk about \"preemptive attack\" is by no means fortuitous. This is clearly evidenced by the recent escalated military moves of Japan against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries recently launched a spy satellite targeted against the DPRK by using a large carrier rocket H-2A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLegal arrangements are being made to decide on necessary formalities to intercept ballistic missile, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities and political circles are becoming increasingly assertive that if North Korea launches a missile, it should be intercepted or new \"sanctions\" be taken. And military hardware is being deployed in the waters off the Korean peninsula to monitor and intercept the missiles launch.  The Japanese bellicose forces' call for a preemptive attack upon the DPRK came against this backdrop. This is a development posing a serious threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that Japan is acting a shock brigade in carrying out the U.S. strategy of preemptive attack on the DPRK, zealously following the U.S. moves to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's chiming in with the U.S. call for a preemptive attack on the DPRK is aimed to spark \"U.S.-led second Iraqi war\" on the Korean Peninsula and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this goes to clearly prove that Japan, still regarding the DPRK as its enemy, is refusing to redeem its past crimes and watching for every chance to reinvade Korea in gross violation of the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration calling on both sides to refrain from threatening each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has self-defensive capacity strong enough to beat back any enemy's preemptive strike at a single blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to behave with discretion, well aware that its preemptive attack on the DPRK will only lead to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n"
