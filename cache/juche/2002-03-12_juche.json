This proud success, he noted, is a striking demonstration of the validity and vitality of the popular policies pursued by the WPK which has worked hard to lay one foundation after another for the building of a powerful nation, looking forward to the distant future of the country though its economic conditions were so difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He added that all the domains and units should build more chicken, duck, pig, cattle, goat and catfish farm and other fish-breeding farms with high economic effectiveness and successfully operate the existing stock-breeding and fish-breeding bases so as to provide the people with a more affluent life at an early date.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anecdotes about President Kim Il Sung\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- After the liberation of the country President Kim Il Sung lived in an old one-storied house with several windows and thin walls. So it was hard to keep the house warm despite a lot of effort to heat its floor.  When officials tried to stoke an extra fire, the president dissuaded them from doing so. He used to work at dawn with an overcoat on his shoulders just as he did while fighting on mountains.\r\n One day in mid-November Juche 36 (1947), the third winter after the liberation of the country, officials installed a small electric heater in his house. Upon seeing that, he told the officials to take it back, if they were truly concerned for him, saying that an electric heater installed in the house at a time when the electricity was in short supply in the country might keep the house warm but could not please him. So the officials were compelled to take it back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened one day in November Juche 39 (1950) when the temporary strategic retreat of the Korean People's Army was made. While inspecting its unit, he learned that soldiers of the unit slaughtered an ox. As far as the ox was concerned, it was one of the several oxen whose owner was unknown with which the soldiers took while retreating. One of his legs was broken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But he regarded it as an \"emergency case\". He made sure that a servicepersons' meeting was held to struggle against absolute ideas, saying that not a single ox would remain alive if we slaughtered oxen under this or that pretext, while the enemy was slaughtering them and eating beef as they pleased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon coming back to the supreme headquarters, he issued a telegraph order of the supreme commander that night to the combined units to strictly ban the ox slaughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened on January 20, Juche 41 (1952). He received an official of the ministry of public health who asked him for not a small amount of money in a report sent to him as regards measures to be taken against the barbaric germ warfare committed by the u.s. imperialists. The official felt very sorry for causing anxiety to the president who was shouldering upon himself the heavy burden of the war. But the president took a step to provide necessary funds, saying that there is nothing to spare for the good of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon learning about the medical fees paid by people in those days, he earnestly told officials to enforce free health care, saying that there was nothing more valuable than the people's life though the conditions of the country were hard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Decision no. 203 of the cabinet \"on enforcing the universal free medical care\" was thus released on November 13, Juche 41 (1952).    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
