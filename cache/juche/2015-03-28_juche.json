            "content": "Spokesman for FM of DPRK Categorically Rejects Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights Resolution\" \r\n Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released a statement Saturday lashing out at the U.S. and its allies including Japan and EU for railroading the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" through the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies, Japan and EU, and other forces rammed the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" through the 28th session of the UN Human Rights Council held on Friday despite the unanimous opposition of the world progressive countries aspiring after guarantee of genuine human rights and establishment of a fair world order, the statement said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK vehemently denounces the farce staged at the UN human rights arena as a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the former and clarifies once again its firm will to thoroughly smash the noisy \"human rights\" racket kicked off by the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The adoption of the \"resolution\" once again brought to light the ulterior design of the U.S. and other hostile forces to hurt the dignity of the DPRK and tarnish its image by making much fuss about its groundless \"human rights issue\" and to invent a pretext for perpetrating intervention and aggression against it at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has already been fully exposed to the world that the \"human rights issue\" of the DPRK which had been cooked up by the lackeys of the U.S. wearing the mask of \"protecting human rights\" and noisily advertised by the U.S. and other western countries on the basis of the \"testimonies\" made by \"defectors from the north\", human scum bereft of elementary quality and conscience as human beings, was no more than a fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. and its allies staged another farce of adopting \"human rights resolution\" against the DPRK, repeating their worn-out assertion. This is aimed to get rid of the dilemma in which they are finding themselves by going desperate in their anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket and divert elsewhere the world-wide criticism of the human rights abuses perpetrated by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is saying this or that about human rights performance in other countries while neither setting right nor admitting hideous human rights abuses in its country. This is the height of impudence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington should not poke its nose into the internal affairs of other countries, styling itself the world's \"human rights judge,\" but improve the human rights situation in its own land, the world's worst human rights tundra. Japan and the EU should stop blindly toeing the U.S. line but improve their marred images before the world's eyes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly understand that it is a pipedream to try to bring down the most advantageous socialist system in the DPRK which its army and people regard dearer than their own lives."

The International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives adopted a bill on ratcheting up sanctions against the DPRK in February. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a commentator's article notes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration and Congress are vying with each other in slapping sanctions against the DPRK. This is something rare to be seen in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington's one-sided policy for ratcheting up the sanctions against the DPRK is no more than the last resort chosen by it from the calculation that it can neither check the latter's bolstering of nuclear deterrent nor disturb its economic growth through power-backed pressure only. It is also a last-ditch effort to block the DPRK's successful advance by slapping harsher sanctions against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of this year, the U.S. has got frantic with its moves to pressurize the DPRK by force and sanctions in a bid to lead it to \"earlier changes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinister design of the U.S., an empire of devils, to wipe the DPRK, a sovereign state, off the world map by igniting even a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula is being revealed with each passing day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Washington set it a policy and a law to ratchet up its sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK. It is working with bloodshot eyes to establish an international cooperation system for enforcing them while floating a story about \"nuclear threat\" from the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the prevailing situation where the U.S. is recklessly pursuing the above-said policy after throwing away even the double-dealing policy of dialogue and pressure it much touted in the past, the DPRK clarifies once again its unshakable stand reflecting the towering resentment of its service personnel and people at the U.S. and their confidence in sure victory as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the above-said U.S. policy precisely means a declaration of war against the DPRK and it is the latter's resolute determination to conclude its decades-old showdown with the former with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the U.S. foolish acts of tightening collusion and nexus with other countries, pulling up the DPRK over its \"nuclear issue\", will only bring earlier the latter's great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the further the U.S. ratchets up sanctions to pressurize the DPRK, the higher the latter will hold the banner of the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts to hasten its final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persists in its policy for ratcheting up sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK, it will be bound to face an unimaginable catastrophe. This is a solemn warning served by the DPRK."
