It is using newspapers, magazines and other publications, radio networks and all other leverages as channels for spreading its ideology and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intensifying economic pressure and blockade against other countries under the pretext of \"spreading democracy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Invasion of sovereign states and \"anti-terrorist war\" are an intensive expression of the viciousness of the U.S. moves for \"spreading democracy\".\r\n It is a habitual method of the U.S. imperialists to surprisingly invade other countries and interfere in their internal affairs while talking about \"democracy\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Korean Peninsula the U.S. is pursuing the most heinous policies of aggression and interference under the pretext of \"spreading democracy\". What is important in the anti-U.S. struggle at present is to shatter the U.S. crafty moves for \"spreading democracy\".     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
