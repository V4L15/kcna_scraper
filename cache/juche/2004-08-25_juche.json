            "content": "U.S. Interference Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of south Korea released a statement on August 20 denouncing the U.S. for its shameless moves to block the inter-Korean economic cooperation, according to the Kuguk Jonson Internet site.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In late July, the U.S. held an \"emergency meeting\" at which it put undisguised pressure upon the south Korean authorities, asserting that the act banning the export of strategic materials to the \"countries listed as sponsors of terrorism\" would be applied to the south Korean enterprises entering the Kaesong industrial zone. This is an unpardonable infringement upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation, interference in its internal affairs and shameless gangsterism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has neither right nor justification to take issue with or hamstring the inter-Korean undertaking pushed forward by Koreans through their concerted wisdom and efforts for the common prosperity and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates once again that the U.S. is a stumbling block lying in the way of achieving inter-Korean unity, cooperation and national reunification, a harasser of peace and an empire of evil as it only brings the danger of war to the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to bar south Korean enterprises from bringing equipment and materials into the zone, not meant for export, by applying the act against the north. Its ulterior aim is to stop the inter-Korean relations from favorably developing in the spirit of \"By the Korean nation itself\" after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration at any cost, save its colonial rule over south Korea from its collapse and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon the people from all walks of life not to tolerate the U.S. shameless and brigandish interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and its moves to bedevil the inter-Korean relations but wage a more vigorous struggle for independence against the U.S. and turn out as one in the work for economic cooperation between the south and the north under the uplifted banner of \"By the Korean nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Terms Bush Fascist Tyrant \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush during his election campaign in Wisconsin State on Aug. 18 hurled malignant slanders and calumnies at the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and groundlessly accused north Korea of steadily developing nukes, while asserting that it is important for the United States to unite with China, Japan, south Korea and Russia and now these five countries are urging the tyrant to disarm himself, according to a Japanese Nihon Keizai Shimbun Internet report.\r\n  This vituperation let loose by Bush against the supreme headquarters of the DPRK has lashed the Korean people into towering hatred and resentment at him and touched off unprecedentedly bitter anti-U.S. sentiment across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the unshakable mettle of the Korean people to take strong counter-actions against anyone hurling slanders and calumnies at the supreme headquarters boundlessly respected and trusted by all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Had Bush have even an iota of elementary reason, morality and ability to judge reality as a human being, he would have not dared defile the political system of his dialogue partner so malignantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bush is, in fact, a thrice-cursed fascist tyrant and man-killer as he revived the fascist war doctrine which had been judged by humankind long ago and is now bringing dark clouds of a new Cold War to hang over our planet and indiscriminately massacring innocent civilians after igniting the Afghan and Iraqi wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the greatest tragedy for the U.S. that Bush, a political idiot and human trash, still remains in the presidential office of the world's only \"superpower,\" styling himself \"an emperor of the world.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In a word, his vituperation discloses his cunning political ploy to mislead the world public opinion and bring down the inviolable political system of the DPRK, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bush said the U.S. was seeking a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue of north Korea in the framework of the six-party talks. This is nothing but a fig-leaf to hide its sinister design to destroy the political system of the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bush's open brigandish demand that the DPRK disarm itself simply reveals the true intention of the U.S. to settle the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue by bringing down the former's system, not through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. is staging even \"Ulji Focus Lens-04\" joint military exercise aimed to unleash a war against the DPRK after massively shipping up-to-date war equipment into south Korea, blustering that a military option has not been completely removed from the table. This clearly indicates that the U.S. option is not dialogue but showdown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now that the U.S. has clearly revealed its true intention, the DPRK can no longer pin any hope on the six-party talks and there is a question as to whether there is any need for it to negotiate with the U. S. any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The option for a stand-off is not a monopoly of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the DPRK's firm resolution and conviction in sure victory to react to confrontation with confrontation and return a preemptive attack with a preemptive strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The reality today makes substantially convinces the army and people of the DPRK that its Songun politics is entirely just. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. foolish attempt to bring the DPRK under its control by force of arms by bringing down its system compels the latter to bolster up its war deterrent both in quality and quantity in order to beat back any aggressor at a single blow.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

They are making quite a noise, alleging that \"a new missile threat\" will be created as north Korea has developed and is deploying new-type ballistic missiles capable of striking at the U.S. mainland and it is going to tip the newly developed missiles with mass destruction weapons including smaller nuclear warheads.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary brands this as a false propaganda devoid of validity and reasonableness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the noisy din of the Bush group over the so-called \"danger\" of the DPRK are sinister political and military purposes, it says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the pretext of this \"danger'\" the U.S. seeks to find an excuse to justify the increase of the war capacities of its forces in the area of Northeast Asia surrounding the Korean peninsula and its military interference there. And the Bush group is scheming in this to create a climate favorable to it in the upcoming presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its moves to build up public opinion over the \"danger\" of the DPRK's arms buildup are a foolish trick to induce the nations participating in the 6-party talks at any cost to sympathize with its argument intended to force the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program and, at the same time, isolate it on the international scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is mistaken. Keen are the eye and ear of fair public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unfeasible and futile are the attempts of the U.S. to make the \"danger\" of the DPRK a fait accompli by setting afloat the rumor about it in the international community and attain its sinister political and military purposes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reunification movement and the military racket, the dialogue and the war drill can not go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military drill is an offspring of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK intended to expand its domination to the northern half of Korea by starting a war against the north through a preemptive attack. It is a test war and preliminary war before the start of a war against the north. It is designed to verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the \"operation plan 5027-04\" through a computer-aided mock drill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So dangerous are the background of the drill and the scheme lurking behind it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must not go unnoticed that the south Korean authorities are joining in the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time to smash the aggression moves of the outside forces, defend the security of the nation and revitalize the reunification movement with the might of national cooperation. The south Korean authorities should immediately stop such anti-national act as joining in the U.S. war drill against the north with independent viewpoint and will of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After terrorizing the Iraqi power with its military club, U.S. is now floundering in slough in face of the rebuff of the resistance forces. If it unleashed a war on the Korean peninsula it could never escape an annihilating retaliatory blow and not a war provocateur could return alive from this land. The U.S. should understand that this warning is not an empty word and discontinue its adventurous play with fire and retract its hostile policy towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
