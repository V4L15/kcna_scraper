He appreciated the exceptionally high zeal of the workers there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people could successfully realize the socialist industrialization in such brief span of time and rapidly augment the nation's economic potential as it was strongly backed by many giant machine plants such as the complex, he noted, adding that this clearly testifies to the validity and tremendous vitality of the WPK's unique line of economic construction on giving priority to the development of heavy industry with machine-building industry as its core while simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the construction site of the gasification process at the Hungnam Fertilizer Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the gasification process before its huge design, he went round the construction site to acquaint himself with the progress made in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly spoke highly of the shining feats performed by the workers of the complex and the builders and their helpers, noting that they not only brought about an eye-opening change in Hungnam but became able to greet the moment soon when they will shout hurrah of victory by waging a tenacious offensive true to the slogan of the Party that the DPRK can do anything when it is determined. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the complex to complete the project earlier than scheduled, saying that the completion of the gasification process at the complex would make it possible not only to establish more solid Juche-oriented system of fertilizer production relying on locally available raw materials but to bring about a signal turn in settling food shortage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for channeling all efforts into winding up the most profitable Juche-based fertilizer production system to complete the project as early as possible and make it possible to mass-produce fertilizers in a short span of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is necessary to finish the gasification project in a brief span of time and, at the same time, speed up the construction of the process for the production of methanol, one of the essential raw materials for chemical industry, in order to bring about a radical change and leaping progress in the development of the nation's chemical industry as required by the new century. And he specified the orientation and ways to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the workers of the complex would bring about a fresh turn in the construction of the gasification process by displaying matchless devotion and popular heroism in socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kwak Pom Gi, chief secretary of the South Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Jang Song Thaek, vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Kyong Hui, Hong Sok Hyong and Thae Jong Su, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
