Paektu is a volcano formed with lava and ejecta which came up several times from late tertiary to quarternary of cenozoic.\r\n   The survey showed that the lava plateau of the mountain appeared after molten lava poured out thirteen times at least and, afterwards, a shield-shape hill was formed. Later,Trachytic lava erupted, forming a cone-shape mountain on the Hill.\r\n   Subsequent extravasations of acid lava made the mountain larger and magnificent, assuming the shape of reed hat.\r\n   The expeditionary team also made clear when and how Jong Il Peak appeared, which had remained unknown.\r\n   The survey proved that the grandiose and wonderful Peak appeared two million years ago with an extravasation of lava.\r\n   As a result of a survey with up-to-date measuring facilities, the relative height of the Peak, 1,797.81 metres above the seal level, is proved to be 216.42 metres, symbolic of the birth date of the respected General Kim Jong Il, February 16, 1942.\r\n   It was also proved in a scientific way that six springs in the Mt. Paektu area stem from lake Chon on the mountain.\r\n   This means that the long Amnok and Tuman rivers flowing in the northern part of Korea embrace streams from the lake."
