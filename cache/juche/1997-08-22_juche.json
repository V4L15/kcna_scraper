After this, he went to the counter of the club and high-handedly asked a salesman to sell a set of ten cassettes worthy of 15 dollars for 12 dollars.\r\n   As the salesman refused, the Russian beat him without reason. To make matters worse, he beat another salesman who tried to stop the violent act, thus breaking one of his cheek teeth.\r\n   The captain of the Russian ship admitted the violence of his crewman and sent a letter of apology to the Songrim Port side.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the Itar-Tass correspondent broadcast false reports about the violence. He tried to conceal the fact by alleging that the boatswain gave 50 dollars to the salesman and salesmen insulted him by crumpling the money and throwing it to him.\r\n   Our side has not yet officially presented any document on damages to the captain of the Russian ship. However, Valiyev spread a false report that our side presented a bill of 40,000 dollars before lowering the amount to 15,000 dollars.\r\n   The case of violence will be handled by a relevant law, not by an impetuous judgement of the Itar-Tass correspondent based on conjecture and forgery.\r\n   In this connection, Valiyev brought disgrace upon himself and Itar-Tass as well.\r\n   He had better bear it in mind that his rude act may have a negative effect on the DPRK-Russian relations and stop an imprudent coverage.\r\n   We urge Valiyev to apologize for his distortion of the fact lest he should be branded as a \"persona non grata\" again.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
