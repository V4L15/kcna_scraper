This proves that the war program against the north is now finishing in a comprehensive and diversified stage.\r\n   We cannot but make an issue of the large-scale military exercises staged by the U.S. with the South Korean authorities when the third round of \"four-way talks\" on ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula is now under way.  \r\n   In the U.S. thinks that it can bring us to our knees or get any concession with  open demonstration of strength or military pressure, it is a ridiculous and dangerous mistake.\r\n  Now that U.S. has thrown away fidelity to its  dialogue partner and the agreement, the army and people of Korea cannot but take a  resolute measure.\r\n   The U.S. and  South Korean authorities should know that they will get nothing but  a merciless  punishment and ruin from their reckless military provocation against the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

The Japanese authorities are, in actuality, carrying into practice their attempts to step up preparations for \"emergency legislative arrangement\" and crack down upon Chongryon-lining Koreans in Japan any time.\r\n   The situation created by the anti-Chongryon campaign is similar to that on the eve of the June 25, 1950 Korean War when the federation of Koreans in Japan was forced to be dissolved.\r\n   We vehemently denounce the frantic anti-Chongryon campaign as hostility against the DPRK.\r\n   The Japanese authorities, far from apologizing and compensating  to the Korean people for their past crimes, are engaging themselves in the brutal suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. This adds to their crimes.\r\n   They should ponder over the ensuing consequences of their frantic suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and stop anti-Chongryon campaign at once.\r\n   If they continue the campaign, ignoring our warnings, they will have to pay dearly for it.\r\n  We will closely watch their future attitude.\r\n   We will also take a decisive retaliatory step, considering any suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan on the part of the Japanese authorities and right-wing reactionaries to be encroachment upon the sovereignty of our republic. \r\n\r\n"
