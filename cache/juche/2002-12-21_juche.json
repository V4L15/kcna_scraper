This was robbery which could be committed only by the U.S. and its followers keen on isolating and stifling the DPRK.\r\n The captain of the DPRK-flagged trading cargo ship Sosan said this at a press conference held aboard the ship on Dec. 17 after entering Mukalla Port in Yemen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the ship was on its voyage in the open sea on Dec. 9, Spanish battleships and planes encircled the ship all of a sudden at the U.S. instigation. They indiscriminately fired guns at equipment of the ship, severely destroying them. Then, two helicopters and a speedboat brought more than 60 commandos on board. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying an engine room and a steering house, they fired thousands of large and small-caliber bullets, thus seriously threatening the lives of crewmen and putting the ship under their complete control. They even kicked sailors and beat them with butts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On that afternoon 18 crewmen of the ship were taken to a Spanish warship and transferred to the U.S. warship later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pirates committed such unimaginable inhuman acts as inhibiting the Koreans from talking and allowing them to go to toilets only under armed pirates' escort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They searched the cabins several times and robbed them of valuables and money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. mobilized a destroyer, a cruiser, an escort ship, a carrier and huge troops to carry out the piracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must apologize for such brazen-faced piracy, own full responsibility for it and make a compensation for the mental and material damage done to the ship and its crewmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the press conference looked round the ship to learn about the damage.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. should behave with discretion, mindful of Koreans' strong criticism of the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula and in other parts of the world.    \r\n\r\n"

The Bush bellicose forces have led nuclear pressure upon the DPRK to a high pitch, bringing the \"nuclear development\" of the DPRK to the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, they are escalating nuclear threat to the DPRK.  The U.S. talking about \"biological and chemical attack\" by \"enemy states\" is sophism to justify its moves to start a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already put forward a proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. if the U.S. has no willingness to launch a war against the DPRK, there is no reason why the U.S. should not accede to the proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, they themselves will be burnt to death in their flame.\r\n\r\n"
