Jangsu, a scenic spot situated on the border of Jaeryong and Sinwon counties in South Hwanghae Province, has undergone a face-lift. The first-stage project for mt. Jangsu pleasure park has recently been completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mountain comprises 12 valleys stretching over four km, namely, a screen of 12 folds formed by queer precipices 50 to 150 metres high in a magnificent yet breathtaking scene. Each valley boasts a crystal-clear cascade with an indented pool beneath, and the foot of the cliffs is garbed in lush pine and maple woods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ancestors called the mountain \"west Kumgang\", or a western version of the celebrated Mt. Kumgang on the east coast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   True to the party and government policy of building it up as a tourist attraction, the provincial officials and builders buckled down and finished the project in a short time despite a series of economic difficulties. By removing 100,000 cubic metres of earth and rocks, they laid out a four-km-long mountain road linking the 12 valleys, improved the Sokdong stream, reinforced the environment of the Jangsusan Revolutionary Site, and built public service amenities, pavilions, a parking lot and the road to the Hyonam Temple. They also built a 25-km-long hiking course, catering and service facilities that saw a removal of another 500,000 cubic metres of earth and rocks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reinforcement was added to such famous places as the \"Kumgang gate\" and \"Satkak cave\" in the first valley, \"Ryongnam pond\" and \"laugh rock\" in the second, \"terrapin rock\" and \"folding-screen rock\" in the third, a 300-year-old tree in the sixth, \"deer-foot pavilion\" in the eight and \"jar rock\" in the 12th, as well as to roads and pavilions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe resort attracts an increasing number of sightseers.

The schools were destroyed by bombing, but children's education continued all the same. Despite the war flames, universal free medical service and other popular state policies were enforced, leaving a lingering impression on the girl. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the war, she finished a medical college and after the war served at the hospital of the Pyongyang University of medicine before she was transferred to the aforesaid preventive hospital where others hesitated to work. She braced hard for the challenge before her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She never flinched from any difficulty even when a case was dismissed as hopeless, for she believed in devotion as a cure-all. Who could tell what great pains she took for checkup, treatment and pharmacy and what a long distance she covered to prepare an appetizing diet for patients    swinging in the rolling years of this preoccupation, she did not notice that her prime of life was passing out. Her blooming youth of romance was forgotten at the sight of beaming faces of the recovered patients who were leaving hospital full of thanks for her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was accustomed to imposing strong demands upon herself, always racing against time with a keen awareness of the need to acquire communist humanity and high professional skill as an engineer of human life. She finished a correspondence course of the Pyongyang University of medicine to hone her professional edge and inquired into new recipes to the benefit of disease prevention and treatment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She makes redoubled efforts to educate the medical workers in the spirit of better service for the people, in the capacity of a deputy director and a deputy to the district people's assembly. She stresses higher competence as a vital task for the doctors and takes a close interest in laying sufficient material and technical foundations of the hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She is now recognized as a veteran talent in disease prevention and treatment. Her scientific diagnosis and her recipes based on experience and skill hold the fancy of professionals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She also plays a major role in promoting cooperation with international health organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She was recently awarded the title of people's doctor. \r\n\r\n"

This is nothing but an impudent intention neither to apologize nor compensate for the crimes committed against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will certainly force Japan to pay dearly for the blood shed by them.  \r\n\r\n"
