Korean girl students under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the recent murder of two schoolgirls by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops is a continuation of the man-hunting committed by them in South Korea without a let-up for scores of years. Driving an armored car over the young girls, killing them, can be perpetrated only by the GIS steeped in the extreme misanthropy and trained in man-hunting.\r\n Recalling that all acts of murder committed by the U.S. imperialists so far have been described as \"accidental\" and \"something done by accidental mistake,\" the commentary blasts the U.S. military authorities present in South Korea for trying to gloss over the recent case as a \"simple traffic accident\" and \"a thing that may possibly happen\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S.-South Korea \"status of forces agreement\" that encourages the U.S. military authorities present in South Korea to do such shameless acts of shifting the responsibility for the murder onto victims just like a thief crying \"stop the thief\". On the strength of this shackling and unequal agreement the U.S. imperialist aggression troops are killing people, robbing them and raping women as they please, lording it over in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. imperialist aggression troops remain in South Korea the South Koreans can neither live in peace even a moment nor escape pain, misfortune and disaster.     \r\n\r\n"
