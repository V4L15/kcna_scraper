            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Command of KPA Large Combined Unit and Unit under It \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, inspected the command of KPA large combined unit 313 and a unit under it standing guard over the eastern sector of the front.\n\t\t\t\t\t He arrived at the unit stationed on the forefront by crossing Chol Pass, a symbol of the country's defense and Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He first inspected KPA unit 894 honored with the title of the O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the monument to the field-guidance of leader Kim Jong Il at the unit, guided by its commanding officers. He then went round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room devoted to the history of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was satisfied to hear the report that the unit was honored with the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment, it produced 60 heroes of the Republic and labor heroes and 30 recipients of National Reunification Prize and 22 companies became hero companies amid profound trust and loving care of the party and the leader. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that this unit, associated with a lot of relics on Kim Jong Il's leadership, has a good tradition shining with many combat exploits, he urged the unit to register signal results in the great war for national reunification in the future to glorify his feats recorded in its history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the office of commanding officers, military research room and other places visited by Kim Jong Il to learn about the unit's combat preparations and readiness to go into action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching with keen attention its plans for operations and battles, he lucidly clarified the important issues to which the unit should direct efforts in combat preparations to cope with the enemies' attempt for a war of aggression and their methods of military actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He taught the unit in detail where it should focus attention in making preparations for battle as it plays an important role in performing the duty of the large combined unit for offensive operations and to which it should direct efforts in order to create combat circumstances favorable for its operation for coping with the tense situation where a war may break out any moment due to the enemies' on-going desperate moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the soldiers' hall, library and other facilities for ideological and cultural education to acquaint himself in detail with the political and ideological education of soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the library he said soldiers should become men of knowledge while preparing themselves as stalwart fighters, adding that to this end they should read many books and acquire rich cultural attainments, writing about their impressions of what they read. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a good method of mental training to read many books and while doing so they would nurture genuine love for the country, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He took deep care of soldiers' living, looking round soldiers' bedrooms, mess hall and daily provision stores of a company directly under the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He encouraged the soldiers of the unit safeguarding the defence line of the socialist country on the forefront from the enemies before having a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he inspected the command of KPA large combined unit 313.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with its servicepersons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was briefed on the monument to the on-the-spot guidance provided by President Kim Il Sung before having a photo taken with lecturer Ri Hye Suk and commanding officers of the large combined unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated for its history. He learned about the proud path covered by the unit; it was honored with immortal field guidance given by the President 38 times and by Kim Jong Il 33 times and it produced 118 heroes and many recipients of orders for military merits during the last Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When he asked the commander of the unit how many heroes were produced by the unit in the post-war period, he was told that it produced 109 heroes. Hearing this, he said this figure is enough to know well about the exploits of the large combined unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased to see the display of the noble title granted to the unit by Kim Jong Il -- the eldest son of the KPA, a standard unit, a unit in which military and political affairs are combined well, a unit he knows well and a unit which does its job well without being known to others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the display of the days of field guidance provided by Kim Jong Il, he said Kim Jong Il clearly indicated a programme for a great war for national reunification and the KPA is sure to triumph if it fights as taught by him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the country was facing a stern trial, Kim Jong Il crossed Chol Pass 18 times to weather it together with the KPA. He crossed it day and night and even at dawn, Kim Jong Un noted, adding that thanks to his forced march the country could be defended and it came to demonstrate the might of Songun Korea with tremendous military capability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recollecting Kim Jong Il who crossed Chol Pass so frequently, he said he considers the front guarded by the soldiers as the yard of his house and he would often visit them, urging them to glorify the so much effort exerted by Kim Jong Il by working hand in hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing his hope that the unit would not forget the trust reposed in it by Kim Jong Il, calling it the unit of the eldest son, prepare itself as a combat unit of tigers of Mt Paektu and creditably perform its duty, he added that he would always remember Chol Pass and that the service personnel of the unit would be in his mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned in detail about the enemy movements in the eastern sector of the front and examined the operational plan of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the enemies are now staging war drills for aggression despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, he recalled that during his inspection of forefront units in the western sector of the front he issued an order to the whole army that if the enemies fire even a single shell on the inviolable territory of the DPRK, it should deal prompt deadly blows at them and go over to a counter-attack, adding that he examined the operational plan of the Supreme Command and finally signed it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When examining the operational plan of the unit, I found it has been worked out in such a way as to go into action immediately in line with the strategic intention of the Supreme Command, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, while examining the operational plan, set right some shortcomings and took relevant measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon receiving the precious teachings from him, the commanding officers of the unit were filled with confidence and courage and earnestly asked him to issue the final order for charge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On his way back after wrapping up his inspection, he visited the monument of a dedicated poem on Chol Pass.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel of the unit made their pledge of loyalty to Kim Jong Un who was on an inspection tour of the front to defend the socialist country from early morning till the hour beyond lunch time that they would reliably stand guard over the eastern sector of the front and once he issues an order, they would bring the theatre of operations in the eastern sector in the south under their control at a breath."

At the same time, they are putting spurs to the preparations for preempting nuclear attacks on other countries any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such acts are quite contrary to the requirements of the international community and pose grave threats to global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Allowance of double standards will only make the international relations biased and complicated, much less contributing to the fair solution to international issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy of double standards existing in international relations and unequal relations caused by it have negative effects on the progress of the disarmament conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries are finding a solution to the progress of the disarmament conference in changing the procedures and regulations of the conference and its work method the keynote of which is the principle of unanimous agreement. The DPRK does not agree with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is convinced that confidence can be built and true political atmosphere for negotiations be created within the disarmament conference only when all countries thoroughly abide by the principle of cooperation, mutual benefits and non-interference in internal affairs of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the issue of forming a negotiation forum outside the conference, the view of the DPRK is that there can never be other forum except the present disarmament conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disarmament conference is the only forum for multilateral negotiations whose mission is to work out internationally recognized disarmament pacts upon authorization of the first special meeting of the UN General Assembly on disarmament in 1978.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing himself of this opportunity, the delegate reaffirmed the DPRK's support for the proposal of non-aligned and other developing countries on the earlier convention of the fourth special meeting of the UN General Assembly on disarmament."

With nothing can it cover up its sinister true colors as a nuclear criminal and chieftain of state-sponsored terrorism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said U.S. attempt is not something that happened long ago because the recently disclosed document called on the U.S. not to completely abandon the use of nuclear materials on the peninsula and but keep open the possibility of furthering the discussion in the future, too. This suggests that the U.S. scheme to turn the peninsula into a wasteland with nuclear materials is in the present tense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The frantic Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises of the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak regime now under way in south Korea are large-scale, most dangerous and provocative drills for mounting a preemptive and comprehensive nuclear attack on the DPRK. The facts go to prove that if the U.S. imperialists find themselves in the danger of facing deadly blows of the DPRK after igniting another Korean war, they may put the plan into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies dare commit provocations against the DPRK, it will give full play to the might of Songun built up for years and force the nuclear criminals to pay a thousand-fold price."

Un.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal Kim Jong Un tomo la iniciativa de celebrar el primer Dia de la Juventud de la nueva centuria del Juche como gran fiesta de todo el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstuvieron

PTC enviado a los participantes en el acto por el Dia de la Juventud y otros jovenes de todo el pais estando en el frente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl escuchar el citado mensaje enviado por el Mariscal, los participantes lo aclamaron con estruendosas \"Vivas\" y efusivos aplausos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn representacion de los militares del Ejercito Popular de Corea, intervino el suboficial Kim Hyon Hyok quien senalo que el mensaje de felicitacion del Mariscal deviene la bandera de victoria que estimula a los jovenes, levantados gigantescamente en la defensa de la patria y la construccion de Estado prospero, a la creacion de nuevas proezas y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un allano la nueva epoca de desarrollo de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias con su extraordinaria perspicacia militar, destacado arte de mando militar, caracter de acero y noble companerismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los soldados integraran la avanzada en la gran guerra por la reunificacion de la patria, que marchara adelante apuntando los fusiles unicamente a la direccion senalada por el Comandante Supremo, y seran los combatientes indoblegables y jovenes heroes que se lanzaran contra la posicion enemiga gritando \"!Viva el Mariscal Kim Jong Un!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos lanzan una sola bala a las aguas y zonas jurisdiccionales de la patria, no perderan esa oportunidad de oro y reduciran de un aliento a cenizas todos los nidos de los enemigos con el fuego de represalia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn representacion de jovenes trabajadores, el Heroe del Trabajo Ju Myong Gil, obrero del Complenjo de Abono de Hungnam, destaco que las vanguardistas juveniles avanzaran con pasos firmes tocando fuertemente la trompeta y tambor de la gran marcha de la juventud hacia la victoria final de la construccion de Estado prospero, orientandose segun las tareas combativas presentadas en el mensaje, y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesplegaremos una ofensiva en la produccion manteniendonos en el maximo estado de movilizacion al tomar los fusiles en una mano y los martillos en la otra y nos movilizaremos en la guerra pannacional integrando las tropas de jovenes trabajadores si los enemigos se atreven a lanzar una sola bala a nuestro territorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conductora de tractor de la Granja Cooperativa de Pom-an del distrito de Sohung, Ri Un Jong, representante de agricultores jovenes, puntualizo que los vanguardistas juveniles de la rama agricola  desempenaran un papel importante en llenar el granero del pais trabajando con el patriotismo de         Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcoto que desplegaran la sagrada guerra de exterminio a los enemigos en la misma trinchera de los soldados del EPC para defender la patria si llega el tiempo de combate de vida o muerte y enviaran muchas provisiones al frente mediante el aumento de produccion de cereales en el tiempo de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl estudiante de la Universidad Kim Il Sung, Kim Chung Il, hablo en representacion del estudiantado destacando la necesidad de armarse cabalmente con la idea del partido en acato al gran proposito del Mariscal y aprender con mucho afan por la patria para prepararse como constructores y personal revolucionario encargado de construir un Estado prospero socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecalco que los estudiantes acudiran al frente y exterminaran despiadadamente a los enemigos tomando el fusil en sustitucion a la pluma si el imperialismo yanqui y la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak se atreven a abrir el primer fuego en el territorio patrio y cumpliran sin falta la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria."
