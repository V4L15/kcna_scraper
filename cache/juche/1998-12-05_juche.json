Paektu, as the Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armed forces, the Korean people have defended and exalted Korean socialism centred on the people under his guidance with an iron faith and will and with firm conviction of victory.\r\n   Whenever grim obstacles have cropped up in the way of our country, they have courageously overthrown them without any  slightest vacillation and brought about great successes in socialist construction, frustrating ill-intentioned moves of the enemy. this is their tradition and intrinsic stamina.\r\n   Now is the rigorous time for all the Korean people to resolutely frustrate the challenge of the U.S. imperialists by means of making a revolutionary upswing in socialist construction, further exalting this glorious tradition. It is their mode of struggle to answer counterrevolutionary offensives of the enemy with revolutionary offensives and war of aggression with a revolutionary war, and bring about an advance in socialist construction, always keeping themselves alert and ready.\r\n   Under the present grim situation, all the officials and working people should have the steadfast faith and determination and press ahead with the forced march of socialism for final victory in a more keyed-up attitude than ever before, holding rifles in one hand and hammers and sickles in the other and thus bring about a new great revolutionary upsurge on all fronts of socialist construction. \r\n\r\n"
