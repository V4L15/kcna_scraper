And they plan to stage the largest-ever naval joint military drill of their nuclear carrier strike groups from early June with introduction of another nuclear carrier Ronald Reagan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a dangerous military action driving the acute situation of the Korean peninsula to the point of explosion, an indication that the U.S. and south Korean warmongers' scheme for invasion of the north has reached to the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. bluffed that the drill would display the strong will to deter the possible military provocation from the DPRK. This shows that its talk about \"dialogue\" is nothing but deception and that the ambition of the aggressors for a nuclear war against the DPRK has remained unchanged. Earlier, the U.S. said that it has no intent to invade and replace the regime in the north but will guarantee its system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clouds of a nuclear war are hanging heavily above the Korean nation owing to the reckless war drills staged one after another in the sky, land and sea of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., together with south Korea, had conducted the joint military exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 17 across south Korea for more than 60 days from March 1, with large nuclear strategic assets, including the above-said nuclear power carriers, and more than 300,000 aggressor troops involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is busy mulling to form a special task brigade for \"beheading operation\" in contingency within this year, after deploying Apache attack copter unit of the U.S. forces in south Korea in the hotspot waters in the West Sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching a flock of birds flying towards the south, the south Korean puppet forces fired hundreds of machine gun bullets into the DPRK side, claiming they spotted \"unidentified flying object crossing the Military Demarcation Line\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean warmongers should stop the reckless acts aggravating the situation, mindful that they would bring only final destruction to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. advertises that a nuclear powered carrier strike group is capable of carrying out a whole war. Its scheme for joint military exercises with such two strike groups involved will only make the DPRK's nuclear weapons target the mainland of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will remain unperturbed even in the face of all the U.S. nuclear strategic assets coming to attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The American-style bluff is no longer workable."

It remains like a dagger stabbed in the chest of the nation for its original purport and reactionary nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2014, Park set up the \"Committee\" as a panel directly under the control of \"president\" while crying out for \"getting ready for unification\" and \"good chance for unification\" in pursuance of her ambition for \"unification through absorption\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The formation of the \"Committee\" was for realizing the ambition for \"unification by prevailing over communism\", touted by her father \"yusin\" dictator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor, buoyed by the dream of \"unification through absorption\", went desperate to work out the policies for escalating stand-off between social systems after setting up the body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"second framed work for developing south-north ties\" was confirmed, totally scrapping the issues which were stipulated in the October 4 declaration and the north and the south agreed to implement, typically the issue of setting up the special zone for peace and cooperation in West Sea, the issue of ending the current armistice system and building lasting peace mechanism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not satisfied with the total denial of the north-south declarations, Park let the distorted segment of north-south summit minutes go public. She raked up human scum-like defectors from the north to malignantly slander the dignity and social system of the DPRK and stage anti-DPRK human rights smear campaign. She called for confrontation with the north abroad while harshly cracking down the forces supporting the June 15 declaration as part of her stepped-up racket for eliminating the \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bound by the spell of the ghost-like shaman that \"unification will come within a few years\", she trumpeted about \"blueprint of peaceful reunification\" and unsparingly shut down the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a product of the June 15 era that had barely been maintained.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive south Korean conservative forces were all hell-bent on escalating confrontation with the north but never have there been such anti-reunification traitors like Park Geun Hye group which went desperate even by setting up \"team for unification through absorption\" involving those in authority, in political circle and non-government field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As differing ideologies and systems have existed for long in the north and the south, attempt at achieving \"unification of social systems\" and \"unification through absorption\" by way of extending the system of one party into the other party will only bring conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous wish of the Koreans that the \"Preparatory Committee\" has to be removed just like its inventor sternly punished by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is never a matter of sign. Deposit will give harm to people and surroundings if it is not cleaned in time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those keen on prolonging the confrontation policy of Park Geun Hye group will meet the same miserable fate as their predecessors."
