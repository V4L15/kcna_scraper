They have made progress in the efforts to reunify the country on the principle of \"one country, two systems.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are sincerely rejoiced as over our own over all the successes gained by the Chinese comrades and wholeheartedly wish the Chinese people and army greater success in their future efforts for socialist construction and increased defence capabilities of the country. The DPRK-China friendship, which is based on the revolutionary obligation and close relations between the leaders of the old generation of the two countries and withstood the trials of long history, has demonstrated its might and vitality to the full and entered a new phase of development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il visited China in May, which marked an epoch-making event in putting the friendly relations between the two countries on a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable stand of the worker's party, the army and people of Korea to strengthen and develop the DPRK-China friendship generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will in the future, too, make every possible effort to strengthen the DPRK-China friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his speech Colonel General Chi Haotian, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the People's Republic of China, State Councilor and Minister of National Defence, who is leading the delegation said he was much pleased that the high-level military delegation is on an official good-will visit to the DPRK to participate in events to be held in the DPRK to mark the 50th anniversary of the entry of the Chinese people's volunteers into the Korean front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditional relations of friendship between the DPRK and China have been consolidated and developed day by day under the care of chairman Mao Zedong, premier Zhou Enlai, Deng Xiaoping and President Kim Il Sung and other leaders of the old generation of the two countries, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May General Secretary Kim Jong Il visited China and shared with general secretary Jiang Zemin important views on further developing the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the DPRK and some time ago general secretary Jiang Zemin was present on invitation at a banquet given at the DPRK embassy in Beijing to mark the 55th anniversary of the WPK. All this marked great events in the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegation's current visit to the DPRK is aimed at implementing the points agreed upon between the leaders of the two countries and further consolidating and developing the friendly and cooperative relations between China and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the delegation would make all efforts to steadily develop the relations together with the Korean comrades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite the complicated international situation in recent years and years of natural disasters the WPK led by general secretary Kim Jong Il has advanced along the road of socialism pioneered by President Kim Il Sung, pulling through difficulties, and gained greater fresh successes in socialist construction, the efforts to improve inter-Korean relations and diplomatic affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed great satisfaction over the successes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the reception on invitation were members of the delegation, Chinese ambassador to the DPRK Wang Guozhang, military attache of the Chinese embassy Yan Jiangfeng and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present were vice-Minister Ryo Chun Sok of the People's Armed Forces, Colonel General Ri Pyong Sam and Lieut.
