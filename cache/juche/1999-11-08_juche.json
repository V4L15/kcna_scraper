It was thanks to the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Il that the Korean people could have strong faith and will and defend the dignity of Korea of Juche by decisively foiling the moves of the U.S.-led imperialists to stifle and isolate the DPRK, he adds, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The single-hearted unity of the Korean people achieved in the latter half of the 20th century and the history of creation and changes in the socio-economic field which have changed the appearance of modern Korea beyond recognition  are closely associated with the august name of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is a rare great man and the greatest commander in the world who enriched the political history of humankind  through his outstanding ideological and theoretical activities and with his prominent leadership and noblest virtue and brilliantly decorated the 20th century with Korean-style socialism. \r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, it seeks to hurl more sophisticated operational equipment including nuclear weapons and aggression forces into there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is trying to justify its arms buildup in Japan by spreading the theory of \"threat\" from the DPRK and calm down the anti-U.S., anti-war spirit daily mounting among the Japanese people and get Japan more deeply involved in the execution of its policy of aggression by creating the impression that the DPRK poses a \"threat\" to the security of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Diplomatic and security policies concerning biological and chemical weapons of North Korea\" peddled by the U.S. bellicose forces are nothing but a sinister plot to deploy more biological and chemical weapons along with nukes for a new Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. loudmouthed peace on the Korean peninsula and improved relations are no more than rhetoric. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. continues to behave as now, it will be impossible to avoid a war, much less defusing the tensions on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its bellicose forces are well advised to ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the policy of stifling the DPRK and behave properly. \r\n\r\n"
