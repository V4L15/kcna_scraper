Korea under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today in a signed commentary dismisses the U.S. imperialists' moves to reorganize the units of the u.s. forces in South Korea and newly build and expand various military installations as a wanton challenge and insult to the Korean nation demanding their withdrawal from South Korea.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are now staging such farces as closing or integrating U.S. bases in South Korea as a gesture of doing something good for the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, nothing but moves to calm down the voices of the Korean people demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea and retain their firm grip on South Korea as their permanent military base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unchangeable ambition of the u.s. imperialists to swallow up the whole of Korea by force of arms to realize their world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is made up of warmongers. Right after it came to power it designated the DPRK as its \"no.1 enemy\" and has since clamoured about the so-called \"nuclear issue,\" \"missile issue\" and the \"issue of cutdown of conventional armed forces\" in a bid to disarm the DPRK and seize it with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. imperialists keep their aggression forces in South Korea and persist in their moves to start a war against the north, the Korean peninsula cannot be free from the danger of war and its independent and peaceful reunification is hardly achievable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will further intensify the struggle to force the U.S. forces to withdraw from South Korea because the U.S. imperialists are keen to use South Korea as their permanent base for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wishes peace and security in northeast Asia and the rest of the world, they should drop its hardline and hostile policy towards the DPRK and opt for pulling its forces out of South Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
