Therefore, the DPRK has been consistently opposed to all forms of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are opposed to terrorism with a view to promoting world peace and stability, defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and protecting the lives and properties of the people. The way of combating terrorism should conform with this purpose. on the contrary, the use of armed forces and the method of war murdering guiltless people or disturbing regional peace and stability cannot be justified in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a few elements who committed terrorism. The absolute majority of people have nothing to do with it. Accordingly, guiltless civilians should not fall victim to the anti-terrorist operations. Extending the military action to other countries allegedly to eradicate the root cause of terrorism is contrary to the purpose of the anti-terrorist struggle and it may rather cause grave consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respecting sovereignty is the best way of preventing terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the countries and nations observe the principle of respecting sovereignty, sound state-to-state relations and international orders can be established and, furthermore, all forms of terrorism and military conflicts terminated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is doing what it should do against terrorism with a view to defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and the lives and properties and security of the people and ensuring peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is seriously threatening our sovereignty and security by pursuing a hostile policy toward the DPRK while keeping it on the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" without any foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present developments clearly prove how just our measure to increase the defence power for self-defence was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people, ready to cope with any situation, will mete out a merciless punishment to those who do harm to the sovereignty and security of our country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are following the developments with heightened vigilance so as to cope with them in time.    \r\n\r\n"

He said the problem of carriage would be solved if the bucket was enlarged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Afterwards the truck's bucket capacity increased to 2 tons from 800 kg. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, 20 trucks were capable of carrying the load to be done by 50 trucks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened right after Ri Po Ik, grandmother of the president, passed away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials agreed to give to the press an obituary of Ri Po Ik and accord a public funeral to her for she dedicated all her descendents to the revolution and remained true to her firm constancy and devoted herself to it all her life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Informed of this, the president said that even his grandmother should not be made an exception in abiding by the state rules. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advised the officials repeatedly making requests to draw a clear distinction between the public and private affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So a simple funeral service was held by her family and relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in November, Juche 35 (1946), general Kim Il Sung dropped in at a farmer's house during his field guidance to South Phyongan Province and had a lunch there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before leaving the house, he asked his aide whether he paid for the noodle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aide said that he left for the journey in such a great hurry that he forgot to take money with him and he would certainly pay for it later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On hearing this, the general told him to drive the car and bring money while he would be waiting for him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the aide was about to pay for the lunch after covering tens of km, the farmer refused to receive the money, saying how he could receive money from the general. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the general said that he should also pay for the lunch as he was one of those serving the people. He got on the car only after seeing the farmer to receive the money. \r\n\r\n"
