This was aimed to sell anti-aircraft system aegis to South Korea in a bid to bring profits to munition monopolies of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the domestic and foreign policies of the United States are meant to meet the interests of these monopolies. The U.S. administration is, in fact, no more than a political puppet manipulated by them. The U.S. rulers can play a major role in politics only when they tickle the fancy of the munition monopolies and if not, they are forced to step down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration and munition monopolies stoop to any infamy to meet their bilateral interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ruling quarters make no scruple of listing other countries as \"rogue states\", \"sponsors of terrorism\" and members of the \"axis of evil\", deliberately sparking regional crisis and aggravating the international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now persistently floating the fiction about the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is aimed to egg the South Korean war hawks on to pursue confrontation with the north in a bid to escalate the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and justify its massive sale of such military hardware as anti-aircraft system aegis to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sale of ultra-modern arms and equipment to South Korea is nothing but a criminal act of unhesitatingly bringing a scourge of war to the Korean Peninsula to meet its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that the DPRK is making sustained big efforts to increase the capacity for self-defence while tightening its belt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is to blame for this.\r\n\r\n"
