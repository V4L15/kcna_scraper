            "content": "GNP to Chiefly Blame for Jong Mong Hon's Death \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee released a statement on august 4 as regards the sudden death of Jong Mong Hon, chairman of Hyundai Asan of south Korea.\r\n Recalling that Jong Mong Hon left inerasable marks in the history of the reunification movement of the Korean nation through non-governmental cooperation in various fields including tour of Mt. Kumgang as a pioneer of the inter-Korean cooperation, the statement said that his death, in fact, can not be regarded as a suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was murder committed by the sword called \"special inspection\" illegally engineered by the Grand National Party of south Korea displeased with the development of the inter-Korean relations, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly denounce the GNP in the name of the whole Korean nation for such political murder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The murder of the man who started the tour of Mt. Kumgang, a symbol of the inter-Korean cooperation, put the cooperation projects between the north and the south including the tour of Mt. Kumgang at an unpredictable peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is chiefly to blame for his death as it has challenged the development of inter-Korean relations with the \"special inspection\" and it should, therefore, apologize to the nation for its irrevocable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jong Mong Hon, who worked so hard to show Mt. Kumgang, the famous mountain of the nation, to the south Korean brothers and sisters is no longer with them to our sorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels us to suspend the tour of Mt. Kumgang for a certain period including the mourning period with profound grief over his death, we think. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There may be painful sacrifices and difficulties on the road of national reconciliation and unity, cooperation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing, however, can stop our dynamic advance to achieve the reunification of the country and the prosperity common to the nation by the concerted efforts of the nation under the uplifted banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Remarks of Japanese War Servants Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- Of late, the vice-minister of foreign affairs of Japan pulled up the DPRK, making reckless remarks that the \"counter-measures\" including economic sanctions should be discussed at the UNSC. In the meantime, the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan is becoming increasingly assertive for adopting so-called the \"provisions of a law on foreign trade\" whose main target is to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the Japanese reactionaries' much touted \"economic sanctions\" against the DPRK have entered a phase of full implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., taking the \"war on terrorism\" as a good opportunity, is keen to use Japan as a faithful servant for executing its policy to put pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue as it is going frantic in its moves for overseas expansion and militarization. Meanwhile, the Japanese reactionaries seek to get a big reward for acting a coachman for the U.S., its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to fish in troubled waters while acting a shock brigade in carrying out the U.S. offensive to put pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue. But this is nothing but a pipe dream. The people of the DPRK are neither surprised nor deterred by the racket kicked up by Japan to woo the UNSC to take \"counter-measures\" and adopt \"provisions on a law on foreign trade.\" The DPRK government has already served a strong warning that it would regard any sanctions and blockade against it as a war action. The army and the people of the DPRK will strongly retaliate against enemies when they have judged that the vital rights and the sovereignty of the DPRK are infringed upon even a bit by the \"blockade operation\" and economic sanctions.    \r\n\r\n"

It demanded the U.S. imperialists immediately abandon their hostile policy toward the DPRK and give up the \"operation plan 5030\" at once.

The power of the DPRK will demonstrate its might as a powerful weapon in accomplishing the cause of Songun, they declare.\r\n An editorial of Rodong Sinmun says that the elections displayed to the full the might of single-hearted unity of the whole party, the entire army and all people around the leadership of the revolution, provided a still firmer guarantee for  remarkably raising the functions and role of our peculiar socialist power, the embodiment of the Songun idea, and powerfully demonstrated the unbreakable will of the Korean army and people to defend the Korean-style socialist system to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic duty of the people's power of the DPRK to steadfastly uphold the Songun idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imbuing the whole society with the Songun revolutionary idea of Kim Jong Il should be regarded as the general task in building the power and in its activities. The single-hearted unity of the whole party, the entire army and all people based on the spirit of devotedly defending the leadership of the revolution, the banner of great victory in the Songun era, should be further consolidated like an impregnable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal exploits performed by Kim Jong Il in strengthening and developing the power of our republic into an invincible power of Songun revolution should be staunchly defended and glorified endlessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work for increasing the potential of the country in every way should be carried on with greater vigor. Today when the imperialists are becoming more undisguised in their strong-arm policy and arbitrariness, this work is itself a fierce anti-imperialist confrontation and an acute class struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible might of the army is the first and foremost national might of our republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything necessary for strengthening self-reliant defences of the nation must be provided preferentially and the whole country be continuously fortified like an impregnable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The future of the power of our republic is sure to be always bright as we have the Songun revolutionary leadership of  Kim Jong Il and the invincible revolutionary armed forces and single-hearted unity, states the editorial.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on DPRK-U.S. Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in a statement released on August 1 referred to the DPRK's new proposal for starting the six-party talks and holding the bilateral talks within their framework to discuss the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. \r\n It is a reflection of the DPRK's sincere and patient efforts to peacefully settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is gratifying that the countries concerned and the world public unanimously welcomed the DPRK's principled and fair proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has deliberately sidestepped a peaceful negotiated settlement of the issue while insisting on the absurd assertion that \"north Korea should scrap its nuclear program before dialogue\" and raising such secondary issues as format of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This created a serious hurdle in the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and pushed the nuclear stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. to an extreme pitch of tension. As a result, the situation has led to such a dangerous phase that a war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new format of dialogue has been decided upon thanks to the DPRK's magnanimity and bold decision to remove the danger of a war from the Korean peninsula and peacefully settle the nuclear issue. So, everything depends on the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, what is essential for settling the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, is whether the U.S. has a bold intention to make a switchover in its policy to stifle the DPRK and a firm political will to prove it in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue would be unthinkable without the U.S. switchover in its policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regretfully, our analysis of the U.S. attitude showed that it has only escalated its diplomatic attempts to form an \"international alliance\" for pressure and blockade against the DPRK and military moves for a preemptive attack on it, instead of making sincere efforts to solve the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Persistent efforts of the U.S. to escalate its hostile policy toward the DPRK would only stoke the DPRK's distrust and resistance against the U.S. then the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue will never find a solution even if talks are held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. launched an unjust war of aggression against Iraq, defying the unanimous protest and opposition of the international community, disregarding the un and grossly violating the universally recognized international law. This offered a convincing proof that the DPRK was entirely right when it has increased its self-reliant defence power under the great banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A long dream predicts an unlucky thing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its delusion based on self-righteousness and arrogance at an early date and face up to the reality. \r\n How to open talks, how they will discuss issues and what results they will achieve will entirely depend on the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK or not will be a touchstone deciding on the outcome of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ball is in the U.S. court. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the U.S. attitude before the talks.    \r\n\r\n"

In a nutshell, they seek to \"bring it down\" by a war as they did the Saddam Hussein regime and occupied Iraq by a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. finds itself in a difficult position after sustaining setbacks and getting worn out in face of the DPRK. The U.S. imperialists, however, are making desperate efforts to overthrow the DPRK at any cost. This is the aim of their \"operation plan 5030\", the finalized war scenario to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politico-ideological and economic and military power of the DPRK is incomparably stronger than what was in the period of the last Korean War. They should clearly understand this and stop at once their reckless moves to put the plan into practice.  \r\n\r\n"
