This is a window dressing to justify their deployment in South Korea and misrepresent and hide their aggressive nature and mission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main purpose of the shift and deployment of their huge aggressor forces in South Korea is to increase the military tension on the Korean Peninsula and provoke a new Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unchangeable policy of the U.S. and the core of its aggressive Asia-Pacific strategy to provoke a Korean War and stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war greatly jeopardize peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula But in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. A \"threat of terrorism\" to the Korean Peninsula and other Asia-Pacific regions is coming from the U.S. it is a brigandish logic for them to clamour about the \"threat of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to know well who is its rival before contemplating about an attack on the DPRK. There is no limit to the DPRK's striking power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better act with discretion, facing up to the trend on the Korean Peninsula and that of the international community towards reconciliation, cooperation and peace. This will do the U.S. good either.     \r\n\r\n"

People, therefore, can never escape a war as long as imperialism exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists become more furious if someone yields to their use of armed forces or steps backward, afraid of it. When they see someone standing back a step, they force him to take ten or a hundred steps back. Any concession to the imperialist aggressors leads to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should fight the aggressors in do-or-die spirit. When the people of all the progressive countries fight the imperialist aggressor forces in unity, instead of struggling separately, they can display tremendous might and the imperialists will not be able to run amuck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The global peace can be defended and the sovereignty of every country guaranteed only when the progressive countries of the world possess strong military power for self-defence to turn out in a courageous fight against the imperialists' aggression and war, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the people of all the progressive countries of the world actively turn out in the struggle against the imperialist aggressor forces, they will be able to check and frustrate their policy of aggression and war and strategy of domination and bring earlier the building of a new peaceful and independent world.    \r\n\r\n"
