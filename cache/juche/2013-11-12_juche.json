Park likes to speak ill of compatriots in foreign countries, forgetful of \"presidency.\" She looks like a meddlesome countrywoman fond of backbiting others, lost to shame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, she changed her dress several times a day and made flattery towards others, uttering some words in their languages like a parrot.
