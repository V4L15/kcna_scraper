Korea protested \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- Kim Hyong Ju, chairman of the general student council of Chonnam National University who is concurrently temporary chairman of the tenth-term South Korean Federation of University Student Councils, reportedly published an article addressed to one million students on Feb. 9 protesting against U.S. President Bush's projected trip to South Korea.\r\n Such junket of bush keen to bring a scourge of war to Korea again, clamouring about \"axis of evil\", will evidently cause misfortune and sufferings to the Korean nation, the article said, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. threat of war to the North of Korea is just a threat to the Korean peninsula as a whole including the south and it is prompted by its brigandish aim to deliberately torpedo the march of the nation advancing toward unity and independent reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. This betrays the U.S. dark intention to ignite a war at any cost in a bid to dominate Korea forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today we students, heirs to the tradition of the South Korean student movement conducted defying imprisonment and death, should respond to the call of the nation with struggle and prevent with wrath the boss of the U.S. imperialists from setting foot on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Renewing the determination to check Bush's junket and demonstrate the strength of the federation and the stamina of the nation, the article called upon one million students to turn out in the struggle to bar such trip by their concerted efforts. \r\n\r\n"

Then, is this paper not qualified to judge the reactionary nature of the argument about an \"axis of evil\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such dishonest diatribe made by the newspaper against sovereign states reflected the political interests of the United States. This is an unpardonable crime as it gave fuel to the Bush administration's war moves to escalate the \"anti-terrorism operations\" worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries are now becoming increasingly critical of Bush's remarks about an \"axis of evil\" intended to attain the U.S. aim to contain the DPRK by \"strength\" and dominate the world with the Korean peninsula as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Washington Post should stop such reckless diatribe swimming against the trend of the times and ponder over its attitude toward other sovereign states. \r\n\r\n"

It is the stand of the people's army and people of Korea that the earth can never exist without the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has strong pluck and war methods and means enough to achieve victory in any form of war against any formidable enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's assertion about the \"axis of evil\" is bound to go bankrupt in face of the DPRK's might and war methods and the U.S. imperialist aggressors will certainly meet a miserable end in Korea. \r\n\r\n"

It reflects the desire of the 70 million countrymen for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its width is 61.5 meters, symbolic of June 15, Juche 89 (2000), a landmark day for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On both sides of the monument there are four display rooms for more than 740 stones donated by Koreans in the north and the south and overseas. The stone gate to them is three tons in weight and a medal of national reunification is engraved on its central part. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On a spacious compound of the edifice there is a monument to the proposition for national reunification written by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The edifice covers a total area of over 100,000 square meters. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

An official asked him to have more rest as he sat up. He told the official that he takes a short sleep on the back seat when he gets drowsy doing a mountain of work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the short and uncomfortable sleep is a sweet one which sleeps off one's fatigue in the main, adding that he likes the short and uncomfortable sleep best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More often than not he had rice balls as his meals on the way of his field-guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a meal time he made sure that a rice ball stuffed with dried radish, pickled cucumber and pacific sand launce was distributed to everyone who accompanied him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asking officials how it tasted, he used to say that the rice ball was best for a long journey as it is easy and takes little time to prepare the food and cause no trouble to officials and villagers in local areas. He has always taken rice balls with pleasure, saying that they are ideal meals for revolutionaries during their trips. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about his simplicity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was one night in mid-December last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An official was surprised to see an unusual scene. Kim Jong Il was seated on an office chair at the entrance of his lodging to have his hair cut because he was working day and night, while providing ceaseless field guidance. The official asked him why he was having a haircut on an inconvenient seat late at night. He told the official that he could not spare time for the haircut as he was expected to go to meet workers early in next morning, adding that he was fond of field life. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
