            "content": "R.S. on remarks of colonial stooge\r\n   Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- A short while ago, the south Korean puppet Foreign Minister, when giving a lecture on \"orientation of diplomatic policy\", cried for \"isolation\" of the northern half of Korea and \"inter-Korean dialogue\" and spoke ill of the efforts for the improved relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the DPRK and Japan. \r\n    Rodong Sinmun today brands his remarks as the complaints of a colonial stooge who is ignorant of the trend of the times.\r\n   The news analyst goes on:\r\n   It is the height of impudence for him to cry for \"isolation\" of the northern half of Korea. He is not entitled to do so.\r\n   For Kim Young Sam forsaken by his masters, the U.S. and Japan, to cry for \"isolation\" is as good as shaking his fists at the sky.\r\n   The call for \"inter-Korean dialogue\" is also nonsense.\r\n   With any honeyed words, the Kim Young Sam regime cannot flee from the responsibility for its crimes in bringing inter-Korean dialogue to a rupture and in laying a stumbling-block in the way of national reunification.\r\n   In talking about \"inter-Korean dialogue\", grounlessly slandering the northern half of Korea, the puppets seek to cast a shadow over the zeal for the improvement of relations between the DPRK and the U.S., between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   The puppets had better stop acting rashly and mind their own business.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
