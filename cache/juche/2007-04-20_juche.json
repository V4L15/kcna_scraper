It was also attended by some chief nationalists who regarded anti-communism as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just before the conference, they regarded the socialists as arch enemy and committed terrorism against them. For their unsavory past and differences in political view they, with distrust, hesitated to come to Pyongyang and expressed enmity even at the conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moved by the President's noble patriotic idea on checking the division of the country and building a reunified country through the great national unity transcending the differences in ideology and political opinion, they fully supported his policy of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were charmed by broad-minded magnanimity, lofty virtue and open-minded and modest trait of the President, who stood them in the van of the struggle for the sacred cause of national reunification without asking their past. They lauded that he was the very one to be followed and respected by the entire nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Ku, an obstinate chief nationalist and a leading figure on the south Korean political arena, experienced that religionists and brothers and sisters and children of nationalists who had persecuted socialists were active at important posts of public organizations and government bodies during his stay in Pyongyang.  He also pledged himself to follow the lofty idea of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the conference, Kim Ku, Kim Kyu Sik and other figures led the patriotic and democratic forces in south Korea in the vigorous struggle against the ruinous May 10 separate election and made a great contribution to successfully holding the nation-wide general election for establishing the unified central government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint conference showed that the political parties and public organizations with different political view and class stand could be united on the basis of the idea common to the nation and could hold in check the division of the nation and reunify the country in an independent and peaceful way.  The conference takes a brilliant page in the history of the united front movement and still inspires all the fellow countrymen to the sacred cause of reunification.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Denounced for Disturbing 6-Party Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Japan, making much ado about the \"abduction issue\" which does not deserve a passing note, has no job to do at the 6-party talks, declares a Rodong Sinmun analyst Thursday, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the talks get rid of such filibuster as Japan, a favorable atmosphere for the talks will be created and the implementation of the agreement will run on oiled wheels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Japan is persistently bringing forward quite an irrelevant issue which has nothing to do with the 6-party talks, the analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is because it has a sinister intention to obstruct the implementation of the February 13 agreement and, furthermore, derail the 6-party talks at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Japan's approach to the dialogue and real intention to lay obstacles in the way of the 6-party talks and curb the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. By doing so, the Japanese reactionaries seek to invent a pretext for the nuclear armament of Japan and gratify their ambition for the building of a military power and overseas aggression. For this very purpose Japan obstinately denies its past crimes including the issue of the \"comfort women\" forcibly recruited for the imperial Japanese army and tries to bury them in the limbo of historic oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely attributable to the unreasonable and shameless obstructions of Japan that the implementation of the February 13 agreement has come up against a snag and the 6-party talks fail to make a progress. Japan is the very one which is forcing the talks to mark time and even back down, not making progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan keeps distorting and denying its past crimes and hindering the progress of the talks, kicking up dust over an issue which has nothing to do with the talks, it will put itself to a greater shame on the international scene and may be driven out of the talks in the long run.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
