            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on danger of U.S. \"TMD\" plan \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- We will continue to increase the country's national defence capabilities in every way to cope with any military offensive of the enemy as the DPRK is made the first target of the U.S. \"Theatre Missile Defense\" (TMD) system. \r\n   This statement was made by a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry, answering the question put by KCNA today as regards the position taken by the French authorities recently against the U.S. \"TMD\" plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He told KCNA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some time ago, French President Chirac declared that he rejected the U.S. \"TMD\" plan as it would spark a new strategic nuclear arms race in East Asia, and the French Foreign Minister in his letter to the U.S. State Secretary also expressed his deep apprehension that the plan would bring only instability to the far east as it was a \"ghost of a new cold war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This fully shows that the \"TMD\" plan pursued by the United States together with Japan is denounced and rejected by European countries as well as Asian countries for its great danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In actuality, the U.S. moves to develop and deploy the \"TMD\" system in northeast Asia are very reckless, dangerous criminal acts which may seriously upset the balance of forces and revive a new arms race and a second cold war in this region and thus drive world peace and security to a grave crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the United States is trying to put spurs to the development of the \"TMD\" system by inveigling Japan into it and including South Korea and Taiwan, to say nothing of Japan, in the main target of its deployment in a bid to contain the surrounding countries with \"an edge in strength\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  The U.S. Persistent hue and cry over \"missile threat\" from the DPRK is nothing but a deceptive trick to justify the moves to develop their \"TMD\" system.    \r\n \r\n"

Experts are now busy working out designs for power stations with an estimated capacity of billions of kilowatt-hour of electricity.\r\n   The River Taedong flowing down the western part of the country is one of the five long rivers in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The utility rate and scope of the river are enormous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The River Taedong was known to be the pronoun of disasters and sufferings before the liberation. But it has turned into a river of bliss under the long-term gigantic nature-remaking plan of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are powerful economic complexes along the river. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The river has the biggest share of the nation's hydro power resources. Various types of hydro power stations have been built along the river regardless of swift current and water head to make the best use of its water resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Much electricity is now being produced from the West Sea Barrage Power Station built in the area very close to the West Sea, which has no water head, the large-scale united Taedonggang Hydro-Electric Power Station built on the upper reaches of the river with swift current and high water head and from the Mirim, Ponghwa, Songchon and Sunchon and other lock gate power stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The construction of the Samdung Power Station and the Sangwon Kunmin Power Station has been completed recently to start production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many power stations are now under construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Mandal, Kumok, Hyangdan, Misong, Sambakkol and other power stations are expected to be completed within this year. Canal, floating and various other unique styles have been applied into the construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When completed, these power stations will sufficiently provide local industrial factories with power and dwelling houses with electricity for cooking and heating. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The River Taedong is the nation's great pride as its rich water resources are greatly helpful to the building of a powerful nation.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan accused of frantic anti-DPRK campaign\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- Japan is now getting frantic in the anti-DPRK campaign. Recently it submitted to the united nations a \"report\" which was adopted at the \"Tokyo Forum on Nuclear Non-Proliferation and Disarmament\" late in July.\r\n   In this connection, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement to the press today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that \"Tokyo forum\" has not yet been recognized internationally as it was cooked up by Japan seeking to cover up its design to realize nuclear arming and become a military power and improve its image in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the \"report\" the \"forum\" kept silence about total abolition of nuclear weapons, the key issue of nuclear disarmament, but impudently raised the nuclear and missile issues of some countries, which are seeking self-defense in face of outsiders' constant threat, and even provoked U.N. bodies including the Geneva disarmament conference, the statement pointed out, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot go unnoticed is its argument that the DPRK is a root cause of instability in northeast Asia. And the \"forum\" intentionally let loose a string of open criticism of the DPRK, maliciously slandering its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not a few participants in the \"forum\" expressed opposition to the adoption of the \"report\" containing such defamatory words against individual countries, but Japan produced this document by a jesuitical method, disregarding their opposition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Geneva disarament conference is now denouncing the \"forum\" for such imprudent behavior as faulting an international body's activities, and even a newspaper of the United States criticized the \"forum\" for taking issue only with individual countries, while turning  aside the outstanding issues related to global nuclear disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Such action taken by Japan before the 54th session of the UN General Assembly is intended to cover up its ever more undisguised design to realize nuclear arming and become a military power,  and create the impression that Japan is \"working\" for world peace and security. Through the \"report\" of the \"Tokyo forum\", Japan also seeks to incite an atmosphere of pressure upon the DPRK at the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today when the international situation and relations are getting complicated, the UN and other international organisations should correctly see the ill-intentioned political design of such countries as Japan and consistently maintain the principle of impartiality so as to contribute to the world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan must not frantically try to stifle the DPRK but properly judge the situation and reflect on and review her hostile policy toward it and make sincere apology and adequate compensation for all her past crimes. And she must discard her wild ambition for reinvasion of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
