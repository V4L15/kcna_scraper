To expand and develop South-South cooperation based on the principle of collective self-reliance is the only way for ensuring the independent development and socio-economic progress, free from the imperialists' economic pressure, exploitation and plunder. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a dignified member of the NAM, the DPRK will fulfill its responsibility and role to firmly defend the fundamental principle of the NAM and its idea and purity and steadily strengthen and develop it, the article concludes."
