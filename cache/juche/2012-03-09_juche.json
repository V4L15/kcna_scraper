            "content": "Truth of Sacred War of Korean Style Can Never Be Downplayed\r\n Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is going so foolish in a bid to cover up the essence of its crimes and mislead public opinion at a time when all-people resistance is raging across the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t They are describing the above-said sacred war as \"a campaign for solidifying the north's system\", \"a campaign for scuttling general election\" and \"tactics for engaging the U.S. and blocking the south\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but the group's hysteria against the nation and for escalated confrontation as it cries out for confrontation with compatriots till it breathes its last because of its inveterate hostility. This is a mean behavior reminding one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's balderdash about \"campaign for solidifying the north's system\" is no more than sheer sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The steel-strong unity of the society where the people are united close around the leader who carved out the destiny of the country and the nation for the first time in history is being successfully carried forward by the people's leader, great heir to his cause, and the younger generation loyal to him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people witness the strongest unity of Korean-style socialism and its invincible might in the great unity of the society in the DPRK and great succession. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly proved by the unshakable determination of all the service personnel and people to wipe out to the last one the Lee group that hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group describing the political and ideological power as \"a campaign for solidifying the north's system\" is no more than idiots and the worst maniacs for confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak is a political prostitute who has prolonged his dirty life through his perfidy and betrayal, bereft of any clear political creed or theory and a political orphan having no social foundation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Maybe, Lee needs the consolidation of his system as he finds himself in the worst crisis of system and political isolation. But it is too late. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If riffraffs who had kept themselves alive under the patronage of Lee part with him, he will find no one who would sympathize with him even a bit, to say nothing of the system on which he may depend in the south Korean society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee finds even his way to his grave thorny as his name sounds. He is fated to be beaten to death like a rabid dog in any lane of south Korea or foreign land any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same can be said of \"the campaign for scuttling the general election.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether south Korea holds a \"general election\" or \"presidential election,\" that is its internal affair, to all intents and purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present Koreans see only the despicable plight of the Lee group more dead than alive as it is on the way to its graves, denied any chance to run for those elections. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As south Korean people of different social standings comment, it is none other than the Lee group that is trying hard to exploit the situation for the purpose of the \"general election.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is seriously mistaken if he thinks he can delay his doomsday by rallying the remnants of \"pragmatism-oriented regime\" and use it even a bit for securing his shelter after his dethronement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee's jargon about \"tactics for engaging the U.S. and blocking the south\" deserves derision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the above-said tactics, one should question Lee if he truly hopes for the north's engaging the south and blocking the U.S. In other words, does he really want reconciliation and unity with fellow countrymen and restriction of foreign interference and guard against it? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is not in a position to properly answer this simple question. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the puppet regime which acts according to the gesture or eyewink of its master, the above-said question may be a crucial one related to its rise or fall. But the DPRK may engage or block the U.S. anytime if it is in the interests of the country and the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already clarified internally and externally, attaching importance to the nation is the consistent stand and steadfast principle of the DPRK in dealing with the issues related to the common interests of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason, the DPRK proposed dialogue when the Lee group was hell-bent on the preparations for a new war, talking about \"military supremacy,\" backed by outside forces in the early period of its office, and made an offer for dialogue when it trumpeted about \"sincerity\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's option for bilateral talks or multilateral talks is aimed at finally removing the threat of a nuclear war from the Korean Peninsula and handing over the nuclear-free new society to the Korean nation and posterity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unconditional sycophancy toward outside forces and humiliating alliance with them is the \"state policy\" pursued by Lee in the whole period of his rule. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Lee group which has pursued unlimited sycophancy towards outsiders with a \"waiting strategy\" aiming at \"change and collapse\" of the system of fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for Lee to talk about \"north's engaging the U.S. and blocking the south\" as he has rejected the repeated sincere gesture and generosity of fellow countrymen but kowtowed to its master, licking his shoes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this sense, it was Lee himself who pushed the DPRK to dialogue with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK's dialogue with the U.S., the party directly responsible for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, means engaging the U.S., what should be said about the Lee group's such political prostitution as leaving everything in south Korea at the disposal of its master U.S. after its seizure of power. It is the most appropriate to call Lee worst pro-U.S. lackey and traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \"Much effort\" and the like touted by Lee in a bid to mislead public opinion is nothing but a poor trick to show his complaint for being sidelined by his master and throw a hurdle in the way of the DPRK-U.S. talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is no more than grievance shown by the stooge behind the scene after being ignored and forsaken by his master while pursuing the tactics of engaging the U.S. and blocking the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Miserable, indeed, is the plight of Lee seized with fear that he may meet the same end as what Syngman Rhee or a  military dictator did while criticizing his master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reminds one of a rabid dog biting passers-by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that what Lee uttered is peppered with lies, deception, plots and trickery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group calculated it could serve the treble purpose through the above-said provocations. It, however, finds itself in such miserable position that it deserves several thousands-fold punishment for all its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maniacs who had gone against the June 15 joint declaration are rushing headlong into campaigns against reconciliation and unity and the people's will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of criminals who failed to come to any human reason and show even a shred of conscience and resurrection can never evade the blame for hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, the dignity common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One may jump from a sinking boat, but traitor Lee is destined to die while staying on the derailed train or jumping from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no other way for Lee but to be responsible for his fate."

            "content": "CRPP critica actitud mas desafiante de banda de traidor Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 9 de marzo (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) publico el dia 9 una declaracion en relacion con que la banda del traidor surcoreano Lee Myung Bak actua mas provocativamente, lejos de pedir de rodillas las disculpas ante los militares y civiles de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea indignados por sus tremendos crimenes barbaros. \n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota va como sigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pasado dia 5, el portavoz del Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del Sur de Corea dijo que \"no vale la pena de responder a cada paso a la persistencia del Norte\", \"los carteles en una unidad de Inchon son para establecer la concepcion del enemigo\" y \"tenemos que urgir al Norte el cese de calumnias\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos tipejos del Ministerio de Reunificacion tambien sueltan disparates como \"proyecto ideado en el interior del ejercito\", \"una cosa inadecuada\" y \"es razonable cesar inmediatamente las calumnias al Sur\" con el fin de evadir la responsabilidad de su tremendo crimen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas grave del caso es que los gangsteres de la capa militar surcoreana dice que \"no retiraremos los retratos y las consignas de censura colocados en las unidades militares\" y que \"desarrollaremos como previsto los ejercicios militares sin hacer caso de la persistencia del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro de Defensa Nacional, Kim Kwan Jin, autor de la presente provocacion nunca vista, aparecio en la isla Yonphyong, donde dijo que \"el Norte provocaria indudablemente\" y ordeno a \"responder de modo rotundo y fuerte con el sentimiento de venganza por el caso de hundimiento de la corbeta 'Cheonan' y el de canonazos en la isla Yonphyong\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es un grave desafio que aumenta la indignacion de los militares y civiles de la RPDC levantados en la sagrada guerra de venganza y otra provocacion imprudente de la horda de traidores ignorantes del poderio real del ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proceder de la banda de traidores que habla de la \"represalia\" y \"venganza\" con la decision de no quitar los carteles insultantes a la maxima dignidad de la RPDC significa la declaracion de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho muestra claramente que mientras existe la banda de traidores, gangsteres no vistas, la nacion coreana no puede vivir ni un dia en paz ni desaparecera en la Peninsula Coreana el peligro de la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se acepta la palabra para la horda de traidores que intenta extender la confrontacion fratricida al mar de fuego. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que la banda de traidores cometio la provocacion abierta, el ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC pondran de pleno manifiesto su voluntad de aniquilar despiadadamente a los enemigos y traera la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la decision final de nuestro ejercito y pueblo."
