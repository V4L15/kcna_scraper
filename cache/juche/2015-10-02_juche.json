            "content": "Objective Assessment of Validity of DPRK's Access to Nuclear Weapons: KCNA Commentary\r\n Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The British magazine The Week in a recent article said that the north's access to nuclear weapons plays the role of a shield deterring the U.S. from attacking north Korea, asserting that the DPRK's option was right in the light of the deplorable situation in Mid-east countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t The magazine said that after the September 11 incident the U.S. attacked Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and other countries, but not North Korea as it is possessed of nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This can not but be an objective estimation of the justice of the DPRK's possession of nuclear weapons that was prompted by the constant nuclear threat and threat of military aggression from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, the worldwide Cold-War has lasted for the past seven decades and wars, big or small, broke out in various regions but not in nuclear weapons states.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past nuclear powers including the U.S. committed indiscriminate interference in the internal affairs and arbitrary practices against non nuclear states by abusing the partial international political structure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries that sought to bolster capability for self-defence and have access to nuclear deterrence were subject to threat and blackmail through military pressure and economic sanctions. In the meantime, they were taken in by economic aid and propaganda for rapprochement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even before the Iraqi war, the U.S. pressurized Iraq into destroying military hardware and facilities including missiles that formed the core of its armed forces. Then the U.S. started the war and swallowed Iraq up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Libya scrapped its decades-old nuclear program, pinning hope on big powers and yielding to their pressure and appeasement, and abandoned its nuclear deterrence. In the end it fell victim to aggression. The tragic situation of several countries including Libya teaches a serious lesson.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries on the Balkans and in Mideast fell victim to the interference in internal affairs and aggression by the U.S. and other Western forces because they neglected the work of increasing the defence capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a country is weak, it can not protect its sovereignty and dignity nor can it achieve the people's happiness and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other hostile forces are now loudly speaking of denuclearization, while getting busy to realize international cooperation in stand-off with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their last-ditch efforts to force the DPRK to scrap its nuclear deterrence clearly prove that the nuclear deterrence is the best means for defence that guarantees peaceful environment and stable conditions for the development and prosperity of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the U.S. is to force the DPRK to dismantle its nukes and overthrow its social system by employing every possible means and methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces have to clearly understand that the DPRK is neither Iraq nor Libya.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The measures for bolstering up its military muscle, a legitimate right to self-defence, will remain unchanged no matter what others may say and no matter how the situation may change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will hold more tightly the treasured sword of nuclear weapons and pave a wide avenue to prosperity in the face of the U.S. imperialists' ever-increasing moves for military pressure, blockade, appeasement and deception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to bolster its nuclear deterrence for self-defence unless the U.S. rolls back its outdated hostile policy toward the DPRK."

            "content": "Evaluacion objetiva sobre posesion de armas nucleares de RPDC, comenta ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 2 de octubre (ACNC) -- La revista britanica The Week reporta que la posesion de armas nucleares de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea cumple el papel de escudo para impedir el ataque de Estados Unidos y agrega que tomando en consideracion la situacion tragica de los paises del Medio Oriente, es muy justa la opcion de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\tY destaca que despues del incidente del 11 de septiembre, EE.UU. perpetro el ataque armado contra Iraq, Afganistan, Libia, Yemen, Somalia y otros paises, pero no lo hizo en cuanto a la RPDC, pais con armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la estimacion objetiva sobre la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC generada frente a la ininterrumpida amenaza nuclear y de agresion militar de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, durante 70 anos pasados surgio la guerra fria en escala mundial y estallaron muchas guerras en varias regiones, excepto a los paises con armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el tiempo pasado, abusando de la injusta estructura politica internacional, EE.UU. y otras potencias nucleares cometieron indiscriminadamente la intervencion en los asuntos internos y las arbitrariedades contra los paises desnuclearizados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmenazan y chantajean con presion militar y sancion economica a los paises que fortalecen la capacidad de autodefensa nacional y se esfuerzan por tener el disuasivo nuclear, y al mismo tiempo, les concilian o enganan hablando de la ayuda economica y la recuperacion de las relaciones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes del inicio de la guerra iraqui, EE.UU. hizo que los iraquies destruyeran con sus propias manos los misiles y otros pertrechos y establecimientos belicos de su pais y despues, desato la guerra y ocupo Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLibia y otros paises tambien abandonaron el programa nuclear que promovian durante varios decenios y hasta el disuasivo de guerra, depositando la esperanza en las potencias y arrodillandose ante la presion y adormecimiento de ellas. Como resultado, se hicieron victimas de agresion, lo que nos da una seria leccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor haber despreciado el fortalecimiento de la capacidad de defensa nacional, algunos paises de la Peninsula Balcanica y del Medio Oriente se convirtieron en el blanco de la intervencion en los asuntos internos y agresion de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas occidentales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn pais debil no puede defender la soberania y dignidad nacionales ni lograr la felicidad y prosperidad del pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles se desesperan por lograr la cooperacion internacional anti-RPDC hablando ruidosamente de la desnuclearizacion y censurando el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho comprueba que el disuasivo nuclear es el optimo remedio para asegurar el ambiente pacifico y las condiciones estables por el desarrollo y prosperidad del pais y la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa verdadera intencion de EE.UU. es lograr el desarme nuclear y el derrocamiento de la RPDC valiendose de todos los metodos y medios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas hostiles deben tener presente que la RPDC no es igual a Iraq y Libia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas se intensifiquen la presion militar, el bloqueo, el adormecimiento y engano de EE.UU., mas consolidaran nuestro ejercito y pueblo el disuasivo nuclear y abriran el ancho camino por la prosperidad nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. no retire su politica hostil anti-RPDC, se intensificara sin cesar nuestro disuasivo de guerra de caracter autodefensivo."
