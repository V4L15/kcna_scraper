The Koreans, a homogenous nation, were divided against their will by foreign forces though they lived in one and the same territory. The fact that Koreans live separated in the north and the south constitutes a temporary pain and tragedy in the nation's history spanning 5,000 years. It is an irresistible trend of the national history and a law-governed requirement of the development of the nation for the divided Koreans to become one nation. No force on earth can perpetuate the division of the Korean nation which came into being and developed throughout a long history or eliminate the nation and its identity. Koreans should no longer allow themselves to live in separation as they are a homogeneous nation. This is the very reason why they should get united and serves as a premise on which unity can be achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The atmosphere of reconciliation and unity is growing stronger than ever before among all the countrymen under the banner of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have the most just idea, line and policy of the great national unity put forward by President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and its excellent tradition. Thanks to the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Il who has creditably inherited the President's idea of the great national unity there arrived the June 15 era of reunification and the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is arousing all Koreans to the sacred patriotic struggle for national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Korean people came to have the strong Korean nation-first spirit from long ago as they were guided by President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the greatest men in the nation's history, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By acclaiming Kim Il Sung as their great leader for the first time in the nation's history spanning thousands of years, the Korean people could put an end to the long history of sufferings and greet a new era in which they could carve out their own destiny by themselves and emerge a heroic people who defeated the two formidable imperialist enemies and a dignified people who set a shining example in socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest national honor for the Korean people to have held Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the leaders of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The guidance of Kim Jong Il brought an immensely bright future to the Korean people struggling to achieve the eternal prosperity of the country and accomplish the cause of Juche. The last more than a decade, in particular, was a period in which the Korean people more keenly realized than ever before the greatness of Kim Jong Il, a peerlessly outstanding leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation-first spirit is based on the Korean people's pride and honor of holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as a distinguished thinker and theoretician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to him that Korean-style socialism remained unshaken even under the complicated situation where socialism collapsed in various countries and it could win one victory after another despite the grim situation where the imperialists got evermore undisguised in their reactionary offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation-first spirit also stems from the Korean people's pride and honor of holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as a great politician and a great father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said Korean nation-first spirit will display ever greater might with each passing day in the worthwhile struggle to make the country of Songun richer and more glorious.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His father was an ill-famed pro-Japanese stooge and Ri Hoe Chang himself committed so many crimes against the nation and reunification. He was censured for his son's evasion from military service and forced big businesses to provide truck loads of money as election funds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is an ultra-right conservative opposed to reunification who was twice defeated in the \"presidential elections\" after facing a stern judgment by the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He embezzled truck loads of money collected from people as taxes in a bid to realize his sinister political ambition, accumulated wealth and wallowed in luxury through all sorts of irregularities and corruption. Worse still, this confrontational maniac openly termed the day when the June 15 joint declaration was adopted a \"day of national humiliation\" and vociferated about \"the principal enemy\", supporting foreign forces in their hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If such human scum is allowed to win the elections, the south Korean society will be completely deprived of justice, the favorably developing inter-Korean relations will again collapse and the south Korean people be thrown into distress again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the youths and students in the north and the south and abroad should turn out as one in the actions to positively support and implement the Declaration for Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity and completely eliminate Ri from the arena of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
