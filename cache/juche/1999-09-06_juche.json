Korea demanded\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland today issued a statement on the lapse of 54 years since the U.S. troops' occupation of South Korea on Sept. 8, Juche 34 (1945). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement strongly urged the South Korean authorities to clearly state their will to pull the U.S. troops out of South Korea, put forth a timeframe for their  withdrawal and repeal the \"treaty and agreements\" which \"legalized\" the U.S. troops' presence in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities take a practical measure to implement the AFORE-said three steps and turn to an anti-U.S. and pro-north patriotic road, not a traitorous pro-U.S. and anti-north path, we will recognize them as independent beings with whom we can negotiate and join hands to pave a true way for the nation to follow, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What the U.S. troops have done in South Korea over the past 54 years is nothing but patronizing the South Korean fascist dictatorship and stepping up the moves to provoke a new war while encroaching upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation and blocking the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive of South Korea paved the way for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in South Korea, asserting that the U.S. troops should remain there even after the reunification.  This is the most hideous flunkeyist treachery committed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The danger of a new war will not be removed from Korea nor can peace and reunification of the nation be achieved as long as the U.S. troops remain in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement earnestly called upon all the fellow countrymen in South Korea and overseas to undertake a vigorous nationwide movement for the U.S. troops' pullback from South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
