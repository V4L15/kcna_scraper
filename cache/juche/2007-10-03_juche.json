This was the declaration of his firm will to always advance the Korean revolution as intended and expected by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in the work systematized and comprehensively dealt with the President's Juche-oriented idea of building a party and the exploits performed by him. And he also clarified the principled issues arising in developing the WPK into an eternal party of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideas and theories expounded by Kim Jong Il in his work have served as fundamental guidelines for building the WPK and the party's activities over the past 12 years, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the true picture of the WPK as the party of the President that it is regarding his revolutionary idea as the steadfast guiding idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's revolutionary idea is the monolithic guiding idea of the WPK and an invincible banner of the Korean revolution. Neither the WPK shining with his august name nor the victory of the Juche-oriented cause of Songun would be thinkable without the President's revolutionary idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible might of the WPK as the party of the President finds its manifestation in that it has always preserved the steel-strong unity and cohesion of the whole party at a high level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strong organization, high sense of discipline and conscious and revolutionary way of the party life that prevail in the WPK today clearly testify to its unity in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the WPK's unity growing stronger than ever before in the Songun era is the brilliant fruition of Kim Jong Il's tested leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The high leadership authority of the WPK as the party of the President lies in the fact that it is making dynamic advance after forming an integral whole with the people, deeply rooted among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party devotedly serves the people while they repose absolute trust in it.
