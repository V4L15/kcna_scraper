Kumgang a few days ago for money-making, so to speak, the north gets fees for entering the mountain.\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a by-lined commentary today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such preposterous remarks can be made only by a group of an anti-reunification treacherous party who depend on outside forces and do not want improvement of north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fees for entering Mt. Kumgang have never been raised and discussed in the recent reunion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treacherous GNP group's linking the reunion of separated families and relatives with money-making is an intolerable insult to the separated families and relatives and the fellow countrymen and a revelation of a criminal attempt to foil the reunion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this the GNP betrayed its dirty colours once again as an anti-national, anti-reunification and treacherous political party opposed to national reconciliation and unity and the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never pardon the GNP group's vituperation and will let it make an apology for it.\r\n"
