            "content": "Portavoz del MINREX rechaza difamacion del premier israeli sobre la RPDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 17 de mayo (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada el dia 16 por la ACNC en relacion con que el premier israeli acuso a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea durante su reciente visita a Japon, el portavoz del MINREX de la RPDC respondio como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podemos tolerar jamas el hecho de que el premier israeli se atrevio a difamar y ofender a la RPDC como \"Estado bribon\" vinculandola injustamente con Iran con el absurdo \"rumor de la cooperacion nuclear\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste acto verbal no pasa de ser un truco barato para distraer el enfoque de las criticas de la opinion publica internacional, que se centra en Israel debido a la ampliacion de asentamientos judios y a la ruptura de conversaciones de paz del Medio Oriente, etc., y para continuar con su ambicion expansionista en esa region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIsrael es el ente canceroso para la paz del Medio Oriente y el canalla que se porta insolentemente sin tomar en consideracion ni el derecho internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, Israel es criticado y denunciado en la region y en escala mundial, pero actua ahora con imprudencia a pesar de su situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ridiculo que Israel hablara tanto de la supuesta \"amenaza\" de alguien si bien llego a tener en silencio muchas armas nucleares bajo el amparo de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIsrael debe aceptar incondicionalmente la demanda internacional de la paz y desnuclearizacion del Medio Oriente, dejando su vicio de acusar a otros cada vez que cae en dilema."
