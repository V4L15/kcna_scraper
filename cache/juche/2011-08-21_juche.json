They are defying the universally recognized demand from a legal viewpoint for an assailant to make apology and reparation to a victim, a news analyst of the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat merits serious attention is the south Korean conservative authorities' pro-Japanese act of treachery of instigating the Japanese reactionaries to reinvade Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs already known, when instructing the south Korean ambassador to Japan as regards the Tok Islets issue after taking office, the conservative group said \"Stay calm even though the Japanese side provokes first\". The Japanese reactionaries have further accelerated the moves to grab Tok Islets, taking advantage of the pro-Japanese acts of treachery on the part of the conservative group that would put even the five traitors of 1905 into the shade. It is clearly evidenced by the recent one-month row kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries over the test flight by a south Korean airliner in the sky above Tok Islets. The Japanese issued a travel ban on south Korean airliners and pushed forward the LDP lawmakers' plan to visit Ullung Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean chief executive in his address to mark \"August 15\" did not mention the Japanese reactionaries' attempt to grab the islets at all. This was unpardonable treachery little short of egging the Japanese reactionaries on to realize their ambition to stage a comeback to Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is the aim sought by the conservative authorities by fanning up the Japanese reactionaries' moves to reinvade Korea. That is to do harm to fellow countrymen in collusion with the Japanese reactionaries. The conservative group only seeks to hurt compatriots even by relying on outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries, well aware of this, are making desperate efforts to seize Tok Islets during the tenure of the present conservative group in south Korea."
