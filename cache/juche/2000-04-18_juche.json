            "content": "New work of Kim Jong Il published \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A new work of General Secretary Kim Jong Il \"Improving the Layout of the Fields Is a Great Transformation of Nature for the Prosperity and Development of the Country, a Patriotic Work of Lasting Significance\" was made public.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is his talk given to officials during his on-site guidance to the land leveling and rezoning in North Phyongan Province on January 24 and 27, Juche 89 (2000). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea, today carries its full text. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il in the work said that the WPK singled out the land leveling and rezoning as one of the important policies for the agricultural revolution and has successfully pushed ahead with it in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The party members and other working people in North Phyongan Province, servicemen of the Korean People's Army and members of the shock brigades from different provinces have done a great deal of work despite difficult conditions, he said, adding the large-scale land leveling and rezoning is possible only under the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted that land leveling and rezoning in North Phyongan Province is evidence that nothing can break the revolutionary stamina of the Korean people to build an economically powerful nation in the spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He pointed out that the KPA servicemen and people are now working hard to build a powerful socialist nation by displaying the revolutionary spirit of fortitude, the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, full of optimism about future that the day is sure to come when they will live well off, though they are hard pressed for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe great change that has taken place in the rural areas of Kangwon and north Phyongan provinces is a striking demonstration of the politico-ideological might of our army and people single-heartedly united around the party and the leader and the solid independent national economy, he said, adding it is also a manifestation of the steadfast will of our people to build a prosperous, powerful socialist nation without fail with redoubled courage in sky-high spirit full of conviction of certain victory and optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that he decided to level and repartition all the fields of the country by generalizing the experience gained in Kangwon Province, he said improving the layout of fields is a great transformation of nature for the prosperity and development of the country, a patriotic work of lasting significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He pointed out that the improvement of the layout of fields initiated by the WPK is aimed at giving a radical face-lifting to this land liberated by the President Kim Il Sung as befitting the land of genuine socialist Korea, glorifying his leadership exploits and changing the appearance and structure of fields and thereby eradicating the last leftover of the feudal ownership of land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Describing the improvement of the layout of fields as a worthwhile work to free the farmers from hard and back-breaking labour, he called for undertaking it in a bold and big way true to the party's policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The fields will look like those of the socialist state only when land leveling and rezoning is carried out under a plan for 10, nay 50 years, instead of undertaking it in such a passive manner as removing a few ridges between patches, he noted, adding: When undertaking land leveling and rezoning we should carry it out under a long-term plan not only for the present generation but for posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that for smooth progress in land realignment project it is necessary to concentrate machines and manpower on the work and admirably finish it one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Land leveling and rezoning should be conducted in South Hwanghae Province after the project in North Phyongan Province, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Stressing the need to successfully carry out the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway project as soon as possible, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is important to concentrate forces on driving waterway tunnels to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also urged all provinces, cities and counties to conduct land realignment projects through a brisk all-people movement so as to turn paddy and non-paddy fields into standardized fields best suited to mechanization. \r\n\r\n"

The DPRK government and people would in the future, too, fully discharge their responsibility and duty for the expansion and development of south-south cooperation to make an active contribution to the cause of global independence, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the history of sustained efforts for south-south cooperation is associated with the noble intentions and exploits of the President Kim Il Sung and other preceding leaders of developing countries, he said the successful opening of the south summit was an indication that its cause would continue to victoriously advance in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went on: Although the Cold War was brought to an end, the international relations have not shifted from confrontation to cooperation and national sovereignty of small countries is overtly violated by the power politics and arbitrary practices of big countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the context of the present international economic relations marked by serious inequality and imbalance, free market competition on the lips of the advocates of \"globalization\" brings profits to the developed countries only. It is an advanced form of neo-colonialism which imposes the specified socio-economic system upon south countries in disregard of their option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Never have the vital rights and sovereignty of the south countries been so seriously threatened as today. It is vital to establish a fair international economic order on the principle of independence, equality and mutual benefit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He referred to the issues to which the current summit should pay attention in adopting the south development strategy and action program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Firstly, a common view of the south on the present \"globalization\" should clearly be confirmed and the developed countries' doctrine of \"globalization\" whereby they force the south countries to accept their view on value and economic mode must be categorically rejected, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And any international economic cooperation for development must be instrumental in assisting state efforts of the south countries to strengthen the independence of their national economy and increase their capabilities for development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Secondly, south-south cooperation based on collective self-reliance should be further expanded and developed to establish new south-south economic relations among the south countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thirdly, a special emphasis should be put on the issue of scientific and technological development in the south countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fourthly, active measures should be taken for practical joint actions to create an international environment and conditions favourable for the growth and development of the south countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe main role of the UN should be further strengthened in analyzing and discussing international economic problems and formulating policies related to them. \r\n\r\n"

Yet, it is a height of folly for the Japanese reactionaries to turn aside from the reality in Japan and slander the DPRK over \"suspected kidnapping\" and for some of the authorities to be impertinently involved in the smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A senior Japanese diplomat recently raised \"kidnapping problem\" again, claiming its solution should be a precondition for the inter-governmental talks between the DPRK and Japan. His remarks are overshadowing the prospect of the DPRK-Japan full-dress talks which resumed with much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This cannot be construed otherwise than a brazen-faced intention of the Japanese authorities to evade an apology for the crimes committed against the Korean people in the past and liquidation of their past wrongdoings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese politicians truly hope for the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations and feel ashamed of their crime-woven past and present, they should stop talking about \"suspected kidnapping,\" a product of their anti-DPRK hostile policy, and combat crimes inside their own country. \r\n\r\n"

Taking advantage of this, Sato, Japanese ambassador to the United Nations, justified Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, claiming that there is growing discontent in Japan as its financial contribution to the UN was not properly appreciated.  In short, his claim is that Japan should be a permanent member of the UNSC because it is one of the biggest financial contributors to the UN among its member nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFinancial contribution to the UN cannot be a criterion  for becoming a permanent member of the UNSC. If Japan's view on value should be accepted, developing countries can never sit on the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe UN is a world body which was founded to defend world peace and security. Therefore, a country which has contributed to the world peace and security or is capable of doing so should be elected a permanent member of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf the UN compromises on Japan's assertion,  backpedaling its principle, it will create an obstacle to the fair solution of disputes and  result in gnawing away at the confidence in the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is still registered as an \"enemy state\" in the charter of the United Nations.\r\n   Japan should unconditionally and fully redress its past to shake off its disgrace of being an \"enemy state.\" Japan's redress of its past would be a touchstone showing whether it can win confidence from the international community or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, Japan has persistently refused to make a formal apology and compensation for its past crimes, including the most hideous crime related to \"comfort women for the army.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yet, Japan asserts that it should sit on the UNSC to contribute to world peace and security. This is nothing but sheer sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should get rid of the disgrace of being an \"enemy state\" before making any bid for permanent membership of the UNSC. \r\n\r\n"
