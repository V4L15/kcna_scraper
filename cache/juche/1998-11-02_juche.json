            "content": "Criminal attempt \r\n Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Defence Agency recently submitted the \"final report on North Korea's launch of missile\" to the joint defence meeting of the Liberal Democratic Party, according to a news report. The report said it is very likely that the DPRK launched a ballistic missile called \"Taephodong no. 1\".\r\n   This shows that Japan doggedly negated the DPRK's launch of an artificial satellite and finally concluded that the DPRK launched a missile.\r\n   We take a serious view of its allegation.\r\n   As all know,  the world has firmly recognized the DPRK launched an artificial satellite, which cannot be negated  with anything. This is a great demonstration of the DPRK's space science and technology and an event of particular significance in the world's history of the development of artificial satellite.\r\n   At a time when the whole world is struck with admiration for this, only Japan has negated it from the beginning. It has tenaciously clamoured that a \"ballistic missile\" of North Korea \"violated\"  the territorial waters and airspace of Japan and that Japan would \"retaliate\"  against it.\r\n  Japan's misdeeds are intended to find an excuse for pushing ahead with their design to become a military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are putting spurs on the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" plan with the United States on the pretext of coping with \"threat of ballistic missile\" by the DPRK and intensifying the collective \"cooperation system\" against the DPRK, crying that \"military cooperation\" of the U.S., Japan and South Korea should be promoted.\r\n   The Japanese Defence Agency's final conclusion that on the DPRK launched a ballistic missile is a revelation of its criminal attempt to step up Japan's moves to become a missile and nuclear power.  This is a very grave movement which makes the DPRK take cautions and powerful self-defensive countermeasures.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries finally take the road of containing the DPRK in defiance of our warnings, they will face only  destruction.    \r\n \r\n"

The rehearsal is aimed at threatening and putting pressure on the DPRK by force of arms and rounding off the preparations for another Korean war, says the paper.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The U.S., through the revised \"guidelines,\"  attempts to provide a justification for Japan's involvement in the execution of its war strategy and use Japan's combat power for the realisation of its aggression. Japan seeks in the \"guidelines\" to secure an institutional mechanism for military actions abroad and step up military reinvasion in real earnest with the backing of the U.S.    The current exercise is a preliminary operation to carry the aggressive \"guidelines\" into practice.\r\n   Involved in the exercise are the U.S. Forces present in South Korea, Japan and Hawaii which will be the main force for provoking another Korean war. From this point of view, it is obvious that the exercise is aimed at the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
