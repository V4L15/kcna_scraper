A class education exhibition hall has been arranged at the People's Palace of Culture in the heart of the capital city of Pyongyang. It shows the U.S.'s history of aggression on Korea spanning more than one hundred years and their atrocities.   The visitors renew their resolution to take revenge upon the Yankees or make an entry in the visitor's book. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Sinchon Museum proves its worth in U.S., class education.   The Yankees temporarily occupied Sinchon during the last Korean War (June 1950-July 1953) and massacred people in cold blood. The atrocities committed by the Hitler fascists at the O'swiecim concentration camp pale before the monstrous massacre.   In a matter of 52 days of their occupation of Sinchon county U.S. aggressors killed more than 35,000 innocent people, or a quarter of the population, in the most brutal way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year General Secretary Kim Jong Il visited the refurbished museum, where he said the place was very instrumental in arousing U.S., class awareness of the people and indicated tasks to make an effective use of the place for education.   The place is visited by a growing number of working people of various social standings, servicepersons and school youth and children.   The visitors make rounds of the exhibits on GI's murders, vowing to take a thousand-fold revenge upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is the sworn enemy of the Korean people and the Korean people will have a make-or-break battle with them any time. This idea is stressed in messages from propaganda and agitation means and the education network.   Mass media systematically deal with data on anti-U.S. education.   Anti-U.S. education remains a topic at oratorical contest, poem recital and story-telling meeting of working people's organizations, People's Army units, industrial establishments, schools and cooperative farms. \r\n\r\n     \r\n"

The statement says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The party considers letters to the South Korean authorities and political parties, organizations and public figures at home and abroad sent by the joint meeting to be a most impartial and significant measure to remove the danger of a war from the Korean peninsula and promote national reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is consecutively cooking up shocking incidents against the DPRK on the peninsula, a place of most acute showdown between socialism and capitalism, thus bringing dark clouds of a nuclear war to the world, to say nothing of the Korean peninsula.   It is a shame on humankind that there still exists in South Korea the notorious \"National Security Law\" (NSL) which does not allow even phone calls and correspondence between kinsmen in the north and south, to say nothing of contacts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are left with no pretext to refuse to accept this proposal. They should give up military exercises with outsiders and the \"international cooperation system\" designed to stifle the DPRK, dialogue partner, rescind the \"NSL\" in South Korea and ensure complete freedom of political activities to all patriotic-minded and democratic pro-reunification figures. \r\n \r\n"
