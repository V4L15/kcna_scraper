This is an unpardonable politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK and indecorum chilling the hard-won atmosphere of improving the north-south relations, the statement said, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is most important for mending the north-south relations to create a good atmosphere and both sides should work hard to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south have already agreed to have the second round of high-level contact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Park made such coarse invectives against the DPRK before having the contact. This is the behavior bereft of elementary courtesy and common sense towards the dialogue partner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what pressure her U.S. master may put on Park, she should learn how to recognize and respect the dialogue partner before reading his face. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Vitriol against the dialogue partner would only hurt mutual feelings and bring nothing good to both. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By letting loose again such reckless remarks against the DPRK Park brought to light the fact that \"improvement of the north-south relations\" and \"unification\" touted by her a lot were not utterances made out of her concern for them but to improve her image. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past too, she let loose a string of invectives rattling the nerves of the DPRK irrespective of time and place, bedeviling the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She would be well advised to behave herself, bearing in mind that a golden chance of improving the strained north-south relations may be missed."

Paektu on Friday, the 34th anniversary of the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo (DFRK) by President Kim Il Sung at the Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t From the first day of the country's division Kim Il Sung set it as the supreme task of the nation to reunify the country and consistently adhered to the line of one Korea, the line for reunification. He put forward the proposal for founding the DFRK, the most realistic one suited to the desire of all Koreans for reunification and the specific conditions of Korea, and brightly indicated the way of national reunification, the memorandum said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced the DFRK proposal on October 10, Juche 69 (1980).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the proposal for founding the DFRK, the country should be reunified by founding a Federal Republic through the establishment of a unified national government on the condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other's ideas and social systems, a government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy with equal rights and duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proposal comprehensively indicates the issue of founding a reunified country including the principle and ways of building a federal state, nature and function of a federal state and duties of a unified government and regional governments and their co-relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The best way of reunifying the country as soon as possible is to found a reunified country through federal formula based on one nation and one state, two systems and two governments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the proposal been published than it aroused full support and approval of all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung wisely led the struggle to carry out the proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his famous work \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\" in April, 1993, he clearly clarified once again that a pan-national reunified state should be built to represent all members of the nation irrespective of party and group affiliation and strata, leaving the two systems and two governments in the north and the south as intact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He worked heart and soul to provide internal and external circumstances favorable for realizing the reunification through federal formula till the last moments of his great life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum said that leader Kim Jong Il powerfully aroused all Koreans to realizing the cause of national reunification. It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He published his work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" on August 4, 1997, formulated the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme for the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the DFRK advanced by Kim Il Sung as the three charters for national reunification which integrally systematize and consummate the fundamental principle and ways of national reunification and clearly indicated the issues arising in carrying out the proposal for reunification through federal formula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2000, in which fell the 20th anniversary of the proposal for founding the DFRK, he provided the north-south summit for the first time in the history of national division and brought about the June 15 joint declaration, the landmark for national reunification in the new century, to Koreans, an event to be specially recorded in national history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He powerfully aroused the whole nation to the struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He provided again the historic north-south summit in Pyongyang in October 2007 and performed undying feats by making sure that \"the Declaration for Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity\", the programme for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, was published.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum said that the cause of national reunification is greeting a new epochal phase thanks to the wise leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the New Year Address he clarified the principled stand of the DPRK to make a new advance in the movement for national reunification true to the behests of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il this year marking the 20th anniversary of the last autographs left by Kim Il Sung on the historic document on national reunification, and the ways for carrying out it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south, in the June 15 joint declaration, recognized that there is commonness in the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed confederation for national reunification and agreed to work for reunification in this direction. The south Korean authorities should respect the joint declaration, work hard to carry it out and thus positively respond to the aspiration of all Koreans for reconciliation, unity and peaceful reunification."

presentacion del Proyecto de la Fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo por el Presidente Kim Il Sung en el VI Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, el Comite Central del Frente Democratico para la Reunificacion de la Patria (FDRP) publico el dia 10 un memorando para transmitir las hazanas de los grandes hombres del monte Paektu realizadas por la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el primer dia de la division nacional, el Presidente presento la reunificacion de la patria como la tarea mas importante de la nacion, mantuvo invariablemente la linea de una Corea y la de reunificacion e indico claramente el camino de reunificacion de la patria presentando el susodicho proyecto mas racional que refleja el deseo de todos los connacionales sobre la reunificacion y conviene a la situacion concreta de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presento ese proyecto el 10 de octubre del 69 (1980) de la Era Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu contenido principal es fundar una republica confederativa en la que el Norte y el Sur, sobre la base del reconocimiento y tolerancia reciprocos de las ideologias y regimenes existentes, instituyan un gobierno unificado nacional con participacion igualitaria y, bajo la jurisdiccion de este gobierno, ejerzan autonomia regional con iguales facultades y obligaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este proyecto se plantean los asuntos relacionados con la fundacion de un Estado reunificado incluyendo la formacion de un Estado federativo, los principios y los remedios, el caracter y la funcion de este Estado, el deber del gobierno reunificado y el regional y sus correlaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mejor remedio para realizar cuanto antes la reunificacion es fundar un Estado reunificado mediante el sistema federal basado en una nacion, un Estado, dos regimenes y dos gobiernos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como fuera publicado, el proyecto fue aplaudido por todos los connacionales del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar y la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente Kim Il Sung dirigio sabiamente la lucha por ponerlo en practica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su obra publicada en abril de 1993 \"Programa de diez puntos de la gran unidad pannacional para la reunificacion de la patria\", volvio a exponer la idea de fundar un Estado reunificado pannacional que pueda representar a todos los miembros de la nacion de distintos partidos, fracciones y sectores dejando intactos dos regimenes y gobiernos existentes en el Norte y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ultimo periodo de su vida, hizo ingentes esfuerzos fisicos y mentales por preparar el ambiente interior y exterior favorable al cumplimiento de la reunificacion por el sistema federal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl memorando recordo tambien las hazanas del Dirigente Kim Jong Il quien llamo a todos los coreanos al cumplimiento de la causa de reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su obra fechada 4 de agosto del 1997 \"Materialicemos de modo consecuente el legado del gran Lider, camarada Kim Il Sung, para la reunificacion de la Patria\", el Dirigente formulo como Tres Cartas para la Reunificacion de la Patria los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria, el Programa de Diez Puntos de la Gran Unidad Pannacional y el Proyecto de la Fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo, las cuales sintetizan los principios fundamentales y remedios para lograr la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi aclaro los problemas que se presentan en el cumplimiento del proyecto de reintegracion federativa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 2000, en que se cumplio el 20o aniversario de la presentacion del proyecto de la fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo, el Dirigente preparo por primera vez en la historia de division nacional la Cumbre Norte y Sur, en la cual hizo publicar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, hoja de ruta de nuevo siglo para la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLlamo energicamente a toda la nacion coreana a la lucha por ejecutar la citada Declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl preparar otra vez en esta capital en octubre de 2007 la historica Cumbre N-S, publico la \"Declaracion para el Desarrollo de las Relaciones Norte-Sur, la Paz y la Prosperidad\", programa de ejecucion de la anterior declaracion intercoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento subrayo que la causa de reunificacion acoge la nueva fase de viraje gracias a la destacada direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su mensaje del Ano Nuevo, el Mariscal declaro claramente los remedios de reunificacion y la posicion de principios de la RPDC que se esfuerza por lograr nuevo avance en el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria en pleno acato al legado del Presidente y el Dirigente, con motivo de cumplirse 20 anos desde cuando el Presidente dejo su ultima firma en el documento historico sobre la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, el memorando enfatizo que las autoridades del Sur de Corea deben respetar y esforzarse por implementar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio en que ambas partes reconocieron que hay puntos comunes entre el proyecto federal de etapa baja de la parte Norte y el proyecto de union de la parte Sur y acordaron orientar la reunificacion en ese rumbo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi deben sumarse a la aspiracion de todos los coreanos a la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion pacifica."
