It is intolerable double standards for some countries to assert that the DPRK only is not allowed to launch satellites while they are launching them as commonplace events.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should not make an excessive reaction to the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes from their viewpoint of confrontation but fairly and calmly accept it as it is. This will amount to proving in practice their commitment that they have no hostile will toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's satellite launch is an issue quite different from the February 29 DPRK-U.S. agreement. The DPRK had already consistently clarified at the three rounds of the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks that the satellite launch is not included in the long-range missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to sincerely implement the DPRK-U.S. agreement. We have already invited a delegation of the International Atomic Energy Agency to discuss the procedures to verify the moratorium on uranium enrichment activities and are coming to sincere understanding for implementing the agreement with the U.S. side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor the U.S. to find fault with the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes is laying hurdles in the way of implementing the agreement as it is contrary to the September 19 joint statement and the spirit of respect for sovereignty and equality of the DPRK-U.S. agreement based on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf there will be any sinister attempt to deprive the DPRK of its independent and legitimate right and put the unreasonable double standards upon it, this will inevitably compel the DPRK to take counter-measures. The DPRK does not wish to see the repetition of vicious cycle of such confrontation and escalated tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the expectation of the DPRK that its sincere efforts to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and realize its denuclearization through dialogue and negotiations will get due response from the parties concerned."

It also aims to make workable earlier UN resolutions on sanctions against the DPRK now defunct in face of domestic and foreign criticism and kick off a new racket for sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the regime's frantic racket was prompted by its uneasiness and fear of the DPRK's demonstration of tremendous national power before the world. Another ulterior aim is to save its face as it failed twice to launch a satellite with the help of others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo use an international meeting for moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen is a reckless act which can be perpetrated only by such ignorant political gangsters and hooligans as the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's stand on the summit has already been clarified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the puppet group dares find fault with the DPRK's nuclear deterrent and satellite launch for peaceful purposes and kick off an anti-DPRK racket at the summit despite its repeated warnings and accusations at home and abroad, this will compel it to take strongest counter-measures which no one can imagine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will never give up what has already been declared but react to any pressure or provocation with toughest measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case an extreme development takes place on the Korean Peninsula, the provocateurs and their followers will be entirely accountable for it."

Has it ever had such a large meeting as this and such an important meeting? …\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat gave historic significance to this meeting and turned it into a storm of emotion, was that General Kim Il Sung, a great patriot of Korea and a hero whom Pyongyang produced, was present in person there, and extended joyful and warm greetings and words of encouragement to the people. … as soon as General Kim Il Sung appeared on the platform, the hero who the Korean people hold in high respect and have been looking forward to seeing, a storm of enthusiastic cheers arose, and most of the participants were deeply moved to silent tear.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecalling that day, Kim Il Sung wrote in his reminiscences \"With the Century\":\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"If anyone asked me about the happiest moment in my life, I would reply that it was that moment.

            "content": "\"Yusin\" Dictator Park Chung-hee's Crimes Exposed\r\nPyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Friday issued an investigative report on Park Chung-hee's \"Yusin\" dictatorship as the conservative group in south Korea has become undisguised in its moves to revive the \"Yusin\" dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe report said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee was a top-class pro-Japanese traitor who was raised as a die-hard \"Japanese subject\" since he went to the elementary school and teacher training school during the period of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule over Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntering the Manchuria Military Academy, he presented to the Japanese imperialists a blood-written pledge and letter which read \"Park Chung-hee will be loyal with death\" and \"I pledge to render devoted service to Japan as its citizen and remain loyal as a dog and a horse\", astonishing even Japanese. At the time of graduation, he received the title \"The best solider of the Japanese Empire\" together with Japanese name Mashao Takaki and a gold watch from the puppet Manchukuo emperor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter his admission to the Japanese Military Academy, he changed his name into Minoru Okamodo. After graduation, he served a Japanese Kwangtung army and the puppet Manchukuo army during which he took part in more than 110 punitive operations and killed a number of patriots who fought for independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee staged the May 16 military coup. Resolved to become the second Ri Wan Yong, he signed the south Korea-Japan \"agreement\" which nullified the reparation for the Japanese imperialists' 41-year colonial rule in return for the 300 million U.S. dollars worth \"aid\" and the 200 million U.S. dollars worth \"loan\" (financial loan).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee was also a top-class pro-U.S. element.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean War in June 1950, he brutally killed patriotic people in the front and the rear, while working at the Intelligence Department of the puppet Army headquarters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring his office as president, he went to his U.S. masters Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon, Ford, Carter and all others upon their inauguration and behaved in a shameful manner. He offered south Korea to the U.S. as its colony just as he promised to his master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee was a matchless fascist dictator.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSince he seized power through the May 16 military coup, he enforced harsh \"military rule\" for two years and seven months.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn 1963 he changed his military uniform into civilian clothes and put on the presidential helmet, saying that the \"military rule is replaced by civilian rule\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traitor revised the constitution to make the \"presidential responsibility system\", taking all powers in his hands. He staffed Chongwadae, the administration and the ruling party with military gangsters. He also posted military hooligans to offices in the central intelligence service, police, overseas diplomatic missions as well as government-run enterprises, sub-county heads and village headmen, in a bid to consolidate the military dictatorship system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee's dictatorial system culminated in the \"Yusin\" system fabricated in October 1972.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe took such government official posts as \"president\", chairman of the \"Council of State\", chairman of the \"security council\" and chairman of the \"people's council for unification\" and seized unlimited rights to control all power means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe even set up the \"lifelong presidential system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe crackdown on the people had gone beyond imagination under \"Yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe covered the whole of south Korea with tight surveillance networks with the involvement of 700 000-strong puppet army, more than 15 000 agents of the \"Central Intelligence Service\", over 370 000 political special agents, more than 50 000-strong police, over 320 000 police information agents and 3 million-strong homeland defence reserve forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPut into force at a moment's notice were emergency martial law, garrison order, state of emergency and emergency step and common occurrence were political vacation, political temporary cessation of study, month of counter-espionage, campaign of finding out seditious persons and campaign for eradicating betrayers to \"Yusin\" unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll harsh methods were used in the secret torture rooms of the Central Intelligence Service including water-boarding, ordeal by fire, electric shock torture, narcotics torture, snake torture, glow lamp torture, aeroplane torture, Chinggis Khan cooking torture and bamboo needle torture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Chung-hee was a heinous confrontation-minded maniac who stood against the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring his office, he tried to make the division of the country permanent while fanning up the north-south confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe worked hard to put the policy of \"two Koreas\" into practice and made desperate efforts to make preparations for a war against the north and provoke it, backed by the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOwing to the traitor's anti-communist acts, the north-south relations were deteriorated, the country remained divided and the south Korean people's hope for reunification was dashed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark was the chieftain of chronically reeling economy being dependent on other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe made sure that it was provided for by law and policy to cut down  taxes levied on foreign capitalists and let the \"government\" make up for their loss and to provide them the patent right, as well as to ensure the authorities' suppression of those hired by foreign enterprises if they form trade unions or cause labor troubles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDue to the traitor's indiscriminate introduction of foreign capital, the foreign debt of the south Korean economy totaled 25 billion U.S. dollars in late 1979, 227 times increase from 1960. This accounted for 14.3 percent of the debts of the developing countries at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traitor turned the south Korean economy into the big business economy ruled by a tiny handful of big businesses and plagued by all sorts of corruption and irregularities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe wide gap between the rich and the poor of the south Korean society is due to the traitor's unpopular policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee Myung Bak group of traitors, echoing the Park Chung-hee-style economic development, pushed the south Korean economy into bankruptcy while talking about \"economic recovery\". This speaks volumes for the unjust jackboot dictatorship of Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShuddering, indeed, are the crimes committed by Park during the 18-year period of rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is intolerable disgrace on the nation that thrice-cursed traitor Park is being eulogized, the report said, warning that the remnants of \"Yusin\" seeking to call back the departed spirit of dictatorship are bound to meet ruin, sternly judged by history and the nation."
