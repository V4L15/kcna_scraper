Taking the rear part of the stand is the picturesque Mangyongdae in April where various kinds of flowers are in full bloom. Seen there are Mangyong Hill where President Kim Il Sung trained his body and mind in his childhood and a stream of people visiting the native home surrounded with flowers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the central part of the stand, a Korean map is depicted with immortal Kimilsungias. And standing both sides of its map are a model of the autographic monument inscribed with the letters \"Kim Il Sung 1994. 7.7.\" written by the President in a document related to national reunification and a model of the Monument to the Three Charters for National Reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the front part of the stand there is a rainbow bearing the letters \"Reunification 6.15\" flanked by two sculptures showing two women pouring the water of Mt. Paektu and Mt. Hanna into one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand resembles to a large art work decorated in harmony with Kimilsungias and various kinds of flowers and plants.

Paektu and is bringing the immortal flowers into full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stands of 25 organizations of overseas Koreans and 79 foreign organizations including the diplomatic missions and non-governmental organizations in the DPRK reflect well the reverence of the world progressive people for the President, a peerless great man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kathrin Rebecca Turner, an actress of the famous art troupe of Australia, went round the flower festival while attending the 24th April Spring Friendship Art Festival. Charmed by the flower festival, she said that at the flower exhibition, she came to know more clearly the greatness of President Kim Il Sung and he would live long in the minds of the Korean people.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
