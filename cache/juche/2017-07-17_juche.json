The reality casts dark cloud to the revision of the Constitution and poses threat to existence of the \"Abe regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a saying \"Want is the master of mankind.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are going to calm down the strong protest against the amendment of the Constitution and realize the ambition for overseas expansion and tide over the political crisis at the extreme phase under the pretence of \"threat from north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is very cunning and wicked intention as befitting Japs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan can never cover up its black-hearted intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means accidental that Japanese people are now contending that \"evacuation drill from north Korean missile\", staged under the sponsorship of the government, has no sense of the reality and it is aimed to propagandize threat from north Korea and make an outside enemy and thus create an atmosphere of internal unity\" and that \"the government would want to say it is impossible to check the threat from north Korea unless it revises the Constitution.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community clearly remembers the criminal acts of Japan which has neutralized the Peace Constitution little by little, vociferating about the regional situation, and watches with vigilance the tendency of Japan which is persistently following its criminal past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better give up the bad habit of faulting others."
