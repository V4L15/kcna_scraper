            "content": "Korea's spring food\r\n   Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- Korea is now in spring. From old times the Korean people have cooked and eaten various kinds of food in spring.\r\n   Typical of them are Songphyon, Hwajon, Hwamyon and Sumyon.\r\n   Songphyon, rice cake, is eaten on the first day of the second lunar month. On the morning of the beginning day of the year's farming, farmers used to be served with as many rice cakes as their age in the hope of harvesting bumper crops. Songphyon is made by kneading rice flour with hot water, rolling dough into flat and round pieces, stuffing them with boiled red-beans, honey-spiced jujubes minus seeds and other materials and steaming crescent-shaped rice cakes on a laver of pine needles.   Songphyon is characterized by pine needle smell.\r\n   Hwajon, Hwamyon, Sumyon and other dishes are taken on the third day of the third lunar month in a sense of stepping on spring grass.\r\n   Hwajon is fried glutinous rice cake with flowers symbolic of season.\r\n   Typical of such cakes is azalea Hwajon. Visitors are usually served with Hwajon.\r\n   The seasonal dishes are still popular in Korea. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Sophism of Kim Young Sam under fire \r\n   Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) --  Kim Young Sam released a \"statement to the people\" on February 25, according to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n   In a nutshell, this statement is nothing but a deceptive and hypocritical rigmarole made by the very one who is on the verge of death to cover up his dirty color as the main culprit of the Hanbo scandal, calm down the resentment of the people and extricate himself from judicial proceedings at any cost.\r\n   In the statement, Kim Young Sam prattled he has lived only in a \"moderate and self-restraining\" manner in four years of his office so that he feels \"inveigled\" by the Hanbo scandal. This is the height of shamelessness.\r\n   Turning to the crime of his son, Kim Young Sam said that \"The misdeed of my son is precisely a fault of his father\" and that it was caused by the lack of his attention. \r\nWhat is in his mind is to shift the responsibilities for his crimes onto his son and offer him in sacrifice.\r\n   This eloquently proves that he is the scum of the world without an equal. \r\n   In the statement, Kim Young Sam cried that he would \"liquidate irregularities and corruption\" and exert all efforts on \"economic revival\". This shows that he admitted the total failure of his four-year-old government. \r\nIt also indicates that he would as ever be indulged in irregularities and corruption under the pretext of \"reforms and economic revival\" and exploit the workers and other South Korean people more cruelly.\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that he openly declared an anti-national confrontation policy again with outcries for \"full-scale security readiness\". It is none other than the Kim Young Sam group who have hurt \"security\".\r\n   The United States also is to blame for the catastrophic crisis gripping South Korea and for such extra-large financial scandals as the Hanbo incident. The U.S. has given tacit consent to the treacherous acts of Kim Young Sam, the kingpin of irregularities and corruption. \r\nThis encouraged him to do whatever he liked.  \r\nAs a result, all social evils and irregularities and corruption are now prevalent in South Korea.\r\n   Kim Young Sam must answer for the Hanbo scandal and step down at once before his \"term\" expires. And the United States would be well advised no longer to deal with Kim Young Sam, the very one that the people are fighting to overthrow. \r\n\r\n"
