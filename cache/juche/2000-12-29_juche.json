This clearly shows the impudence and moral baseness peculiar to Japan. Japan's attitude is a challenge and an insult to human conscience desiring peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the world is strongly demanding Japan reflect on its past crimes honestly and apologize and compensate for them. \r\n\r\n"

Seeing out 2000, the last year of the 20th century, the author says the great leader Kim Jong Il is confident that the 21st century will be a century of victory and glory for Korea, recollecting with deep emotion 2000 as a significant year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The essay describes 2000 as a year of victory that startled the world with significant historic events in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that 2000 was marked with the meridian of the Korean revolution in the 20th century, the essay goes on: 2000 reviewed the last century of the Korean history that started with the national ruin as a shining victory of socialism and described it as a year that paved the way for building a reunified  powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world startling victory in 2000 marked a great event in the 20th century which proved that no country can match the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK achieved historic victory in defending socialism and paved a wide avenue for national reunification. An unbroken chain of landmark events unprecedented in the 5,000-year-long history of the nation took place in the diplomatic field of the DPRK. This is clear evidence of the collapse of the imperialists' persistent blockade against the DPRK and a historic event demonstrating the victory of socialism in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hero of the history who has glorified 2000 is none other than Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is the great leader produced by the 20th century who has concluded 2000 with shining victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Standing on the top of Mt. Paektu in the 20th century, he has steered the world, bringing about a great victory in 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 21st century augurs a rosy future for the Korean people as they are blessed with the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Final victory is in store for the Korean revolution led by Kim Jong Il, the sun of the 21st century, and socialism is sure to triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people led by him will enjoy happiness in the powerful socialist country as its masters generation after generation. \r\n\r\n"
