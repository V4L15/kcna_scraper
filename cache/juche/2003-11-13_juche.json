            "content": "Giving Priority to National Defence Industry Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- The main idea of the line of economic construction in the Songun era is to give priority to developing the national defence industry. This is a scientific line as it most correctly reflects the requirements of the times and revolution, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One may live without sweets but would not survive without bullets. This is the present reality in Korea. To struggle to contain and foil the imperialists' policy of strength and aggression and protect the sovereignty of the country and the nation and socialism means protecting the supreme interests of the state and the basic interests of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il saw to it that primary attention was always paid to the national defence build-up and big efforts were channelled into it, carrying forward President Kim Il Sung's military thought and exploits. Kim Jong Il embodied the Songun political mode and took important measures to further develop the national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now vigorously pushing forward the building of a great prosperous powerful nation despite the imperialists' vicious challenges and moves to isolate and stifle the country as they have a reliable national defence industry built their own way under his leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to implement the line of economic construction in the Songun era as a strategic line of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and channel all efforts into giving priority to developing the national defence industry, the article calls for putting the modernization of the whole army and the work to put all people under arms on a new higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strengthening the independent character of the national defence national industry and putting it on a modern and IT basis is one of the important issues in giving priority to the development of the national defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stands out as the primary strategic task for the revolution and construction in each country to boost the military muscle and develop the national defence industry as long as the imperialists persist in their moves for aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is even threatening the prosecution openly, crying that it will never tolerate any pursuit to the GNP's source of fund. It is really a group of hooligans and robbers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no trick or sleight of hand can the GNP rid itself of the noose put around its neck by the illegal money dealing or escape its political ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to expect a clean democratic society free from corruption and reconciliation, cooperation and national reunification desired by the people while leaving alone the GNP, which subsists on pro-U.S. flunkeyism and corruption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans from all walks of life should turn out in an unflinching fight to destroy the GNP, a group of traitors steeped in corruption and irregularities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was obtained by the group for probing the truth about the forcible drafting of Koreans active in Japan on the basis of the survey and discovery made in the north and the south of Korea, Japan and the United States, etc.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists bitterly despised, insulted and maltreated the Koreans, blustering \"the Koreans must abide by the Japanese law or die.\" And they did not allow the Koreans to go by the names given by their parents under the pretext of \"changing Korean names to Japanese.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the aftermath of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists that not only the victims of the forcible drafting but their bereaved families consider it hard to find the names of their own and relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Statute of limitations is not applicable to the war crimes and human rights abuses in view of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The human rights abuses the Japanese imperialists committed by forcibly drafting and massacring Koreans in the past are war crimes, \"crimes against humanitarianism\" and human rights abuses, the truth of which should be probed to the end \r\n Japan is the worst violator of human rights as it abducted a great number of young and middle aged Koreans for slave labor, forced Korean women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army and disallowed the Koreans to use their spoken and written languages. It should be judged according to international law. It should reinstate the victims of the forcible drafting and make adequate compensation to them and their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
