Rodong Sinmun Monday urges this in a signed commentary blasting the very dangerous moves under way in Japan these days.\n\t\t\t\t\t All what is happening in Japan cannot be construed otherwise than undisguised moves for overseas expansion and a scenario to convert it into a military giant, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"bill on special measures for activities to combat piracy\" drafted by the Japanese government is basically aimed, to all intents and purposes, at expanding the scope of overseas actions of the \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" and increasing the possibility of reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bill calls for allowing the \"legitimate self-defense\" of the SDF and \"use of weapons against pirates in case they resist with arms.\" This is in contravention of the present Constitution of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government singled out the \"wider use of satellites for national security purpose\" as one of the basic ways for space development program. This is designed to embark upon the road of reinvasion by realizing its ambition to emerge a military power and rounding off the capability to mount a preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By making a military use of space the Japanese reactionaries seek to have the military targets of strategic importance in their neighboring countries including the DPRK at their fingertips and disable those targets through preemptive attacks to be mounted from space any moment. This dangerous scenario can never come true. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is keen to realize the military use of space and its ambition for reinvasion backed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The development of midsize GX rocket had already been shelved at the meeting of a special panel of the Strategic Headquarters for Space Development under the Japanese government as its expenses are expected to be treble the original spending and there arose the problem concerning the need of satellites. However, the Japanese government decided to go ahead with the development of the rocket regardless of the expenses and their need. This betrays the impatience and ambition of Japan to hasten the military use of space as early as possible, come what may.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These frantic moves of the Japanese government and the SDF clearly indicate the criminal attempt of Japan to justify the moves for turning itself into a military power and launch reinvasion."
