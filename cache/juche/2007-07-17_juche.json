            "content": "Inter-Korean Military Working Level Talks Resumed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- The north-south military working level talks were resumed in Panmunjom on July 16 in the wake of their session on July 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continued their discussion on the issue of implementing the joint press release adopted at the 5th inter-Korean general-level military talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the delegation from the north side Senior Colonel of the Korean People's Army Pak Rim Su said that in order to realize the joint fishing in the waters of the West Sea at an early date as desired by all the fellow countrymen, both sides should lay down among other things the principle of promoting the co-prosperity and common interests to the utmost, the principle of strictly banning foreign fishing boats' illegal fishing, the principle of ensuring peaceful and safe joint fishing and the principle of conserving and propagating the marine resources of the nation by their concerted efforts and, on this basis, should take military measures and discuss and settle other relevant issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced a reasonable proposal for setting up a vast expanse of waters for joint fishing from Yonphyong Islet to Paekryong Islet in the West Sea and proved at length its validity and feasibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also proposed that in order to prevent the military confrontation and clash in the waters of the West Sea the north and the south regard as the basis of their discussion the principle calling on them to remove the root cause of clash, the principle of broad-mindedly giving up each other the maritime boundary line over which they have so far conflicted with each other and recognizing and respecting each other's right to territorial waters and the principle of thoroughly implementing the inter-Korean agreements already adopted and the Armistice Agreement and fully meeting the requirements of the universally recognized law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the south side's proposal for \"building military confidence\" only reveals its intention to continue maintaining the \"northern limit line,\" root cause of confrontation and clash, and disclosed its injustice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the inter-Korean cooperation and exchange, he noted that it is the invariable stand of the KPA to take military measures in time for ensuring cooperation and exchange, the implementation of which is guaranteed. He urged the south side to provide the civilian ships of the north side with a military guarantee for their direct sailing into Haeju Port and full passage through the Straits of Jeju as an immediate task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks they agreed to hold the 6th inter-Korean general-level military talks from July 24 to 26 before discussing a detailed schedule for them.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu and no outside force dare provoke it freely. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These days, the Japanese reactionaries and some pro-Japanese elements in south Korea are distorting the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists which are undeniable and even twisting the truth behind the \"incident\". And it must not go unnoticed that Japan has now become a theater of a feverish anti-DPRK and anti- Chongryon (the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) campaign which vividly reminds us of the past acts of the Japanese imperialists in depriving Korea of its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should make an apology and compensation for having made the Korean nation weep bitter tears and go through immeasurable misfortunes and disasters, after reducing it to a ruined nation. However, far from doing so, they are still persisting in a hostile policy towards the DPRK and suppression of Chongryon. This is an intolerable insult and provocation to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out more vehemently in the nationwide struggle to decisively shatter their provocative acts and force them to pay for the blood.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu which is strong enough to defeat any formidable imperialist army at one blow and the defence industry of the DPRK has been put on a very high level to produce for itself any military and technical equipment for modern warfare. Great unity of the army and people has been achieved and the whole country turned into an impregnable fortress, so that the DPRK can be placed in full preparedness to meet any contingency on the initiative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His wise leadership also finds manifestation in that he has led the work to build a great prosperous powerful nation of Korean-style on this land by the efforts of the people themselves and further fully developed in depth the work to give sufficient play to the superiority of the Korean nation in all aspects of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il is the most steadfast policy of independence and patriotism.

The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea including the \"Grand National Party\", instigated by the U.S., are desperately blocking the trend of the June 15 era of reunification, while denying the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and crying for confrontation against reunification. The fanatics of confrontation of the GNP are kicking and struggling to grab power at any cost at the forthcoming \"presidential election\" and turn the flow of history back to the past era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans who seek national reconciliation and unity and want peace and reunification should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle for attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity, regardless of differences in ideology and system, and dynamically push forward the trend of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should wage this patriotic struggle with redoubled efforts and thus promote national reconciliation and cooperation, give impetus to the development of north-south relations and bring earlier the common prosperity of the nation and the future of a reunified country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was an illegal action in view of the law, common sense and usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said application is an illegal action which cannot be recognized by the civil execution law and civil execution regulations as it means forcing the start of sale of real estate on the nominal debtor and the third nominal party and it is quite natural that the court did not recognize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The RCC should immediately drop the illegal suit brought against the \"Management Board.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly demand the RCC respond at once to the reconciliation negotiations with Chongryon with sincerity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
