            "content": "Spokesman for NDFSK Issues Statement on 59th Anniv. of Korea's Liberation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of south Korea (NDFSK) made public a statement on Aug. 15 on the occasion of the 59th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, according to Kuguk Jonson Internet Site.\r\n The statement said that the day of Korea's liberation which brought ecstasy and joy to the land of 3,000-ri freed the Korean nation from the colonial yoke as a stateless nation and threw upon it the rays of resurrection and marked a historical turning-point in carving out its own destiny independently and creatively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this joy at the liberation was dampened by the U.S. imperialists who replaced the Japanese imperialists, and there began the tragedy of national division, the statement said, and went on: The ambition of the U.S. to turn the whole Korean peninsula into its permanent colony, dead-set against Korea's reunification, the greatest long-cherished desire of the Korean nation, has reached its height after the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People from all walks of life should more bravely turn out in the struggle to drive out the Yankees under the banner of the struggle for independence against the U.S., bearing deep in mind the viewpoint that its fighting target remains unchanged as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces stay in this land, no matter how the situation and circumstances may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey should decisively smash the U.S. moves for a nuclear war against the north by the concerted efforts of the nation under the banner of our nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities disallowed the Pyongyang visit by pro-reunification patriotic organizations this time. They should, therefore, be fully accountable before the entire nation for having scuttled the joint events for reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that all the people are working hard to make the year 2005, the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, a year of reunification by driving the U.S. forces out of south Korea, the statement declared that the NDFSK would join them in their brave sacred struggle for independence against the U.S. and implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and thus greet August 15 as a day of reunification without fail.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

This self-exposes its sinister purpose behind its lip-service to the \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue. Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The U.S. stands against the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and renders the situation complicated because it has no political willingness to settle the issue, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. true intention is not to seek a final settlement of the nuclear issue but to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently it talked about a military solution to the nuclear issue while dramatizing the \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK.

The mayor of Djakarta said the performance of the Pyongyang Schoolchildren's Art Troupe is, indeed, at the world's highest level to the surprise of even experts, extending thanks to the party and government of the DPRK for sending such wonderful art troupe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vice-minister of Culture and Tourism said the performance offered him an opportunity to have fresh understanding of the DPRK.

All the achievements made the DPRK in the development of culture and arts are the results of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation lives in the era of independent national reunification in which all Koreans strive to promote the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and achieve independent reunification by their concerted efforts under the banner of the historic June 15 joint declaration. However, the fellow countrymen in the north are listed as \"the principal enemy\" and regarded with hostility in south Korea. It is quite unreasonable and abnormal from the national viewpoint and in the light of the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, in fact, something deplorable and national disgrace to regard with hostility the fellow countrymen in the north, the dialogue partner for reunification, as \"the principal enemy\" and cooperate with outside forces, which has imposed the tragedy of division and all sorts of misfortune upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification forces' opposition to the call for dropping the conception of \"the principal enemy\" only discloses their criminal attempt to stem the trend of the era of \"By our nation itself\", the era of the June 15 reunification, at any cost, maintain their old system of confrontation and thus realize their sinister political ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The call for an end to the conception of the \"principal enemy\" is in full line with the trend of the times towards reconciliation and cooperation as it reflects the spirit of national independence and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a touchstone discerning between patriotism and treachery, a stand for reunification and anti-reunification stance to work for national cooperation or oppose it and seek \"cooperation\" with outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clarify their stand on the conception of \"the principal enemy\" before the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hypocrisy and a deceptive and treacherous act going against the times and the nation to talk a lot about \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation,\" while regarding the north as \"the principal enemy\" and remaining hostile to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should immediately drop the above-said conception and remove all sorts of institutional mechanism blocking the reconciliation and unity among Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is an anti-national, anti-reunification act going against the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and give up the outdated idea of confrontation and stop acts obstructive to national harmony and independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Refutes Report on Drug Smuggling\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 17 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Congressional Research Service recently released a report what it called \"Drug smuggling and north Korea\".\r\n In the report the Bush administration groundlessly pulled up the DPRK, saying that it has become a state policy to cultivate opium in the DPRK, it conspires with criminal organizations in countries around it for drug smuggling and that it has doubled the drug production and its smuggling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a base political farce orchestrated by the U.S. to tarnish the image of the DPRK on the international arena at any cost and internationalize and justify its moves to apply sanctions and blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK smear campaign escalated by the U.S. in the wake of the passage of the \"bill on human rights in north Korea\" through the House of Representatives clearly proves that the Bush group is keen to isolate and stifle the DPRK by labeling it a \"rogue state\" and a target of international concern, far from wishing to co-exist with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, it is the U.S. in which drug production and smuggling are closely linked not only to businessdom but to politicaldom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at the very moment the report was released, many illegal drug markets were in their normal operation in the U.S. and a number of people were trespassing borders for smuggling and secret sale of drugs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., ill-famed for the world's biggest drug dealing and drug smuggling, kept mum about those illegal acts in its own land but had temerity to slander the DPRK which has nothing to do with the drug smuggling. It is the height of impudence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that it defiled even the political system in the DPRK, while spreading a rumor about its drug smuggling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, a basic principle governing the activities of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government is to regard man as the most precious being in the world and devote everything to the work to train everyone as a highly civilized human being of sound body and mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well known fact that the drug abuse and their secret sale are strictly banned by law in the DPRK as they reduce people to mental cripples and the production, use and import of any substance for health care and scientific researches are subject to strict state control and the relevant law in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In zealously spreading all sorts of false stories about the DPRK, while increasing pressure upon it over its nuclear issue the U.S. seeks to force it to scrap its nuclear program first and lay down its arms. This is, however, nothing but a delusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the Bush administration gets more undisguised in its hostile policy toward the DPRK while escalating on a phased basis its political provocation against the DPRK, it can not but be strange for the latter to sit at the negotiating table with the U.S. to discuss the nuclear issue, a product of the deep-rooted bilateral mistrust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should make a bold switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, clearly understanding that with nothing can it mar the international image of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
