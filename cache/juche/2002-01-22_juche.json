            "content": "U.S. wild ambition for world domination under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The United States set up a \"Missile Defense Agency\" in the department of defense with a view to dynamically pushing forward its Missile Defense Program (MD) on Jan. 4. In this regard, papers here today carry signed commentaries.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that this action taken by the U.S., timed to coincide with its withdrawal from the ABM treaty concluded in 1972 with the soviet union, indicates that it is putting into practice its criminal ambition to carry out its strategy for world domination by more frantically pushing forward the MD in a bid to strike not only the DPRK but other countries of the world with its missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Heavyweights of the u.s. are now becoming more vociferous about the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. This is intended to serve its criminal purpose of pushing ahead with the MD in real earnest under the absurd pretext of \"coping with\" other's \"missile threat\" and getting South Korea and Japan involved in it with an eye to realize their reactionary Asian strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an aggressive Asian strategy of the united states to seize the DPRK by force of arms and invade Asia and establish its domination over it, using the Korean peninsula as a military springboard. To this end the U.S. organized a new special missile unit and has further modernized the military equipment of the U.S. forces in South Korea and Japan under the pretext of \"coping with\" the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. move to create MD systems in and around South Korea is a dangerous action to upset the strategic balance in this region and thus provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju joson warns that the DPRK will not remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. moves to make the DPRK fall victim to its ambition for world domination.    \r\n\r\n"

It is because the past crimes are too grisly to tolerate Japan and the present Japanese government still refuses to admit them and tries to evade the responsibility and justify them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries think that Japan's military actions for aggression are warranted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, they have gone the length of saying that Japan's aggression had a \"strong impact on pushing Korea and other Asian nations to modern civilization\" and the Asian people should remember the \"benefits\" from Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everywhere they go they try to win over the people through \"aid\" and \"cooperation.\" in other words, they seek to lull the angry people critical of Japan's past crimes with a few dollars and curry favor with them so as to build a springboard from which to advance overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Asian people and the progressives of the world demand Japan admit, apologize and compensate for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should swim with the trend of the times toward independence in the new century and meet the demands of the people. Only then can Japan's future in the 21st century be guaranteed.

The fellow countrymen's movement for national reunification has developed into a nationwide movement for independent reunification involving the people from all political parties, all groupings and all walks of life in the north and south of Korea and abroad, guided by the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people should open without fail a decisive phase of independent reunification with firm faith that national reunification is sure to come and optimism about it under the slogan \"reunify the country by united efforts of our nation\" this year which marks the second anniversary of the publication of the historic north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Korean people to open a decisive phase for national reunification by themselves this year it is necessary to improve the inter-Korean relations and give further momentum to the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to warm the inter-Korean relations it is imperative to seek authorities-to-authorities dialogue and all forms of non-governmental talks and contacts and work harder to boost them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to open a decisive phase for national reunification this year it is necessary to do away with a threat to peace in the country and obstacles to national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and south and abroad should valiantly turn out in a nationwide anti-war struggle to smash every move of the bellicose elements at home to provoke a new war and preserve peace in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, improve the inter-Korean relations, make progress in the movement for reunification and do away with a threat to peace and obstacles to reunification these are important tasks to be carried out to promote the unity of the Korean nation and open a new phase for national reunification this year by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by this desire to carry out the important tasks by the concerted efforts of the Korean people, the reporter proposed to set this year as a \"year of promoting the unity and reunification of the Korean people by themselves,\" coming June 15 as a \"day of opening the door of reunification by the united efforts of the Korean nation\" and, as a practical measure for putting it into practice, the period from may to august, the month of national liberation through july, the month of the publication of the July 4 joint statement, as a \"period of the campaign for pooling the strength of the Korean people.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting adopted an appeal to the Koreans at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal says that this is the second year of weighty importance in the implementation of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and \"reunify the country by united efforts of our nation\" is the slogan to be put up by the Korean people this year for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also says that the north-south joint declaration is an eternal milestone for national reunification which is a driving force for the grand national march to achieve the reunification of the country and guarantees the rosy future of a reunified country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inter-Korean relations are those between the fellow countrymen of the same blood and dialogue should remain true to the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and a dialogue to put it into practice, it says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for attaining the reunification by the united efforts of the Korean nation, adding that the place for a happy living should not be allowed to turn into a battlefield between the fellow countrymen and all the Koreans should not fall victim to a war imposed upon them by outsiders under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for glorifying this year as a year of a new surge in promoting the unity and reunification of the Korean nation by itself under the banner of national independence and the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
