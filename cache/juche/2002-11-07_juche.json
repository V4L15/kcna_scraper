And the general student council of Kyonggi University held a \"Funeral of GIs in South Korea\" at the university before inaugurating a group for bringing their action to success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the Oct. 2 general student action vowed to foil U.S. military hegemony and force it to pay for its crimes through a mass struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This mounting anti-U.S. sentiment has set the stage for the Nov. 1 general actions to place on a mass basis the struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle on the occasion of the 73rd anniversary of the Kwangju student incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The voices critical of the U.S. have grown stronger during the South Korea visits of U.S. warmongers and on other occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Students staged demonstrations holding placards reading \"We demand the U.S. drop its hard-line policy toward the north\", \"No South Korea visit of John Bolton, U.S. under-Secretary of State\" etc. and protest letters. They branded John Bolton, as \"an extreme hard-liner of the bush administration\", \"a typical hawkish element\" and an \"envoy of evil.\" \r\n Students under more than 10 student organizations including Hanchongryon held an anti-U.S. rally in Seoul on Oct. 2 when Kelly, assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, flew into South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its unilateralism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is still insisting that it will resume dialogue with the DPRK only after the latter scraps its \"nuclear weapons program.\" This is, in fact, a self-justified and unilateral assertion which turns down the DPRK's productive, pragmatic and constructive proposal for  peace because the DPRK clarified its will to clear the U.S. of its security concerns if it legally assures the DPRK of its non-aggression including non-use of nukes through the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. assertion is an unfair and brazen-faced one as it seeks to impose its ill- advised unilateral and brigandish demand on the DPRK while shelving the DPRK's proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural and logical that the DPRK can never accept the U.S. demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand is little short of forcing the DPRK to drop its arms itself and live in sham peace as a servant of the U.S. arms are vital to the Koreans and a master key to all their victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unshakable faith and stand of the DPRK neither to put down its arms nor weaken its army under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With neither ready-made formula nor far-fetched assertion can the U.S. disarm the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never drop its arms and submit to the U.S. allowing itself to meet the lot of slavery and suffer humiliation under the U.S. umbrella even if the nuclear agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. is scrapped and its people may die in battles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. absurd assertion will never work on the DPRK as it is not palatable to the Koreans but endangers the security and sovereignty of the DPRK. The DPRK will never move first to get so-called \"recognition\" from the hostile country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently insists on its unilateral assertion while shunning the DPRK's constructive proposal for peace, this will render the situation more complicated and push the DPRK-U.S. hostile relations to an armed conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to opt for a proper solution to the problem, away from its short-sighted view, way of thinking and self-justified stand.     \r\n\r\n"
