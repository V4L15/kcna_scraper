He continued:   Kim Il Sung will always be not only with the Korean people but also with the world progressives. This is my confidence that has already been  deeply rooted in my heart.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President was the greatest leader ever known in human history. He devoted his all to the people's happiness as their leader.   He made the Korean people  an independent people who most value the national dignity, which is one of his great achievements. Thanks to his great services Korea became a country strongest in independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But for the strong armed forces founded and led by the President, the Korean people could not defend what they have achieved in the revolution at the cost of blood nor the  sovereignty of the country.   The U.S. and its followers could inspect military installations and even the presidential palace of another sovereign country and intrude into its airspace at will. But that is not the same case with the DPRK at all. The will of the Korean armed forces and people not to tolerate any encroachment upon the sovereignty has been proved in practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK successfully solved the question of succession to the leadership. Kim Jong Il gives wise guidance over the work of  the party, the state and the army as a whole.\r\n   It is a principle and stand always maintained by Kim Jong Il to do all work as the president did and work out all lines and policies as he intended. \r\n   Thanks to Kim Jong Il the history of Kim Il Sung still continues.\r\n   Kim Il Sung is immortal as the sun that will throw its brilliant rays of Juche for all people forever. \r\n \r\n"

These are attributable to the Japanese government's anachronistic policy towards the past crimes, the delegate said, and went on:   Japan should make a proper apology and take a step for deserved compensation for its crimes against humankind so as to liquidate the crime-woven past at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

The statement warned that in case police is called out to put down strikes, it will develop into a violent conflict, and urged the authorities to stop such suppression. \r\n \r\n"

This part deals with the hero's struggle in the enemy rear during the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-july 1953). It teaches through a truthful depiction the truth of the revolution that the destiny of the fatherland and the nation can be saved and defended only when everyone absolutely trusts and follows the great leader.   It also tells the people if they are not guided by a great leader and they fail to breathe the same with their leader, the revolution is bound to fail as their idea changes and the weapons in the hands of the revolutionaries  get rusty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A preview of the film was held at the April 25 House of Culture on Saturday.\r\n   Senior party and state officials appreciated the film. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KPA is invincible\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- Invincible is the Korean People's Army (KPA), grown and gained in strength under the guidance of the three commanders of Mt. Paektu and trained through decisive battles of nearly 70 years against imperialism.   Rodong Sinmun today stresses this in an editorial dedicated to the 67th army day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA is invincible as it is the best in terms of loyalty to the party and the leader, revolutionary trait, war strategy and methods, and discipline and unity, the editorial says, and goes on:   The nearly 70 years of our revolutionary armed forces is a history of glorious revolutionary activities conducted by the three commanders of Mt. Paektu.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader President Kim Il Sung long ago founded the immortal Juche idea and basing himself on it gave a clear exposition of all the problems arising in the army building in the present era.  Kim Jong Suk, a woman commander of Mt. Paektu, indicated the way of strengthening and turning the revolutionary army into an army of the leader.   The respected Marshal Kim Jong Il has made great contributions to developing and enriching the President's idea and theory on Juche-oriented army building in a comprehensive way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He creatively advanced ideas and theories that serve as a guideline in building the revolutionary armed forces in our era. Among them are a soldiers-centred theory that successful army building is decided by servicemen, an idea of achieving unshakable unity between officers and men, between superiors and inferiors and between army and people, a theory of imbuing the whole army with the revolutionary idea of the leader and an idea of strictly ensuring the party's leadership over the army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the spirit of human bomb and suicidal attack, being displayed among KPA servicemen today, are an expression of their noble sense of obligation to repay the benevolence of the great Kim Jong Il who has trained and led them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean revolutionary armed forces are greeting the heyday of their development under his leadership, the editorial points out, and further says:   The invincible might of our People's Army lies in that it is the most staunch army with invariable class stand and unwavering fidelity to revolutionary principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The imperialists' \"peace strategy\" or \"appeasement policy\" can never work on our army.   Its might also lies in the fact that it is the incomparably brave army, grim in making resolution and merciless in striking.   It is the spirit of the KPA to decisively fight against arrogant attack of the imperialist aggressors and give merciless blows to them. Its striking ability is unlimited and there is no room on this planet to evade such strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA is also invincible because the revolutionary military discipline of acting only under the order of the respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il has been strictly observed by the whole army.   The KPA officers and men are only committed to observing the principles of absolutely and unconditionally implementing orders and instructions of the Supreme Commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   More powerful than nuclear weapons is the might of our People's Army thinking and acting as one with high consciousness and awareness.\r\n   Once the Supreme Commander issues an order, the KPA will go into action as one like a fierce tiger and mercilessly annihilate the enemy and thus achieve the cause of national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
