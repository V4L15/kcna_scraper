It is almost vertical down to 3.9 meters from the ground . The 0.6-meter-thick floor was tamped with clay and gravel. \r\n Its wall was built of grey bricks of 69 layers. Each brick is 30 centimeters long, 15 centimeters wide and 5 centimeters high. Some of the bricks were made in different patterns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solid bricks show the developed ceramic technology at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many relics such as earthenware, roof tiles and ironware were collected in the well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 70 pieces of earthenware were discovered, 15 of them have their original shapes and 56 can be restored to the original state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most of the earthenware pieces are similar with those found in a well in Kosan-dong belonging to the days of the Kingdom of Koguryo. Their quality and shapes are better than those produced in the period of Ancient Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
