In consequence the peninsula is put on a time bomb. The U.S. military is now even talking about \"bombing of North Korean nuclear facilities.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Korean nation that should defend peace and avert a war on the Korean Peninsula standing at the crossroads of war or peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean people are called upon to replace candle-lights against the United States by torches against the U.S. and turn out more courageously in a struggle to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves to start a war against the DPRK including arms buildup and war exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace of the country and the nation's right to existence can be preserved only when the whole nation struggles against the U.S. and war without the slightest concession or hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more desperate aggressors and warmongers become in their moves, the closer the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should unite in their struggle under the banner of national independence and patriotism so as to firmly defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation and bring earlier the day of independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The independent policy basically means reflecting the desire and independent demand of the popular masses and meeting them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A true independent policy means the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy of the party fully represents the independent policy aimed to most successfully realise the sovereignty of the country and the nation. \r\n This policy is the Korean-style unique political mode which calls for regarding the military affair and the increase of the national defence capability as the greatest state affair, and strengthening the main agent of the revolution and promoting national defence and socialist construction as a whole with the People's Army as the mainstay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the Songun policy, the Korean people would not have been able to defend the sovereignty of the country, to say nothing of the socialist construction, and would have fallen victim to foreign forces long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries and nations advocating independence can increase their national defence capabilities and achieve the independent development and prosperity, standing the severe test of history, only when they follow the Songun policy, the most vivid manifestation of an independent policy and the most effective political mode in our era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
