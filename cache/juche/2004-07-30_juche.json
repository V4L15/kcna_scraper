            "content": "All-People Movement for Abolition of SL Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The Information Department of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of south Korea issued an \"appeal to all the people\" on July 27, according to Internet Site Kuguk Jonson.\r\n The appeal said: It is a shame on our people and a tragedy of all the fellow countrymen that the \"Security Law\" going against the will of the people and the trend of the times, still remains in force though they live in the era when the old goes to ruin and the new wins, the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration when the Korean people are working hard to achieve reunification by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people can never tolerate the pro-U.S. treacherous group's act of challenging the people in a bid to block the advance in the era and preserve its vested rights with the revival of the Cold War. The people from all walks of life and the pro-reunification movement organizations should intensify the movement for independence, democracy and reunification and thus wage an all-people movement to abolish the SL, a leftover of the era of confrontation and disgrace for the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An approach towards the SL is a touchstone that distinguishes patriotism from treachery and reunification from division. The present authorities should completely repeal the SL to show their will to implement the June 15 joint declaration in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called on all the people to give full play to the indomitable fighting spirit and stamina in order to see the SL completely abolished and bring about new politics, new society and new life without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Attempt at Preemptive Nuclear Attack on DPRK under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article denounces the U.S. imperialists for their reckless attempt to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces have made preparations to invade the DPRK for the last several decades as evidenced by their massive beef-up of their aggression forces in and around south Korea. Considering it as a major goal of their military strategy for overseas aggression to stifle the DPRK, they have focused all their efforts on achieving this goal. They are keen to ignite another Korean war under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists count on a preemptive nuclear attack in achieving the objective of their scenario for a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This scenario has already been into a concrete shape. According to it, the development of special type smaller nukes is making rapid progress and a move to deploy them is being pushed forward. Having succeeded in developing missiles capable of super-high speed underground penetration the U.S. imperialists are contemplating their deployment in south Korea before any other regions. It is their intention to ignite a nuclear war in Korea and with this as a precedent start the same war to invade other regions in the future. That is why the U.S. is taking so much pain to input other countries into its move to lay an international siege to the DPRK and apply collective sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists make the outbreak of a nuclear war in Korea an established fact on the basis of their calculation that they can use nukes in this region, unhindered, and their use will not have any impact on their mainland across oceans. If the U.S. bellicose forces ignite a nuclear war in Korea at any cost, the U.S. will not be safe from it, either. The Bush bellicose elements are well advised to drop such daydream and stop the nuclear war racket.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

An end to the U.S. colonial rule and the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea entirely depend on the struggle of our people, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called upon all the south Korean people to decisively frustrate the aggressive designs of the United States and its intrigues to start a war by building in practice through national cooperation a structure of Korean people's confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK and patriotic people from all walks of life will wage a more relentless struggle against the U.S. and war, convinced that the victory of July 27 is always in store for the Korean nation, thus will surely bring an independent and peaceful new society free from U.S. troops and war, the dawn of a reunified country, it stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities of Abduction\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Thursday issued a statement denouncing the south Korean authorities for their anti-national act of taking a group of \"defectors from the north\" to south Korea.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities committed such anti-national act as taking a group of \"defectors from the north\" to south Korea on Tuesday and Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was organized and premeditated allurement, abduction and terrorism committed by the south Korean authorities against people in the north in broad daylight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north , therefore, considers this action as a flagrant violation of and challenge to the June 15 joint declaration in which the north and the south committed themselves to solve the issues related to the inter-Korean relations and the country's reunification independently by their concerted efforts and the most hostile act to destroy the system in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive south Korean rulers took the human scum who committed crimes in the north to south Korea to use them in the campaign for confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north can not but take a serious view of the fact that even in the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration the present south Korean authorities lured and abducted a group of northerners by more crafty and vicious methods, repeating their predecessors' crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that this terrorism was timed to coincide with the U.S. House of Representatives' recent passage of the \"bill on human rights issue in north Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature the issue of \"defectors from the north\" is a product of the anti-DPRK campaign the U.S. is escalating by using a lot of money and materials in a bid to destroy people-centered socialism of Korean style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will never allow the south Korean authorities to impair the international prestige and image of the DPRK and realize the \"change of its system\" in pursuance of the U.S. campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland bitterly condemns in the name of the whole nation standing for its unity and reunification the above-mentioned crime committed by the south Korean authorities to drive the inter-Korean relations to a phase of acute confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are feeling uneasy, seized by extreme guilty conscience after luring and abducting those northerners like alley cats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent criminal act committed by the south Korean authorities is sparking off fresh antagonism and confrontation between the north and the south and throwing insurmountable obstacles in the way of improving the inter-Korean relations. The north will never remain a passive onlooker to this crime but settle accounts with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will be held wholly accountable for the ensuing consequences and other forces who supported them will have to pay a high price for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
