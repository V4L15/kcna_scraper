So the drama, in which the DPRK is \"suspected of having kidnapped a Japanese girl,\" was invented in a hurry at south Korea's \"Agency for National Security Planning\".\r\n   The drama is based on the statement of a north Korean \"agent\" who \"defected\" to south Korea. The statement is that one day in hospital he was told by a roommate that a Japanese senior middle school girl was \"kidnapped\", who the agent said may be the girl who disappeared in Niigata, Japan, 20 years ago.\r\n   Just having received the scenario of this drama from the south Korean puppets,  the Japanese right-wing reactionaries concentrated efforts on bringing it into action. They judged that the drama will be \"effective\" in tarnishing the DPRK's image and inciting hostile sentiments toward the DPRK among the Japanese people and that this will help attain their insideous purpose of avoiding Japan's atonement for the past crimes.\r\n   \"Sankei Shimbun\" and other venal press media of Japan launched anti-DPRK propaganda over the \"case\".  And some politicians from the new frontier party \"asked\" the diet to probe the \"case\". \r\n   Furthermore, the Japanese reactionaries mobilized parents of the missing girl to  call for a probe into the \"case\". \r\nThey also spread the rumour that 16 other people who have been missing in Japan for the last 20 years might have been \"kidnapped\" by the DPRK's \"operatives\".\r\n   The Japanese Government has made a fuss for \"investigation\" but found no clue because the \"case\" is based on no credible evidence or material but speculation and hypothesis.\r\n   On the contrary, it will be made all the clearer that the \"case\" has nothing to do with the DPRK.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must promptly stop the frantic anti-DPRK campaign, though belatedly, mindful that they will get nothing from this poor and false drama,  which will not be good for Japan itself in the long run. \r\n\r\n"

This was not a simple military parade but a powerful demonstration of the might of the invincible Korean People's Army led by Secretary Kim Jong Il, a great man produced by heaven, as well as a true picture of north Korea in which the people are united around their leader.\r\n   I was sure of their victory in the \"Arduous March\" at the sight of the parade columns  and tens of thousands of people raising cheers toward their Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The April 15 commemorative events and the April 25 military parade dealt a  heavy blow at those who were dreaming of some \"change\" in the north and discouraged the U.S. and its followers attempting to stifle the north by force.\r\n   The people in the north more loudly sing revolutionary songs full of optimism and hold higher the red flag which fluttered in the van of anti-Japanese independence fighters, inspite of grave difficulties caused by heinous anti-DPRK moves of the imperialists, tremendous economic losses caused by repeated natural calamities unprecedented in history and the sudden death of President Kim Il Sung. The north is like a phoenix, indeed.\r\n   The optimistic spirit of the northern people working world-startling miracles is based on the confidence that they can overcome any adversity and defeat any strong enemy and create greater happiness under the leadership of Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is just like President Kim Il Sung. \r\n   The north is still in the \"Arduous March\" but will finish it victoriously before long.  \r\n \r\n"

This announcement proved true as witnesses also said that the policeman was run over by an armoured teargas launcher of the police during the suppression of demonstrators.\r\n   Police said on June 4 that a lathe operator surnamed Ri, branded as a \"police agent,\" was beaten to death by students at Hanyang University. The police claimed that the worker was wandering on the fifth floor of the student hall of the university  before being caught by students of the \"corps defending Hanchongryon\", who suspected him to be a police agent and beat him to death while trying to wrest confession from him.\r\n   But the truth of the case was brought to light soon. In a bid to invent a pretext to suppress \"Hanchongryon\", the fascist clique infiltrated him into the university in a crafty method and caused his death. \r\n    With such poor and base plots the Kim Young Sam group are attempting to justify the repression of \"Hanchongryon\" and divert elsewhere the public attention from the Hanbo incident.

Korea\r\nPyongyang, June 17 (KCNA) -- A Pyongyang meeting was held today to mark the 10th anniversary of the June popular resistance in south Korea.\r\n   The June, 1987, resistance was an anti-U.S., anti-fascist popular struggle to put an end to the U.S. colonial domination over and interference in the internal affairs of south Korea, retake the sovereignty of the nation and achieve the democratisation of society against the fascist dictatorship.\r\n   The resistance lasted more than 20 days with the participation of over five million people from all walks of life. Yielding to the resistance fighters, the Chun Doo Hwan Military fascist clique had to publish the \"June 29 declaration\" promising the \"constitutional revision for direct elections\", the release of detainees and other matters. \r\n   Han Si Hae, Director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, said in his report:\r\n   South Korea is still under the colonial fascist rule of outside forces and their stooges owing to the despicable treacherous acts of its rulers.\r\n   The present south Korean rulers are a group of flunkeyists and traitors who are more openly dependent upon the outsiders than any preceding rulers.\r\n   Some time ago, the south Korean fascist clique openly declared that they would completely disorganise the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) which is standing in the van of the movement for reunification and democracy. Since then have they made desperate efforts to dissolve and destroy the  students' autonomous organisation from within, employing violence and government power.\r\n   Anyone who values the destinies of the country and the nation and truly aspires after the reunification of the country should oppose outsiders' domination over and interference in the internal affairs of south Korea and categorically check the flunkeyist and treacherous moves of the south Korean rulers.\r\n   If the United States wants peace on the Korean Peninsula, not war, and is truly interested in the settlement of the pending matters with the DPRK, it must respond at an early date to the call for signing a DPRK-U.S. peace agreement, discard the hostile policy towards the DPRK and stop such reckless moves as encouraging the south Korean puppets to unleash war against the north.\r\n   Besides, it must stop rendering support to Kim Young Sam, who is obstructing the improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
