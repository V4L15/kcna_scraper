            "content": "NDC of DPRK Clarifies Principled Stand on DPRK-U.S. Relations\r\n Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK in a statement Saturday revealed the deceptive nature of the rhetoric about non-aggression on the DPRK made by the U.S. recently, and principled stand of the DPRK on the DPRK-U.S. relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tense situation that persisted on the Korean Peninsula for the past six decades after the ceasefire has not developed into a war. This is entirely thanks to the peace-loving efforts and just struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK despite their bitter pain resulting from territorial and national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On October 3 U.S. Secretary of State Kerry said that if the DPRK starts denuclearization first, the U.S. will be ready to have dialogue with it and that if it becomes clear that the DPRK started denuclearization, Washington will open peaceful relations with Pyongyang and sign a non-aggression pact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing the hypocritical nature of his remarks, the statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks, which mean that the U.S. will enter into friendly relations with the DPRK after it is left bare-handed, are the height of American-style impudence and craftiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are well aware that even though it clamored for non-aggression, the U.S. is running the whole gamut of intrigues to lead the DPRK to \"change\" and \"collapse\", while persistently opposing the withdrawal of its aggression troops from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. call on the DPRK to lay down arms and remain bare-handed is an intolerable mockery and insult to the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is disgusting to see the U.S. playing the role of a leading character with high skill in the charade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. proposal for non-aggression cannot guarantee peace and security on the Korean Peninsula but the nuclear-armed revolutionary forces for self-defence of the DPRK can defend and guarantee everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement clarified the principled stand of the DPRK as follows as the U.S. takes issue with the nuclear issue and talks about the DPRK-U.S. relations while escalating all sorts of pressure offensives against the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1.  If the U.S. truly wants to improve the relations with the DPRK, it has to properly understand the DPRK and behave as befitting a big power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is no longer a small and weak country which used to be in the past when it was hacked at the point of bayonets of big powers for it had neither sovereignty nor arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can frighten the army and people of the DPRK through the \"gunboat\" offensive, with which it used to browbeat the world and bring its rival to its knees in the past, and through the superiority in the air based on latest science and technology, and can hurt the DPRK through the vicious moves for isolating and stifling it politically and economically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. tragedy is that it does not know about the DPRK which is demonstrating its strong spirit and its army and people who love and value their country more than their own lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly wants to mend the relations with the DPRK, it should properly understand the DPRK supported even by tens of millions of south Koreans, and behave itself as befitting a big country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should no longer talk about dialogue and improvement of relations with preconditions nor maintain the brigandish insistence that non-aggression is possible only when the DPRK dismantles its nuclear weapons first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK can discern the ulterior intention concealed in the dialogue and non-aggression proposed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The U.S. should discard the old way of thinking and outdated stand and abandon the threadbare hostile policy toward the DPRK, before it is too late.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For a good while the U.S., when meeting with DPRK officials behind closed doors, used to talk volubly that Washington has no intent to pursue policy hostile toward the DPRK. In recent public appearances Washington is working hard to build public opinion, claiming that it has neither hostile policy toward the DPRK nor willingness to replace the regime in the DPRK by attacking it. But in actuality it is working hard to realize its attempt at the regime change while systematically escalating all sorts of sanctions, isolation and blockade against the DPRK after invariably labeling it as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a \"rogue state\" behaving contrary to \"law standard\" and \"international cord of conduct.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation goes to fully prove that the U.S. assertions that it has neither hostile policy toward the DPRK nor intent to attack it are a poor farce for deceiving the public at home and abroad and mocking at the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. wants to escape the pent-up grudge and retaliation of the army and people of the DPRK, it should drop its old way of thinking and outdated stand and make a bold decision to roll back its old hostile policy toward the DPRK before it is too late.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The U.S. should clearly understand the meaning of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and lift all steps for isolating and stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the consistent policy goal set forth by the DPRK government. It calls for the denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula including south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This denuclearization is a peace-loving and powerful physical means for defusing all the U.S. nuclear threats to the DPRK and denuclearizing the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. continues threat and blackmail against the DPRK, the DPRK will get more time in its favor and the U.S. will only precipitate its miserable end. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In other words, the DPRK will prosper with increasing vigor and strength, as it has smaller, diversified and precision nuclear weapons, but the U.S. will remain as a bubble marginalized in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should, first of all, lift all the sanctions it imposed against the DPRK under absurd charges, if it wants to get rid of the present poor situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should stop resorting to the stereo-typed nuclear blackmail against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further the U.S. escalates its nuclear threat and blackmail, the deeper it will find itself in self-contradiction and bottomless labyrinth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What we would like to emphasize is that the U.S. should take a bold decision to halt at once all the provocations against the DPRK including war exercises which aim at bringing down its social system and territorial invasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the U.S. should make a policy switchover by withdrawing all the measures it has taken to isolate and stifle the DPRK as part of its greedy pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies the way for improving the DPRK-U.S. relations and guaranteeing peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula but  in the U.S. mainland."

            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Denounces S. Korean Authorities for Crying out for Their Dignity\r\n Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces are clinging to the moves of insulting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) gave an answer to the question put by KCNA on Saturday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Wednesday the minister of Unification of south Korea impudently said the great politics of love for the people pursued by the DPRK is aimed to \"achieve exploits\" and \"highlight the image of love for people\". On Tuesday he talked nonsense that south Korea has the \"dignity of 50 million people\" while finding fault with the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and asserting that \"the north's mud-slinging at the south has gone beyond the limit\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a move is another intolerable heinous and grave provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As admired by the world, the politics of love for people pursued by Marshal Kim Jong Un is producing stirring events day after day in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an admirable reality can be found only in the socialist system centered on the popular masses in which the whole society forms a big harmonious family. The puppet forces of south Korea dared compare this with their petty and reactionary politics by which they make a spate of every wicked sermon to earn the grass-root support at every election and make false propaganda guided by such a way of thinking. How shabby and foul they are!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that they cried out for the \"dignity of 50 million people\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This ridiculous move is enough to make even a cat to laugh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is not in a position to talk about the dignity as it is under the military occupation by the U.S. which holds control of all domains including politics and military affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is indeed preposterous for those who turned south Korea into the barren land to talk about the \"dignity of 50 million people\", an intolerable mockery of south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now under way in south Korea are actions of various circles demanding the probe into the truth about the case of the puppet Intelligence Service's interference in the \"presidential election\" and the nullification of the results of the \"election\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye is being disgraced as \"half president\" due to the fraud-marred election and is faced with denunciation and rejection by the people for trying to revive the ill-famed \"yusin\" dictatorship. Park's group is not entitled at all to speak about the \"dignity of 50 million people\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If there be any in south Korea, there is grudge of the 50 million people who had their dignity violated by the puppet group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group, made up of confrontational maniacs seized by the hysteric fit and hell-bent on antagonism, hostility and evil moves, is persistently making vituperation slandering the dignity and social system of the DPRK. It is nothing but a shriek made by those taken aback by the bright reality in the DPRK which wins only victories day by day and achieves prosperity thanks to the politics of believing in people as in Heaven and leadership of Kim Jong Un. It is also its last-ditch efforts to get rid of serious crisis at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, as it had already warned, will never tolerate but resolutely punish anyone who slanders the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park's group should properly govern its tongue, if it does not want to face the same miserable end as what was met by those who went hell-bent on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen."

It took a series of practical steps, clarifying its positive will for peace and dialogue by reflecting the aspiration of the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation, unity and reunification. A particular mention should be made of the fact that it clarified the stand for dialogue without conditions and advanced on its own initiative proposals for this, prompted by the desire to ensure durable peace and stability on the peninsula and realize its denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   As recognized by the international community, it was something unprecedented that the DPRK exercised its maximum self-restraint during Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces in August last. But contrary to this, they persisted in the policy of confrontation and war racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Talking about someone's \"trustworthy\" priority steps, the U.S. introduced three major nuclear strike means into the peninsula and its vicinity one after another, rounding off the physical and institutional preparations to ignite a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces, pursuant to their American master's Asia strategy and timetable for war of aggression against the DPRK, escalated anti-DPRK conspiracies and moves for igniting a war, openly crying out for \"confrontation accompanied by dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring foreign countries, they hurt the dignity and social system of the DPRK and incited the atmosphere of confrontation, undisguisedly revealing their scenario for \"toppling its regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said racket is part of such scenario, the last phase for carrying out it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that \"confidence\", \"respect\" and \"detente\" touted by the U.S. and other hostile forces are nothing but hypocrisy and it is their real intention and final goal to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fully reveals the despicable true colors of the U.S. and its stooges as wreckers of peace and stability on the peninsula as proven by the involvement of the nuclear carrier in the maneuver.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is fully ready to take military countermeasures as the striking targets are huge and close and they often come within the striking range of its army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces had better stop behaving rashly towards the emergency countermeasures being taken by the DPRK's revolutionary armed forces."

Pero, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de autodefensa con armas nucleares pueden defender y garantizar lo todo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, EE.UU. habla de las relaciones con la RPDC planteando el problema nuclear sin relajar su campana de presion anti-RPDC de todas formas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, se expone la siguiente posicion de principios de la RPDC: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Si EE.UU. desea de veras la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC debe conocerla correctamente y portarse como digna potencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no es el pais debil de pasado en que fue pisoteado por las bayonetas de las potencias por no haber contado con su soberania y fusiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs absurdo si EE.UU. piensa en que su ofensiva de \"canones\" y la supremacia aerea con que amedrentaba al mundo y arrodillaba a sus rivales jactandose de la tecnologia sofisticada, puedan asustar al ejercito y al pueblo de la RPDC y hacer temblarla con sus perversas maniobras de aislamiento y aplastamiento politicos y economicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tragedia es que EE.UU. no sabe demasiado de nuestra Republica Popular y de nuestro ejercito y pueblo que la aprecian mas que su vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. desea de veras la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC, debe conocer correctamente a esta que apoyan hasta decenas de millones de surcoreanos y portarse como digno pais grande.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No debe hablar nunca mas del dialogo y de la mejora de las relaciones anteponiendo las premisas ni del tratado de la no agresion tras renunciar las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC no son los que no puedan distinguir el astuto intento de EE.UU. ocultado en la propuesta del dialogo y del tratado de la no agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. EE.UU. debe renunciar, antes de que se haga tarde, su anejada politica hostil anti-RPDC saliendo del caduco modo de pensar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante algun tiempo, en conversaciones a puertas cerradas con la RPDC, EE.UU. solia decir que no tiene la politica hostil a la primera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En estos tiempos, lanza una propaganda en ocasiones oficiales en el sentido de que no tiene la politica hostil a la RPDC ni la intencion de derrocar el poder de ella mediante el ataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero en realidad, sigue definiendo a la RPDC como \"eje del mal\" y \"pais bribon\", que actua sin respetar la \"pauta legal\" y la \"norma internacional de accion\", e intenta lograr el derrumbe del regimen recrudeciendo gradualmente la campana de sancion, aislamiento y bloqueo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad evidencia que tales palabras de EE.UU. no pasan de ser una farsa para enganar la opinion publica interna y externa burlandose del ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para evitar el rencor de sangre y la venganza de nuestros uniformados y habitantes, EE.UU. debe tomar la valiente decision de cancelar su politica hostil a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. EE.UU. debe conocer correctamente el significado de la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y cancelar todas las medidas orientadas a aislar y atropellar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana es la meta politica invariable que quiere alcanzar el gobierno de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta desnuclearizacion comprende toda la Peninsula Coreana, inclusive el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla constituye el poderoso medio fisico y pacifista para eliminar hasta la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC abriendo pasos a la desnuclearizacion del mundo entero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras persistan la amenaza y el chantaje de EE.UU. para tomar a la RPDC, esta ganara mas tiempo provechoso y aquel buscara el tiempo que aceleraria su destino tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es decir, la RPDC dispuesta de los medios de ataque nuclear minimizados, diversificados y precisos prosperara mas con el paso de tiempo, pero EE.UU. sera marginado como espuma echada al borde de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para liberarse de la tambaleante situacion de ahora, EE.UU. debe cancelar todas las medidas de sancion contra la RPDC inventadas con pretextos absurdos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. no debe recurrir por mas tiempo al chantaje nuclear que ejerce a cualquier momento sobre la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuanto mas se eleve el grado de amenaza y chantaje nuclear, tanto mas contradictoria sera la situacion de EE.UU. que se hundiria en el pantano sin salida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especialmente, EE.UU. tiene que tomar la decision resuelta de cesar total e inmediatamente todos los actos provocativos como los ejercicios belicos de toda indole que se libran con el objetivo de derrocar nuestro regimen y ocupar nuestro territorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Enfatizamos una vez mas que ese pais debe tomar la decision politica de cancelar diversas medidas de aislamiento, aplastamiento y bloqueo contra la RPDC que se aplican como parte de su ambiciosa estrategia de dar importancia a Asia y Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He aqui el camino de la mejora de las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. y la garantia de la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y del propio territorio estadounidense."
