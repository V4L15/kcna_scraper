No one can guess how strong the military force of the DPRK is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. blusters that it would be able to occupy the DPRK within one hour. But this is nonsense in every aspect. The U.S. is still fighting a war with Iraq, a war which can hardly be considered to be an actual war. Then, how can it finish a war with the DPRK within one hour? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. invades the DPRK through a preemptive attack, the DPRK will turn the situation in favour of it by a strong counterattack. Then powers around Korea will inevitably react to it and this will have a strong impact on the development of the situation. The second Korean war can not but spill over into a new world war. It is quite natural that the U.S. can never finish such a war and world war within an hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why the U.S. imperialists are peddling such ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is to serve the purpose of its crafty awe strategy and psychological warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should clearly understand who their opponent is and drop their foolish ambition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK owes the U.S. nothing and it does not want to benefit from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not seek a selfish aim to attain something by wielding a stick against its dialogue partner and partially handle the nuclear issue in its favour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent moves would only chill the atmosphere of the talks and put them at a peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stand of the DPRK to participate in the talks with an easy mind, not being subject to any pressure including psychological one and discuss the issue in a sincere and candid atmosphere on the principle of impartiality and equality so as to make the talks fruitful and thus find a solution to the acute nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and achieve lasting peace and security on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
