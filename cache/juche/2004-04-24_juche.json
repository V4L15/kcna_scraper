            "content": "Japan's Frantic Moves for Militarism Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- Some days ago the Fukuoka District Court of Japan ruled that Koizumi's repeated visit to the Yasukuni Shrine was a violation of the constitution. But the Japanese ruling quarters are now openly justifying the visit to the shrine, wantonly challenging this decision.\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson today says this was an undisguised expression of the inveterate militarist frenzy of the Japanese ruling quarters as it is aimed to justify the visit to the shrine at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act is part of the premeditated moves to repeat the past history of aggression and revive militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more urgently needed for the Japanese reactionaries is to create a social atmosphere for reviving militarism because they are pushing forward the moves to convert Japan into a military giant and watching for a chance for overseas aggression, while zealously joining the U.S. in its unilateral moves for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The frantic attempt of the Japanese ruling quarters to realize the militarist overseas expansion is as reckless and foolish as jumping into fire with faggot on one's back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to know that their rash acts, prompted by militarist ambition, would entail irretrievable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persist in their moves to realize the militarist overseas expansion, defying this warning, Japan will cease to exist on this earth. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The KPA won a great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953) against the U.S. imperialists' invasion and brought about the beginning of decline for the U.S. imperialists for the first time in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the postwar period, it fully showed its ever-victorious heroic stamina by smashing their ceaseless military provocations such as the \"Pueblo\" incident (1968), \"EC-121\" incident (1969) and Panmunjom incident (1976). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With Kim Jong Il as its supreme commander, the KPA has become stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past ten years it has creditably defended the security of the state by sternly thwarting thousands of dangerous military provocations of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are some typical examples to show such things: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A KPA soldier shot down with a single shot a latest-type helicopter of the U.S. army which entered into the territorial air of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in December 1994. When the U.S. imperialists opened gunfire towards the DPRK site in the demilitarized zone of the Military Demarcation Line in July 1997, KPA soldiers, in retaliation for the military provocation, took such an immediate self-defence measure as raining fire on their pillboxes and artillery emplacements and destroying them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. imperialists aggravated the situation in Korea, taking issue with the DPRK over the \"issue of underground nuclear facilities\" and its launch of an artificial satellite in the end of the 1990s, the KPA dispirited them through a statement of its General Staff spokesman declaring that there is no limit in its striking force and the revolutionary army will answer the challenge of the U.S. imperialist aggression army without the slightest mercy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA will as ever emerge victorious by sternly smashing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
