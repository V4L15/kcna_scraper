            "content": "Bellicose remarks of S. Korean chief executive flayed\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of South Korea on Friday showed up at a graduation-cum-commencement ceremony of the Naval Military Academy and renewed his bellicose remarks inciting anti-north confrontation.   In an intention to exacerbate inter-Korean confrontation, he told a whopping lie that the north is \"sustaining the strategy of communizing the south.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As is known to the world, the DPRK has consistently held that the north and the south should work hard to improve their relations on the principle of great national unity, transcending differences in idea, ideology and systems, and accelerate their reunification. And it is making sincere efforts to this end.   This year the north proposed authority-to-authority talks to the south. This significant proposal is a proof of such efforts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean chief executive sticks to the conceptions of anti-north confrontation called \"strategy of communizing the south,\" the conception which was commonly used by the preceding dictators, separatists for the maintenance of power and \"security of power.\"   Basing himself on this fictitious doctrine, he said that the \"capabilities of South Korea-U.S. joint operation would be increased\" to further strengthen \"security cooperation\" and that \"security forces should be beefed up to the maximum. This is little different from the war slogan which was chanted at the time of the preceding military dictatorship for anti-north war preparations and provocation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The facts only prove that his arguments about \"reconciliation and cooperation\" and \"improvement of relations through dialogue\" are hypocrisy full of contradictions.   It is a typical expression of his flunkeyism and treachery to try to maintain \"security\" by doing harm to the fellow countrymen and relying on outsiders. If he truly wants improved north-south relations, he should choose the road of great national unity in the spirit of national independence. \r\n    \r\n"

This laser equipment is meant to confirm a hit through laser launcher attached to rifle and machinegun.

Korea's reckless arms buildup \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 17 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary lashing out at the reckless arms buildup being stepped up by the South Korean authorities against the north.   The news analyst of the paper says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean authorities are now hectic in their efforts to get \"approval and cooperation\" from the United States for its plan to develop and deploy \"medium-range missiles capable of striking targets in the north including Pyongyang\" under the groundless pretext of \"threats of the north's attack.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their reckless moves are an unpardonable treacherous act intended to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north by serving outside forces in a war  and plunge the Koreans into the scourge of war.   It is the U.S. invariable policy to threaten and stifle the DPRK with \"strength\" by beefing up its aggression armed forces and the  army and pushing ahead with war preparations on the Korean peninsula.   The South Korean authorities are now stepping up arms buildup in pursuance of the U.S. policy of aggression and war for the purpose of maintaining their power and gratifying their ambition for \"unification through northward invasion,\" backed by their masters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even according to their official announcement, South Korea has squandered 14.4 billion dollars as military spending every year. At present, it is the world's 2nd biggest buyer of U.S. lethal weapons.   In the final analysis, their outcries over \"threats of the north's attack\" are the height of folly.   Their frantic arms buildup proves that their talk about \"reconciliation and cooperation\" is nothing but a deceptive platitude.   Their reckless arms buildup and war preparations against the north will only precipitate their own destruction. \r\n \r\n"

It continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chinese characters in our dictionaries account for 70%.   Korean language useful in our life is hardly to be found while there are a lot of Chinese characters useless in our life.   We have thus become slaves of Chinese characters. Classical Korean culture should be carried forward by use of Korean language.   This slavery should be brought to a definite end.   The authorities must unconditionally cancel the \"policy on combined use of Chinese characters\". \r\n\r\n"

It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean authorities are crying they will meet demands of the workers through the deceptive \"Labor-Management-Government Committee.\" Nevertheless, they are further tightening the noose of harsh exploitation and subordination around the necks of workers in favour of foreign monopoly capitalists and local business groups.   It is only too clear that as long as the flunkeyist and treacherous labor laws of the South Korean authorities remain in force, there will be no change in worker's condition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Divided, one will lose and united, one will win.  Let us win the vital rights through our united struggle. This is a bitter lesson drawn by South Korean workers.   The South Korean workers will never lower the flag of struggle they have already upheld until their just demand is met and fully demonstrate the might of their tightened unity. \r\n \r\n  \r\n"

They are indomitable men, who set an example in devotedly defending the leader while drifting about in rough storms for nearly 3 months.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) sent to the homeland photos of their belongings and a letter found in their dead bodies which had been discovered in waters off various prefectures of Japan.   The bodies were hardly recognizable.  But, the witnesses found a box in which the Portrait of the President Kim Il Sung and the Portrait of General Secretary Kim Jong Il as well as badges bearing the Portrait of the President were kept dry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The heroes left a port to catch fish on November 5 last year. The sea weather went from bad to worse from that afternoon on.   The hydrometeorological service continued sending a warning signal on November 8-9.   They drifted about for a week, tossed about by strong wind and waves.   A wireless apparatus could not air an SOS because of the weak battery. Food and water ran out on the boat.   They buffeted violent waves, helping each other even at a time when their lives hung by a thread.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their bodies were found roped to a raft made of pieces of boards of the boat nearly three months after the distress.   The portrait box and the letter found along with them made a number of Japanese witnesses keenly realize once again the unshakable faith of the Korean people, who know how to live a worthy life and how to die.   \"convey our whereabouts, please.   A side-line fishing boat of the Korean People's Army with 15 servicemen and workers on board.    Convey all of us have fought courageously to the last moment as soldiers of Marshal Kim Jong Il.
