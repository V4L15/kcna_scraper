            "content": "National Meeting Marks Kim Jong Il's Election as NDC Chairman \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture Sunday to celebrate the 14th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's election as chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army Kim Il Chol, member of the NDC of the DPRK and minister of the People's Armed Forces, in a report said that the election of Kim Jong Il as the top leader of the state politics responsible for increasing the country's defence capacity and the state power as a whole provided the servicepersons and people of the DPRK with a sure guarantee for glorifying generation after generation President Kim Il Sung's idea of building self-reliant national defence forces and the exploits performed by him in the field and the cause of building a rich and powerful country and achieving the final victory of the Juche-oriented revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path of revolution covered by the DPRK, having Kim Jong Il at the head of its NDC, is a praiseworthy and proud one along which it has firmly defended Korean-style socialism of Juche, standing in confrontation with the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces single-handed and ushered in a dawn of a great prosperous powerful country on this land through world-startling tremendous creations and changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il that an all-people and nationwide defence system has been reinforced and the social trait of attaching importance to the military affairs and the army prevails in the country, converting the whole country into an invulnerable fortress and augmenting the DPRK's military muscle to be stronger than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can match the army and people of the DPRK single-mindedly united around the headquarters of Songun revolution on the basis of their absolute trust in the leader. This single-minded unity represents a great symbol of the invincibility of Songun Korea dynamically advancing toward the high peak of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation despite worldwide great political upheaval and provides a sure guarantee for achieving the victory of the Juche revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has legitimately ranked itself among the nuclear weapons states. This was a great victory of the Songun idea, the Songun revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea and a praiseworthy historic event as it translated into reality the centuries-old desire of the nation to have national power strong enough not to allow anyone to dare provoke it and provided a fundamental guarantee for dynamically advancing the cause of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation despite the imperialists' threat of a nuclear war and their moves for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's Songun politics consistent with the principle of national independence and patriotism ushered in the June 15 era of reunification, an embodiment of the idea of \"By our nation itself\", and brought about a landmark phase in the movement for national reunification. It, at the same time, helped the DPRK exalt its dignity and prestige on the international arena higher than ever before and significantly boost the international solidarity with the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for attaining a new target of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, stepping up the cause of national reunification and achieving the final victory of the Juche-based revolution, drawing on the victories and achievements of national historic significance made in the course of the great Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula still remains tense due to the U.S. incessant military provocations, he said, and went on: The DPRK is following with a high degree of vigilance the reckless moves of the U.S., Japan and other hostile forces.  Should anyone infringe upon the sovereignty and the dignity of the DPRK even a bit, the DPRK will sternly punish it with the matchless armed forces built under the Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were senior party, army and state officials.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a \"trade coup\" staged to deprive the people of their right to existence and a blatant challenge to them, the statement noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Committee for Emergency Measures for Agriculture, Stock-breeding and Fisheries to Check the Conclusion of south Korea-U.S. FTA in a statement stressed the need to decide on the issue of the conclusion of FTA with the U.S. through referendum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lawyers Association for Democratic Society in a statement accused the \"government\" of having struck the deal with the U.S. in a humiliating manner despite the people's worries and opposition. The \"government\" will not be able to evade the responsibility for breaching democracy and the spirit of the constitution, it warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Citizens' Federation for Economic Justice in a commentary expressed regret at the action taken by the \"government\" to unilaterally strike the deal, yielding to the pressure of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Headquarters of the All-People Movement for Checking the south Korea-U.S. Free Trade Agreement held a press conference in Seoul on April 3 at which it denounced the \"government\" for its submission to the U.S. At the end of the press conference its participants entered an all-night sit-in strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day members of the headquarters held a candlelight cultural event demanding a total nullification of the concluded FTA in front of the Sejong Cultural House.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Blasts Japan's Hindrance to Six-Party Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Saturday in its commentator's article deals with the approach taken by Japan to hinder the work of the six-party talks. Japan unreasonably insisted on the \"abduction issue\" that had already found a solution thanks to the magnanimity and sincerity of the DPRK at the talks, thus putting a brake on the implementation of the September 19 joint statement and the February 13 agreement and deliberately creating difficulties in the way of the talks, the article observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's participation in the six-party talks did nothing helpful but laid only a hurdle in their way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-party talks are a platform for discussing the issue of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula, not other matters irrelevant to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan might be well aware of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, however, kicked up a ruckus, politicizing and internationalizing an unimportant issue in a bid to scuttle the six-party talks and check the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the six-party talks should honor their commitments to serve the nature and purport of the talks with a view to realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula and ensuring peace there. It is as clear as noonday that the talks can hardly prove successful should any party insist on any issue irrelevant to the main purport of the talks to achieve its ulterior aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is nothing but a filibuster keen to chill the atmosphere of the six-party talks. No wonder, those following the talks are of the view that unless Japan is ordered to leave the conference hall the talks will prove fruitless and the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula will never find a solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the attitude and true intention of Japan to scuttle the six-party talks and check the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's escalated moves against the DPRK inside and outside the conference hall are aimed to becloud the prospect of the settlement of the nuclear issue and cite it as a pretext for its nuclear weaponization. It is the fear of the Abe forces that the denuclearization of the peninsula as a result of the successful six-party talks might deprive Japan of any justification for going nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK is its criminal intention to distort and deny its bitter past history including the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and revive militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, a historic tragedy and blunder that such country is allowed to attend the six-party talks that handle the above-said crucial issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe forces' theory of \"doing away with the postwar system\" and \"building beautiful Japan\" precisely means a doctrine for domination and a theory of hegemony as it calls for revenging its past defeat as a \"victimized state\", not as a war criminal state, and realizing its ambition to dominate Asia and the rest of the world. This is the sinister aim sought by the Abe forces in denying and distorting the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and crying out for getting rid of the postwar system and building beautiful Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A politician should have a more reasonable judgment and greater responsibility for the destiny of his country than anybody else. But the present Japanese ruling quarters do not have any of them. The only way out for Japan is to redeem its past and opt for peaceful development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto es lo que les falta a los actuales gobernantes del pais isleno. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La unica salvacion para este pais esta en optar por el desarrollo pacifico tras liquidar sus crimenes del pasado.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
