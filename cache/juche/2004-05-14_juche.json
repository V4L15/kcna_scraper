But they are talking about the cutback of some of them these days. Lurking behind this is a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld said that despite a change in the strength of the U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region the defense capability would grow stronger. His remarks suggest that even in case some of the U.S. forces are reduced, main U.S. combat forces and their modern war means will remain in the region and, on the contrary, they will be bolstered qualitatively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Bush advocated a \"policy of attaching importance to the Asia-Pacific region\" in a bid to establish an armed domination and control over the region. Pursuant to this policy, the U.S. is steadily increasing the operation capability of its aggression forces under the pretext of reorganization and reduction of its forces in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that the U.S. forces in south Korea are being equipped with modern hardware and its forces in Hawaii, Guam and Japan are also being bolstered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reactionary ruling quarters are raising a hue and cry over \"nuclear threat\" and \"missile threat,\" while advertising the U.S. forces cutback plan. This is nothing but a crafty artifice to permanently keep its aggression forces in this region. The real threat to the peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region comes from the U.S. conducting ceaseless war exercises of various forms, keeping a lot of nuclear weapons and huge aggressor forces there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants peace in this region, it should stop talking about someone's non-existent \"threat\" but reexamine its anachronistic strategy of strength and drop it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
