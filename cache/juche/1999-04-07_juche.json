The revenue and expenditure of last year were less than those in the early 1990s. But, the revenue was 0.4 % larger than that of 1997. This has enabled the nation's finance to take the road of fresh advance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state budget for 1999 has been worked out in such a way as to ensure that financial resources of the nation are concentrated on important sectors that play a key role in bringing about a great revolutionary upswing in socialist economic construction and making a turning-point in the building of a powerful nation.

            "content": "State budget for 1998 and on state budget for 1999\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Minister of Finance Rim Kyong Suk delivered a report on the first agenda item \"on the summing up of fulfillment of the state budget for Juche 87 (1998) and on the state budget for Juche 88 (1999)in the DPRK\" at the 2nd session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK which has opened today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year's state budget was creditably implemented through the stepped up forced march of socialism under the wise guidance of the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) despite all trials and difficulties.   The WPK has firmly maintained and executed the policy of securing necessary funds as much as possible by domestic efforts in reliance upon the financial foundation of the country even under the difficult conditions and effectively utilizing them on a priority basis for economic construction, national defense building and the people's living.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year, the total state budgetary revenue was 19,790,800,000 won, or 98 % of the plan, and the total state budgetary expenditure was 20,015,210,000 won, or 99 % of the plan.   Last year's state budgetary revenue and expenditure did not reach the level of the early 1990s in scale but the budgetary revenue showed an increase of 0.4 % over 1997.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As seen above, the finance of the country took a new road of advance last year with the increase in state budgetary revenue.   This is one of important achievements made in the struggle to carry out the state budget and bring the forced march of socialism to a successful end.   Last year, the DPRK government made sure that appropriations for the national economy were increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNotably, its outlay for the power, coal, metal and machine-building industries and railway transport showed an increase of 6 % as compared with the figure of the previous year.   Last year, the construction of large hydraulic power stations was stepped up forcefully, more than 5,000 minor power stations were erected in a single year and a foundation was laid to rapidly increase coal production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In addition, the DPRK succeeded in realizing the underground coal gasification, with the result that a bright vista was opened to make an effective use of coal resources abundant in the west coastal areas so as to solve the energy problem of the country and develop various domains of the national economy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the domain of the metal industry, a foundation was laid to lift steel production at the Songjin Steel Complex and other metal plants to a high level.   A large quantity of pig iron was produced at the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex as the Juche-based iron-producing method was invented and the construction of an oxygen-blown blast furnace was completed.   The machine-building industry consolidated its foundation on which to make a new leap forward in production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the domain of railway transport, its material and technical foundation was consolidated and Haeju-Ongjin and Singangryong-Pupho broad-gauge railways extending more than 60 km were laid out. As a result, the transport capacity markedly increased.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In the domain of agriculture, too, some progress was made  and a vista was opened for solving the food problem completely.   The WPK and the DPRK government invested a larger amount  of state funds in the agricultural domain than the previous year.   Many strains of high-yielding seeds were obtained and the technology of doing two-crop farming in paddy and non-paddy fields was developed and introduced in many areas. The number of composite micro-biological fertilizer factories increased to at least 100, which is a solid foundation to drastically increase grain production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year, the DPRK government made huge state investments in the construction of the capital city of Pyongyang and major projects in various domains.   Soldiers and constructors in the capital completed September 9 Street extending over 8 km and April 25 Hotel with the accommodation capacity of 20,000 persons in a matter of one year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year, the construction of the December 5 youth mine was dynamically stepped up and an extension project of electric furnace at the furnace shop of the October 13 youth iron works was finished and the electric furnace No. 3 at the carbide shop of the Sunchon Vinalon Complex and  the Loyal Sinpho Salt Refinery and the Pyongyang Integrated Circuit Plant were successfully built and put into operation. Besides, a large number of new dwelling houses were built in Pyongyang, local cities and rural areas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year, the DPRK government directed huge funds and state efforts to the city administration and land management, with the result that many successes were made in this domain. Kangwon Province pushed ahead with the land rezoning for the purpose of standardizing arable land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Last year the government of the DPRK allocated 14.6 % of the total budget of the state for the defense of Korean socialism.    Though there were a lot of things to be done for economic construction and betterment of the people's living, it attached priority to the military to meet the fundamental interests of the revolution, directed primary efforts to increasing national defense capabilities, built the People's Army into an invincible army equipped with highly-efficient sophisticated combat and technical means and further consolidated all-people, nationwide defense system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  She said last year a colossal amount of money was disbursed for the building of socialist culture.   She gave details of the fact that despite big difficulties for the last few years, the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) and the government of the DPRK have consistently pursued policies for the good of the people through the allocation of a huge amount of state fund and provided them with a great many additional material and financial benefits at state expense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She said all the successes gained in socialist economic construction and performance of the state budget fully demonstrate the validity of the WPK's line of economic construction and financial policy, as well as inexhaustible potentials of the independent national economy of Korea.   She attributed the proud achievements made in the forced march of socialism last year to the energetic wise guidance and distinguished strategy of the great Kim Jong Il, who devotedly led the whole party and army and all the people to a new victory.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She touched upon the state budget for 1999.   She quoted Kim Jong Il as saying \"We should bring about a turn in the building of a powerful nation this year.\"   He said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In hearty response to the militant slogan of the WPK \"Let this year mark a turning-point in building a powerful nation \" we should run at a canter on steed so as to build at an early date a prosperous powerful nation of Juche on this land of socialism, Kim Il Sung's country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state budget for 1999 has been compiled in such a way as to concentrate financial resources of the country on key domains of weighty importance in effecting a new upswing in the building of a powerful nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state revenue and expenditure for 1999 total 20,381,720,000 won respectively, up 3 % in total revenue and up 1.8 % in total expenditure over last year.   This year the state will increase the expenditure for the national economy by 2 % as against last year, the biggest shares of which will go to power industry and agriculture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For a decisive solution of food problem this year the government of the DPRK will make 11 % larger investment in agriculture than last year and channel big nationwide efforts into farming before anything else.   The investment in power industry will be 15 % bigger than last year.   This year the state will spend 10 % more funds than last year to upgrade coal, mining, metal and machine-building and other key industries and give precedence to railway transport.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year the WPK and the government of the DPRK will disburse a huge amount of funds for light and pharmaceutical industries.   This year the government of the DPRK will make a big financial allocation for carrying out vast projects in Pyongyang, the capital city of Juche Korea, for the construction of monumental edifices in the building of a powerful nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year the state will increase expenditure on land development and city management.   With a view to increasing the strength of the revolutionary armed forces the government of the DPRK envisages the allocation of 14.5 % of the total state budgetary expenditure for military spending this year.   This year state expenditure on scientific researches is expected to be up 10 % over last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also envisages a huge financial disbursement for education, health care, culture and physical culture and sports so as to push ahead with the building of socialist culture this year.   The government of the DPRK will send a lot of education aid fund and stipend to children of Koreans in Japan for their democratic national education this year, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The state budget for this year which has been submitted for deliberation at the current Supreme People's Assembly session, the reporter said, is a revolutionary and popular budget that gives a sure financial guarantee for the heroic struggle of the Korean people and the People's Army who have turned out as one to bring about a fresh great Chollima upsurge in socialist construction and a great turn in the building of a powerful nation by making the best of potentials of the socialist independent national economy of Korea. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Outbursts of high-ranking Japanese figure\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the director general of the Public Security Investigation Agency of Japan said at the diet there is the danger that the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) might \"conduct violent subversive activities.\"   Commenting on his outbursts, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;His outbursts are part of a premeditated plot to hurt the DPRK and Chongryon.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Chongryon is a dignified organisation of overseas Koreans. Since its foundation, it has conducted legal activities amid wide support and encouragement of honest-minded peoples of the world including the Japanese, firmly maintaining the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of Japan.   Nevertheless, the reactionary Japanese authorities have enforced an unjustifiable hostile policy toward the DPRK and committed subversive moves and plots against Chongryon in a planned way almost every day, groundlessly finding faults with it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It cannot go unnoticed that his outbursts came when the scenario of a second Korean war of aggression called \"possible scenario\" to cope with the \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula is afloat in Japan and the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves are being intensified over the \"mysterious ships pursuit case\" invented by the reactionary authorities.   This reveals the criminal intention of the Japanese reactionaries to intensify the anti-DPRK hostile policy and the suppression and restriction on Korean residents in Japan and, furthermore, launch into a more frantic campaign to destroy and disintegrate Chongryon on the plea of coping with \"emergencies.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The suppressive and subversive activities of the Japanese authorities against Chongryon are precisely a challenge and provocation against the DPRK. It can never overlook this.     The Japanese authority's hostile policy against the DPRK and Chongryon is an anachronistic one which seriously contravenes the universal declaration on human rights endorsed at the Japanese diet and the international covenant on human rights based on it.   The Japanese authorities should stop the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon racket at once. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This small factory brings in handsome profits every year.   The standout among others is  Koryo antibiotic suppository, a recently manufactured medicine. It markedly boosts the immunity and sterilizing functions. It has been highly effective for many cases which were not cured by penicillin, streptomycin and other poly-antibiotics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It produces a wide range of curative effect as it stimulates blood circulation through veins of the rectum without affecting the stomach and liver.    After administration, the suppository is absorbed within 7 to 8 hours of slow melting. It is particularly efficacious in the cases of tuberculosis, urinary diseases and abdominal inflammations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The factory's researchers have developed a new injection, Jangsaeng 1, for use in combination with the suppository. Experts find in this a new breakthrough in the treatment of aids, the world's hard nut to crack. \r\n\r\n"

The credit for this goes to General Secretary Kim Jong Il who is making tireless efforts for the immortality of the preceding leader.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun stresses this in a signed article today.   It says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The past 5 years are years of his loyalty and filial piety during which he has devotedly worked for the great leader.   The 5-year-long revolutionary history in which he has led the Korean revolution by himself was a revolutionary record of a great man, great revolutionary, the kind that could be set only by the supreme incarnation of communist moral obligation = it was a glorious revolutionary record which saved progressive humankind from moral crisis and paved the way for the immortality of the preceding leader.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He built the Kumsusan Memorial Palace into the most sacred temple of Juche to preserve  Kim Il Sung in state. That is his undying exploit for the immortality of the preceding leader.   His loyalty and filial piety culminated in constructing the palace for the immortality of the preceding leader.   His 5-year-long history is replete with his imperishable exploits in carrying forward and developing the Juche idea, the revolutionary idea of  Kim Il Sung, in an all-round way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While leading the contemporary revolution by himself in hard times, he conducted energetic ideo-theoretical activities to publish a great many works, including \"Socialism Is a Science,\" \"the Worker's Party of Korea Is the Party of the Great Leader Comrade  Kim Il Sung\" and \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction.\" All these works represent his unshakable faith and will to lead the revolution as indicated by the Juche idea, come what may.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The daily deals with every effort made by him to exalt the revolutionary exploits of  Kim Il Sung for all ages.

Kim Il Sung will always be with us thanks to the history of loyalty and filial piety of Kim Jong Il who is working toward the eternal brilliance of  Kim Il Sung's revolutionary exploits. \r\n"

I realized that South Korea is an anti-social, anti-worker system while the north is society for the workers.   The United States is the very one which drove South Korea into the worst financial crisis  and is plunging the workers into a piteous plight by totally controlling the South Korean economy through the IMF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To get rid of this wretched plight the South Korean workers must develop their struggle into an anti-U.S. struggle and fight against such a group of flunkeyists and traitors as the \"government for people\" which prolongs its days clinging to coattails of the U.S.    Unity is a key to victory in their anti-U.S., anti-\"government\" struggle. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
