Moreover, the Malaysian side clamored for the second autopsy without publishing the results of the first autopsy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Korean Jurists Committee in a statement on Wednesday termed this undisguised encroachment upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, a wanton human rights abuse and an act contrary to human ethics and morality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits more serous attention is the fact that the unjust acts of the Malaysian side are timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket launched by the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conservative media of south Korea began spreading wild rumors that the DPRK citizen was \"poisoned to death by two women agents of the General Reconnaissance Bureau of north Korea\" and it is undoubtedly its \"deed\" before the results of the autopsy were published.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On February 14, a day after his death, Chongwadae of south Korea kicked up a fuss over it and the south Korean authorities were busy holding a ministerial meeting on February 16, showing an excessive response. Moreover, they openly discussed the issue of THAAD deployment though it has nothing to do with the death of a DPRK citizen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the south Korean authorities has long expected the case since it worked out a scenario for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, regretful that only Malaysia is denying such fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The biggest responsibility for his death rests with the government of Malaysia as the citizen of the DPRK died in its land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unfriendly attitude of the Malaysian side found a more striking manifestation in the matter of transferring his body to the DPRK side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Malaysia is obliged to hand his body to the DPRK side as it made an autopsy and forensic examination of it in an illegal and immoral manner. However, it has not yet handed the body under the absurd pretext that it cannot do so unless the family of the deceased presents a DNA sample in accordance with its law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the Malaysian side is going to politicize the transfer of the body in utter disregard of international law and morality and thus attain a sinister purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early days when the incident happened Malaysia widely publicized that it arrested suspected persons but now keeps mum about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What sounds more alarming is that the suspected persons allegedly stated that the DPRK citizen was poisoned to death when \"oil like lotion was put on his head with their hands.\" That means the woman survived even after having poison on her hand while leaving only the poisoned man dead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already proposed a joint investigation for properly probing the incident and clarified that it is ready to dispatch a delegation of its jurists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its aim is to meet the suspected persons and hear their statements, confirm who ordered them and meet the arrested citizen and survey in detail the scene of the incident and its video footage and thus conclude the investigation into the incident in a fair way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never allow any attempt to tarnish the image of the dignified power of independence and nuclear weapons state but make a thorough probe into the truth behind the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will watch the future attitude of the Malaysian side."

The news instantly jolted the world and the international community is acknowledging the nuclear attack capability of the DPRK that has made rapid progress in quality. \n\t\t\t\t\t Leading media of the world are unanimous in assessing that the acknowledged success in the test-fire of Pukguksong-2 was a demonstration of the DPRK's strategic superiority as it proved impossibility of advance detection by satellite, interception and preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, a neighboring country, which often claims itself to be a \"friendly neighbor\", is downplaying the significance of the test-fire, branding it as a \"nuclear technology just at the beginning\" and threatening \"the DPRK will suffer the biggest loss.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, it has unhesitatingly taken inhumane steps such as totally blocking foreign trade related to the improvement of people's living standard under the plea of the UN \"resolutions on sanctions\" devoid of legal ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has often stated that the UN \"resolutions on sanctions\" should not have negative impact on the people's living.

The U.S. termed it a \"provocation\" and denounced the DPRK for posing threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent days, it held a drill of intercepting the DPRK's rockets together with Japan and the south Korean puppet forces. This is no more than a deliberate act aimed to escalate the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme phase and shift the blame on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's rocket launch is a legitimate right from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is claimed that it does not present any problem for other countries including the U.S. to launch missiles at any time, but it is a violation of law for the DPRK to conduct the test-fire for self-defense. This is quite unreasonable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one should fault the DPRK's measures for self-defense. If U.S. and its stooges work hard to slander and put pressure upon the DPRK, the latter cannot but take a step of stronger physical counteraction. This is the legitimate right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will fully exercise the right to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation no matter what others may say."

Como estaba esperandolo la policia secreta de Malasia lo hizo sin ton ni son como un hecho consumado y propuso el problema de autopsia del cadaver creando complejidades del caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Embajada de la RPDC aclaro la posicion de que no hay necesidad de hacer autopsia porque fue confirmado como muerte por el choque cardiaco y que no puede hacerlo porque el fallecido es poseedor del pasaporte diplomatico que es el objeto de jurisdiccion extraterritorial segun el Convenio de Viena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la parte de Malasia realizo la autopsia del cadaver sin ningun acuerdo con la parte coreana ni presencia de esta despreciando nuestra demanda justa y la ley internacional e insistio en la necesidad de la segunda autopsia sin publicar el resultado de la primera prueba.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene la abierta violacion a la soberania de la RPDC y a los derechos humanos y un acto antietico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi condena el vocero del Comite de Juristas de Corea en su declaracion del dia 22 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no podemos pasar por alto es que tales actos injustos de la parte malasiana se coinciden en el mismo tiempo con los alborotos de intriga de las autoridades surcoreanas contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de ser publicado el resultado de autopsia los medios de prensa conservadores del Sur de Corea empezaron a divulgar con teson los rumores del \"envenenamiento por las dos agentes del Buro General de Reconocimiento del Norte de Corea\" y de la \"innegable maniobra del Norte de Corea\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe manifesto muy claramente la reaccion de las autoridades surcoreanas: el dia 14, un dia despues del caso, Chongwadae empezo a hacer bulla y se realizo el dia 16 la reunion a nivel ministerial y, al fin y al cabo, discutieron abiertamente hasta el emplazamiento de \"THAAD\", asunto que no tiene ninguna relacion con la muerte de nuestro ciudadano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto muestra claramente el hecho de que las autoridades surcoreanas estan previendo este caso y preparando hasta su guion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, solo Malasia da espaldas a tales hechos, lo cual resulta muy lamentable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobierno malasiano tiene mayor responsabilidad del caso porque el ciudadano de la RPDC murio en el territorio de Malasia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conducta hostil de Malasia se manifesto mas claramente en el problema de transferencia del cadaver.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse pais, que hizo de modo ilegal e inmoral el examen de medicina legal, deberia volver merecidamente el cadaver a la parte coreana. Pero, todavia no lo entrega presentando el pretexto absurdo de que es imposible trasladarlo antes de que la familia del muerto presente la muestra de DNA segun la ley de Malasia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra que la parte de Malasia persigue alcanzar un objeto malsano politizando el problema de traslado del cadaver sin tomar en consideracion la ley internacional y la etica y la moralidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, a principios del caso, Malasia hablo ruidosamente de que detuvieron el sospechoso del asesinato. Pero, despues no refiere nada al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas ridiculo es la insistencia en que el fallecido fue envenenado por un liquido igual con un aceite que untaron con la palma de mano a la cabeza del muerto. Entonces, ?por que no murio esa mujer que engraso ese liquido en su mano?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos planteado la investigacion conjunta por la aclaracion correcta de este caso y aclaramos la posicion de que estamos preparados para enviar la delegacion de juristas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQueremos enviar al terreno la delegacion de juristas para escuchar la declaracion de los presuntos de asesinato, verificar a los autores del caso, encontrarse con nuestro ciudadano arrestado e investigar detalladamente el terreno del caso y los datos de video, asi como concluir imparcialmente la investigacion del caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo perdonaremos jamas cualquier intento de manchar la imagen digna de la potencia independiente y la nuclear, sino descubriremos hasta el fin los secretos de este incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservaremos la conducta futura de Malasia."
