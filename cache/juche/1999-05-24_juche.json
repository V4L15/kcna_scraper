It is engaged in terrorism and plotting to do harm to any country, if it stands against or is unacceptable to the United States.   After all,  the argument about \"nuclear suspicion\" of the DPRK  turned out to be false because it is based on \"secret information\" provided by the CIA, a master-hand in reversing black and white.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dignity of a pressman is guaranteed by objectivity and impartiality. This indicates that the journalist of Washington Times has lost his dignity as he provoked the DPRK with false information. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Truth about test-firing of new missile in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- The propaganda department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South  Korea (NDFSK) made public an indictment titled \"We uncover the truth of the test-firing of a new missile in South  Korea\" on May 20, according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe South  Korean authorities recently test-fired a missile of new type developed by the South  Korean National Defence Science Institute at the Anhung General Missile Firing Range on the west coast of Korea. Announcing that it was the missile \"Hyonmu\", which  was already developed and completed in 1987 and deployed in the forward area along the truce line to be ready to go into action, they asserted that this was a test for developing \"materials for its wing and other parts.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The NDFSK in the indictment said:   The authorities argued that the recent test-firing was made to \"develop parts\" 12 years after their successful development of \"Hyonmu\" with 176-250 km range. This is a sophism which can convince no one.\r\nThe South  Korean authorities have escalated the missile development since early in the 1970s and developed and completed \"Paekgom,\" \"Hyonmu\" and other missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having worked out a plan to develop a missile with a range of 500 km by the year 1995 and a missile with a range of 1,500 km by the year 2000, they have pushed ahead with it in real earnest by employing such crafty methods as allotted,   research and development and joint production at the National Defense Science Institute and Aero- Space Institute under the pretext of \"development of space industry.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. asserted that it is a missile of new type the range of which could be well beyond 300 km in case it is fully charged with propellant fuel after photographing the course of the missile test-firing by an intelligence satellite.  And the \"Minister of National Defence\" said he could not disclose its actual flight-capacity because it was a military secret. This clearly proves that the National Defence Science Institute developed and test-fired a missile of new type by increasing its efficiency and lengthening the range of the existing missile \"Hyonmu.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The test-firing is a product of the reckless and provocative anti-north confrontation policy of the present \"government\" and its moves for a war against the north. This proves that the United States is sticking to its double standards as regards its missile policy toward the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlthough the United States ostensibly restricted the missile development in South  Korea to the range of 180 km, it has encouraged South  Korea's missile development by providing technology of manufacturing satellites and developing carrier rockets as well as missile designs and all kinds of equipment for its development and systematically increased the capacity of the \"ROK\" army for a war against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If it continues applying double standards to the Korean peninsula  the DPRK-U.S. missile talks now under way will come to a rupture and this will increase the military tensions and danger of war on the peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the heinous ambition of the Kim Dae Jung \"government\" to step up the missile development under the U.S. patronage and support behind the scene, join the ranks of semi-nuclear weapon states such as Japan in a few years to come and have a military edge in the inter-Korean relations to overpower the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reality clearly shows that though South  Korea makes any weapon with the  help of the United States, it will not be for the nation and the people but bring only calamities to them as it will be under the U.S. control and used for the execution of a war against the north as long as the U.S. colonial policy toward South  Korea remains unchanged.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present \"government\" should give up a foolish and base ambition to stifle the north by developing new type weapons and take the road of national reconciliation and great national unity at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

The KPA is highly honored to have the great leader Kim Jong Il, who has far-sighted wisdom, tested leadership ability, matchless grit and outstanding strategy, in high esteem as its Supreme Commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The anti-socialist moves and war fever of the imperialist allied forces against the DPRK have reached the highest pitch in recent five years.\r\n    Last year the DPRK was in a touch-and-go situation  in which a war may break out any time following the announcement of \"5027 operation plan\" by the bellicose U.S. military quarters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    A spokesman for the KPA general staff in a statement clarified its hard-line stand that the KPA would meet the challenge of the U.S. aggression  forces by a fatal blow.    Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il long ago made clear an immutable truth that  peace and socialism are guaranteed by the power of the gun,  army is the party, people and state, and socialism  can be defended and national reunification  can be achieved by a strong army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    He defined revolutionary leadership with priority given to the army as a leadership way of revolution and has exerted primary efforts to strengthen the  revolutionary armed forces, bringing about a signal success in army building.   In recent four years he inspected more than 330 People's Army units, covering  46,280 km.    Among them were forefront units including those defending Panmunjom, Mt. Thaedok, and heights 351 and 1211.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Whenever moves of the enemy grew serious and the situation of the country became strained, he inspected combined units and units of the People's Army to take operational steps to provide against the reckless provocations of the enemy and encourage the People's Army soldiers to struggle and feats.    His revolutionary leadership with priority given to the army is the source that made it possible for the KPA to grow to be an invincible army. \r\n\r\n"

It will direct big efforts to operating power plants in full capacity, step up the construction of large hydro-power plants and build new large  power plants. Minor power stations will be built on a large scale  along rivers and streams in localities to meet the need of electric power in cities and counties and realize rural electrification on a high level.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The construction of power plants is being pushed forward throughout  the country.\r\n   The builders of the Anbyon Youth Power Station are substantially carrying on the project, concentrating all efforts  on the project after finishing the initial water storage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The builders of the Namgang Power Plant are stepping up hundreds of metres of parapet and embankment projects.    The builders of the Thaechon power plants nos. 2 and 3 have finished the production makeshift project which is equal to the construction of a big factory, while pushing ahead with excavation for  the main dam.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year the state allocated for the power industry 6 percent bigger funds than the previous year to increase generating capacity.    As a result, the construction of large hydro-power plants was accelerated and 5,000 minor power stations have been built across the country.   The prospect of the country's power industry development  is very good.   Deposits of anthracite, brown and other coal are abundant and there are thousands of big and small  rivers and streams. The country is rich in resources of tidal power, wind power and atomic energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The state is exerting sustained efforts to make an effective use of all resources and expand and consolidate power bases of the country,  a breakthrough in building a powerful socialist nation and life line of the national economy. \r\n  \r\n"

Commenting on this, a news analyst of rodong sinmun today says:   The exercise to be participated in by military officers above army corps-level is not a \"defensive exercise\" but a preliminary war gamble, a mock war on the eve of a real war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The exercise, part of moves to unify the military command system according to the U.S. \"5027 operation plan\", a plan for a second war of aggression on Korea, is a dangerous war gamble that has made provocation of a war against the north a fait accompli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK does not want war but it is always merciless to provokers, the commentary says, adding that if they encroach upon even an inch of the  territory of the DPRK, the Korean People's Army will never miss the opportunity to deal a telling blow to the aggressors. \r\n\r\n"
