He said the light water reactor supply and humanitarian food assistance should be discontinued.\r\n   He, styling himself a scholar, would not have made such remark, inviting worldwide ridicule, if he had had a proper thinking pattern and a sound sense of the time.\r\n   The LWR supply is an important project under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement, which set a milestone in the improvement of bilateral relations. It is good developments that the U.S. and other countries are taking active part in the project. However, Taylor, who has nothing to do with the project, is despicably pouring cold water on the project.\r\n   His remark is apparently abuses against the U.S. Administration and those countries that are taking part in the project. His abuses, however, are as foolish as trying to sweep the sea with a broom.\r\n   Many countries and international organizations have rendered food and other relief goods to the DPRK, which has suffered from repeated flood damage, encouraging the Korean people in their \"arduous march\". \r\n   Taylor's abuses are an undisguised challenge to the international usage and humanitarian principles concerning disasters.\r\n   Taylor even talked about \"collapse\" of the DPRK. Before he said if the U.S. gave no \"assistance\" to the DPRK, it would \"collapse\" soon. But this time he said the DPRK should be let to go down by itself without assistance.\r\n   His remark is not enough to hurt our invincible and solid system. But it has sparked off the resentment of the Korean people. He, who once made eyes at the DPRK, is now maliciously slandering it.\r\n   From the beginning of the '90s, he had visited the DPRK more than once for \"improvement of DPRK-U.S. ties\", speaking highly of it.\r\n   He expressed sympathy with the DPRK's will and stand and voiced willingness to make efforts for the improvement of DPRK-U.S. relations. Now, however, he has reduced to a mouthpiece of the south Korean \"Agency for National Security Planning\", bribed by it.\r\n   No matter how faithfully serving the south Korean puppets, such a human dreg has nothing to get but worldwide ridicule and denunciation.    \r\n \r\n"

Korea accused of trying to check Japanese delegation's visit to DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK-Japan Friendship Society issued a statement today, accusing the south Korean puppets of putting a spoke in the wheel of the moves for the improvement of DPRK-Japan ties, in connection with the soon-to-be-held visit to the DPRK by a delegation of three ruling coalition parties of Japan.\r\n   The spokesman says:\r\n   The south Korean puppet authorities are resorting to mendicant diplomacy for the revocation of the planned Pyongyang visit of the Japanese delegation. They ask for delaying the time of the visit, arguing that the visit is not timely and may have an adverse impact on certain \"talks.\"\r\n   Meanwhile, they lay stress on the so-called \"unreasonable nature\" of the visit.\r\n   This emanates from their sinister political intention to check the improvement of DPRK-Japan ties, get rid of their worsening international isolation and maintain the anti-DPRK \"cooperation system\" at any cost.\r\n   The planned Korea visit of the delegation reflects the desire of the two peoples of the DPRK and Japan, and meets the requirement of the time. \r\n   In view of the demand of the present time for independence, peace and friendship, the DPRK-Japan relations should be improved at an early date and should not be postponed any longer.\r\n   This notwithstanding, the south Korean puppets have left no stone unturned to lay a stumbling-block in the way of the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations with the anachronistic way of thinking to isolate and stifle the fellow countrymen in conspiracy with outsiders.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime is forsaken by the nation and rejected even within the ruling group for the thrice-cursed crimes it committed during its five years of office. It still fails to discard its bad habit, and engages itself in anti-DPRK confrontation campaign abroad. Its unpardonable crime of  driving a wedge between the DPRK and Japan is denounced by the world people, including the Korean and Japanese peoples.\r\n   The dishonest moves of the south Korean puppets to block progress in the DPRK-Japan relations, going against the desire of the two peoples of the DPRK and Japan and the demand of the time, will end in failure.\r\n   The dog barks, the caravan goes on. \r\n   The improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations is an irresistable trend of history.\r\n   The south Korean puppets should be aware of their miserable lot of prolonging their remaining days as colonial stooges in reliance upon outsiders and immediately stop their foolish act of keeping others from improving the DPRK-Japan relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
