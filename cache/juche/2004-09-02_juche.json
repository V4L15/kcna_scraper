K. Chopra, chairman of the Indian Intellectuals' Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, at the seminar said the DPRK under the Songun policy is displaying its dignity as an independent powerful nation on the globe today when imperialism is thrashing around in aggression, interference and arbitrariness. Only victory and glory are in store for the DPRK as long as the Korean people uphold the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songchit Pullarp, chairman of the Organization for the Study of the Juche Idea of Thailand, at the lecture said the development of the DPRK is unthinkable apart from the unique Songun policy. The Songun policy enables the DPRK to achieve great successes today, he noted, adding: From the course of the development of the DPRK we should deeply understand the validity and originality of the Songun policy pursued by      Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Messages of greetings to Kim Jong Il were adopted at the celebration meeting and seminar held in Pakistan and India. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, an explanation meeting, film shows and a celebration party were held in Lemba District of Kinshasa, Democratic Congo, the Antam TBK Co., Indonesia, and the Leoncio Prado Military School and Thomas Jefferson Preliminary Military School, Peru, from Aug. 23 to 26. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Screened at the film shows were Korean films including \"The International Friendship Exhibition\" and \"The Three-Revolution Exhibition.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They should also invigorate the struggle for independence and peace against imperialism and war with concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will, as ever, remain true to the fundamental principle and idea of the movement and discharge its responsibility and role for the global independence and the development of the movement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
