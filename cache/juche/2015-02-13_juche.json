and on the basis of the organizational and ideological groundwork of building a party and the glorious revolutionary traditions created in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution, he founded a revolutionary party of the Juche type, the Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy enhancing the leadership role of the Party in the revolution and construction, he led to victory the Fatherland Liberation War, postwar reconstruction and two stages of social revolution, built the people-centred socialist system of our own style, achieved socialist industrialization of our country from scratch, and turned it into a powerful socialist country, which is independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in national defence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe great Comrade Kim Jong Il formulated Comrade Kim Il Sung's revolutionary ideology as Kimilsungism and developed our Party into an ideologically pure and organizationally integrated body in which monolithic ideological and leadership systems are firmly established, into a motherly party which has formed a harmonious whole with the masses and serves them, into a seasoned and experienced party which is possessed of a high level of leadership art, and into a promising party which has definitely been assured of the leadership being inherited. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the days of the Arduous March and forced march, when our people and revolution faced the worst-ever hardships and trials, he developed our Party into the guiding force of the Songun revolution, firmly safeguarding the sovereignty of our country and nation, developing our motherland into a single-heartedly united politico-ideological power and into an invincible military giant, which no formidable enemy dares to provoke, and kindling the flames of the industrial revolution in the new century to lay a firm foundation on which we can effect a great leap forward, great innovations, in building our country into an economic giant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe exploits of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, who laid an eternal cornerstone for the victorious advance of our country and revolution by leading the cause of building a party of the Juche type and a prosperous country along the road resplendent with victory, will shine for all ages to come. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the steadfast will of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un to further develop our Party and our Republic, which were founded by Comrade Kim Il Sung and led by him and Comrade Kim Jong Il, into the party and state that will shine forever together with the ideas and august names of the great leaders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy formulating Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism as the eternal guiding ideology of our Party and revolution, he has provided a fundamental guarantee for developing ours into the party of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, and under the unfurled banner of modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism, he is wisely leading to victory the showdown with the United States and the building of a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder his outstanding and seasoned leadership, the prestige and authority of our Party are being raised remarkably, and the history and tradition of victory of heroic Korea are being carried forward to the hilt, and the cause of building a thriving nation is advancing full of vigour despite the incessant moves of the imperialist reactionaries to isolate and suffocate our country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe respected Comrade Kim Jong Un said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"We must hold up the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il as the eternal leaders of our Party and people, as the sun of Juche, and step up modelling the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism so as to build on this land a dignified, thriving socialist country, a powerful Paektusan nation, as wished by the great Generalissimos.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll Party members, service personnel and people, rallied behind the Party ring after ring under the slogan \"Let us all turn out in the general offensive to hasten final victory in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu!\" must make greater efforts to create a new speed of the times, the speed of Korea, in building a thriving socialist country and demonstrate to the whole world the prestige and mettle of the prospering Songun Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea has adopted a resolution on the measures aimed at greeting the 70th anniversaries of Party founding and national liberation as revolutionary, auspicious events of Songun Korea which is prospering under the leadership of the great Party by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit and mettle of Paektu. The resolution reads in the following vein:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst, we will hold the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the eternal leaders of our Party and people and add eternal brilliance to their immortal revolutionary exploits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will splendidly lay out the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun, where the great Generalissimos are preserved in their lifetime appearances, as the eternal sanctuary of the sun and defend it to the death, and have their bronze and coloured statues set up at such important units as those visited by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will renovate the Korean Revolution Museum as befits the storehouse of national treasures, where one can learn the revolutionary careers of the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu and their immortal exploits in a comprehensive way, spruce up other bases for education in revolutionary traditions and intensify educational work through them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecond, we will strengthen the Party and consolidate rock-solid the single-hearted unity of our Party and revolutionary ranks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a decisive guarantee for carrying forward through the generations and accomplishing under the leadership of the respected Marshal Kim Jong Un the revolutionary cause of Juche and the revolutionary cause of Songun pioneered on Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will establish stringent organizational discipline whereby the whole Party acts as one under the monolithic leadership of the respected Marshal, and consolidate the political and ideological position of our revolution by taking hold of public sentiments and uniting the masses of the people firmly around the Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThird, we will hold fast to the Party's line of the Songun revolution so as to build up our national self-defence capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to achieve final victory in the showdown with the United States and speed up the building of a thriving socialist country, it is urgent to strengthen the People's Army, the buttress and main force of the Songun revolution, develop defence industry and step up the work of arming all the people and fortifying the whole country on a high level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will establish the monolithic command system of the respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un more firmly across the People's Army and press on with the movement of winning the titles of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment and Guards Unit, in order to develop the army into an invincible force of guards who are fully possessed of the spirit of defending their leader and country to the death, the strongest in idea and faith, and capable of winning all battles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will display the same spirit and mettle as we did in conquering outer space to manufacture larger numbers of powerful, cutting-edge military hardware of our own style that are of high precision, light, unmanned and intelligent, so that we can cope with modern warfare, and develop defence industry by relying on latest science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFourth, we will raise a fierce wind and achieve a major leap forward on all the fronts where we are building a thriving socialist country, in order to usher in a great golden age of Songun Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat all sectors and all units of the national economy accelerate the onward march to bring about an upsurge in the building of an economic giant is a sure guarantee for fully demonstrating the country's might as a politico-ideological and military power and achieving a brilliant triumph in the struggle to build a thriving nation and defend socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will open up a shortcut to the building of the knowledge-based economy by developing science and technology and going beyond the cutting edge, and bring about a radical turn in improving the people's standard of living by resolving the food problem of the people with crop cultivation, animal husbandry and fishing as the main thrusts and directing great efforts to developing light industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn particular, we will firmly take hold of agriculture as an area of major thrust, enlist and concentrate nationwide efforts for agricultural production, speed up the building of the livestock farming base in the Sepho area, and make a fresh turn in the development of animal husbandry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will open up a new era of \"gold sea\" and make the whole socialist country permeated with the fragrant smell of fish and other kinds of seafood by decisively bolstering up the fishing sector, and direct uninterrupted efforts to developing light industry so as to increase the production of consumer goods for the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will thoroughly translate the Party's Juche-oriented idea on architecture into reality and usher in a new golden age of construction by completing without fail and by the dates set by the Party such major projects as building the Sci-Tech Complex, Mirae Scientists Street, second-stage Wisong Scientists Dwelling District, Terminal 2 of Pyongyang International Airport, Building No 3 of Kim Il Sung University, Pyongyang University of Architecture and Secondary School No 1 and renovating the Central Zoo and Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will make a leap forward in the vanguard sectors, basic industries, including electric-power generation, coal mining, rail transport and metal, chemical and machine-building industries, and other major sectors of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will direct nationwide efforts especially to expediting the construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station, the multi-tier power stations on the Chongchon River and the Wonsan Army-People Power Station, and to stepping up modernization of factories and enterprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will bring about a new turn in the fields of education, public health service, art and literature, mass media and sports and in conserving the cultural heritage of our nation and exalting their brilliance by putting spurs to the building of a civilized socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will enlist the whole Party, the entire army and all the people in restoring the forests of the country and improving the work of land administration so as to transform the appearance of the country's land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will arouse the whole society to vigorously conduct mass-based movements like those of winning the titles of Forest of Socialist Patriotism and Model County in Afforestation, and push ahead with the work of covering the whole country with fruit and other trees and flowers on the strength of cooperation between the service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFifth, we will make a vigorous effort to achieve the historic cause of national reunification and promote international solidarity with our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHolding aloft the slogan \"Let the whole nation join efforts to open up a broad avenue to independent reunification in this year of the 70th anniversary of national liberation!\" we will resolutely frustrate the anti-DPRK war moves and nuclear and human rights rackets by the US imperialists and the south Korean puppets and open up a broad avenue to independent reunification by uniting firmly all the fellow countrymen in the north, in the south and abroad under the banner of patriotism, under the ideal of By Our Nation Itself; we will also develop foreign relations in a multilateral and proactive way, and strengthen international solidarity with our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSixth, we will organize and hold events in celebration of the 70th anniversaries of Party founding and national liberation as grand political festivals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will hold in grand style a parade of the service personnel of the ground, naval, air and anti-aircraft and strategic forces of the Korean People's Army and a procession of Pyongyang citizens in celebration of the Party's 70th anniversary so as to fully demonstrate at home and abroad the might of the service personnel and people united single-heartedly behind the respected Marshal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will also hold different political events in a meaningful way to mark these landmark anniversaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe resolution, in its last part, stressed the need for Party organizations and other political organs at all levels to thoroughly implement the tasks set forth in the resolution by scrupulously arranging organizational and political work to carry it out and regularly keeping up-to-date with the progress of the work, and for the Cabinet and other relevant organs to take administrative and practical measures to carry out these tasks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking back with deep emotion upon the immortal revolutionary exploits the peerlessly great men of Mt Paektu performed for the development of the Party and the building of a prosperous country, our service personnel and people are now filled with a firm determination to work harder to achieve the final victory of the revolution under the leadership of the great Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInvincible is the cause of the Workers' Party of Korea, the party of the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, which is advancing under the leadership of the respected Comrade Kim Jong Un holding aloft the banner of independence and Songun, and certain is the final victory of the building of a thriving socialist nation, a powerful Paektusan nation."

This means its admission of the reality in which the U.S. military muscle has become weak and financial resources have gone down the drain, first of all. In other words, it is nothing but a stop-gap measure to calm down the international criticism of its unilateral policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is also a vivid manifestation of the U.S. wild ambition for world domination aimed to rally its allies and contain rivals now that its unilateralism no longer works in the international arena today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example is the emphasis put on the rebalancing strategy in Asia-Pacific and the revelation of its attempt to stop Russia and China from expanding their influences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also mentioned the shift of diplomatic, economic and military influences to the Asia-Pacific region, strengthened security cooperation and bilateral relations with its allies, aid to Southeast Asian nations now locked in territorial disputes with China, escalated intervention in the regional organizations such as the Association of Southeast Asian Nations and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also revealed an attempt to intensify the monitoring and control over China's modernization of its army and expansion of its clout and to conclude an agreement on the trans-pacific partnership, a link in the whole chain of its rebalancing strategy in Asia-Pacific and thus establish a new economic order led by the U.S. and counter China's economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pointing to Russia, the report branded Ukrainian crisis as \"a serious challenge to the national security\" of the U.S. and vowed to \"make the Putin government pay a due price and to strongly deter it from opting for expanding its hegemony\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While renewing its security commitments with EU countries, the U.S. in the report mentioned intensified military activities in the middle and eastern regions of Europe to prevent Russia's invasion and vowed to pursue long-term and short-term plans for curtailing Europe's dependence on Russia's natural resources. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the \"nuclear issue\" in the DPRK in the report as usual, the U.S.  asserted that north Korea's provocation is likely to lead to tension. Facts, however, more clearly prove that \"nuclear issue of north Korea\" touted by the Obama administration is nothing but a subterfuge for carrying out its strategy for world domination and the recently published report is a conspiratorial document admitting this.   It is by no means fortuitous that the international community interprets the recent report as one aimed to \"contain and tame China\" and justifies its strategy to \"contain Russia from expanding its influence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. aggressive aim to contain major big powers and dominate the world will never change just as leopards never change their spots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. cover up its self-complacence and arrogance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. scenario for world domination is bound to fail just as the Roman Empire's wild ambition went bust."

En esa ocasion tambien se pondran de pleno manifiesto el alto prestigio y la combatividad de nuestro Partido que en la nueva centuria logra resonantes triunfos y logra el mayor fortalecimiento y prosperidad del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl librar durante 20 anos una sangrienta guerra contra el imperialismo japones enarbolando la bandera de la independencia, el gran Lider Kim Il Sung lo derroto, cumplio la historica tarea de liberar al pais y, a partir del cimiento ideologico-organizativo para la fundacion de un partido y las brillantes tradiciones revolucionarias preparadas durante la revolucion antijaponesa, fundo el Partido del Trabajo de Corea, una organizacion revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl multiplicar su papel rector en la revolucion y la construccion, condujo a la victoria la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria, la rehabilitacion y construccion de postguerra y la revolucion social en dos etapas, establecio nuestro regimen socialista centrado en las masas populares, concluyo la industrializacion socialista y convirtio al pais en un poderoso Estado socialista independiente politica, economica y militarmente, venciendo multiples dificultades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego de formular la idea revolucionaria de Kim Il Sung como kimilsungismo, el gran Dirigente Kim Jong Il convirtio a nuestro Partido en una agrupacion ideologicamente pura y organicamente integra que tiene bien establecidos los sistemas de ideologia y direccion unica, en una madre que logra total armonia con el pueblo y le ofrece mejores servicios, en una organizacion probada y experimentada con un gran arte de mando y en una gran promesa que garantiza la continuidad de la direccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl consolidar a nuestro Partido como fuerza orientadora de la revolucion del Songun durante la Marcha Penosa, la Forzada, cuando nuestro pueblo y revolucion enfrentaban pesimos y multiples contratiempos y dificultades, el gran Dirigente  Kim Jong Il salvaguardo firmemente la soberania nacional e hizo del pais una potencia ideo-politica sustentada en la unidad monolitica y una invencible potencia militar a la que ninguno, por muy fuerte que sea, se atreve a agredir. Tambien dio inicio de la revolucion industrial de la nueva centuria y asento una solida base para producir grandes saltos e innovaciones en la construccion de la potencia economica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe transmitiran a toda la posteridad los meritos de los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il quienes al conducir hacia la victoria la causa de la construccion de un partido autoctono y la edificacion de un pais poderoso y prospero prepararon una base de eterna duracion para el victorioso avance de nuestra patria y revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsociar eternamente con la ideologia y los respetables nombres de los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il a nuestro Partido y Republica, fundados por el primero y orientados por los dos, es la invariable voluntad del estimado companero Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl formular el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo como eterna ideologia rectora de nuestro Partido y revolucion, Kim Jong Un preparo la garantia fundamental para desarrollar nuestro Partido como el de los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il y, mediante la transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, conduce acertadamente hacia la victoria el enfrentamiento con Estados Unidos y la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de su destacada y probada direccion, hoy la dignidad y el prestigio de nuestro Partido se elevan notablemente. Pese a las interminables maquinaciones de aislamiento y estrangulamiento de los reaccionarios imperialistas, la historia y la tradicion de victorias sucesivas de la Corea heroica continuan de generacion en generacion y la causa de la construccion de un Estado poderoso y prospero cobra mayor fuerza y vigor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl estimado companero Kim Jong Un dijo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Al enaltecer a los grandes Generalisimos como eternos Lideres de nuestro Partido y pueblo y Sol del Juche e impulsar energicamente la transformacion de toda la sociedad segun el kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo, debemos levantar en este territorio un digno Estado socialista poderoso y prospero, la potencia Paektusan, tal como deseaban el gran Lider y el gran Dirigente.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fiel acato a la consigna \"!Alcemonos todos en la ofensiva general para anticipar la victoria final con el espiritu revolucionario del Paektu!\", todos los miembros del Partido, militares y civiles deben formar multiples cercos en torno al Partido y empenarse con denuedo para crear la velocidad de Corea, la de la nueva epoca, en la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero, para asi manifestar ante el mundo la dignidad y el espiritu de la poderosa y prospera Corea del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Buro Politico del Comite Central del Partido decide que todos, con el espiritu e impetu revolucionarios del Paektu, celebren el 70 aniversario de la fundacion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y de la liberacion de la patria como acontecimientos revolucionarios de la Corea del Songun que se hace poderosa y prospera bajo la direccion del gran Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, la resolucion acentua la necesidad de enaltecer a los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il como eternos Lideres de nuestro Partido y pueblo y hacer valer generacion tras generacion las proezas de los Generalisimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe refiere a la tarea de acondicionar mejor y defender a ultranza el Palacio del Sol Kumsusan, donde se conservan los restos de los grandes Generalisimos, como eterno lugar sagrado del Sol y erigir con sumo respeto las estatuas y las esculturas de colores de los Generalisimos en las unidades importantes como las visitadas por ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, senala la importancia de acondicionar las bases de la educacion en las tradiciones revolucionarias, por ejemplo, reconstruir el Museo de la Revolucion Coreana en un acervo nacional, sintesis de la gran historia y los inmortales meritos revolucionarios de las eminentes figuras del monte Paektu, e intensificar la educacion mediante estos lugares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo segundo punto, la resolucion enfatiza el fortalecimiento del Partido y la consolidacion de la unidad de este y de las filas revolucionarias, lo cual constituye una garantia decisiva para llevar a cabo generacion tras generacion bajo la direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un la causa revolucionaria del Juche, la del Songun, que tiene su origen en el monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSugiere establecer una ferrea disciplina organizativa segun la cual todo el Partido actua como un solo hombre bajo la unica direccion del Mariscal, conocer bien la opinion publica y aglutinar a las masas alrededor del Partido, con vistas a consolidar mas la base politico-ideologica de nuestra revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo tercer punto subraya el fortalecimiento del poderio autodefensivo del pais en acato al lineamiento revolucionario del Partido que prioriza los asuntos militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara lograr la victoria final en el enfrentamiento con Estados Unidos y acelerar con pujanza la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero es necesario fortalecer mas el Ejercito Popular, pilar y fuerza principal de la revolucion del Songun, desarrollar la industria de defensa nacional y lograr el alto nivel del armamento de todo el pueblo y de la fortificacion de todo el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben establecer firmemente el sistema de direccion unica del Comandante Supremo sobre el ejercito y desarrollar activamente el Movimiento por el Titulo de Septimo Regimiento de O Jung Hup y el de la Unidad Guardia, de modo que el Ejercito Popular se prepare como guardia invencible y tropas de firme ideologia y fe, imbuidas del espiritu de defender a riesgo de la vida a su lider y la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa resolucion recalca que, con el espiritu y temple con que exploraron el cosmos, deben desarrollar mas armamentos autoctonos dotados de la tecnologia de punta, de gran precision, ligeros, no tripulados e inteligentes, conforme a la guerra contemporanea, y aplicar en nuestra industria de defensa los ultimos logros cientificos y tecnicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su cuarto punto la resolucion subraya la necesidad de dar nuevos saltos en todos los dominios de la construccion de un Estado socialista poderoso y prospero para asi abrir una era de gran prosperidad de la Corea del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcelerar la marcha por el gran auge en la construccion de una potencia economica en todas las ramas y unidades de la economia nacional es una firme garantia para poner de pleno manifiesto el poderio de la potencia politico-ideologica y militar y lograr una brillante victoria en la edificacion de un Estado poderoso y prospero y la defensa del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso desarrollar las ciencias y la tecnologia y superar a los demas en la tecnologia de punta para abrir un atajo en la construccion de la economia del conocimiento,  resolver el problema de alimentacion de la poblacion tomando como tres pilares la agricultura, la ganaderia y la pesqueria, y producir un cambio decisivo en la mejora de la vida de la poblacion al priorizar el desarrollo de la industria ligera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs de particular importancia movilizar y concentrar todas las fuerzas en la produccion agricola considerandola como la mayor prioridad, acelerar la construccion de la base ganadera en la zona de Sepho y lograr un nuevo cambio en el desarrollo de la ganaderia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento hace hincapie en desarrollar decisivamente el sector pesquero para escribir la nueva historia del mar de oro y respirar el intenso olor del mar socialista en todo el pais, asi como seguir poniendo gran empeno en el desarrollo de la industria ligera y lograr un gran cambio en la produccion de articulos de consumo masivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrge terminar incondicionalmente hasta la fecha indicada por el Partido la construccion o la remodelacion de las obras importantes como el Palacio de Ciencias y Tecnologia, el Reparto de Cientificos Mirae, la segunda fase de la zona residencial de cientificos Wisong, la terminal 2 del Aeropuerto Internacional de Pyongyang, el edificio docente 3 de la Universidad Kim Il Sung, el Instituto Universitario de Arquitectura de Pyongyang, la Escuela Secundaria No. 1, el Jardin Zoologico Central y el Palacio de Escolares y Ninos de Mangyongdae, y de esta manera materializar cabalmente la original idea del Partido sobre la arquitectura y abrir una era de gran prosperidad para el sector de la construccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa resolucion se refiere a la tarea de dar grandes pasos de avance en los reglones principales de la economia como los sectores priorizados, los de las industrias basicas, entre ellas la electricidad, el carbon, el ferrocarril, la metalurgia, la quimica y la maquinaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMencion aparte merece la movilizacion de todo el Estado para impulsar la construccion de la Centrales Hidroelectrica Juventud del Songun en el monte Paektu, las escalonadas Chongchongang y la Militar-Civil de Wonsan y la modernizacion de fabricas y empresas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento presenta la tarea de acelerar la construccion de un Estado socialista civilizado, registrar nuevos cambios en los sectores de la educacion, la salud publica, el arte y la literatura, la prensa y el deporte, asi como preservar y enriquecer el patrimonio cultural de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExhorta a todo el Partido, ejercito y pueblo a movilizarse a la recuperacion de bosques, mejorar el mantenimiento del territorio nacional y renovar su fisonomia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSugiere desarrollar en toda la sociedad los movimientos masivos como el por el Titulo del Bosque Patriotico Socialista y el del Distrito Ejemplar en la Reforestacion y convertir todo el pais en bosques, jardines y huertos mediante la cooperacion militar-civil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su quinto punto la resolucion subraya la necesidad de librar energicamente la lucha encaminada a lograr la historica causa de la reunificacion nacional y fortalecer la solidaridad internacional de nuestra revolucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario, apunta, frustrar resueltamente las maniobras de guerra del imperialismo norteamericano y sus lacayos surcoreanos contra nuestra Republica y sus confabulaciones en torno a nuestros \"problemas nucleares y de derechos humanos\" y que todos los coreanos del Norte, Sur y en el extranjero se unan bajo la bandera del patriotismo y el ideal Entre nosotros, los connacionales, con el fin de hacer realidad la consigna \"!En este ano del 70 aniversario de la liberacion de la patria abramos un ancho camino para la reunificacion independiente del pais con la fuerza unida de toda la nacion!\". Urge ampliar multilateralmente y con iniciativa las relaciones exteriores y reforzar mas la solidaridad internacional de nuestra revolucion, agrega.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su sexto punto la resolucion se refiere a la tarea de organizar y llevar a cabo por todo lo alto las actividades para celebrar como grandes festivales politicos el 70 aniversario de la fundacion del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y la liberacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn conmemoracion de la fundacion del Partido se llevaran a cabo una parada militar con la participacion de las fuerzas terrestre, naval, aerea-antiaerea y estrategica del Ejercito Popular de Corea y un desfile multitudinario de los capitalinos, con miras a demostrar ante el mundo el poderio de la unidad monolitica de militares y civiles coreanos aglomerados en torno al estimado Mariscal Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon motivo de las efemerides tambien se efectuaran significativamente varios actos politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFinalmente, con el objetivo de cumplir cabalmente las tareas presentadas, la resolucion exige a las organizaciones partidistas a todos los niveles y los organos politicos realizar una esmerada labor organizativa y politica y controlar y dirigirla con regularidad y al Consejo de Ministros y otras instituciones correspondientes tomar medidas de caracter administrativo y practico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos nuestro ejercito y pueblo evocan profundamente las sempiternas hazanas revolucionarias realizadas por las eminentes figuras del monte Paektu para el fortalecimiento del Partido y la construccion de una patria poderosa y prospera y estan firmemente decididos a esforzarse mas para la victoria final de la revolucion siguiendo la orientacion del gran Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInvencible es la causa del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, organizacion de los grandes companeros Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il que avanza con la bandera de la independencia y del Songun en alto siguiendo la direccion del estimado companero Kim Jong Un, y definitivo es el triunfo final de la construccion de la potencia Paektusan, Estado socialista poderoso y prospero."
