            "content": "DPRK to Go Its Own Way \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 25 (KCNA) -- The United States is building up public opinion to create impression that a certain change in its Korea policy is imminent, talking about an important measure of concession after the six-way talks. This is, however, nothing but a trite trick to disarm the DPRK and stifle it at any cost. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It cites concrete facts to disclose the U.S. intention to justify its hostile policy toward the DPRK, establish international cooperation system on this basis and stifle the DPRK politically and militarily at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. military intention to stifle the DPRK, threatening it with nuclear weapons, the nuclear issue would not have cropped up between the DPRK and the U.S. The U.S. should make a bold decision to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK to solve the nuclear issue peacefully through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In view of the situation in Korea increasing the nuclear deterrent force provides the only way of checking the U.S. moves to provoke a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and protecting peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is left with no option but to go its own way now that it has become clearer that the Bush administration does not have any political willingness to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and is getting more undisguised in its moves to disarm the DPRK and isolate and stifle it at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. increased hostile policy toward the DPRK will only compel the DPRK to further increase its nuclear deterrent force.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Slams U.S. Moves to Politicize Aid \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 25 (KCNA) -- Some UN organizations are now putting on hold or shelving the approval of regular aid projects for the DPRK.\r\n This is attributable to the political attempt of some countries including the U.S. and Japan to use the aid of UN organizations to the DPRK as a leverage to put pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long abused the name of the UN responsible for global peace and security for implementing its policy to stifle the DPRK and desperately worked to achieve its political purposes with the help of international organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year alone, several officials of the U.S. administration including U.S. State Undersecretary Bolton made several attempts to put pressure upon the DPRK by bringing up the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula for discussion at the UN Security Council, claiming that it is appropriate to discuss north Korea's nuclear issue at the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May U.S. State Secretary Powell proposed the UN's participation in forming a \"united front,\" part of the U.S.-led collective blockade strategy aimed to isolate and stifle the DPRK, and in July he blustered that bad acts would not be rewarded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, non-governmental aid organizations including the Asian Foundation of the U.S. put their heads together in Seoul to block the aid of the international organizations to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. expressed its will to offer 100,000 tons of food aid to the DPRK through the World Food Program this year but only 40,000 tons of it have been supplied but nobody knows when the remaining 60,000 tons would be delivered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Actively toeing the U.S. line, Japan made the far-fetched assertion that no aid should be given to north Korea unless the issue of \"abduction\" is settled when the new term aid projects of the UN Population Fund for the DPRK was under discussion at a meeting of its Executive Council in June. Meanwhile, Abe, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, on Sept. 12 blustered that if the families of those abducted are not allowed to return to Japan, no economic aid would be provided by Japan to north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attempts of the U.S. and Japan to block the \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" to the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the issue of \"abduction\" are intolerable as they are a wonton violation of the principles of international cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the U.S. and Japan to politicize the regular aid of UN organizations to the DPRK in a bid to isolate and stifle it only bring into bolder relief their true colors as wanton violators of the UN Charter and international laws. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international organizations should reject any attempt of the U.S. to politicize and make selective aid projects and observe the impartiality in their activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
