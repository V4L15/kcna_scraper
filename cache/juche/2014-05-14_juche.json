How can he behave so if he is not an idiot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a regular news briefing he shouted hoarse to dare slander the DPRK as a \"country that can hardly be called a country\". He went the lengths of talking such rubbish that \"it is a country which should disappear at an early date\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is pitiful that an imbecile unable to discern the cardinal points is busy kicking off deranged hysteria, regardless of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even south Korean public termed his remarks \"nonsensical ones excessively rattling the nerves of the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As there goes a saying that a crow cannot be whiter for often washing, Kim Min Sok, steeped in the enmity towards fellow countrymen in the north, let loose a spate of invectives against them on different occasions, spoiling the atmosphere  for mending the  inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the National Defence Commission of the DPRK made a crucial proposal to the south Korean authorities early this year and proposed taking practical steps for improving the inter-Korean relations, Kim blustered that the U.S.-south Korea Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises would be staged as scheduled and the puppet forces would \"make an immediate counterattack without slight hesitation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told journalists on April 22 rubbish that \"there would happen something alarming before April 30\", floating a rumor about an imminent nuclear test of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that Kim, a fool, is speaking for the military of the Park Geun Hye regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What he uttered reflects the last-ditch efforts of the sinking Park regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The puppet group, the arch criminal who turned the whole of south Korea into a sea of tears due to the ferry Sewol sinking disaster, is making desperate efforts to calm down the angry and grieving people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is greatly vexed by the stirring reality of the DPRK, its dynamism and might of single-minded unity quite contrary to what is happening in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is much upset by the happy laughter and songs of children heard from the Songdowon International Children's Camp, the result of the noble loving care of the Workers' Party of Korea for the rising generation and the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The malignant vitriol let loose by the group against the dignified DPRK is also aimed at getting rid of the overall crisis caused by dependence on foreign forces and acts of treachery and escaping a miserable defeat in the forthcoming local election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group, seized with extreme fear and uneasiness, is putting forward such bad guy as Kim in a bid to escalate all-out confrontation with the DPRK. This is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with faggot on its back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to behave with discretion in face of the current crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Park regime is to prolong its remaining days even a bit, it should sternly punish at once Kim Min Sok who brought misfortune to the nation. This is the only way out not only for the Ministry of Defense but for Chongwadae."
