At the talks both sides agreed to stop propaganda and dismantle its means in the area along the MDL in order to defuse military tensions on the Korean Peninsula and dispel distrust and misunderstanding between the armies of both sides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Lee Myung Bak group, steeped in extreme hostility toward the fellow countrymen in the north, took a measure for resuming the psychological warfare against the DPRK under the pretext of the Cheonan warship incident and Yonphyong Island incident and operated the light tower on Aegi Hill as part of the warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the puppet chief executive got angry after belatedly learning about the dismantlement of the tower by the marine corps which was in charge of it.

Korea\r\nPyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is running the whole gamut of gimmicks towards the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t When the puppet forces begged for the indefinite extension of the transfer of the wartime operation control (OPECON) at the recent 46th U.S.-south Korea annual security consultative meeting, the U.S. pretended to reluctantly accept the request while pressurizing south Korea to sign contracts on the sale of military hardware worth an astronomical figure of dollars in return for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a typical example of a trick played by the U.S. on its stooges. In word, the U.S. calls south Korea its ally but, in fact, it uses the puppet forces for meeting its own interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. holds the right to command the south Korean army, it is fated to be used as bullet shields and cannon fodder any moment at the instructions of the American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the spirit of achieving independence from the U.S. mounted in south Korea and demands for taking over the OPECON grew stronger, the U.S. could not but transfer the ordinary time operation control in 1994, to begin with. It then agreed to transfer the OPECON to the puppet forces in 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this becomes a reality, the U.S.-south Korea \"Combined Forces Command\" will be left with no justification to stay as it is a tool for the U.S. exercise of the operation control over south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence, the U.S. has made desperate efforts to build or strengthen legal and institutional mechanisms that can replace the wartime operation control which is indispensable for its forces' presence in south Korea and for its implementation of the strategy for dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the annual security consultative meetings and military commissions with the puppet forces, the U.S. formulated a system whereby it can interfere in all military policies shaped by the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made sure that its nuclear war exercises are staged with south Korea every year strictly under its command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently it finalized an agreement on creating a new combined division in 2015 involving the main forces of the U.S. second division present in south Korea and the armored troops of the puppet ground force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that all kinds of mechanisms and means will continue to be used to keep the U.S. forces in south Korea and to use the puppet forces as a shock brigade for executing aggression war even after the transfer of the OPECON.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the present conservative regime emerged in south Korea, the U.S. availed itself of its ignorance of military affairs and pushed south Korea to the brink of war and created \"security unrest\" through nuclear war exercises targeting the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet government had no alternative but to beg its master to extend again the transfer of the OPECON as intended by him and, at the same time, behave like an idiot offering even funds to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a vicious aggressor and plunderer who does not hesitate to make a fool of even its junior ally in order to achieve its hegemonic goal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent indefinite extension of the transfer of the OPECON is a product of the U.S. premeditated moves to put south Korea under its tighter military control and bring huge profits to the U.S. munitions monopolies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans from all walks of life should clearly see through the true colors of the U.S. as a gangster and courageously turn out in the struggle against the U.S."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Urged to Stop Enlarging Tower on Aegi Hill\r\nPyongyang, November 10 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities recently announced a plan to dismantle a light tower on Aegi Hill and install instead a new observation deck and an electronic display board more than double the existing ones and build a hall showing scenes of the June 25 war as part of their psychological warfare with an investment of tens of billions of won.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an open declaration for escalating psychological campaign against the DPRK and another serious military provocation to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The light tower has been a typical means for psychological warfare against the DPRK. It has been a source of sparking off confrontation and tensions between the north and the south, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces' moves have fully disclosed their crafty nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are getting vocal grumbling that the \"high-level contact was aborted\" due to the \"provocation\" by someone while jabbering they would \"make sustained efforts for the development of the south-north relations\". But no one would lend an ear to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality clearly proves that the \"dialogue\" and \"improvement of relations\" touted by the puppet forces are a sheer lie and that they only pursue confrontation with fellow countrymen and armed conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not gamble over the fate of the nation. History and the nation will never tolerate it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should immediately stop the project for enlarging the tower aimed at escalating the military tension and conflict and discontinue acts of going against the improvement of the north-south ties."
