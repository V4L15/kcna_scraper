So, 10 million workers have turned out in the spring struggle in protest against them.   All the people are qualified to enjoy the right to labor and social welfare and benefits according to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, South Korean workers  are denied the right to work by the reactionary labour policy of the ruling authorities who yielded to the arbitrary act and pressure from the U.S.-led IMF.   At the crossroads of whether to die, enduring sufferings  or fight to win the right to existence  and get rid of this wretched plight  the South Korean workers  have opted to launch the spring struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are convinced that the international labour organisations and trade unions of all countries will pay deep attention to the struggle of South Korean workers and extend widespread support and encouragement to them. \r\n\r\n"
