For dialogue the U.S. should refrain from any provocations to its dialogue partner. Yet, the U.S. is busy making preparations to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, while paying lip-service to the dialogue. Ulji Focus Lens is part of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saber rattling is incompatible with dialogue. The U.S. does not stand for a negotiated settlement of any problem but is only keen to bring the DPRK to its knees by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula to start a war would not do it good either. The DPRK can no longer be exposed to the U.S. military threat and the danger of war posed by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully ready for both dialogue and war.    \r\n\r\n"

This is also thanks to the independent foreign policy of the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Very important is the position of the Korean Peninsula in keeping and consolidating peace in the Asia-Pacific region and achieving its sustained development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Threatening a sovereign state militarily and attempting to isolate and stifle it, prompted by the outdated thinking-pattern of the cold war era, will only result in bringing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to confrontation and tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will in the future, too, pursue its foreign policy no matter how the situation may change and make positive efforts for peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n"

The policy of establishing the system and order of the economic management calling for combining the economy with science and technology and keeping production and management based on the scientific and technical successes reflects the revolutionary stand of the WPK to build a powerful economy, relying on science and technology.    \r\n\r\n"

If this rate of increase is left unchecked, it is likely to reach 6,000 PPM in 2050 and the average temperature of the earth is expected to rise 4-6 degrees centigrade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the glacier and iceberg will thaw in the polar regions. Sea water will rise to such a level that its consequences will be unimaginable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The changeable weather caused by global warming is seriously affecting Korea, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Korea the weather gradually became whimsical from the early 1970s, seriously upsetting the balance between temperature and rainfall in the 1990s. In consequence, the DPRK was frequently hit by abnormal weather. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speed of warming in Korea at present is three times the average speed of global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rainfall sharply decreased in the area on middle latitudes (30-40 degrees north latitude) where Korea is situated and the rain to be expected in northeast Asia fell on the areas lying on low and high latitudes, causing floods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year Korea was hit in January by the longest spell of cold weather in one hundred years and the highest temperature in the history of meteorological observation registered repeatedly in the spring. Korea was struck by the severest drought in 1,000 years that played great havoc with the agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inestimable is the damage done to different domains of the national economy by the climatic change including the reduction of grain harvest due to a long spell of torrential rain and shortage of energy caused by the lack of hydraulic power resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The repeated natural disasters that hit the DPRK are attributable to the abnormal weather caused by global warming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of global warming is a worldwide one that should be jointly settled by humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
