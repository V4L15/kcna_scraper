            "content": "\"Kidnapping\" of Japanese has nothing to do with DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the Japanese chief executive said that it is unthinkable for the Japanese government to establish diplomatic relations with North Korea in disregard of suspected kidnapping cases and that \"Tokyo will not open diplomatic relations with Pyongyang before their settlement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that kidnapping has nothing to do with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not Japan but the DPRK to talk about \"kidnapping.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs to kidnapping, Japan is an assailant and the DPRK is a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a stark historic fact that Japan kidnapped and took away nearly 200,000 Korean girls and women from Korea and forced them to be \"comfort women for the army,\" sex slaves, and walked away at least 6 million Korean young and middle aged men and made them victims of the war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"suspected kidnapping\" cases raised by the Japanese authorities are premeditated moves to evade the issue of redressing their past and get a sort of political concession from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is not frightened by their remarks that it is unthinkable to establish diplomatic relations with the DPRK without settlement of the issue of \"kidnapping.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan set the non-existent issue of \"suspected kidnapping\" as preconditions for the establishment of Japan-DPRK diplomatic relations, the DPRK will turn round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK does not care about whether diplomatic relations with Japan are improved or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has no idea to open diplomatic relations with Japan while allowing its self-respect and dignity to be impaired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is as foolish as coming home to roost that Japan continues to get on the nerves of the DPRK by raising the non-existent issue of \"suspected kidnapping.\" \r\n\r\n"
