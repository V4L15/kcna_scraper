They fought to beat back the pirates' attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They switched on an automatic warning device and waged a fierce gunfight against the pirates after seizing weapons from two terrorists who were standing guard over the engine room. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the steering room was occupied by the pirates, they sailed towards the open sea by use of steering engine for emergency operation and life boat compass, while battling on to overpower the remaining pirates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, upon receiving a SOS sent by the ship, an institution concerned in the DPRK officially informed the International Maritime Organization and the Piracy Reporting Centre of the IMB stationed in Malaysia of the incident and asked for help. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the request of the above-said centre, U.S. navy's destroyer James E. Williams and a helicopter rushed to the scene and helped the DPRK sailors in fighting, threatening the pirates over walkie-talkie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, at around 16:30 on Oct. 30, i.e. about 20 hours after the start of the fight, the pirates dropped arms and surrendered. The ship was completely recaptured by its sailors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One pirate was killed and six crewmen of the DPRK were wounded in the fight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A surgeon of the U.S. destroyer provided first-aid treatment and other medical service to our wounded crewmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our cargo ship made a safe voyage to its destination through a regular sea route. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pirates' recent armed attack on our trading ship was a grave terrorist act perpetrated against a peaceful ship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent principled stand of the DPRK government to oppose all sorts of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As shown by our crewmen through their actions, it is the disposition of the Korean people to fight out any terrorist act on the spot though they are empty-handed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel grateful to the United States for its assistance given to our crewmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case serves as a symbol of the DPRK-U.S. cooperation in the struggle against terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will continue to render international cooperation in the fight against terrorism, in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to build socialism in line with the above-said desire and interests, it is necessary, first of all, to strengthen the working-class party organizationally and ideologically and fully ensure the party leadership over the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to steadily increase the function and role of the socialist power and protect and develop the socialist ownership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is one of the fundamental principles to be consistently maintained in socialist construction to resolutely struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abandoning the above-said principle means surrender and betrayal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Eastern European countries, which were once engaged in building socialism, opted to make concessions over the socialist principle, wavering before the temporary difficulties and yielding to the pressure of the imperialists because they lacked faith in socialism and a firm revolutionary stand. They weakened the leadership role of the ruling parties and uniform leadership function of the socialist states, neglecting the work for strengthening the working-class parties. They, at the same time, compromised with the imperialists without principle, applying the relations of capitalist ownership and capitalist methods of managing economy. This brought such miserable consequences as degenerating socialism and ousting the working-class parties from power and pushing socialism to a collapse in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical experience goes to clearly prove that if a country makes a single concession and backdown over the socialist principle, it is bound to make them a hundred times and this will lead to the final collapse of the working-class party and socialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Many effective styles and methods were created in the education in the party policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wise leadership of Kim Jong Il also found its expression in that he has led the party organizations to closely link the work of organizing and guiding the party life with the implementation of their revolutionary tasks and set an example of the times in devotedly carrying out the party policies and helped all the officials and party members earnestly follow it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il created the revolutionary soldier spirit during the difficult period of the \"Arduous March\" and led all the party members and other people to actively follow the fighting spirit and work style of the People's Army. This marked a landmark occasion in making the spirit of carrying out the party policies in a do-or-die spirit prevail throughout the party.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
