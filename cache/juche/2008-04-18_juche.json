This is nothing but sophism prompted by a sinister aim to justify their moves to establish the missile defense system (MD) and invent a pretext for launching a military invasion of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that other countries' moves to increase their capabilities for self-defense are posing a \"threat\" to it, while seriously threatening and blackmailing others with lots of missiles and nukes. This is a brigandish assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how vociferously the U.S. bellicose forces may talk about the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK they can never conceal their ulterior motive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable ambition of the U.S. to put the world under its domination. It seeks to contain other big powers with a military edge by building the MD.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Congress has allotted 115 billion U.S. dollars for the development of the MD since early in the 1980s. The U.S. Department of Defense is contemplating additionally earmarking 500 million U.S. dollars for the expansion of the MD till 2013. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the U.S. bellicose forces plan to tip ballistic missiles with nuclear warheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. MD is presenting itself as a matter of the greatest concern in the international arena as it is a dangerous move to upset the world's strategic stability, spark off a new arms race and ignite a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' oft-repeated fiction of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK is aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on it any moment after keeping it on the list of \"enemies.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can survive, while trying to kill others with \"missile shields.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to drop its reckless missile hysteria.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The south Korean ruling conservative forces, however, claim that they have \"obtained majority seats\" through the \"election\". This is something that provokes side-splitting laughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the conservative group is prodding conservative media into letting loose a spate of rubbish pulling up even the DPRK over the issue of \"election.\" This is an intolerable provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"lowest turnout in the history\" in the \"election\" glaringly shows what extent the people's distrust and disillusion with the political charlatans have reached in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the results of the above-said \"election\" do not show any \"victory\" of some forces but a stern warning of the people to the political camp quelling their desire and wishes. It is foolish of the conservative group to exploit the \"election results\" for covering up their treacherous nature, misleading the public opinion at home and abroad and justifying their policy of confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors should not misjudge the mind-set in south Korea reflected in the \"election\" but stop their rash acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean \"National Assembly\" will not be able to escape the curse and condemnation from all Koreans if it plays the role of a rubber-stamp in allowing treachery and anti-reunification acts, paying no heed to the common interests of the nation and the desire of the public, as a waiting maid of the Lee Myung Bak regime, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
