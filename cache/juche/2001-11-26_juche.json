            "content": "KCNA slams remark of U.S. defense secretary \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. defense secretary Rumsfeld at a recent press conference pulled up the DPRK again, asserting that North Korea is directly involved in terrorism and proliferating its missile technology.\r\n This goes to prove that the U.S. anti-DPRK hostile policy remains unchanged and it is set to escalate it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, at the same time, disclosed the U.S. intention to push ahead with its moves to establish the \"Missile Defence\" system (MD), which may disturb the global peace and strategic stability, under the pretext of non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the u.s. has so far gone ahead with the MD under this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the U.S., styling itself a \"superpower,\" to claim that it should establish the MD for fear of the DPRK's missile solely meant for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community, therefore, is ridiculing the U.S. insisting on such pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has already clarified, its missile program is of peaceful nature and it poses no threat to any country which does not intend to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Furthermore, the DPRK assured the international community that it would freeze its launch of ballistic missiles by 2003 and is now sincerely keeping this promise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is again taking issue with the DPRK, asserting that the DPRK's \"development of weapons of mass destruction and proliferation of its missile technology pose a real threat\" to it. It is a blatant challenge to the DPRK and a despicable plot to divert the international resentment at its arbitrary and high-handed practices to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as terrorism is concerned, the DPRK had already clarified its principled stand that it is opposed to all forms of terrorism and any support to it. And no one can deny the fact that the DPRK is not involved in any terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The groundless charges brought by the U.S. against the DPRK over the issues of \"terrorism\" and \"missile threat\" go to clearly prove that its talk about an unconditional dialogue with the DPRK is nothing but hypocrisy and it is, in fact, not interested in the dialogue and improved relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop behaving rashly, not forgetful of the historical lesson that its escalated anti-DPRK hostile moves have never brought any good consequences.    \r\n\r\n"
