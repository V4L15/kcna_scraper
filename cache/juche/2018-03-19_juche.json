            "content": "Conservadores surcoreanos no pueden evitar el castigo severo, apunta Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 19 de marzo (ACNC) -- El diario Rodong Sinmun divulgo el dia 19 un articulo individual en relacion con que se cumple un ano desde la dimision de la traidora surcoreana Park Geun-hye por la severa sentencia de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa dimision y la detencion de Park fueron la explosion del arraigado rencor y la colera de la poblacion y el serio juicio de la historia sobre la traidora y la banda conservadora que al navegar a contrapelo de la opinion publica y a la aspiracion de la nacion, vinieron recurriendo a la politica antipopular, los actos vendepatrias y serviles a grandes potencias y la confrontacion fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi inicia el articulo y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl derrumbe del \"poder\" de Park Geun-hye, nido de males, demostro que se arruinaran sin falta las fuerzas traidoras que marchan a contrapelo de la opinion publica y la corriente de la epoca y que nadie puede impedir el deseo de las masas populares por la justicia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Partido de Corea Libre y otros compinches conservadores que cometieron todo tipo de maldades disfrutando de la opulencia y placeres bajo el amparo del \"poder\" conservador son los complices a ser sepultados en la tumba de la historia junto con los traidores Lee Myung Bak y Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los conservadores surcoreanos se desesperan todavia por frenar la corriente de la epoca hacia la unidad nacional y la reunificacion, abrigando a la traidora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSus tentativas ultimas para salir del abismo de arruinamiento devienen la burla intolerable a la poblacion surcoreana levantada con velas encendidas y la verguenza de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad muestra que la banda conservadora surcoreana es el grupo de males y politicastros que en lugar de sentir la culpabilidad, solo suenan por resucitar la era fascista enganando y burlando a la opinion publica."
