The book contains a true story about eight Dutch women who were forced into sexual slavery by the Japanese imperialists in Indonesia during the Second World War. \n\t\t\t\t\t The book bears witness to the history as it indicts the Japanese imperialists for their hideous crimes related to the sexual slavery enforced by the Japanese imperialists in the 20th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a commentary: Those victims of the crimes are dying with the passage of time before getting neither apology nor reparation from the Japanese government even after beginning of the 21st century. This is something deplorable and resentful, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What touches off bitter resentment among the Koreans is the attitude of the Japanese authorities towards the hideous crimes related to the sexual slavery committed by Japan in the 20th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have run the whole gamut of gimmicks to cover up the thrice-cursed crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Craftiness and impudence may be typical of moral vulgarity peculiar to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sexual slavery unprecedented in history and the Japanese reactionaries' attitude and stand of denying it stem from their brazen-faced way of thinking to distort the historical facts and justify their acts, bereft of humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan claims that the above-said sexual slavery cannot be regarded as a crime as it originated from the course of the militaristic war of overseas aggression. This is the opinion and viewpoint of the island country which has lurched to the Right considering the praise of chauvinism and militarism as ethics. Japan is rushing headlong into overseas expansion, overheated with militarist hysteria.  Its ultimate goal is to repeat the Japanese imperialists' past history of aggression. This is the very reason why the stepped-up moves for Japan's militarization escalate the distortion of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No statute of limitations is applicable to crimes against humanity. Japan can never escape from the responsibility for its past crimes, warns the commentary."
