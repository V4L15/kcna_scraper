The introduction of double standards in the field of human rights is, in its essence, a revelation of false ideological point of view and attitude which call for the \"integration\" of the world based on specified \"view on value\", ignoring the independent dignity and rights of human being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists including the U.S. are misleading the public opinion, trying to give impression that there are no problems in the field of human rights in the countries obedient to them but there exist serious \"human rights issues\" in the countries maintaining their independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"human rights\" performance based on false standard is aimed to make its \"view on value\" and way of living prevail in all other countries and thus Americanize the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of double standards in the field of human rights has resulted in grave consequences such as fostering the conflicts and disputes among countries and destroying the international peace order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. does not hesitate to commit such gangster-like acts as using armed forces in case when its persistent \"human rights\" offensive does not work on other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A historical lesson proves that if one fails to smash the \"human rights\" offensive of the imperialists it would be impossible to defend the sovereignty of the country, much less achieving the free development of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when every country maps out the policy suitable to its own specific condition, implements it by the efforts of its people and actively preserves the customs and cultural tradition peculiar to its nation, can a guarantee be provided to successfully smash the imperialists' persistent \"human rights\" offensive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To attach importance to the nation, not to the outside forces and put the interests of the nation above all is the most principled demand in the struggle to carve out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the demand of the principle of national independence to categorically oppose and reject the flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces in developing the movement for national reunification and inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces make the nation slavish and weak and lead it to ruin in the end. This is a bitter lesson the Korean nation has drawn from its long history of national sufferings in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence urges the movement for national reunification and inter-Korean relations to be developed in conformity with the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the days when the June 15 joint declaration has been put into force, the validity and vitality of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" have been fully demonstrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fundamental development of the movement for reunification and inter-Korean relations hinges upon the national cooperation based on the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of inter-Korean relations and national reunification are the demand of the times and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should wage a more vigorous struggle under the uplifted banner of national independence to fundamentally improve and develop the inter-Korean relations and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
