It is made clear by the projected war maneuvers that Japan will be a supply base and a sortie base for another Korean War and a command base of the front.\r\n   If the U.S., Japan and South Korean warmaniacs launch a new war in Korea, they will be given thunderbolts of revenge. \r\n\r\n"

So, fortitude represents the distinguished advantage of Kim Il Sung's nation guided by General Secretary Kim Jong Il and its invincible might.\r\n   The fortitude of Kim Il Sung's nation is precisely the Juche character. In other words, this means the determination and will to shape its own destiny by its own efforts in any adversity with self-respect.\r\n   The spirit of devotedly defending the leader is the Juche-based invincible will of the Korean people.\r\n   Since the Korean people have the Juche-based will that if not guided by Kim Jong Il, the Korean nation cannot exist, they are devotedly defending him in the high-pitched spirit of human bombs.\r\n   Kim Jong Il, a brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu, is the great teacher and father of the Korean nation, who has grown it to be the strongest one in the world.\r\n   So,the Korean people proudly say that his august name is the symbol of Kim Il Sung's strong nation and all victories.\r\n   The Korean nation has a strong faith and will, good qualifications and traits as it has perfectly taken after Kim Jong Il, the supreme incarnation of faith and will.\r\n   Socialist Korea of Kim Il Sung's nation with a strong Juche character will emerge victorious forever as it is guided by Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
