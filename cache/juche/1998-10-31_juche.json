The U.S. imperialists' wild ambition for invasion of Korea still remains unchanged, though. The U.S. seeks to provoke another Korean War, use a nuclear weapon without hesitation to conquer the whole of Korea and commit aggression on Asia with the region as its springboard.\r\n   Another Korean War may break out any moment in the Korean peninsula as a result of the new war provocation moves of the U.S. and South Korea.\r\n   If a war breaks out, it will soon spread  beyond the boundary of Korea.\r\n   The DPRK and the U.S. are in a state of war.\r\n    A war may break out at moment unless there is a peace accord between the two countries and unless the U.S. withdraws its troops and nuclear arms.\r\n   The U.S. wild ambition for domination over Korea and Asia cannot be realised at all.
