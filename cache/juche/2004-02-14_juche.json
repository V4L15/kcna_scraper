He suffered bitter sorrow as member of a stateless nation under the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and wandered about in a foreign country in quest of means of living. It was not until President Kim Il Sung liberated Korea that he came to lead a worthy life as a human being under the care of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He joined the Korean People's Army right after the liberation of the country true to the President's line on building the army. During the Fatherland Liberation War he bravely fought in many battles but was unfortunately arrested by the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was forced to make an \"ideological conversion\" during his 37 years of his life in jail but he did not yield to the savage torture and appeasement and deception of law enforcement agents, thus remaining true to the revolutionary faith in the Party and the leader and constancy as a member of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since he came into the care of the Party after the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration provided by leader Kim Jong Il he remained loyal to the Party to the last moments of his life with his single-hearted determination to repay the profound solicitude of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the heart of Kang ceased to beat, the feats he performed for the prosperity of the country and national reunification will remain long, it stated.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Association of Korean Victims of Forcible Drafting and Their Bereaved Families issued a statement Thursday sharply denouncing it.\r\n The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must not go unnoticed that the organization, quoting the view of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Justice of Japan, let out the nonsensical sophism that there was no forcible drafting and most of those crossed over to Japan from Korea were those who came at their free will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in forcibly drafting Koreans, in which they drafted at least 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans before and after the start of the Sino-Japanese war and took them away overseas, to say nothing of Korea, to reduce them to army and labor slaves after occupying Korea by armed forces in the past are a historical fact that can neither be erased nor denied as they were the biggest crimes against humanity in the 20th century. \r\n It is utterly nonsensical to assert that Koreans went to Japan and other countries at their free will, ignoring the fact they were separated by force from their families and relatives and taken away under the jackboots of the Japanese police and gendarme, deprived of their freedom and elementary rights to existence by the Japanese imperialists under their colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The association vehemently denounces the council's shameless act of denying history and evading the redemption of its past crimes as an intolerable mockery of the Korean victims to forcible drafting and their bereaved families and another hideous human rights abuse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese government plays a double-game, conniving at and defending the shameful negation of history by such anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization as the council, it will only result in tarnishing its image and it will never be able to shake off the ill fame of a crafty political dwarf.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
