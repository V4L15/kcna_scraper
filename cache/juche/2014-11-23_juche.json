Paektu prevail at all units so that all service personnel may be prepared as Mt. Paektu tigers possessed of Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il military strategy and tactics, perfect capability to fight an actual war, marksmanship of never missing targets and strong physical bodies, and thus turn all units into steel-strong guards units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Army General Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff, and other commanding officers of the KPA and O Il Jong and Han Kwang Sang, department directors of the Central Committee of the WPK."

            "content": "KPA and People Will Not to Tolerate \"Human Rights\" Racket of U.S. and Its Allies: NDC of DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK issued the following statement Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already seriously warned of the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the reckless anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket kicked up by the U.S. and it followers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This warning was aimed to help cool their heads overheated by confrontation and hostile policy, though belatedly, and refrain from committing another anachronistic criminal act of challenging justice after judging the gravity of the situation with reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This measure taken by us aroused deep sympathy of the public at home and abroad and various righteous and upright countries made every possible effort to put the situation under control while voicing opposition to the U.S.-orchestrated \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We feel sincerely thankful for this and will always remember it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S., steeped in brigandish bad habit, finally perpetrated such reckless action as fabricating the anti-DPRK \"resolution on human rights\" at the UN by manipulating riff-raffs bereft of elementary view and principle, instead of thinking twice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. let the EU and Japan draft the \"resolution\" and UN member states blindly following and obeying it voted for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This hideous charade staged in the international arena is a shameless, politically-motivated farce to suppress justice with injustice and cover truth with lies and the height of impudent burlesque to deceive the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What happened there is lashing our service personnel and people into great fury and their determination to make retaliation against this is running high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers are now unable to escape merciless punishment for daring impair the prestige of the DPRK and foolishly trying to bring down the socialist system, the cradle of our people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers adopted the extremely unreasonable \"resolution on human rights\" against the DPRK and, not content with this, continue behaving impudently as if they had put it in an awkward position. The NDC of the DPRK solemnly declares the following principled stand in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, our army and people categorically deny and reject the \"resolution on human rights\" fabricated by the U.S. and its allies by abusing UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have never recognized any \"resolution\" worked out by the U.S.-led undesirable hostile forces to encroach upon our sovereignty and vital rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with the present \"resolution.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because the present \"resolution\" is a fabrication made on the basis of misinformation provided by a handful of human scum who fled the country after committing unpardonable crimes before our country and its people and abandoning their native places and parents and wives and children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also because the \"resolution\" is a product of political fraud as it was railroaded through highhanded and arbitrary practices, allurement and bribery by hostile forces including the U.S., without expression of the free will of UN member states who sympathize with justice and value conscience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, the \"resolution\" was adopted under the manipulation of the U.S. which has sought the infringement upon our sovereignty in violation of the UN Charter which considers respect for the sovereignty of all countries and non-interference in their internal affairs as a basic principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This \"resolution\" may work on those poor guys who throw away human dignity like a pair of old shoes, steeped in sycophancy and submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it can never work on the DPRK, highly dignified with independence and demonstrating its might with self-defence and self-reliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan are the worst human rights abusers as they have mercilessly trampled down the peoples' rights to exist and live and develop and took countless human lives in Korea and other parts of the world for centuries. And such riff-raffs as the Park Geun Hye group of south Korea kowtowing to them joined them in sponsoring the above-said \"resolution\" reminiscent of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" This cannot but be a tragicomedy unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people urge the Obama administration to make a formal apology by bending its knees before us for its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stand of ours is a warning served to Japan and riff-raffs of the EU as well as the Park Geun Hye group that they can also never go scot-free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stand of the DPRK is, at the same time, a warning served to the UN to make haste to take a fair measure to put the situation under control, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN needs to seriously recollect the time when the DPRK declared a just nuclear thunder to defend its supreme interests 20 years back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, our army and people will take an unprecedented toughest measure for mercilessly smashing the heinous \"human rights\" campaign against the DPRK as it has already declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent \"resolution on human rights\" is a full revelation of the hostile intention to stamp out everything dear to our army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Human rights precisely mean the right to independence and the sovereignty of a relevant country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the brigandish \"resolution\" against the DPRK's genuine human rights means the most undisguised war declaration to infringe upon its sovereignty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent \"resolution\" dared take issue with the dignity of our supreme leadership. This fact alone goes to prove that the sponsors of the \"resolution\" and all those involved in its adoption deserve a severe punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Because the dignity of the supreme leadership means the destiny of the DPRK which cannot be bartered for anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the primary target of our toughest countermeasure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has run the whole gamut of hostile policies including the political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. found all this unworkable on the DPRK, it is making desperate efforts to use the \"human rights issue\" for creating a new theatre for invasion under the pretext of armed intervention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will take toughest counteraction against the U.S. as already declared before the world, as long as its \"human rights\" racket and its hostile actions go on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, too, can never escape this toughest counteraction of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the sworn enemy of the Korean people as it committed thrice-cursed crimes, crudely violating their human rights from the beginning of the last century like the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is disgusting for Japan to pull up the DPRK over its genuine human rights just to please the U.S., far from repenting of its crime-woven past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should bear in mind that if it continues behaving as now, it will disappear from the world map for good, not just remaining a near yet distant country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group is also the main target of the DPRK's toughest counteraction as it has turned the whole of south Korea into the worst tundra of human rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We warned it enough to understand that its improper tongue-lashing would end in cutting off its head. It, however, is still busy talking rubbish about somebody's nukes and \"human rights\" and a sort of life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be well advised to realize itself what miserable end its heinous confrontation with compatriots will bring.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we would like to urge the UN to come to its senses and awaken itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UN allows the U.S. to turn the inviolable political arena into a mayhem under the sway of its highhanded and arbitrary practices, abandoning the principle of impartiality and equity and its original mission and role, it will be hard to maintain its existence amid the world people's condemnation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people can never overlook the insult to our genuine human rights and the infringement upon the right to independence and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time will prove what high price those who unreasonably violated the dignity of the DPRK despite its warning will have to pay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the U.S. and its followers will be wholly accountable for the unimaginable and catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the frantic \"human right\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We offered the U.S. a series of opportunities of redeeming its crimes by turning over a new leaf. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the DPRK treated with magnanimity U.S. high-ranking officials who came here, bringing with them Obama's personal letter and showed such humanitarian leniency to several American criminals who were sentenced to heavy penalties for violating the law of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. responded to it with the frantic \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to question the Park Geun Hye group busy billing the adoption of the above-said resolution as a sort of a significant event.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does she think Chongwadae will be safe if guns roar for aggression and a nuclear war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Can she prolong her remaining days in America after leaving south Korea?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, political pigmy, would be well advised to behave itself properly, cogitating about what miserable end it will meet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once a sacred war is launched to protect the sovereignty of the DPRK, not only the U.S. but the Park Geun Hye group and Japan will have to be hit hard and sent to the bottom of the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN also can never evade the responsibility for the catastrophic consequences entailed by what happened there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All this is the DPRK's response to the \"human rights\" racket of the U.S.-led hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nobody can infringe upon the DPRK's sacred and supreme interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm stand of the army and people of the DPRK not to tolerate the U.S. and its followers' vicious \"human rights\" racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sponsors of the \"resolution\" and all those involved in its adoption will repent bitterly."
