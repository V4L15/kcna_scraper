They encouraged  the oppressed and exploited people of the world in their anti-imperialist national liberation struggle and made a great contribution to defending the socialist cause.\r\n   The Korean people are  now undergoing unprecedentedly harsh trials because of the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign of the imperialists and reactionaries. In fact, they are going through such a grim war as the last Fatherland Liberation War.\r\n   Under the leadership of Kim Jong Il, the Korean People's Army and people have firmly defended and exalted Korean socialism, smashing the enemy's counterrevolutionary offensive with a great revolutionary offensive in the war devoid of gunfire.  This miracle of history eloquently  verifies the invariable truth that invincibility of the party, state, army and people is guaranteed by the greatness of the leader.\r\n   Kim Yong Chun called for firmly defending the Korean revolution from the enemy's encroachment, strengthening the position of Korean socialism  in every way and accomplishing the Juche revolutionary cause under the banner of anti-imperialism and independence.\r\n   He laid stress on  maintaining the Korean socialist economic  structure and developing the national defence industry to meet the demand of the obtaining situation.\r\n   With an unchangeable design to stifle the DPRK, he said, the U.S. warmongers, South Korean puppets and Japanese reactionaries in conspiracy with them continue to amass huge armed forces and up-to-date military equipment in and around South Korea and stage frantic war exercises almost everyday. Waiting for a chance to invade the DPRK. This makes the Korean People's Army and people sharpen their vigilance.\r\n   It is our consistent principle to answer the appeasment strategy of the imperialists with the revolutionary principle, and  their armed invasion with a revolutionary war, he said, and stressed:\r\n   If the enemies unleash a war in defiance of our repeated warnings, our army and people will rise up as one in the sacred war for revenge and  give them a heavier blow  than in the past war  with all potentialities  so as to remove the root cause of war  from the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The U.S. conservative hardliners, Japanese reactionaries and South Korean warmaniacs should know this and act with discretion.\r\n   Though  our struggle is arduous today, our future is optimistic and a final victory is  in store for us because we are guided by Kim Jong Il, the illustrious commander of Mt.

Not glory but a miserable doom was awaiting Macarthur who lost not only the frontline units but also the reserve force units.\r\n   In April 1951 the then U.S. President, Truman, declared Macarthur dismissed.\r\n   It was on July 1, 1950 that dean, who had shown \"valor\" in the Second World War, was appointed as commander of the U.S. 24th division, which had been called a \"victorious division\" in the Pacific War.\r\n   Leaving for the Korean front, he blared that one divisional force of the U.S. army was enough to hold at bay the counteroffensive of the KPA.\r\n   But, Dean's dream went up in smoke at the very start. The U.S. 24th divison was totally destroyed in the Taejon battle on July 20, that was the 20th day after its arrival in South Korea. Dean himself was taken prisoner by a people's army soldier.    He was the first division commander of U.S. imperialist aggression forces to be taken prisoner in the Korean War.\r\n    Walker, the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army at the time of the Korean War, ordered his men to kill the Koreans in cold blood.\r\n    The murderer considered a massacre warfare the best way of his promotion to higher ranks.\r\n    He tried to get \"fame\" in reliance upon such a \"warfare.\" He got nothing but a death in the Korean War.\r\n    Hard hit by the KPA units behind the enemy's line, he organised the South Korean puppet third army corps and went to Ryonchon to command it in early December 1950.\r\n    But, he kicked the bucket, falling into an ambush by the KPA while fleeing to Jongok in a heavy tank, escorted by the his men in 8 trucks on December 13, 1950.\r\n    Ridgway who was the commander of the U.S. Eighth Army and then the U.S. Far East Forces commander and concurrently commander of the \"UN Forces\" met with the same doom of Macarthur.\r\n   Height 1211 in the eastern sector of the front was the main target of attack of the \"autumn offensive\" of massive scale in September 1951.\r\n   By throwing into it more than 50,000 troopers and sophisticated military hardware he made attacks in waves scores of times a day. But, the \"autumn offensive\" commanded by him ended in failure with 17,000 more deaths than in the \"summer offensive.\"\r\n   The enemy soldiers driven into the attack called Height 1211 \"heart-breaking hill\" meaning that they lost heart at the mere sight of it and the valley below it \"trap valley\" meaning that no one who entered it came back alive.\r\n   Ridgway was dismissed one year after he was appointed as U.S. Far East Forces commander.\r\n   It was in April 1951 that van fleet was appointed as commander of the U.S. Eighth Army.\r\n   Finding a way out of the U.S. defeat in the war in the \"new offensive,\" he made preparations for a \"model battle\" on Jonghyong height with huge forces and combat materials and let a large number of officers, war correspondents of the \"UN Forces\" and foreign minister residents and consuls inspect the battle.\r\n   But the battle ended in a total fiasco.\r\n   As a result, van fleet was stripped of the general's uniform.\r\n   Clark who was appointed as commander of the \"UN Forces\" at the end of the Korean war vowed to his Washington master who had been driven to desperate straits by repeated setbacks in the war to turn the scale in the war.\r\n   He called many flying corps out to commit indiscriminate bombing, saying that he would remove 78 towns in the northern half of Korea from the map. The bombing became powerless before the firm will of the Korean people.\r\n   The \"Kimhwa offensive\" into which he had thrown huge forces, staking his own fate on it, ended in a shameful defeat.\r\n   After suffering one setback after another, the U.S. ruling quarters told Clark to sign an armistice agreement, admitting their defeat.\r\n   Clark lamented his fate as the first U.S. Forces commander who failed to win victory and signed the armistice agreement.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
