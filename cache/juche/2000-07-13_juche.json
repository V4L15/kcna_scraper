            "content": "Victims testify to Japanese imperialists' drafting \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- Papers here on July 11 and 12 carried articles by Ri Ho Jun and Hong Chan Jong residing in Ryonhwa-dong no. 2 in central district of Pyongyang, revealing the Japanese imperialists' drafting of Koreans.\r\n   They belonged to at least six million young and middle aged Koreans who were forced to do slave labour in Japan after being drafted by the Japanese imperialists before the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They wrote about what they experienced, recalling that the Japanese imperialists kidnapped or drafted Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Ho Jun noted he could not repress his bitter anger at Japan persistently raising a hue and cry over \"kidnapping\" by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as the issue of \"kidnapping\" is concerned, it is the DPRK that should indict Japan, he pointed out, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   My native home is Anak county of Hwanghae province, a plain area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I was drafted at the age of 21, when I was a worker of the Kyomipho Iron and Steel Factory (now Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I was taken to Pusan from Hwangju Railway Station by train and to Shimonoseki from Pusan by a ship and finally to the Kawasaki shipyard in Japan. During the trip I was treated no better than an animal and under the constant watch by Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Tentacles of the Japanese imperialists' drafting stretched to every nook and corner of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hong Chan Jong, who was living in a mountainous village of Jasong county of Jagang province at that time, was cheated by the then county headman with a promise to give him an opportunity to study in Japan before being taken to the Kobe steel plant of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The drafting was supervised by fully armed Japanese imperialist MPs or plainclothes Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I was given only a few grains of boiled beens and thin salty soup as meals though I was forced to toil 12-14 hours a day like a slave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Ho Jun and Hong Chan Jong in the articles emphasized the history can neither be denied nor covered up. No country is so shameless as Japan which has not said any word of apology for forcing Koreans to labour like beasts of burden after kidnapping and drafting them, far from paying compensation to them, and is now working hard to charge the DPRK with \"kidnapping.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities should clearly judge the Korean people's anti-Japanese feelings and make an official apology and compensation for all the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past, they demanded.    \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang railway project and built the Kwangmyongsong Saltern covering hundreds of hectares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And they put into operation the Anbyon Youth Power Station (first stage), an oxygen blown furnace and a high-quality magnesia clinker factory and built a dam for the Namgang Power Station. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   True to the will of the president, they wonderfully built grand monumental edifices in the era of the Workers' Party of Korea, including the mausoleum of King Tangun, the monument to party founding, Chongryu Bridge and Pyongyang-Hyangsan Tourist Motorway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Scientists and technicians succeeded in launching \"Kwangmyongsong 1,\" the first artificial satellite, into its orbit and made many inventions to dynamically advance the building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il has always led the work to lay the solid foundations of a powerful nation, true to the behest of the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il saw to it that the grand monumental edifices which the president had planned to build in his lifetime were constructed before anything else and preferentially gave on-the-spot guidance to the places associated with revolutionary activities of the president so as to make the august name and exploits of the president shine forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to Kim Jong Il the president is immortal as the eternal sun of Juche together with the history of the building of a powerful socialist nation.    \r\n\r\n"

Moreover, there is stronger zeal of Japanese monopoly capital for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries can start their overseas aggression any moment.\r\n   Japan has made Korea and other Asian countries immediate targets of its overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is prompted by its military strategic calculation that Korea and its other neighbouring countries should be conquered before any others and its dangerous design to bring vast markets and sources of raw materials in Asia under its control and thus gain world supremacy. \r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare ignite a war against Asian countries, holding them in contempt, they will not escape a severe punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Peace is the only way for Japan to survive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to bear this in mind and stop reckless arms buildup and moves for overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n"
