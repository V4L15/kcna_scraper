U.S. Ambassador in Seoul Bershbow openly made remarks threatening and blackmailing the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warmongers of the south Korean military, at the instigation of their American master, are busy developing and introducing latest war hardware, while talking about \"sort of capacity of independently executing a war\" and \"acquisition of combat power for deterring the north\".\r\n The commentary terms the above-said moves unpardonable criminal acts to throw hurdles in the way of finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., escalate confrontation and tensions on the Korean Peninsula and unleash a nuclear war against the DPRK at any cost. \r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group uttered that the U.S. is not hostile to north Korea but respects its sovereignty.  But it, in actuality, has made careful preparations in all aspects to mount military attacks on the DPRK anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outcries let loose by the U.S. trigger-happy circles are little short of declaring that the U.S. has already completed the preparations for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A war may break out on the Korean Peninsula any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists will not escape the fate of the forlorn wandering spirit should they dare ignite a war on this land and invade even an inch of the sky, land and sea of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warhawks should bear in mind that their \"cooperation\" with the U.S. in its moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK, quite contrary to the aspiration of the nation and the trend of the times, would only bring miserable self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Anybody will fall a victim to it and the existence of the Korean nation itself will be in danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should turn out as one to foil the U.S. war provocation moves against the DPRK and uproot the source of war from this land through the nation-wide struggle to drive the U.S. troops out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
