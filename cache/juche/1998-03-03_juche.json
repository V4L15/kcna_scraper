Paektu, the holy mountain of the Korean revolution.\r\n   He saw with great satisfaction scores of art works representing the indomitable spirit and magnificent scenes of the mountain such as Korean paintings \"lightning above Lake Chon of Mt. Paektu,\" \"Rhododendron on Lake Chon,\" \"Tiger Rock of Mt. Paektu,\" \"Twin Rainbow Peak of Mt.

Paektu, which is the symbol of Korea and the cradle of the 5,000-year-long history of the nation, is the holy mountain of revolution where the WPK's glorious revolutionary tradition takes its deep roots and the dawn of national liberation broke. He also said the ancestral mountain has always been the banner of struggle, the banner of victory for the Korean people.\r\n   He noted that Mt. Paektu and its vicinity have turned into a school for education of the party members, working people and students in the revolutionary tradition established by President Kim Il Sung and that more art works representing the spirit of Mt. Paektu should be created to greatly contribute to carrying forward the tradition of Juche through generations.\r\n   He said the revolutionary art works are of weighty importance in the politico-ideological education and emotional education of the party members and working people. \r\n   He then gave highly important tasks for fully preserving the Juche character and national character of fine art.    \r\n     \r\n"

It is also to solve all the problems in reliance on the advantages of the socialist system and the economic foundations of its own.\r\n   The immeasurable ordeals and difficulties are lying in our forced march for socialism.

Korea was faced with food shortage and economic difficulties for years, owing to the repeated grave natural disasters.\r\n   The world worried over the life or death of Korea.  \r\n   But Korea remains unchanged.\r\n   Korean socialism in which the idea and faith, feelings and emotion, destiny and future of the leader and the people are welded into one is more firmly consolidating and winning victory after victory whatever obstacles and difficulties may lie ahead.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
