Another is to isolate and suffocate the DPRK politically and militarily by branding it as a \"missile proliferating state.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This brings into bolder relief the long-standing U.S. dominationist ambition and impudence. It also eloquently shows that the U.S. call for \"dialogue and cooperation\", \"peace and disarmament\" is nothing but sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This impudence of the U.S. may throw a grave obstacle in the way of improving relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK and the U.S. are in dialogue process. Action getting on dialogue partner's nerves should be avoided to advance dialogue and establish cooperative relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nonetheless, the U.S. is intensifying the political and military moves against the DPRK, persistently floating baseless rumour of \"missile threat.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unless the U.S. discards its intention to stifle the DPRK, the latter will have no option but to take a strong countermeasure, which belongs to the DPRK's sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In that case the situation will not be in favor of the U.S. and it will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom. \r\n\r\n"

But, Japan has not made any proper apology for its monstrous crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The relationship between the DPRK and Japan is that between the victim and the assailant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is quite natural for the criminal to admit his crimes, face judgement and make an apology and pay compensation to the victim from a legal and moral point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accusing the Japanese government of whitewashing its crime-woven past in a bid to evade its settlement, the article notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Termination of hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan and the opening of diplomatic ties between them can not be expected without Japan's settlement of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is only one basic principle to govern the process to improve the DPRK-Japan relations. This principle is that Japan's redress for its crimes committed against the Korean people in the past is a prerequisite to improving the relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This principle can never change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan is to admit and settle its past crimes, it should, first of all, apologize for its military aggression on Korea and for misfortune, sufferings, disasters and damage it imposed upon the Korean people during its occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should be a political apology which reflects its sincere repentance for its past crimes and its will not to repeat them and this apology be made by the chief executive of the Japanese government before the normalization of the relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should also compensate for the human and material losses it inflicted upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should make material compensation for the destroyed cultural treasures and return all the looted ones to meet the principled demands of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The improvement of the legal status of the Koreans in Japan should be part of Japan's settlement of its crimes committed against the DPRK in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not only those who suffered damage directly from Japan but also their descendants are demanding Japan settle its crimes perpetrated against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's delay in liquidating its past crimes against the DPRK would add to its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will surely force Japan to pay compensation for its past crimes. \r\n\r\n"

Answering a question put by KCNA today in this regard, the spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. employs the trite method of sacrificing small countries to please big countries, but it is gravely mistaken if it thinks that will work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. moves to establish the NMD aimed to get unchallenged upper hand in strength are censured and condemned not only by its allies and Americans but by the international community as they are very dangerous and reckless moves to vitiate the world strategic stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The U.S. is brazen-faced enough to talk about \"threat\" of the DPRK's peaceful satellite launch although it deployed thousands of nuclear missiles in different parts of the world and carries out test-firing almost every day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its insincere implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.

Paektu (2,750 m) soaring imposingly in the northern inland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is called Mt. Paektu (white head) because it looks as if it is covered with snow all the year round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It consists of many peaks of various forms such as Janggun Peak, Hyangdo Peak and Ssangmujigae Peak with rocks of fantastic shape. On the top of it is Lake Chon, a crater which is more than 14 km round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are thick forests around the mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fascinating is the scenery of the mountain at sunrise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The area of the mountain is associated with the history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle of the President Kim Il Sung. And there is a native home of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why it is called a holy mountain of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mt. Kumgang is a world-famous one in the northern part of the Thaebaek mountain range which lies in the central part of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is called Mt. Kumgang for its jewel-like scenery in spring when all things in the universe come back to life and all kinds of flowers come into bloom and emit fragrance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Multifarious and grand landscape scenery can be seen in the vast area of the mountain, 40 km from east to west and 60 km from north to south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are upper Paldam pool with a legend that eight fairies of heaven used to come down to have a bath, the Kuryong pond, the Kuryong Falls and many other ponds and waterfalls, rocks of fantastic shape, rocky cliffs and mountain beauty remind us of a painting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Especially, on the Piro Peak (1,639 m), its main peak, you command a bird's-eye view of 12,000 peaks and valleys of Mt. Kumgang, the East Sea of Korea and landscape of vast area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mountain has been well known not only to Korea but to the world as well from thousands of years ago for its superb scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mt. Myohyang in the western inland is one of the famous mountains. It is called Mt. Myohyang for its beauty and fragrance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It tops grand and magnificent beauty as many peaks of 1,300 m and over with the Piro Peak (1,909m) as its main one rise like the teeth of a saw. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The mountain boasts of 8 famous views of Hyangsan including meeting and seeing off guests at the Simjin pavilion, moon-viewing at the Bulyong pavilion, waterfall-viewing at the Inho rock and night glow at the Tangun pavilion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Indeed, Korea is rich in famous mountains. \r\n\r\n"

The \"A.B.C. plan\" was part of their plan of aggression on the Far East. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is known to the world that the \"A.B.C. plan\" was worked out by the Macarthur command at pentagon's instruction from 1948 to early 1950 and approved by the U.S. joint chiefs of staff in around January 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The plan envisaged the three stages of war--the first stage (A) was to begin the war of aggression on Korea involving the U.S. troops and the \"ROK\" Army, the second stage (B) to spread the war to Manchuria involving the re-armed Japanese Army and the Chiang Kai-shek Army and the third stage (C) to conquer the whole Siberia, including Ural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the \"a scenario\" the U.S. worked out the \"plan for northward expedition\" by the \"ROK\" Army, a detailed military action program for the provocation of a war of aggression in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While crying  out for \"northward expedition,\" the U.S. and the South Korean ruling quarters made an unbroken chain of armed assaults across the 38th parallel, paving the way for full-dress war of aggression on the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.'s new war plan for \"northward expedition\" was to begin the Korean War before July 1950 and round off the war preparations in the U.S. mainland and Japan, particularly in South Korea just before the outbreak of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also called for making the U.S. troops as well as the \"ROK\" Army take an active part in the war from its outset and concentrating all forces on breaking through the 38th parallel instead of carrying out landing operations on the east and west coasts of the North Korea which had been envisaged in the \"northward expedition\" plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    It elaborated on the diplomatic plan of the U.S. Department of State to give political backing to the military operation plan of pentagon and the U.S. joint chiefs of staff, the intelligence action program of the KLO and the South Korean ruling quarters, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    With a view to meeting the demands for their world supremacy strategy and Korea policy of aggression the U.S. imperialists worked out and rounded off the very reckless plan of war of aggression to let the \"ROK\" Army provoke the war of aggression on the North Korea, promptly hurl the U.S. troops into the front to conquer the whole of Korea in a short time and turn the Korean War into a world war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article discloses that the armed intrusion of the U.S. and the South Korean rulers into the area north of the 38th parallel was a prelude to the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. orchestrated a series of \"small wars\" and armed intrusions into areas north of the 38th parallel against the DPRK from 1947 and escalated them to provoke the Korean War on June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The number of cases of armed intrusion reached 2,617 in 1949 when their \"plan for the northward expedition\" entered a phase of implementation and this continued and got more pronounced in the first half of 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. employed broad hoax to cover up their aggressive nature and shift the responsibility for the war on to the DPRK.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Behind the curtain of this deceptive offensive the U.S. finally rounded off their war preparations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They, among other things, decided to move up the month for the start of the war to June from July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under this decision the U.S. rushed political adviser to the U.S. President Dulles, secretary of defence Johnson and chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff Bradley and others to South Korea and Tokyo to finally examine the preparations for the Korean War and take necessary measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Military proposals set out at the \"four-party talks\" were ratified by Truman and a combat order was issued to the \"ROK\" Army to invade the north all at once at dawn of June 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group, explaining the reason \"why the U.S. chose June 25,\" said that June 25 being Sunday, no one would believe that the U.S. and South Korea started a war on Sunday, as the U.S. and South Korea, both Christian lands, observed Sunday as the lord's day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With nothing can the U.S. imperialists cover up their true colors as the provoker of the Korean War and escape a severe judgement of history, the article warns. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
