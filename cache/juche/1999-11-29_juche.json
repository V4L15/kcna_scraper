Korea plan \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today, denouncing the United States and South Korean authorities for having overtly revealed their plan of invading the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At a \"U.S.-South Korea annual security consultative meeting\" recently held in Washington, the U.S. and South Korean authorities groundlessly slandered the DPRK over \"bio-chemical weapons\" and agreed to strengthen the anti-DPRK cooperation system to cope with the unstable security situation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. Secretary of Defense Cohen went so far as to urge the DPRK to choose between \"cooperation\" and \"confrontation\" in compliance with their brigandish demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the same time, the United States officially announced that it would dispatch 600,000 troops, five detached squadrons, 200 warships and 1,200 planes to the Korean peninsula in case of a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows the \"annual security consultative meeting\" was a discussion of war of aggression where a second Korean war was made an established fact and forestalling attack on the DPRK was confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the talks held so far with the DPRK, the U.S. called for \"high-level talks\" for improved relations. No sooner had the talks ended than the U.S. Made public a timetable for emergency dispatch of huge aggressor forces to the Korean peninsula. This eloquently shows that their ambition for invasion of the DPRK still remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By overtly revealing their design on war against the DPRK and threatening it, they foolishly intend to gain some concessions and lull sharp criticism for the massacre in Rogun-ri, the spraying of defoliant in the demilitarized zone and other crimes they committed against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people and army are in full preparedness with maximum vigilance over the new war preparations of the U.S. and South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the aggressors unleash war of aggression, we will take the opportunity to wipe out the enemies at one stroke. \r\n\r\n"
