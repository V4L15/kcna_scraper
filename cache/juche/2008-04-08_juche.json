In the meantime, the minister of Unification blustered that he would \"adjust the speed, scope and ways for the development of the inter-Korean relations depending on the progress made in the efforts to settle the north's nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary terms the reckless remarks made by the Lee Myung Bak group a revelation of their ulterior aim to pull out of all the inter-Korean agreements over the nuclear issue on the peninsula and bring the inter-Korean relations back to the era of fascist dictatorship and an open declaration of confrontation with the DPRK and a war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula was spawned as the United States turned south Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world in a bid to stifle the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Lee and his gentries are interested in the denuclearization of the peninsula, they should make a bold decision to force the U.S. to withdraw its nuclear weapons massively stockpiled in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are behaving so provocatively as to dare demand someone dismantle nuclear weapons, while putting their crimes and obligations on the shelf. This is only putting a brake on the process of the denuclearization of the peninsula. What is prerequisite to settling the nuclear issue on the peninsula is to create an environment necessary for this process. The U.S. should make a policy switchover and adjust its nuclear policy and put an end to all its political and military threat to the DPRK's security and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group's outbursts demanding \"the north dismantle its nukes first\" put the inter-Korean relations in a crisis and threw a stumbling block in the way of the denuclearization process. It is as clear as noonday that their persistent insistence on the above-said provocative assertion would only lead to a war on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who go reckless, turning their backs on compatriots and dancing to the tune of foreign forces, are bound to meet self- destruction, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has kept conducting nuclear tests and bolstering its nuclear forces despite international protest and condemnation. It is bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the Korean Peninsula after massively deploying nuclear weapons in south Korea. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. warmongers brought to south Korea means for nuclear strikes including nuclear-powered carriers and nuclear submarines in March, staging a nuclear test war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not entitled to say anything about someone's \"nuclear issue\" or pull him up over it.
