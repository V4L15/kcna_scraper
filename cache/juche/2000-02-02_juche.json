It should, therefore, honestly fulfil its obligation as a defeated nation under the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. negation of its start of the Korean War and massacres in the '50s is nothing but an intention to repeat such crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people can never forget the U.S.'s massacres but will fight on till they make an official apology and compensation for them. \r\n\r\n"
