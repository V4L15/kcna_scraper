A month or so after the verdict, the south Korean \"court\" made a \"magnanimous\" decision to release Kim Hyon Chol. As a result, one of the chief culprits of the corruption scandal caused by monetary \"privilege\" was released in a few months under judicial \"privilege.\"\r\n   This was a Mafia-style rescue operation that could be seen only in such a corrupt society as south Korea.\r\n   Lurking behind this release are Kim Young Sam, who accumulated hundreds of millions of dollars in slush funds through Mafia-style violence and irregularities, and the \"political depression\" of south Korea, a product of his corrupt rule.\r\n   Kim Young Sam has driven south Korean society into a total crisis during his office of five years. This time, he abused his power to rescue the little thief, taking advantage of the serious political confusion with the \"Presidential election\" at hand.\r\n   It is not without reason that an opposition party leader in south Korea branded Kim Young Sam as a \"dirty traitor who lives on government power\" and a businessman described the south Korean judicial system as a \"stick like Mafia's arms.\"\r\n   South Korea is where public sentiment is flouted, public will is refuted and the political structure is openly abused in the operation of rescuing thieves the way Mafia does.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\nPyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the DPRK Medical Society issued a statement today, accusing the Kim Young Sam regime of branding the DPRK as a source of disease in south Korea.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   Some time ago, the puppet health authorities announced that malaria has become an endemic disease with the rapid increase of malaria cases in recent years, for instance, some 13,000 cases this year, in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line including Kyonggi and Kangwon provinces. And they ascribed the cause to the movement of infected mosquitos from the north to the south.\r\n   This is a sheer lie and sophism that goes against reality and common sense and does not make any sense.\r\n   In the north of Korea where the party's policy of preventive medicine is fully applied, the sources of infectious diseases such as malaria, a leftover of the old society, have totally disappeared.\r\n   In Korea, July and august are the best months for mosquitos. In this season, the wind blows hard northward from the south and lots of insects move to the north, doing harm to people.\r\n   The rapid increase of malaria and other cases in south Korea is attributable to the antisocial health policy of south Korean rulers and the corrupt and ailing social system. \r\n   The south Korean rulers blame the north for the malaria cases in south Korea, with a view to diverting elsewhere public attention and inciting hostile feelings against the DPRK as their government crisis is getting more serious because of internal feud with the \"Presidential election\" at hand.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime, the root cause of the spread of infectious diseases in south Korea, had better mind its own business.    \r\n\r\n"
