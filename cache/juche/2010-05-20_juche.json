            "content": "National Defence Commission Issues Statement\r\nPyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK National Defence Commission issued a statement today as regards the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\" of the south Korean puppet navy.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement reads:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe had already warned the south Korean group of traitors not to make reckless remarks concerning the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\" of the puppet navy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the group of traitors had far-fetchedly tried to link the case with us without offering any material evidence. It finally announced the results of the joint investigation based on a sheer fabrication, which assert that the warship was sunken by our torpedo attack, in a bid to mislead the public opinion inside and outside Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is, at the same time, crying out for \"punishment\" and \"retaliation\" internally and foolishly seeking to prod the international community into applying additional \"sanctions\" against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat matters is that traitor Lee Myung Bak is taking the lead in such anti-DPRK smear campaign, even daring slander the headquarters of our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, Kim Thae Yong and other gangsters of the south Korean puppet military accustomed to flattery and blind obedience echo Lee Myung Bak's outbursts. This smear campaign is fanned up by Ryu Myung Hwan and other ultra-rightist conservatives of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is also joined by the U.S. and Japanese aggressors who are making desperate efforts to keep their hostile policy towards the DPRK on its orbit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe would like to question them so busy linking the above-said case with the DPRK why they don't link with it the death of a puppet army soldier, crashes of fighter plane and gunship of the puppet navy and air force and the sinking of a civilian fishing boat that occurred one after another almost simultaneously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the age of science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a swollen balloon is bound to break, any lie is bound to be brought to light no matter how hard one may try to make it sound plausible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is evident is that the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\" can never be construed otherwise than a \"conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\" orchestrated by the group of traitors in a deliberate and brigandish manner to achieve certain political and military aims because only 46 soldiers met miserable deaths while officers survived the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis being a hard reality, they are pointing a dirty accusing finger at us like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a trite method of the successive south Korean puppet regimes to fake up a shocking case and use it for floating a story about \"north wind\" whenever they find themselves in a crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese days they are using for this plot even \"deserters from the north\" who had found their ways to a dumping ground and human scum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe National Defence Commission of the DPRK responsible for the defence of the country and the security of the nation clarifies the principled stand of our army and people in view of the grave situation where the sinister plot of the group of traitors may lead to reckless actions against us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. As the group of traitors declared that the sinking of the warship\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Cheonan\" is linked with us, the NDC of the DPRK will dispatch\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tan inspection group to the spot of south Korea to verify material\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tevidence concerning the linkage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors should produce before the dignified\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tinspection group of the DPRK material evidence proving that the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tsinking of the warship is linked with us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe remind the group of traitors in advance that there should be\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tnot a shred of doubt about the material evidence to be produced\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tbefore the inspection group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Our army and people will promptly react to any \"punishment\" and \"retaliation\" and to any \"sanctions\" infringing upon our state interests with various forms of tough measures including an all-out war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe all-out war to be undertaken by us will be a sacred war involving the whole nation, all the people and the whole state for completely eliminating the strongholds of the group of traitors who orchestrated \"the conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\" and their followers and building instead a reunified power in which the whole nation emerges powerful and prosperous. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tough countermeasures to be taken by us will prove to be practical actions of justice for dealing unpredictable sledge-hammer blows at the group of traitors who blocks national reconciliation and unity and stirs up an atmosphere of confrontation in the south Korean society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Now that the group of traitors declared what it called \"decisive actions\", we will brand any small incident that occurs in the territorial waters, air and land where our sovereignty is exercised including the West Sea of Korea as a provocation of confrontation maniacs and react to it with unlimited retaliatory blow, merciless strong physical blow. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is our invariable iron will to react to \"retaliation\" with more powerful retaliation and to \"punishment\" with indiscriminate punishment of our style. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAvailing ourselves of this opportunity, we sternly warn the U.S. and Japanese authorities and riff-raffs, their poor lackeys, to act with discretion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world will clearly see what dear price the group of traitors will have to pay for the clumsy \"conspiratorial farce\" and \"charade\" concocted to stifle compatriots."

Korea's Groundless Accusations against DPRK Refuted\r\n Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The south Korean conservative group at the NPT review conference now under way in the U.S. behaved so recklessly as imploring for \"more tightened international sanctions\" against the DPRK, while making groundless accusations against it with a hue and cry over \"a blatant challenge to nuclear non-proliferation.\" At the 25th south Korea-U.S. \"meeting on security policy initiative\" the group was so foolish as to beg its master for \"military cooperation\" in the moves against the DPRK while vociferating about what it called \"provocation\" and \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's above-said behavior is nothing but a treacherous criminal act to do harm to the DPRK in collusion with foreign forces under the pretext of \"nuclear non-proliferation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This betrays the despicable ambition of the group of traitors to stand in the way of the process for building a peace-keeping regime on the Korean Peninsula as servants for the aggressors, push the inter-Korean relations to a catastrophe and, furthermore, ignite a nuclear war of aggression against the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet ruling forces are the nuclear criminals gravely threatening the destiny of the country and the nation by shipping nuclear weapons of foreign aggressor forces into south Korea and frantically stepping up the moves to ignite a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fellow countrymen will never pardon the clique of traitors, which finds fault with fellow countrymen, though it has committed so hideous acts of treachery, and gets frantic with the scheme to bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war, but mete out a stern punishment to  it on behalf of the nation."

Puesto que la banda de traidores hablo publicamente de la supuesta \"accion resuelta\", consideraremos como provocacion de los maniacos de confrontacion cualquier incidente pequeno que acontezca en el mar, el cielo y el territorio bajo nuestra jurisdiccion, inclusive el Mar Oeste de Corea, y responderemos con un potente golpe fisico de represalia que no tendra limites ni piedad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResponder con la represalia mas intensiva a la \"represalia\" y con implacable castigo a nuestro estilo al \"castigo merecido\", esto es nuestra voluntad invariable y tan firme como acero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta oportunidad, advertimos severamente a las autoridades de EE.UU. y Japon y otros fulanos y menganos, quienes se portan irracionalmente adhiriendose a las primeras, que actuen con prudencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera claramente cuan caro pagara la banda de traidores su torpe \"complot\" e \"invento\" fabricados para aplastar a los connacionales."
