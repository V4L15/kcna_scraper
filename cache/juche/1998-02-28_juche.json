But what is more important is to have a correct view of the past and draw a proper lesson from it.\r\n   The north and the south of Korea should reject dependence on outsiders and foreign interference, maintain the Juche character and national character and pursue independence. \r\n   And they should not antagonize each other but seek reconciliation and unity. \r\n   From this point of view, we hope to have no impressions that there is no change in inter-Korean relations and the reunification issue though there was another change of regime in South Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Confidence in the dialogue partner is a prerequisite to a successful dialogue.\r\n   It is undesirable to come out to the negotiation table to waste time under public pressure, while seeking unification by military force.\r\n   It is important first of all to stop all acts opposing or hurting the dialogue partner.\r\n   It is also necessary to keep the door open for all the compatriots desirous for reunification to take part in the movement for reunification. All the people of the nation should be encouraged to participate in the reunification dialogue, irrespective of their being \"pro-north\" or \"pro-south.\"\r\n   South Korean political parties and organizations should refrain from fostering distrust and antagonism between the two halves of the country and promote understanding and confidence through contacts.\r\n   They should discard the deep-rooted concept of confrontation with the north.\r\n   They should not follow in footsteps of former dictators who incited distrust, antagonism and confrontation between the fellow countrymen nor abuse the reunification issue for their interests. \r\n   The South Korean political parties, organizations and figures should show an affirmative response to the call of our joint meeting for creating a good atmosphere of dialogue and negotiations for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
