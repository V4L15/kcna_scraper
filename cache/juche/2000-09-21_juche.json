And he put forward the Juche-oriented lines and policies of national reunification and wisely led the whole nation  to the struggle to implement them, developing the movement for great national unity and national reunification on to a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation has now held in high esteem the great leader Kim Jong Il who is identical with him in idea, leadership and virtues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il is wisely leading the struggle to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche and the cause of national reunification started by Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il's idea and theory on the essence, character and invincibility of the driving force of the nation who will defend and carry out the cause of national independence are the basic guidelines in the settlement of the issue of the nation which help smash all sorts of imperialism and dominationism, realize national independence and successfully hew out the destiny of nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Thanks to his outstanding idea and leadership Korea has become a powerful country of transparent national independence politics which nobody dares to invade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is under the guidance of the great leaders that the dignity of the Korean nation is shining, the DPRK is demonstrating its might and the cause of national reunification related to the vital destiny of the nation is firmly guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a shortcut to accomplishing the cause of national independence and building a powerful unified state of Juche in the east to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem forever as the eternal sun of Juche and uphold the leadership of Kim Jong Il with single-hearted unity. \r\n\r\n"
