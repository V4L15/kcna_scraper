            "content": "U.S. Dangerous Sabre-rattling against DPRK Condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- As reported, the U.S. bellicose forces today launched large-scale war maneuvers against the DPRK, a combination of the \"Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration\" (RSOI) and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise with the front area of south Korea as an operational theatre.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says in a signed commentary in this regard: RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" are an open challenge to the whole Korean nation and the world peace-loving people desirous of detente and peace on the Korean peninsula as they are one more dangerous military provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disclosing the offensive nature and danger of these plays with fire against the north evidenced by their scale, contents and methods involved, the commentary terms these joint military exercises a test nuclear war and a preliminary war against the DPRK as they are designed to make a preemptive attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the second round of the six-way talks closed than the U.S. announced its plan to stage large-scale war maneuvers against the DPRK in the sky, land and waters of south Korea. This clearly indicates that though the U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" and \"peace,\" it is, in fact, working hard to swallow up the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is nobody's secret that the U.S. has already worked out a \"New Operation Plan-5026\", a new dangerous war scenario for invading the DPRK. A dialogue can never go with a war maneuver. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of a nuclear war cannot be removed from the Korean peninsula nor can peace be preserved there as long as the U.S. persists in its moves to start a nuclear war against the DPRK in a bid to stifle it by force of arms. The DPRK will not remain a mere on-looker to these developments. Strength is not a monopoly of the United States.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Actions against the passage of \"the motion on impeachment against the president\" through the \"National Assembly\" are reportedly going on in south Korea.\r\n The Democratic Workers' Party, the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the National Federation of Peasants Associations, the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils and other democratic movement organizations held a meeting of representatives of people on the emergency situation in Seoul on March 16 to cope with the situation created in the wake of the passage of the motion, settle the problem of the deteriorated people's living, put an end to the corrupt politics and realize progressive politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution released at the meeting noted that an absolute majority of people are expressing irrepressible resentment at the \"motion.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The blame for this situation entirely rests with the corrupt political forces which drove south Korea to the state of bankruptcy, trampling down upon the political right of the people, it noted, calling for conducting an all-out campaign to liquidate the corrupt political forces, judge the neo-liberal conservative politics and realize progressive politics in order to fundamentally settle the situation created in the wake of the \"passage of the motion\" through the NA on March 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"National Students' Committee of Emergency Measures for the Annulment of the Motion on Impeachment, Dissolution of the 16th-term 'National Assembly' and a Judgment in the General Election in April\" grouping the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils, the South Korean Federation of University Students in the twenty-first century, the All Together Association, the Students Solidarity for Political Reform and other organizations held a \"meeting of representatives of student organizations to jointly counter the \"motion on impeachment against the president\" at Korea University on March 15. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting the committee set it as a slogan for the immediate struggle to declare the \"motion\" invalid, get the Grand National Party and the Democratic Party dissolved and the \"National Assembly\" disorganized, champion democracy, put an end to the corrupt politics and restore the policy for people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It decided to organize a meeting on the emergency situation and a rally calling on all the students to rise up in a campaign for declaring the motion on impeachment invalid, getting the 16th-term \"National Assembly\" dissolved and protecting democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Headquarters of the People's Movement for the Withdrawal of the U.S. Forces on March 16 issued a statement on the situation titled \"Let us foil the political plot of the U.S. and the remnant forces of pro-American military dictatorship and punish them through the general election.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said that the people would never pardon the corrupt political camp including the GNP, a group of traitors who, clinging to the coattails of foreign forces, are working hard to scrap the June 15 joint declaration, incite confrontation and antipathy between fellow countrymen in the south and the north and thus desecrate the successes made in the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on all the people to unite as one in the actions against the row of \"impeachment\" kicked up by the U.S. keen to block independence, democracy and reunification and its henchmen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, they only experienced setbacks owing to the separatist and flunkeyist acts of the nationalists and the decentralized anti-Japanese movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on the analysis of this serious weak point of the Korean anti-Japanese movement, he conceived a far-reaching idea that in order to smash the fascist rule of Japanese imperialism and win the independence of the nation, it was imperative to rely on the internal force of the nation and have a revolutionary organization which would be strong in the anti-imperialist, independent stand and root deep among the popular masses, and energetically pushed ahead with the preparation for its formation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He proclaimed the formation of the KNA in Hakdanggol, Pyongyang on March 23, Juche 6 (1917 ). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KNA was a secret organization with the aim of achieving national independence and establishing a truly civilized state through concerted efforts of the Korean nation. It was one of the largest anti-Japanese underground revolutionary organizations of Korean patriots formed at home and abroad just before and after the March First Popular Uprising. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He directed special attention to closely combining the struggle of the KNA with revolutionary armed activities and led the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle to a new upswing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea of \"Aim High!\" has been successfully realized in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by President Kim Il Sung who achieved the liberation of the country and built Korean-style socialist society centered on the popular masses under the banner of the Juche idea and by leader Kim Jong Il who is defending socialism and carrying forward the revolutionary cause of Juche by force of arms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "White Paper on Recent Political Terrorism in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute in a white paper issued on March 21 branded the recent political rebellion committed under the signboard of \"impeachment against the president\" at the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea as an outright challenge to history and the mindset of people, a crude violation of democracy and most barbarous and illegal political terrorism.\r\n World history knows no such a law-making body ridden with illegality, lawlessness and evils as the National Assembly in south Korea, the paper said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the 15th presidential election in 1997 south Korea witnessed a dramatic regime change. The ruling political party that had dominated the NA was reduced to an opposition party. The Grand National Party bribed National Assemblymen from both ruling and opposition parties with \"political funds\" it illegally collected during its ruling period in a bid to make up for its defeat in the presidential election. As a result, it occupied majority seats in the NA. It postponed the organization of the NA for as many as 40 days in a bid to win such important seats as those of chairmen of standing committees including the \"special committee for budget settlement,\" \"the legislation and judicial committee\" and the \"committee for reunification, diplomacy and trade,\" to say nothing of that of the speaker of the NA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP group's high-handed and self-justified practices backed by the NA had become all the more pronounced since the right-wing conservative forces were defeated in the 2002 presidential election, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year alone, the GNP ilk put in motion the voting machine of the NA and railroaded \"four bills on special inspection,\" thus attacking \" the government for people\" and driving the political situation into a chaos. During the entire term of the 16th NA the GNP unilaterally convened 8 extraordinary sessions of the NA, put more than ten NA sessions to a stalemate, railroaded seven bills through it and called seven bullet-proof NA sessions in a bid to help its riff-raffs flee from the prosecution's investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NA is a den of irregularities and corruption. Such hideous financial scandals as \"the National Security Planning Board budget embezzlement case,\" \" national tax scandal\" and \"illegal presidential election fund scam\" have been disclosed in south Korea in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the GNP forced business tycoons to provide it with truck loads of money amounting to hundreds of billions of won as an election fund in the last presidential election. Scores of National Assemblymen have so far been interrogated by the prosecution for their involvement in presidential election fund scams and the majority of them are from the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent political rebellion committed by the conservative forces including the GNP under the back-stage manipulation of the U.S. was a product of their mean plot to divert elsewhere the people's attention focused on their irregularities and corruption and turn the situation before the general election in their favour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK fully approved and officially consented to the inter-Korean agreement adopted at the north-south high-level talks in 1991. But the south Korean National Assembly turned it down and answered it by joining the U.S. in kicking up an anti-DPRK nuclear racket and resuming the temporarily-suspended Team Spirit military exercises next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for laws adopted by the NA of south Korea, none of them pursues reconciliation, unity and reunification but seeks division and confrontation. \r\n The NA has hamstrung every effort for dialogue, contacts and cooperation between the north and the south, taking issue with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to its obstructive moves that north-south economic cooperation failed to make desired progress and not a shovelful of earth has been removed in the construction site of the Kaesong Industrial Zone though it started 4 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on history, the NA has traversed a road of treachery as it has sold off the national dignity and interests to the outsiders, pursuing a sycophantic and traitorous policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is now making desperate efforts to calm down the anti-U.S. spirit for independence that has rapidly mounted in south Korea since the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the GNP and other pro-U.S. conservative forces in the NA that are making desperate efforts to keep the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in south Korea for an indefinite period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It fully disclosed its true colors as a pro-U.S. NA and a war NA by zealously supporting the U.S. in its hard-line policy concerning the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the south Korean NA is a traitorous NA which lets the nation fall victim to the outsiders, utterly indifferent to its dignity, sovereignty and security, and a pro-U.S. law-making body and a war NA pursuant to the U.S. war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was behind the recent NA passage of the \"motion on impeachment\" in south Korea. The U.S. should stop interfering in the internal affairs of south Korea and remove its dark tentacles from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans from all walks of life should never tolerate the conservative forces' plot to usurp the initial achievement made in the struggle for democracy but turn out as one to dismantle the cursed NA and bring about new politics, new system and new life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
