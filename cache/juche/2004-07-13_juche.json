Herein lies the chief aim of the U.S. in bringing forward what it calls RMSI, the news analyst notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main target of the U.S.-advocated RMSI is the DPRK. The United States is seeking to cut off and block economic and trade dealings between the DPRK and other countries and isolate and stifle the DPRK by seizing a military reign on the Strait of Malacca and controlling and restricting the navigation of the ships of various countries to the DPRK and DPRK ships through the strait. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is mistaken. The self-righteousness, arbitrariness and unilateralism of the U.S. work no more with the present world, but is rejected everywhere. The United States should give up the anachronistic scheme of naval blockade.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
