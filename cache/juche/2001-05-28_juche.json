            "content": "U.S. troop pullout from South Korea urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- A ridiculous remark made by a high-ranking official of the bush administration recently as regards the issue of resuming talks between the DPRK and the U.S. comes under fire by a signed commentary of rodong sinmun today. The commentary says: He asserted that the \"resumption of the talks should be preceded by the north's reduction of its troops deployed along the military demarcation line.\" He also said that the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea is to cope with \"possible North Korean  military provocation.\" \r\n Lurking behind such remark is a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By raising the \"issue of North Korean forces reduction\" as a precondition for the resumption of the talks, the United States seeks to render the bilateral relations complicated and while away time with that as a pretext and thus keep its troops in South Korea for an indefinite period and keep the Korean peninsula in a state of military confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its ulterior aim is to completely disarm the DPRK in a bid to create a military vacuum on its front and rear and seize it anytime with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the U.S. to assert that it keeps its troops in South Korea to cope with \"possible North Korean military provocation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south have already adopted an agreement on non-aggression and the June 15 Joint Declaration. It is our steadfast stand to implement them to improve inter-Korean relations and stabilize the situation on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that there is no ground for the U.S. troops to stay in South Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. sincerely wishes a solution to the issue of disarmament on the Korean peninsula, it should pull its troops out of South Korea, first of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. forces' pullback from South Korea would be definitely followed by the process of disarmament between the north and the south. The issue of the DPRK-U.S. relations and all other issues depend on the U.S. troops' pullout from South Korea. The U.S. stand on it will be a touchstone showing whether its administration truly wishes disarmament on the Korean peninsula and an end to the DPRK-U.S. confrontation or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will do what we should do while closely following the attitude of the Bush administration.    \r\n\r\n"

The meeting discussed immediate measures to pave the way for reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n The meeting raised the issues related to measures to significantly observe the upcoming first anniversary of the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and conduct the June 15-August 15 movement for promoting national reunification as a nationwide movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, made a report. He said that the publication of the declaration was a new historic declaration to relink the severed blood ties of the nation and bring the atmosphere of reconciliation and reunification to this land where the wind of the cold war and confrontation raged in the past.  It was also a solemn declaration of the nation in the new era which demonstrated at home and abroad the dignity and spirit of the nation and its will to achieve independent reunification, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to achievements made in the movement for national reunification over the past one year, he pointed out: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last one year witnessed the ever mounting spirit of national independence to solve the issue of reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation under the banner of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last one year the nation's desire to promote reconciliation and unity between the north and south and achieve reunification grew stronger than ever before and the movement for national reunification was vigorously conducted as a movement involving all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these positive developments and successes in the drive for reunification since the publication of the joint declaration are entirely the precious result of leader Kim Jong Il's energetic efforts and the shining fruition of his exploits made in leading the drive for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration has not been smoothly implemented owing to the moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad. outsiders should not be allowed to impudently say this or that about the joint declaration signed by the heads of the north and south and meddle  in its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should pay heed to the voices of the awakened Koreans in the north and south expressing their pent-up indignation, squarely see the changed situation and reality and ponder over its policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the political parties, organizations and the people from all walks of life in the north and south should defend the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration from challenges at home and abroad and hold its banner higher. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report was followed by speeches of representatives from political parties and organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting adopted a decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was decided to hold a grand symposium for national reunification on Mt. Kumgang with attendance of people from all walks of life in the north, south and abroad on the occasion of the first anniversary of the declaration. It also called for organizing significant functions on a large scale in the north, south and abroad to suit their specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was decided to conduct a vigorous movement for promoting national reunification under the banner of the declaration until August 15, the day of national liberation, following those functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end the meeting decided to form a preparatory committee of the north side for the June 15-August 15 movement for promoting national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the central committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party,  who is chairman of the council for national reconciliation, was  elected chairman of the preparatory committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
