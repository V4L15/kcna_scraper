But it is something which cannot be overlooked that it has put up the card of non-lethal weapon use all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Americans are getting vocal in their opposition to the use of force against the DPRK with their increasing fear and uneasiness of being exposed to the attack by its nuclear forces which have put the whole U.S. territory in their strike range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This troubles the Trump administration and war maniacs of the U.S. military who are pining hope on the use of force, obsessed with megalomania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this backdrop, they raised the issue of non-lethal weapon development to calm down the anti-war sentiments of the public at home and abroad and to justify their scenario for igniting a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just red herring to cover up their bloody imperialist acts of war against humanity and civilization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Nov. 30 the U.S. Department of Defense issued a statement that it would lift the ban on the use of cluster bomb internationally recognized as WMD, asserting it is \"badly needed for maintaining strong military muscle\" and remains a \"safe weapon.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A cluster bomb sends out smaller bombs when it explodes to cause mass destruction. Its use is banned by an international treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said decision betrays the true colors of the U.S. which is touting a \"humanitarian war without victims on the part of the enemy side.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the U.S. talk about \"use of non-lethal weapon\" is just sophism to create public impression that the second Korean war, a global thermonuclear war, will be safe and thus secure a justification for provoking the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., employing all sorts of trickery to provoke a fresh war, is just the wrecker of global peace and security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves once again prove the necessity and justice of the DPRK's measures for bolstering its war deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should heighten their vigilance against the U.S. sinister moves to plunge the world into a crucible of war."
