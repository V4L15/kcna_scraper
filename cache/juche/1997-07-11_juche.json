So, I want to say loudly that he was, indeed, a great man who moved the world with his love and who is immortal in human history for his love.\r\n   So said Dr. Gatot Wilotikto, an Indonesian who works as a researcher at Kim Chaek University of Technology, in an article entitled �heternal memory�h.\r\n   In November 1960,  he came to Korea for study when he was 24 years old.\r\n   President kim il sung took care that he could study at Kim Chaek University of Technology as he desired. When he graduated from the university, the president saw to it that he worked as a researcher at the university.\r\n   Under the paternal love of the president, he was married to a Korean girl and moved to a house.\r\n   In the article, the author wrote:\r\n   The respected President Kim Il Sung is, indeed, my father, great teacher and eternal benefactor.\r\n   I have been able to live a worthwhile life even in an alien land without feelings of loneliness. This is ascribable to the benevolent care of President Kim Il Sung, the great leader of all peoples, who is possessed of noble humanity.\r\n   Only the DPRK, the land of Juche, has taken warm care of my destiny in a responsible way in the world. It is the benevolent bosom of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   His great love continues generation after generation.\r\n   I have been able to live in Korea because I am greatly attracted by the personality and virtues of Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n  The general said that the Workers' Party of Korea will never treat with discrimination foreigners and their family members who live in Korea and that its consistent policy is to look after their life better he sent a 60th birthday table to me, awarded the doctorate of engineering to me and took a medical measure so that all my family members can live in good health.\r\n   Indeed, the general is the supreme incarnation of the intetrnationalist obligation who embraces not only the Korean people but also the progressive people of the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And fuel is useless as fungus is cultured at under 15 degrees centigrade and mushroom grows at 2-9 degrees centigrade.\r\n   Raw materials for production are corncob, rice, wheat and barley straw, dead leaves, assorted trees, excreta of fowls and silkworms, grain water, etc.\r\n   By this method, the yield of mushroom per one square metre is 30.5 kilograms and the rate of actual output per one ton of raw material is 101.6 percent.\r\n   Anbyon Agaric can be picked up 30-45 days after fungi are injected to substrate. The mushroom can be also gathered 3-5 times at intervals of 15 days after the first picking.\r\n   It is delicious and highly nutritious.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il appreciated this mushroom on several occasions and named it \"Anbyon Kungomun Agaric\", expressing his great satisfaction over the new species that helps improve the people's diet. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
