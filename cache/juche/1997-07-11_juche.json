And fuel is useless as fungus is cultured at under 15 degrees centigrade and mushroom grows at 2-9 degrees centigrade.\r\n   Raw materials for production are corncob, rice, wheat and barley straw, dead leaves, assorted trees, excreta of fowls and silkworms, grain water, etc.\r\n   By this method, the yield of mushroom per one square metre is 30.5 kilograms and the rate of actual output per one ton of raw material is 101.6 percent.\r\n   Anbyon Agaric can be picked up 30-45 days after fungi are injected to substrate. The mushroom can be also gathered 3-5 times at intervals of 15 days after the first picking.\r\n   It is delicious and highly nutritious.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il appreciated this mushroom on several occasions and named it \"Anbyon Kungomun Agaric\", expressing his great satisfaction over the new species that helps improve the people's diet. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean people determined to execute traitor\r\nPyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) issued a statement today, criticising the Kim Young Sam regime for having wirepulled Hwang Jang Yop, who defected to south Korea and became an enemy both to the north and south, to call a press conference on July 10 after taking shelter at a secret place of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP).\r\n   The Seoul-based radio voice of National Salvation quoted the statement as saying:\r\n   Mass media had advertised the press conference, changing its date once and again in a bid to attract world public attention. The press conference, however, turned out to be a very poor political burlesque.\r\n   Hwang had been brainwashed and trained in a secret place for more than two months since he was taken to Seoul from abroad. He was, however, far from being trusted. So, only about 30 reporters selected by the ANSP were present at the conference, which was a forced event and a poorly prepared drama.\r\n   The behavior of Hwang, who was tamed in a \"cage\" of the ANSP, at the conference proved that he was a human waste and lunatic as our people already branded him.\r\n   Though he had been a high-ranking official in the north, he mechanically read a script written by the ANSP, even stammered, begged pardons of reporters repeatedly without understanding their questions and replied irrelevently. It was a tragicomedy, indeed.\r\n   Hwang slandered the political system of north Korea, where he had lived for scores of years, calling it a \"dictatorial system.\" Can there be any system more democratic than the north, which enabled Hwang, son of a landlord, to study in a foreign country without feeling any discrimination and promoted him to the post of university President, speaker of Parliament and Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea so that he could enjoy freedom in political activity?\r\n   He had been a class a meritorious subject who praised the north's politics as true democracy more loudly than anyone else.\r\n   He told the press conference that he had never made a lie while in the north. Then, it means that he recognises the political system of the north as a truly democratic system.\r\n   He must be an incurable case of mental derangement as he is not able to distinguish between dictatorship and democracy.\r\n   He sweatily talked about \"war preparations\" in the north for \"invasion of south Korea.\" This is also a sophism of a paranoiac.\r\n   It is known to the world that the United States, which styles itself the only superpower in the world, is threatening the north in concert with western imperialist allies, having deployed more than 1,000 nuclear weapons in south Korea. Hwang himself had never failed to talk about this on every occasion.\r\n   For the north to build up self-defensive military strength in this situation is a patriotic measure to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and preserve peace in the country.\r\n   Our nation naturally pay tribute to this resolute self-defensive policy of the north.\r\n   If this were \"war prepartions\" and \"preparations for invasion of the south,\" what should be said of the acts of south Korea, which begs for permanent U.S. military cccupation, builds up armaments with massive import of sophisticated military hardware and stages war exercises with foreign forces against the north?  Are they for peace's sake?\r\n   The sophism of Hwang, who does not distinguish between war and peace and between aggression and defence, strikes a spark of war that will exterminate the nation.\r\n   At the press conference, he talked as if he were worried about livelihood of workers and farmers in the north. It was too brazenfaced of him as a defector.\r\n   As a matter of course, the lunatic could not behave otherwise.\r\n   If he were truly concerned for the north's people, he would have never defected to the south, taking several million dollars of public money obtained at the cost of their blood and sweat nor had affairs with a young Korean woman overseas when the compatriots in the north were making an \"Arduous March\".\r\n   If he were not insane but truly hoped for politics for the people, he should have not come to the corrupt political system of the south where not only parliamentarians and ministers but also the \"President\" have swindled colossal amounts of money collected from the people.\r\n   If he really had an ounce of human conscience, he would have not fled from the north to an alien land at the age of above 70, leaving his family in the north. And if he had a reasonable sense, he would have not preferred living single at a place of the ANSP rather than leading a happy life with his wife and grandchildren in his house.\r\n   A dotard destroys the good furniture of the house, turns over sumptuous feast and relieves himself inside the house before leaving the house.\r\n   Hwang, who pretents to be concerned for the fellow countrymen, with no sense of ethics and humanness, is obviously a lunatic.\r\n   What he said in the press conference is nothing but the continuation of the anti-north smear campaign manipulated by the ANSP with \"press guidelines\" over the past decades.\r\n   Through his absurd remarks, our people have fully affirmed the ugly colors of Hwang, who has reduced to a mouthpiece of Chongwadae and the ANSP and the sinister intention of the ANSP and the ruling quarters to use such a human dreg for their policies.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime, on the verge of collapse, has no possibility to exist any longer and get out of the crisis.\r\n   Chongwadae and the ANSP, which are seeking a way out in confrontation and war against the north, arranged Hwang's press conference, though belatedly, as such a \"shocking therapy\" as driving inter-Korean relations to the brink of war.\r\n   But the press conference, directed by the ANSP with an improperly selected person, at an undesirable time and with wrong contents, reminds one of a camel going to seek horns, lost his ears.\r\n   The perpetrators of the reckless act challenging the north, which values its dignified political system very must, is another dangerous declaration of an anti-north war in the wake of the Chosun Ilbo newspaper's editorial full of abuses of the north. They will undoubtedly have to pay dearly for it, that is, their ruin.\r\n   The NDFSK is now determined to bury Chongwadae and the ANSP, which are bringing disasters of a fratricidal war upon themselves, through an all-people resistance.\r\n   The overthrow of the Kim Young Sam dictatorial regime and the dissolution of the ANSP are solemn tasks of the nation the fulfilment of which breaks no further delay.\r\n   Any malicious anti-north slanders and war preparations can never save the \"civilian\" dictatorial regime from the catastrophic crisis.\r\n   Chongwadae and the ANSP, which are bringing unprecedented calamities to this land, should make suicide of their own accord before meeting a disgraceful end by an all-people resistance.\r\n   The intolerable punishment by the patriotic-minded people will fall on the traitor Hwang, as well as the ANSP and Chongwadae. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
