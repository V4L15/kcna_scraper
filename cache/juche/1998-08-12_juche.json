He apparently read a script written by the ANSP.\r\n   He defected to South Korea from the north after committing such crimes as larceny and rape. To save himself, he could not but seek safe haven in the ANSP and do what it tells him to do.\r\n   The \"suspected kidnapping case\" was created by the ANSP.\r\n   If Japanese politicians had had a proper judgement, they would have already grasped the truth behind the \"case.\"\r\n   But they, availing themselves of the plots of some right-wingers and South Korean authorities, have connected the cases of those who disappeared in Japan with the DPRK in a far-fetched way and used them in impeding the improvement of DPRK-Japan ties.\r\n   Worse still, some politicians have attempted to make the \"abductions\" by the DPRK a faith accompli and internationalize the \"cases,\" saying that they should be \"carefuly dealt with because they are related to the lives of the abducted.\"\r\n   If politicians fail to clearly see the situation, availing themselves of the plots, they will inevitably mess the state affairs.\r\n   Their talk about the \"suspected kidnapping cases\" invented by the South Korean authorities only brings Japan's tarnished public image into a bold relief. They have nothing to get from it.\r\n   We have already made clear our position concerning the \"suspected kidnapping\" and, requested by Japan, made a sincere operation for searching for ordinary missing persons and informed Japan of the results.\r\n   As for such a crime as \"kidnapping,\" Japan has no face to talk about it.\r\n   During their occupation of Korea, the Japanese imperialists kidnapped and took away a total of more than 6 million young and middle-aged people and slaughtered more than one million people.\r\n   Now the Asian and world people are urging Japan to make an honest apology and compensation for its past crimes. \r\n   Their demand is growing stronger with each passing day.\r\n   If Japanese politicians fail to extricate themselves from the narrow-minded and short-sighted view, they can never evade worldwide criticism.\r\n   They should know clearly that they have nothing to get but shame with \"kidnapping,\" a term hostile to the DPRK.\r\n   They should take a calm and reasonable view of the issues and act with prudence.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

They must make a policy shift to turn the anti-north confrontation policy into pro-north reconciliation policy.\r\n   It is one of the important ways of achieving the great national unity for the whole nation  to make mutual visits, hold contacts, promote dialogue and strengthen solidarity.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
