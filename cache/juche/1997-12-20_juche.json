            "content": "U.S. new nuclear strategy under fire\r\n Pyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- Of late the U.S. directed the spearhead of its nuclear strategy to the small countries who are out of favor with it from big countries, threatening that in case the \"interests\" of its allies are \"violated\" it would make a nuclear attack. In the recently-published new \"guidelines\" the U.S. adopted it as a policy to attack with nuclear weapons the small countries in case they use \"bio-chemical weapons against the U.S.\" papers here today, commenting on this, say the new \"guidelines\" of the U.S. is, in essence, a new nuclear strategy worked out after re-examination of the nuclear strategy of the Cold War.\r\n   This clearly shows that the new nuclear scenario of the U.S. has been worked out against developing countries, particularly those countries which are fighting for independence against imperialism, the news analyst of Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\r\n   After the Cold War the U.S. has had no rivals in nuclear arms race, and big countries with nuclear arms are committed to no-use of nuclear weapons against one another.     The U.S., therefore, should awake from a nuclear dream and seek a nuclear scenario no longer.\r\n   The U.S. outcry over \"attack by the small countries with bio-chemical weapons\" and \"encroachment upon the interests\" of its allies is for nuclear preemptive strike at the countries which are fighting for independence against imperialism.\r\n   No country on earth tries to pose menace to the security of the U.S. or attack it. The U.S. outcry cannot be justified in any case, and it does not stand to reason.\r\n   The projected nuclear attack on the small countries  brings into bolder relief the criminal nature and seriousness of the u.s. \"strong-arm strategy\", \"new world strategy\".\r\n   If the U.S. wants to see peace and advancement of humankind in civilisation, it should stop pursuing the criminal nuclear policy.\r\n   Minju Joson in a commentary says the U.S. focuses the nuclear strategy on the countries which go against the grain with it and the countries which hold high the banner of independence against imperialism, and with nothing can it realise its ridiculous nuclear strategy.     \r\n\r\n"
