            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Construction Sites of Power Station\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il provided field guidance to the construction sites of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station.\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the construction of the power station before a huge map showing its panoramic view, he looked round the construction sites to acquaint himself in detail with the progress made in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the power station, located in a good place, was designed well strictly on the principle of profitability, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that one more structure of eternal value is now under construction in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the dam and other work sites, he was pleased to learn that the young builders have done a huge volume of work in a brief span of time by displaying popular heroism and patriotic devotion. He highly appreciated their feats and extended thanks to all the loyal builders for having worked for the prosperity of the country with sweat running down in beads.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young builders who have always lived and struggled in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu, have worked admirable miracles by giving full play to the revolutionary soldier spirit, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, determined to wind up the vast power construction project by their own efforts despite the severe natural environment in which temperature registered 30-40 degrees below zero and under unfavorable working conditions, he said, repeatedly giving high appreciation of their intense loyalty and ardent patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, a spectacular success that the members of the Paektusan Songun Youth Shock Brigade built many splendid structures in various places on their own efforts to be handed down to posterity with pride by weathering out manifold trials as befitting a vanguard unit in building a great prosperous and powerful nation, he said, adding that this precious fruition is a striking manifestation of the great mental power of the young people in the DPRK educated and brought up under the care of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il, looking at literary and art works created by members of the youth shock brigade, heard a lot of stories about the beautiful traits displayed by young people in the course of the construction of the power station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that every monumental structure of eternal value in the country is associated with the honored sweat and blood shed by young people in the era of Songun, he stressed that the sacred revolutionary cause of the DPRK started by the forerunners is steadfastly carried forward as a large contingent of youth, most vital militant unit, is playing a main role in the defence of the country and the socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for completing the construction of the power station earlier than scheduled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need for the brave builders to devote their youthful wisdom and enthusiasm to qualitatively building the power station as a structure of eternal value and thus creditably perform their sacred duty they assumed before the revolution and the era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the young builders of the power station would complete the construction project earlier than scheduled by displaying matchless dedication and thus demonstrate the heroic spirit of the young people of Songun Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Hi Thaek, chief secretary of the Ryanggang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Secretary Kim Ki Nam, Department Directors Kim Kyong Hui and Jang Song Thaek, First Vice Department Directors Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Je Gang of the WPK Central Committee, Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su, department directors of the NDC."

            "content": "North Demands South Stop Psychological Warfare\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces have become evermore frantic with their anti-north psychological warfare aimed at driving the inter-Korean relations to confrontation and conflict. In this connection the Korean People's Army served them a grave warning on April 10 that it would immediately take relevant measures unless the latter takes steps for halting it and officially notifies it of them. \n\t\t\t\t\t However, the puppet military authorities of south Korea tried to patch up the situation created by the above-said psychological warfare designed to achieve a sinister aim by sending a reply notice little short of a mere excuse and an attempt to evade their responsibility. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe anti-north psychological warfare is getting more pronounced due to such irresponsible attitude on the part of the puppet military authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection the head of the north side delegation to the north-south general-level military talks sent the following notice to the military authorities of the south side on May 16: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despite our side's repeated demands for stopping the above-said psychological warfare, the south side again committed such crime as encouraging and conniving at the operation conducted from May 1 for massively scattering leaflets, transistors and DVDs defiling the ideology and system in the north and one dollar notes with human scum involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south side keeps acting recklessly in wanton violation of the agreement reached upon by both sides, the army of the north, as it had already warned, will take more rigid practical measures than restricting and cutting off the overland passage of south Korean personnel through the zones under the joint control of the north and the south in the eastern and western coastal areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side should bear in mind that it will be wholly to blame for the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the resumed anti-north psychological warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The development in the days to come will be decided by whether the south side implements the inter-Korean agreement or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces should ponder over the warning served by the KPA and pay heed to it."

            "content": "US Rhetoric about Its MD Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The United States describes its moves to establish a missile defence system (MD) as measures for \"protecting\" its own country and its allies from \"enemy\" missile attacks. This is nothing but sophism to hide its aggressive and dangerous nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves of the U.S. are aimed at forming a global network of missile attack and holding an unchallenged military edge in a bid to maintain and consolidate its hegemonic position, invade and dominate other countries with ease and, furthermore, realize its scenario for establishing world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to establish the MD are, in essence, designed to throw a network of powerful missile strike in Eurasia, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ultimate goal of the U.S. to build missile shields of diverse classes around Russia and China in an effort to make missile strikes at them from all sides in \"contingency.\" Precisely for this reason the U.S. adamantly refuses to give up its scenarios for missile shields but is focusing its efforts on rounding them off in the shortest possible time. The U.S. regards those countries which follow independent policies, located at the points of military strategic importance, as primary targets of missile attack. This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is justifying its criminal MD under the pretexts of the fictitious \"missile threats\" from the DPRK and Iran. In a word, the U.S. moves to build the MD is a product of its reactionary strategy for world domination and one of the basic leverages for putting it into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves of the U.S. are sparking off a new arms race in the international arena and seriously threatening peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world peace-loving people should clearly see through the criminal and dangerous nature of its arms build-up and the MD and wage a dynamic struggle to check and foil them and thus defend the sovereignty of their countries and nations and achieve global peace and security."

            "content": "S. Korean Ruling Quarters Accused of \"Cooperating\"\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The south Korean ruling quarters' \"cooperation\" with foreign forces is, in essence, dependence upon them and its objective is inter-Korean confrontation and a war of aggression against the north, observes Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History teaches Koreans that \"cooperation\" with foreign forces only brings permanent division of the nation, confrontation, war and disasters. It is nothing but an anachronistic foolish behavior for the south Korean authorities to get frantic in \"cooperation\" with foreign forces even in the June 15 era of reunification when the idea of \"By our nation itself\" has become a basis of inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative ruling forces act a guide letting foreign forces meddle in the settlement of the issue of the Korean nation and serve as a political foundation for the U.S. imperialists' implementation of the policy of colonial enslavement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are earnestly begging aggressors to provide a \"nuclear umbrella,\" regarding the north's dismantlement of its \"nukes first\" as a precondition for settling the inter-Korean relations. This is a blatant challenge to the efforts for independent reunification as it means solving the issue of national reunification, an internal issue of the nation, with the help of foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group's act of pinning hope on \"cooperation\" with foreign forces, prioritizing them, is nothing but a scenario to achieve \"reunification under the liberal democratic system\". It seeks to realize its wild ambition for confrontation with fellow countrymen through cooperation with foreign aggressor forces. This is an act of treachery, servitude and submission intended to reduce all Koreans to slaves of foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By relying on foreign forces one can neither properly settle any internal issue of the nation nor escape a miserable situation where its destiny is flouted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to the group of traitors' \"cooperation\" with foreign forces that the inter-Korean relations have reached an extreme pitch of tension and the danger of a nuclear war is increasing on the Korean Peninsula as the days go by.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fellow countrymen are vehemently repudiating and denouncing the above-said \"cooperation\" of the puppet regime with foreign forces and have already declared its fiasco. The conservative group will not be able to escape the nation's severe punishment for having frantically pursued \"cooperation\" with foreign forces in a bid to realize its foolish ambition, the article concludes."
