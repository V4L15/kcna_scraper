            "content": "KCNA on U.S. non-compliance with agreed framework \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The construction of light water reactor power plants which the U.S. committed itself to provide to the DPRK under the dprk-u.s. agreed framework is too much delayed  and unlikely to be completed by the target year. despite this serious development, the united states is taking an irresponsible stand and attitude toward the issue.\r\n Cock-and-bull stories about the \"revision\" of the AF and the \"provision of thermal power plants\" are heard from among officials of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take a serious view of this assertion as it is little short of the declaration of the U.S. will to evade its responsibility for the delay in the construction of the LWRs and ditch the commitments the two governments should fulfil under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As known to everybody, the AF was concluded thanks to the courageous decision made by the DPRK to sacrifice its independent nuclear power industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If graphite-moderated reactors with a generating capacity of 50mw (e) and 200 mw(e) each which were about to be commissioned in 1994 had gone into operation and the construction of atomic power plants with an annual generating capacity of hundreds of thousands of kw expected to start in the year 1997 had been commissioned, the DPRK would have certainly created the aggregate generating capacity of 2 million kw by the year 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's freeze of its nuclear power industry under the AF has brought a huge loss of electricity and a lot of economic difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has dragged on the implementation of the AF under this or that pretext though nearly seven years have passed since its adoption and is trying hard to evade its responsibility for the delayed provision of the lwr project and any compensation for the resultant electricity loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one side fails to meet its obligation in inter-state relations, it should compensate the other side for the loss resulting from non-compliance. It is the acknowledged norm and being practiced among the countries and is not subject to any alteration with the change in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The LWR issue is a product of the political deal between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When an attention is paid to the fact that the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is calling for simultaneous actions on both sides with a main emphasis on the DPRK's nuclear freeze in return for the U.S. provision of LWR reactors,  the U.S. may know well what consequences would be entailed by its practices intended to backtrack from its obligations to provide LWRs and make a bargaining over the issue of compensating for the electricity loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not remain a passive onlooker to this loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never evade its responsibility for the provision of LWRs and compensation for the electricity loss. \r\n\r\n"

Over 8 km-long new canal  was built and a pleasure ground covering over 300 hectares made its appearance along the canal.\r\n The land management has steadily progressed in the whole period of socialist construction in the DPRK. \r\n Over the last 55 years many monumental edifices have risen in different parts of the country and the area of cultivated land and  forests has increased several times. land realignment projects were carried out in Kangwon, North Phyongan and South Hwanghae provinces, changing the appearance of vast plains beyond recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tideland reclamation resulted in linking hundreds of islets to the coast and shortening the coast line by thousands of km. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Motorways were constructed between Pyongyang and Kaesong, Pyongyang and Wonsan, Pyongyang and Nampho and Pyongyang and Hyangsan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Timber forests, economic forests, reserve forests and ornamental forests were created on all the mountains which cover over 80 per cent of the country's territory to comprehensively harness forest resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great efforts have been exerted for the improvement of rivers and streams. as a result, such big rivers as Taedong, Amnok, Tuman and Jaeryong rivers and small rivers play a big role in the development of the national economy and the improvement of the standard of people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The West Sea Barrage was built in the lower reaches of the Taedong River and Mirim and Ponghwa barrages stand along the river. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thousands of large power stations including the Anbyon Youth Power Station and the Thaechon Power Station and minor ones were constructed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A total 20,000-km embankments were built and over 12,000 hectares of forests created to protect dykes across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 800 km-long waterways were built. They include waterway from the west sea barrage to Sinchon, Kangryong and Ongjin, waterway from the Thaechon Power Station to Unjon, Jongju and Kwaksan, and waterway from Ryesong River to Yonbaek plain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The completion of the Kaechon-lake Thaesong waterway project would make it possible to supply tens of thousands of jongmi (one jongmi equals 10,000 cubic metres of water) to fields and industrial establishments. thousands of man-made lakes and reservoirs including Unpha, Sohung and Yonphung lakes made their appearance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wind break forests, dikes and other protection facilities were built along the coasts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Land construction is now under way as a mass movement in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
