            "content": "KCNA Blasts Military Adventure of U.S. and South Korean Warmongers \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and south Korean warlike forces are going to stage \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises in south Korea despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK.\r\n The exercises will be staged for 12 days beginning on Aug. 21 allegedly to help \"the U.S. troops and south Korean army get familiar with cooperation procedures in contingency on the Korean Peninsula.\" They will be participated in by more than 8,000 U.S. troops including the overseas-based forces and hundreds of thousands of south Korean servicepersons as well as latest war means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military exercises are another grave military provocation to the DPRK. They are nothing but a very dangerous military adventure driving the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war as they are to take place at a time when the war moves of the U.S. and its allies to stifle the DPRK have reached an extreme phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean military authorities describe the exercises as \"annual ones\" as they used to do so in a bid to cover up their aggressive nature. But what matters are that they have been repeated in a systematic manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is open secret that the joint military exercises that started in the mid-1970s have been staged for the purpose of renewing and rounding off the \"OPLAN 5027,\" a scenario to invade the north, at the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line of counterattack in the \"OPLAN 5027\" went beyond the 38th parallel in 1994 for the first time through such experimental stages as \"Ulji Focus Lens.\" It was revised into one for toppling the regime of the DPRK through all-out invasion in 1998 and renewed into one for mounting a preemptive attack on the nuclear facilities in the DPRK in 2002, bringing its provocative and aggressive nature into bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises were suspended in the 1990s as they were denounced by the world for being a test war against the north. The U.S. has filled up the \"vacancy\" made by the \"Team Spirit\" by staging the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" on a larger scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises will not develop into a war on the Korean Peninsula in view of their aggressive nature and the bellicose true colors of the U.S. rulers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military threat to the DPRK is not a fiction but a reality at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension while hyping up \"threat\" from the DPRK and working hard to kick up a row for international pressure upon it. What remains to be done by it now is to go into action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Ulji Focus Lens\" go to clearly prove that the U.S. attempt to provoke the second Korean war has entered the practical phase of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tense situation on the Korean Peninsula has not yet led to an all-out war because the DPRK has kept the balance of strength by building powerful war deterrent to cope with the U.S. threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is greatly conducive to maintaining stability in Northeast Asia, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was quite right for the army and people of the DPRK to have bolstered the war deterrent for self-defence in every way.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Panmunjom Incident\" Termed Carefully Premeditated Provocation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The \"Panmunjom incident\" that occurred on August 18, 1976, driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war, was a provocation perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists under a carefully pre-arranged plan to all intents and purposes, observe Pyongyang-based papers today in their signed commentaries carried on the occasion.\r\n They cite concrete facts to prove that it was orchestrated by the U.S. in a premeditated and deliberate manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve their sinister political purpose and realize their ambition to invade the DPRK the U.S. imperialists committed such grave crime as triggering off the \"Panmunjom incident\" in a premeditated manner and driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a crisis, Rodong Sinmun notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time they resorted to such a reckless military adventure in a bid to carry out their scenario for invasion of the DPRK by driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a catastrophe and invent a pretext for justifying the presence of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in south Korea at least in case they fail to do so. It was thanks to the powerful military countermeasure and positive efforts of the DPRK to defuse the tension that this alarming incident did not go over to a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The incident clearly proves once again that the U.S. forces present in south Korea are, indeed, chiefly to blame for the escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and a wrecker of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on history, all the incidents that deteriorated the situation on the peninsula were without exception triggered off by the U.S. imperialists. The U.S. was also to blame for the \"Pueblo\" incident and the EC-121 large spy plane incident which drew the world attention. Even in the wake of the \"Panmunjom incident\" the U.S. orchestrated shocking cases, ceaselessly straining the tension on the peninsula. The U.S. has staged ceaseless anti-north war exercises in south Korea by bolstering its aggressor troops and thus pushed the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops are, indeed, the root cause of war and the enemy of peace as they have been engrossed in aggression, war, destruction, plunder, mass killings and other crimes for more than 60 years of their presence in south Korea.    Nobody can predict when and what kind of misfortune the Korean nation will suffer and it can never be free from the disaster of a nuclear war as long as the U.S. troops stay in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The earlier pullback of the U.S. forces, the better.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In an attempt to find a way out of the crisis in a war, they stepped up the provocative acts against the DPRK than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They perpetrated reckless military provocations of over 23,800 in 1974 and 28,150 in 1975 in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line and committed hostile acts of over 400 only in the Panmunjom Joint Security Area from January to July 1976. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of such provocations, they mobilized 14 hooligans at around 10:45 on August 18 to cut a tree standing in the Panmunjom Joint Security Area without any agreement with the other side. When the security personnel of the DPRK demanded stoppage of the rude act, the hooligans pounced upon and made a collective assault on them, wielding lethal tools. As the security personnel took a determined self-defensive step, the enemy dispatched over 30 personnel who had been in readiness. A hand-to-hand fight ensured between both sides, leaving wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the conflict as a pretext, the U.S. imperialists reinforced updated military equipment and armed forces in and around south Korea, threatening that they would take a \"retaliatory step\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pernicious war provocation moves on the part of the U.S. imperialists created a crucial situation in which a war might break out in Korea any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, members of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and Young Red Guards and other people of the DPRK turned out as one and decisively frustrated the enemy's war provocation moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Panmunjom Incident\" showed once again before the world that the U.S. imperialists are the war-maniac and disturber of the world peace. And the Korean people fully demonstrated the invincible might of their single-minded unity and revolutionary stamina.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. should stop its reckless anti-DPRK nuclear racket and withdraw its troops from south Korea as well as all the war means including depleted uranium shells and nuclear weapons if it is interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula even in the least.\r\n This demand is contained in information bulletin No. 922 released by the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Friday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bulletin said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea have stockpiled 2.74 million depleted uranium shells in their military bases in Suwon, Chongju, Osan and other places of south Korea. This quantity is 3.5 times those used by them in the Gulfs War and 7 times those in the possession of the U.S. troops in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with this massive stockpile, the U.S. keeps introducing into south Korea the latest war means tested in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, high-tech weapons suited to the topographical conditions of Korea and various types of nuclear war means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard reality, the U.S. is crying out for the \"dismantlement of nuclear weapons\" on the Korean Peninsula and taking issue with the DPRK over its nuclear deterrent for just self-defence. This is sheer hypocrisy and a mockery of the public opinion at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With neither poor excuse nor far-fetched assertion can the U.S. cover up its true aim to turn south Korea into a nuclear arsenal and start a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-American warlike forces in south Korea had better come to themselves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
