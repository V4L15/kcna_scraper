C., the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performers put on the stage colorful numbers of various genres including choruses \"Nostalgia\" and \"My Country Is Very Good,\" a dialogic poem and drama \"The Guardian of Our Life,\" a duet \"Blue Sky over My Country,\" a short drama \"Precious Wealth,\" a story and song \"We Will Enshrine the Profound Loving Care,\" a poem and chorus \"Let's Advance Faster for Higher Goal\" and a chorus \"You Are Our Mental Mainstay.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In their repertoire they loudly sang of their high pride and honor of working hard as women revolutionaries reliably taking charge of posts of the revolution under the loving care of Kim Jong Il and their worthwhile life replete with optimism and joy. They, at the same time, powerfully demonstrated the fixed faith and will, revolutionary spirit and indomitable stamina of the servicemen's families to devotedly protect the headquarters of the revolution and remain loyal to the sacred cause of Songun alongside their husbands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the performance he waved to the enthusiastically cheering performers and audience. He congratulated the performers on their successful\r\npresentation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed great satisfaction over their splendid performance high in its ideological value and artistry as they gave a unique and truthful representation of their life and feelings in each number. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks which would serve as guidelines in developing popular and mass art activities, noting that brisk performances being given by art groups of servicemen's families at all units play the role of a powerful motive force vigorously arousing our army and people to the struggle to defend socialism because they constitute one more aspect of brilliant revolutionary soldier culture created in the era of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The United States should admit and publicly apologize for approving and orchestrating the bloody crackdown upon the Kwangju resistance fighters\r\nwho rose up to put an end to the military fascist dictatorship and win democracy, independence and reunification and supporting the Chun Doo Hwan\r\nmilitary dictatorial regime 25 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. We demand the U.S. renounce all the war scenarios on the Korean Peninsula, drop its unilateral assertion that the DPRK scrap its nuclear\r\nprogram first before coming out for the six-party talks for achieving peace and improving the relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. We demand the U.S. retract the bellicose remarks that a war might be launched without a prior consultation any moment and immediately come out for the negotiations for denuclearization and disarmament in order to achieve lasting peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth. The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a wanton violation of the Armistice Agreement and a source of war. The U.S. should come out at once for the political negotiations aimed at effectuating the pullout of its forces from south Korea and replacing the AA by a lasting peace agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reconciliation, cooperation and unity are the shortest cut to bringing earlier peace, independence and reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, the joint statement said, calling for abiding by the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, remaining true to the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" a landmark of the country's reunification,  and glorifying the year 2005 as a year of bringing about a turning phase in the movement for the  reunification through national cooperation against the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The deputy chief of the Japan Mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front Wednesday said this in a statement issued on the occasion of the 25th\r\nanniversary of the Kwangju Popular Uprising, according to a news report.\r\n Our anti-U.S. struggle for independence and reunification has entered a higher stage of the actions to drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea through an all-people struggle, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the historic national task whose fulfillment brooks no further delay to put an end to the U.S. domination and interference and build an independent and reunified, new country without GIs, a source of war and all evils. \"Let us not allow the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea to go beyond 60 years!\" This is the general goal of our actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality urgently calls on all the people to turn out in the anti-outsider struggle for independence in order to terminate the U.S. colonial rule and frustrate Japan's wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic people from all walks of life should revive the spirit displayed during the May 18 Kwangju resistance and wage a courageous struggle for independent reunification and thus make this year marking the 60th anniversaries of the country's liberation and the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea a year of their total withdrawal, the statement urged.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The desire of the resistance fighters can be realized only by bringing earlier the reunification of the country through three forms of cooperation: cooperation for national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in an article dedicated to the 25th anniversary of the heroic Kwangju Popular Uprising.   The author of the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kwangju resistants shed blood of patriotism while waging the anti-U.S., anti-fascist struggle with arms in their hands to bring a new society free\r\nfrom outside forces and fascism, but their desire remains unrealized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They, urged by earnest desire for a reunified new land, independent and democratic, shed their blood to put the seal of finality on the anti-popular, anti-national state of affairs, but the reality is still grim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. put down the Kwangju resistance of justice by force of arms in a bid to turn south Korea into its \"quiet backyard\" without resistance. And it\r\nhas maintained its colonial rule over south Korea until now, lording it over there as the dominator, and, furthermore, desperately challenged the reunification cause of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the U.S. is the heinous aggressor and the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, which is seeking its own interests at the\r\ncost of the sacrifice of the Korean nation and, unless an end is put to the U.S. policy of military occupation of south Korea, unthinkable are peace on\r\nthe Korean Peninsula, security of the Korean nation and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progress of the south Korean society, peace of the country and national reunification must be moved up by struggle. With the U.S. imperialist aggressors left alone in this land, it is utterly impossible for the south Korean people to settle the bitter grudges of Kwangju or remove the danger of war from the Korean Peninsula or achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To fight the U.S. is the only way out. This is the bitter lesson drawn from the Kwangju Popular Uprising.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The single-minded unity is a mainstay of the revolution and serves as a powerful weapon for accomplishing the socialist cause.
