            "content": "Anniversary of DPRK-Russia Joint Declaration Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- Russian President V.V. Putin visited the DPRK from July 19 to 20, 2000 at the invitation of leader Kim Jong Il. Putin was the first head of state of Russia to visit the DPRK. The DPRK-Russia Joint Declaration was adopted during the visit.\r\n Pyongyang-based newspapers today dedicate articles to this anniversary. The articles say that the adoption of the joint declaration was an important event as it provided a solid basis for developing in depth the DPRK-Russia relations of friendship and cooperation on a new track as required by the new century. Over the last five years these relations have steadily developed on a new stage under the special care of the top leaders of the two countries, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun recalls that Kim Jong Il visited Russia twice, recording a brilliant page in the history of DPRK-Russia friendship and greatly contributing to the strengthening of the bilateral friendship and peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the DPRK-Russia relations have become closer in various fields on the basis of the joint declarations, the paper notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Russian people are working hard to achieve social stability and national unity and defend the security and interests of the country under the leadership of Putin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Russian leadership set a general goal to build a strong state and is guiding the people to its attainment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia's say and prestige are rising in the international arena. Its efforts to defend global peace and security and establish a sound international relationship have been supported worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people appreciate the Russian government and people's efforts for social development and national security and interests and sincerely hope that everything will go well in Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the Korean people will strive to boost the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation in the spirit of the DPRK-Russia Joint Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Wild Ambition for Military Supremacy Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- Japan has recently announced the \"2005 defence white paper\" in which it cited the so-called \"military threat\" from the DPRK and China and vociferated about the importance of increasing the military muscle to cope with it and escalating the military actions to ensure maritime security.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary observes this move is a revelation of Japan's sinister aim to justify its ambition for emerging a military giant and its moves for reinvasion and thus hold military supremacy in the Asian region under the pretext of coping with the \"military threat\" from the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By adding even \"military threat\" from China to the one from the DPRK, Japan seeks to create impression at home and abroad that its security is exposed to a bigger threat than before and thus legally step up in real earnest its moves for turning itself into a military giant and launching reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists listed the DPRK and China as its principal enemies and are now working hard to seize Korea, to begin with, and, using it as a springboard, invade China to conquer the rest of Asia as they did in the past. \r\n The Japanese reactionaries are sparking off territorial disputes, deliberately insisting that Tok Islet, an inseparable part of the territory of Korea, and Diaoyu islands of China belong to the territory of Japan. This is nothing but a deliberate premeditated move to strain the situation in the region and create an environment favorable for becoming a military giant and realizing its wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries and the U.S. agreed to boost the military alliance and make a common use of the military bases of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" and the U.S. troops. This is part of their military preparations for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are following the moves of the Japanese reactionaries for reinvasion with high vigilance. If the Japanese reactionaries dare encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, the army and people of the DPRK will not miss the opportunity to give vent to the pent-up grudge against the sworn enemy but mete out merciless punishment to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the only way of winning one victory after another and paving the wide avenue for bringing about the greatest national prosperity to conduct a more dynamic all-people march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The essential characteristic feature and might of the general march lie in that the People's Army, invincible revolutionary armed forces, is projected as a main force and the revolutionary soldier spirit and heroic fighting traits created by it serve as a powerful engine and the perfect unity of the army and people in thinking and fighting traits gives strong impetus to the advance of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general march is the most powerful all-people grand march in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For our army and people the general march serves as a sacred struggle in which they share their destiny with their leader to the last and work hard to bring about the prosperity of the country and happiness of all generations to come, true to the cause of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general march is an all-people one to devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and an offensive for protecting the socialist country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Final victory in the present confrontation with the U.S. and success in building a great prosperous powerful nation lie in devotedly defending the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outstanding leadership provided by the headquarters of the revolution is a sure guarantee for the victorious general march. The wise leadership provided by Kim Jong Il over the general march imbues our army and people with immense confidence and optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible military power and single-minded unity are the driving force of the general march. They are the master key to achieving leaping advance of the country and its prosperity despite the enemies' obstinate offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK and destabilize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's army and single-minded unity that have grown strong by dint of the great Songun political mode serve as the most powerful weapon in the general march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the general march is guaranteed by the Korean-style line of economic construction and the tremendous potential of the independent economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ideology is the most powerful weapon for the general march and the Songun revolution advances and emerges victorious thanks to its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the primary task of the general march to consolidate the politico-ideological position of socialism as firm as a rock by conducting the ideological work in a dynamic and unique manner. It is necessary to concentrate efforts on the ideological work for preparing the servicepersons of the People's Army and members of the Party and other working people as genuine Songun revolutionary soldiers who, armed with the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution, have made the Juche idea, the Songun idea, their faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to deepen the ideological education aimed at instilling the faith and optimism about socialism into them in combination with the work for establishing a socialist view on morality and the lifestyle based on collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in the general march, the article stresses that one should believe in one's own strength and self-reliance is the only way to live. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and people should come out as one to thoroughly implement the joint slogans of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the WPK and thus fully demonstrate the might of the Songun unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon everyone to single-mindedly unite around Kim Jong Il and demonstrate to the full the heroic spirit of Songun Korea in the general march. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In May when Abe visited the United States he asserted that the next prime minister, too, should visit the shrine because it is the responsibility and duty of the chief executive to express respects to those who fought for the country.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from the fact that Abe is strongly assertive for Japanese rulers' visit to the shrine, it is clear that he wishes to become the second Tojo and see his name to go down to posterity. That is why he does not hesitate to drive Japan to its second defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sophism about \"universally accepted common sense\" and reckless remarks about \"the fallen fighters\" made by him in a bid to justify the prime minister's visit to the shrine clearly suggest his sinister political intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The ulterior aim of Abe is to provide a justification for visits to the shrine by state leaders by painting as \"fallen fighters\" the war criminals who were sternly punished by history as the enemies of international justice and human conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is covetous of the post of the next prime minister. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what will be the future of Japan in case the power is seized by such political mountebank who does not hesitate to lead the country to self-destruction in quest of \"honor\" good-for-nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military fanatics are bound to go to ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is, however, nothing but a despicable and ridiculous plot to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but maintain high vigilance and draw attention to the fact that the hostile forces are getting frantic in their false propaganda against it at a time when the north-south relations are making positive progress and the resumption of the six-party talks for the solution to the nuclear issue is near at hand.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
