Up to this date it has been called \"East Sea of Korea\" as it was used to be called before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The designation of the \"Sea of Japan\" is nothing but a bogus one as there is no ground to call the waters east of the Korean Peninsula as such in the light of the requirements of the norms for international geographical designation and international usage concerning the designation of seas and the trend of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was in about 670 that Japan appeared in the world by the name of \"Japan.\" This was about 900 years later than the time Koreans called the sea \"East Sea.\" Japanese called the waters east of Honshu of Japan \"Sea of Japan\" more than 1,900 years later than the time the designation of \"East Sea\" appeared in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are persistently insisting on the renaming of the \"East Sea of Korea\" \"Sea of Japan\" in their criminal bid to use it as a springboard and a theatre of their activities from which to launch aggression and plunder of Korea and other countries in Northeast Asia, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation will never allow Japan to rename the above-said sea \"Sea of Japan.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any action to allow the above-said farce of the Japanese reactionaries would amount to encouraging them in their stepped-up moves for overseas expansion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The International Hydrographic Organization which was abused for renaming the East Sea of Korea, the designation of the sea of the inviolable country, \"Sea of Japan\" by the cunning appeasement and deception of the Japanese imperialists in the last century has an unavoidable obligation to correctly settle the issue of the designation of the \"East Sea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organization should fulfill its due responsibility to restore the original designation \"East Sea of Korea,\" the only long-standing geographical designation of the waters off the Korean Peninsula, on the principle of impartiality, though belatedly, urges the article."

En las ocasiones le dijeron que \"no se logra el dialogo Norte de Corea-EE.UU. debido al primero\" y \"en caso de que el Norte de Corea haga la prueba nuclear, pagaria el precio correspondiente al respecto\" y otras cosas similares.\n\t\t\t\t\t  El diario Minju Joson en un comentario individual del dia 17 senala que tales palabras de los lacayos coloniales, que pretenden danar a los connacionales en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras, no tienen ningun valor de discutirlos, pero, hay la necesidad de aclarar la verdad de la situacion porque ellos intentan inducir en error la opinion publica interna y externa desempenando el papel de microfono de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La actual administracion de EE.UU. aboga por el \"cambio\" y la \"diplomacia de cooperacion multilateral\", por una parte y por la otra, sigue practicando la misma politica hostil a la RPDC de la administracion anterior, senala el comentarista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No se ha cambiado en lo minimo la ambicion de EE.UU. de aplastar a la RPDC con las fuerzas detras de la cortina del \"dialogo\". Lo sabe bien la banda de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A pesar de esto, esta banda repite la ilogica de EE.UU. como si fuera un papagayo, lo cual no es que ella falta de la firmeza sino toma la confrontacion fratricida por el modo de existencia. Actua con frenesi para aplastar a toda costa a los connacionales apoyandose en las fuerzas de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque la banda de Lee, esbirro de EE.UU., lanza toda clase de disparates, la RPDC no cambiara su decision ya proclamada para defender la dignidad y la soberania de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Fue y es invariable la posicion de principios de la RPDC de no abandonar la dignidad en las relaciones con EE.UU. y otros paises ni de ponerse de rodillas sino de responder con espada a la espada y con la benevolencia a la benevolencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los que tocan la soberania de la RPDC no evitaran el severo castigo del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea y la banda de Lee tambien pagara el precio caro por sus maquinaciones de confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lee debe darse clara cuenta del respecto y poner fin de inmediato a su papel de lacayo de EE.UU."
