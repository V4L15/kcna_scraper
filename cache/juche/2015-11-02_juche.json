It noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il in his work taught that the collapse of socialism in various countries did not mean the failure of socialism as a science but the bankruptcy of opportunism which rendered socialism degenerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And he clearly indicated the essential advantages of Korean style socialism demonstrating its might as a socialist fortress and specified ways of successfully building socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He declared that man-centred socialism, socialism centred on the popular masses, is sure to triumph for its scientific accuracy and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality shows how nonsensical the \"complete end of socialism\" touted by the imperialists and their mouthpieces is and , at the same time, proves that socialism is a science and truth and it is the inexorable law of history that mankind is heading for socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Socialism is a science and sure to triumph."
