That clearly shows he has steadily improved his art of aviation through his day-to-day intensive flight training.\" He showed such profound love and trust in him as telling the commanding officers accompanying him to highly praise the pilot and convey his salute to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The territorial air of the country should be protected irrespective of weather and time and a modern warfare is conducted under the worst conditions, he said, underscoring the need for the airmen to undergo a lot of trainings under the simulated conditions of an actual war despite the unfavorable situation with high ideological awareness so that they may successfully perform their combat duty under whatever situation and conditions anytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for fully preparing the airmen as members of a death-defying corps in the sky and able combat pilots capable of successfully fighting a modern warfare through intensive flight drills in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Choe Ryong Hae, secretary of the C.C., the WPK, and O Il Jong and Han Kwang Sang, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
