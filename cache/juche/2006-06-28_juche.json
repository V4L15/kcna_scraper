The bulk of it is being spent for the modernization of nukes and the militarization of space.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this Tuesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group is now hell bent on stepping up the modernization of nukes under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\", sparking off a new nuclear arms race and bringing the danger of a thermonuclear war, which is a crime intended to inflict nuclear holocaust upon humankind, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's biggest possessor of nukes and it is not exposed to any nuclear threat. The U.S. moves for the modernization of nukes are aimed to make a preemptive nuclear attack on other countries and materialize its wild ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new nuclear arms race is being triggered by the U.S. in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The amount of world military spending is reaching an astronomical figure and it is on the increase every year. This is mainly ascribable to the U.S. moves for a nuclear war, a space war. The U.S. is the principal criminal of the present nuclear arms race, the very one who harasses world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should give up its wild ambition for nukes, mindful that its nuke modernization and space militarization will be a grave crime of disturbing world peace and security.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Koreans firmly adhere to the principle of independence in the struggle to terminate the division of the country and pave the way for the development of the nation can they protect the rights and interests of the nation and settle the issue of reunification according to the will and requirements of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation was divided by the foreign forces which sought the partition of the Korean Peninsula and domination over it. The movement for national reunification is a struggle to protect national sovereignty from foreign domination and interference and exalt the national dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is a patriotic cause of the Korean nation which can never be accomplished by others. The Koreans should be responsible for national reunification, an issue related to their destiny and a matter related to the national dignity and sovereignty, and play such role. They should settle the issue of reunification by their concerted efforts according to the desire and wishes of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is the intrinsic nature of the cause of national reunification and keeps the nation alive. National reunification and future and prosperity of the nation would be unthinkable without independence. National independence serves as a patriotic banner to be always held aloft by the Koreans engaged in the movement for reunification, desirous of national reunification and the common prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are a basic obstacle to national reunification. The Koreans have not yet achieved reunification despite their strong desire for unity and reunification entirely because of the persistent and vicious moves of the U.S. imperialists to block the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not tolerate even the slightest manifestation of foreign interference in the internal affairs of the nation but categorically reject it and independently settle the issue of national reunification through their negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without a resolute struggle against flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces the Koreans can neither prevent foreign forces from meddling and obstructing the cause of reunification nor develop the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation armed with the spirit of national independence alone can put an end to flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces, an obstacle to reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate efforts can the U.S. and pro-U.S. conservative forces hold in check the dynamic advance of the June 15 era if all Koreans strengthen in every way the driving force for national reunification, guided by the strong spirit of national independence, and switch the movement for national reunification to a struggle for independent reunification through national cooperation, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its ground was built with quadrangular pyramid-shaped stones and the upper part of the gate from the middle built with well-trimmed fan-shaped stones in the form of arch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  There stands a pavilion with hip-saddle roof supported by wooden pillars above the gate. The front of the pavilion is viewed as three compartments (7.05 m) and the flank as one compartment (3.1 m). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It, suited to the topographical conditions of Moran Hill, is a treasure of the nation, which shows the developed castle gate architecture of Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, destroyed by the U.S. indiscriminate bombing in the past Korean war, was restored to the original state in Juche 43 (1954). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The gate is kept and managed as it was under the correct policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on preserving historical and cultural relics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
