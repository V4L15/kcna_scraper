Paektu with the might of music and songs as well as arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Revolutionary music has become an invincible weapon of the Korean revolution along with arms and the Korean army and people are firmly convinced of a rosy future of the country and a final victory of the cause of Juche in the music-based politics of the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The music-based politics of the Party is a powerful weapon which helps strengthen in every way the single-minded unity of the army and people around the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks in which all the army and people follow the leader, singing revolutionary songs, is unbreakable and more powerful than a nuclear weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The music-based politics of the Party is also a powerful means which enables the army and people to valiantly break through any trial and difficulty and create an epoch-making miracle in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what hard and vast task they may face, the Korean army and people will overcome difficulties, more loudly singing revolutionary songs, songs of Songun, and build a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche in this land with their own efforts.\r\n Korean revolutionary songs are songs of everlasting conviction, songs of advance that guarantee victory of the cause of Songun. The U.S. imperialists' war moves to stifle the DPRK with corrupt ideological and cultural poisoning and by force will be impotent before the Korean army and people dynamically advancing, optimistic of future and full of conviction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution will dynamically advance full of vigor as long as there are the invincible music-based politics of the great commander of Songun and the army and people who struggle, loudly singing songs of revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It called upon all the south Korean people to try and ostracize the GNP, the wicked enemy of the nation, with great anti-conservative solidarity.\r\n The statement said that the collusion between the GNP and the ULD is not a mere reunion of \"twin toadstools\" rooted in the \"Yusin\" dictatorship but a political collusion to seize \"power\", a plot to revive fascism, the \"Yusin\" ghost in a bid to drive into the darkness of dictatorship again the south Korean people aspiring after a new politics and a new life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this despicable conspiracy and collusion of traitors, human scums and remnants of history is a dark tentacle of the United States seeking to block the trend of the times in which the Koreans are working together to reunify the country independently after the June 15 joint declaration, the statement pointed out, stressing:\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if a group of such nefarious traitors comes to power again, such medieval rule of darkness as that during the \"Yusin\" dictatorship will be revived in south Korea, the June 15 Joint Declaration, which opened up the era of independent reunification, will be endangered and the nation will sustain the holocaust of a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Should they make concession to outside forces and yield to them, they will lose their country and become colonial slaves. Rodong Sinmun Monday warns this in a signed commentary 130 years after the Japanese imperialists forced the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty to conclude the criminal \"Kanghwa Island Treaty.\" \r\n The aggressive nature of the brigandish Japanese imperialists remains unchanged though 130 years have passed since then, the commentary notes, and goes on:\r\n In connection with the lapse of 130 years since the fabrication of this treaty all the Koreans should harden their determination to take a thousand-fold revenge upon the Japanese reactionaries keen to stage a comeback to Korea in order to force Japan to pay for all the monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and not to allow the nation's disgraceful history to repeat itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unforgettable lesson that the Koreans will meet only misfortune and disasters as long as there remain the sycophantic and treacherous forces who bring foreign forces into their country and curry favor with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party of south Korea are leaving no stone unturned to block the struggle of the south Koreans for independence against outside forces, grumbling that the \"alliance with outside forces is shaking\".

The spirit of attaching importance to the nation, the Korean nation-first spirit is running high wherever Koreans live, making the hurricane of independent reunification rage throughout Korea. This is a stirring reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the movement of the Korean nation for national reunification is by no means a smooth sailing. The situation in Korea still remains close to the brink of war and the inter-Korean relations often find themselves in the mire of frustration and stagnation quite contrary to the unanimous aspiration and wishes of all the Koreans.\r\n The U.S. has never favored inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and reunification, prompted by its intention to keep south Korea under its military occupation for an indefinite period, pursuant to its strategy for dominating Korea.\r\n The facts clearly indicate that a failure to force the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, the cancer-like entity harmful to the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula, to quit south Korea and check and foil the U.S. criminal strategy for dominating Korea would have an irrevocable grave impact on the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, a gain attained through a hard struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on the Koreans to turn out as one in the struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggression troops chiefly responsible for the nation's division to go back to their den from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Should Give up Wild Ambition for Comeback to Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- A hundred and thirty years have passed since Japan forced the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty (1392-1910) to conclude the \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" on February 27 (then lunar February 3).\r\n This was the first gangster-like and aggressive treaty for occupying Korea and subordinating the Korean nation to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time Japan provoked the aggressive warship \"Unyo-maru\" incident for the purpose of fabricating the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After illegally infiltrating into the sea off the Kanghwa Island in September 1875 (lunar August) the horde of pirates of the warship surprised the Chojijin battery on the island and destroyed the batteries on the Jongsan and Yongjong islets. And they set fire to private houses and robbed people of their property. The Korean garrison dealt deserved punishment to the invaders who wantonly violated the sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the Japanese imperialists   threatened the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty with gunboats, clamoring that the Korean side committed hostile acts against Japan and should compensate her for the damage inflicted on the Unyo-maru and thus forced the latter to conclude the 12-point \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" in February 1876. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this treaty as a pretext, Japan penetrated deep into various fields of Korea including politics, the economy and culture and put the whole of Korea under her military occupation, imposing immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean people for more than 40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is natural in the light of the international law or in view of moral sense that Japan, the assaulter, sincerely apologizes and compensates to the Korean people, the victim, for her past criminal acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even today, more than sixty years after her surrender at the Second World War, however, Japan refuses to repent of her crime-woven past, trying to justify the history of aggression against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, Japan, availing herself of the hostile policy of the United States against the DPRK, is committing every wrongdoing against it and is unscrupulously disclosing the wild ambition for territorial expansion, claiming \"dominium over Tok Islet\".\r\n The Japanese militarist forces should be well aware that the Korean people today are never those yesterday. They are well advised to abandon their wild ambition for the reinvasion of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The present one larger than the original one was cast in 1726 after its breakage owing to fire of the pavilion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bell is 3.1 meters high, 1.6 meters in diameter of its mouth and 0.3 meters thick. It weighs 13.513 tons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carved on the bell are images of Buddha, patterns of cloud, words, etc.\r\n Its hook depicts two twisted dragon heads (blue and yellow ones).\r\n The bell, one of the big bells in the period of the Ri Dynasty (1392-1910), has been called \"famous thing of Pyongyang\" for the gracefulness of its shape and beautiful peal ringing far and wide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the 1890s, the bell was stroke to open and close all the gates of the walled city at 4 in the morning and 22 in the evening and to inform the invasion by foreign troops, natural calamities, New Year's Day, auspicious and other events.\r\n The Japanese imperialists who illegally occupied Korea in the early 20th century banned the Korean people from approaching it, to say nothing of striking it, saying that the bell was the symbol of the Korean nation and its sound was permeated with the nation's soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung, who liberated the country in August Juche 34 (1945), saw to it to toll the bell on the eve of the New Year's Day that year to bring greater joy of national resurrection to the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
