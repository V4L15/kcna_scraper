            "content": "Japan Should Honestly Admit Its Crimes and Apologize for Them \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moscow, December 5 (KCNA) -- The 47th issue of the Russian paper Patriot published an article titled \"'Treaty stained with human blood and peppered with lies\" a century since the Japanese imperialists' fabrication of the \"1905 Five-Point Treaty.\"\r\n The article recalled that the Japanese imperialists faked up the treaty in a brigandish manner on November 17, 1905 and announced it, thus using it for putting Korea under their military occupation and turning it into a colony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explaining in detail how they fabricated the treaty, the article recalled that the more than 40 year-long colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists brought unspeakable misfortune and sufferings to the Korean people and turned Korea into a huge prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese guerrilla army commanded by President Kim Il Sung liberated Korea from Japanese militarism in 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. imperialists occupied the southern half of Korea after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. It has thus been under the U.S. colonial rule still today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet apologized and compensated for the crimes committed by it during its colonial rule over Korea though six decades have passed since its defeat in the Second World War. On the contrary, it seeks to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should honestly admit its past crimes and apologize for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan refuses to admit its past crimes, swimming against the trend of the times, it will never escape protest and denunciation from the international community.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

In the wake of the announcement of this decision Chief Cabinet Secretary of Japan Abe insisted that \"north Korea compensate for the financial loss.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The illogical and unreasonable remarks made by Abe clearly prove that Japan is no more than a political waiting maid and diplomatic servant for the U.S.\r\n It is the deeply rooted tendency and bad habit of Japan to blindly toe the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has every right to demand compensation for the losses caused by the stoppage of the LWR construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the 1994 DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) the U.S. was obliged to build two LWRs and provide them to the DPRK by the year 2003 in return for its freeze of nuclear facilities and supply 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil to it on an annual basis till the construction was completed. It also assured the DPRK that it would not threaten the latter with nukes. However, the U.S. had not properly implemented any of its commitments till the deadline for the LWR construction fixed in the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has totally scrapped the AF and stopped the construction, causing huge political and economic losses to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is, however, working hard to shift the responsibility for \"compensation\" on to the DPRK by falsifying truth. This behavior only discloses Japan's short-sighted politics and its true colors as a political waiting maid for the U.S. as it is keen to gain even small profits by serving it. \r\n Japan is not entitled to demand the DPRK compensate for the above-said losses nor is it in a position to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be well advised to clearly understand the issue with reason and stop acting a humiliating political waiting maid for the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an unpardonable treacherous criminal act in the June 15 era of reunification as it is a vicious challenge to the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors of south Korea ignited a war in league with the U.S. imperialists in the 1950s, worked hard to unleash a war against the north while vociferating about \"march north to unify\" with the backing of the U.S. imperialists after the war. They became evermore undisguised in their moves for confrontation with the north during the \"Yusin\" dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP based on pro-U.S. flunkeyism and confrontation with the north are following in the steps of their preceding pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration been published  than the U.S. imperialists openly deterred the Koreans from pooling their efforts for fear that  south Korea might slip out of their hands. The U.S. pressurized south Korea to deal with the issue of inter-Korean relations as intended by it, asserting that south Korea should pursue its policy toward the north with the approval of the U.S. and strictly observe the principles of reciprocity and verification. Meanwhile, the U.S. blustered that it would not rule out even a military attack on the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over \"missile threat\" and \"threat of biological and chemical weapons\" of the DPRK and listing it as part of an \"axis of evil\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces of south Korea are playing an active role as a shock force in the implementation of the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean nation will certainly force the south Korean pro-U.S. conservative forces of south Korea to pay for their criminal acts of opposing the fellow countrymen and obstructing the reunification of the country, insisting on \"cooperation\" with foreign forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ideology serves as a lifeline in carrying out the socialist cause and the politics that regards the ideological work as a cornerstone of revolution is an ever-victorious one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK could emerge victorious in the two revolutionary wars fought against the formidable enemies of imperialism and has won victory after victory at different stages of social revolution without failures and turns and twists. This was possible thanks to the great idea of the leaders and the firm faith and will of the army and people in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is, in essence, a political mode, an organic combination of the politics of putting main emphasis on the idea of the revolutionary army, the idea of attaching importance to the ideology, and the idea of giving priority to military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics helps the popular masses fully display the might of ideology because it is the most popular political mode for arming all of them with correct guidelines in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary ranks are solidly united in thinking and purpose on the basis of the Songun idea. As a result, the servicepersons and people are demonstrating their dignity as the army and people strong in independence and bringing about the  greatest successes in the efforts to attain national prosperity despite any stern ordeals without hesitation, vacillation and pessimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il created the most powerful and ideal political mode in the present era by combining the Juche-oriented theory of ideology with philosophy on the army. This is a great immortal exploit performed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics serves as a revolutionary banner for placing the political and ideological features of the revolutionary ranks on highest level in the era. \r\n The might of the Songun politics represents the might of the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The creation of the revolutionary soldier spirit has put the  ideological and moral traits of the revolutionary ranks on the highest plane.\r\n Kim Jong Il ushered in a new era in which the ideological and moral traits of the whole society are modeled after the ideology and spirit of the revolutionary army. This is an outstanding feat performed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics serves as a powerful treasured sword as it brings about fresh innovation and leap forward in building a great prosperous powerful nation by dint of the political work aimed at gripping the hearts of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of socialism advances by dint of ideology and emerges victorious by dint of faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe army and people of the DPRK will hold fast to the great Songun politics for giving fullest play to the might of ideology as an ever-victorious treasured sword and thus effect steady leap forward in the efforts to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
