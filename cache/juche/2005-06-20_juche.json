This precisely reflects the criminal intention and policy of the Japanese militarists. Nakayama's remarks represent the policy of the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No attempt to distort or cover up history can ever change or write it off.

According to it, a representative of the Democratic Workers' Party and members of civic organizations in charge of the case conducted an investigation into the case. In the course of investigating the case, keeping in touch with the relevant police station, they have found out the fact that a GI on the truck saw that woman before the incident took place and its driver, too, felt something wrong before stopping the truck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is quite different to the statements made by the two GI assailants at the outset of the investigation that they did not see any woman nor their truck hit her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on it, a Minju Joson news analyst today brands the case as a thrice-cursed brutal murder deliberately committed by the GIs present in south Korea.\r\n The news analyst further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case clearly proves once again that the U.S. imperialists are a group of murderers regarding human-killing as their job and pleasure with whom the Korean nation can never live under the same sky. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have kept south Korea under their occupation for more than half a century, inflicting all sorts of misfortune and sufferings upon the south Korean people. Not content with it, they are now seeking to bring a nuclear war disaster to the entire Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that without getting the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea, is it impossible for the south Korean people to be free from misfortune and sufferings and for the Korean nation to avoid such nuclear war disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out as one in the courageous anti-U.S. struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, a group of blood-thirsty man-killers, out of south Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was announced on the same day that the existing 1st Brigade of the 2nd Division has been reorganized as the first heavily armed and mechanized combat brigade of the \"rapid task force\" with \"strategic flexibility\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the U.S. had rapidly stepped up its moves to strengthen the war capability of the 2nd Division, the main force for invasion of the north, in a bid to reorganize its forces in south Korea as a \"rapid task force\" which has high mobility and precision strike capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S announced it would complete the reorganization of the 2nd Division till this summer. It reorganized the 1st brigade under the division  as a \"super brigade\"  two or three times stronger than the strength of  the existing brigade armed with such up-to-date weapons as Striker armored cars and then again established new units, putting spurs on the final completion of reorganization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dangerous U.S. moves for reorganizing the armed forces is a grave provocation aimed to trample upon the desire of Koreans for national reunification which was gaining momentum during the June 15 grand festival for national reunification, and it is a revelation of its wild ambition to unleash a war of aggression, a nuclear war, on the Korean Peninsula at any cost.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
