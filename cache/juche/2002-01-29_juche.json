            "content": "U.S. use of biological and chemical weapons assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today carries a signed commentary 50 years after the U.S. full-scale use of biological and chemical weapons in the northern half of Korea during the Korean War.\r\n The U.S. imperialists began a germ warfare by spreading contagious bacteria including smallpox. From Jan. 28 to march 1952 they dropped germ bombs and a variety of things carrying germs on over 800 occasions over more than 400 places in the northern half of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. use of germ and biological and chemical weapons took many lives of Koreans and seriously polluted the picturesque Korean land and its ecological environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not even admitted its crimes though a half century passed since then.      This is little short of revealing its intention to repeat such crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. units for biological and chemical warfare are armed with about 90 types of chemical bombs and have stockpiled more than 3 million chemical shells. All these facts clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly responsible for the threat of biological and chemical weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to officially admit the war crimes committed by it by use of biological and chemical weapons in Korea, make an apology to the Korean people and dismantle as soon as possible the nuclear weapons, biological and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction stockpiled in South Korea and the U.S. mainland. \r\n\r\n"

It is still staging aggression and war, terrorism and intervention everywhere in the world, wrecking peace and wantonly violating human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by its war in Afghanistan conducted under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" operation. in this war the U.S. has massacred a large number of innocent civilians in cold blood only to come in for criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is sheer hypocrisy and a foolish attempt of the U.S. to pull up the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to put pressure on the DPRK, slandering its system where all human rights are fully ensured. But it is a reckless and futile attempt.    \r\n\r\n"

It decided to build aircraft carriers and introduce a mid-air tanker. Such a decision has nothing to do with the defence of Japan. It is a product of Japan's pugnacious policy of strengthening its position as a military power and dispatching its aggression forces to any part of the world to commit intervention in conflict and use of force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a view to justifying such aggressive overseas military operations Japan is trying to abuse the name of the \"UN.\" It is the ulterior intention of Japan to partake in worldwide disputes under the name of the \"UN Peacekeeping Forces\" to play the role of international gendarme and expand the sphere of domination and markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what desperate efforts Japan is making to go under the signboard of the \"UN Peacekeeping Forces\" it cannot conceal its true colors as an aggressor hell-beat on overseas military expansion.    \r\n\r\n"

And he told his aide to bring the certificate though it might cause a delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the aide came back, the president put the certificate into his inside pocket after carefully examining it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon reaching the voting place, he showed his certificate to officials there and received a voting card to vote. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung looked around the inside of a small railway station in a mountain area at sunset of Feb. 6, Juche 52 (1963) when he was giving on-the-spot guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time, a table showing railway fares vertically written in Chinese characters was hanging on a wall there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met the station-master and told him that the fares on the table should be written in Arabic figures horizontally to make it easy for the passengers to read the table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He left there after promising the master to come there again and see a new table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in the morning of the next day he visited the station again and saw the new table.

He asked officials there what was the special food of the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n None of them could give a correct answer to the questions repeatedly put by him in the course of the on-the-spot guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While visiting factories in the city he met old men who had lived there for years and found out that loach soup was a special food of the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he made sure that a new restaurant was built there to serve only loach soup to the customers.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
