            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Various Units in Manpho City\r\nPyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il  provided field guidance to various units in Manpho City.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his guidance was the Manpho Smeltery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conducted by a leading official of the smeltery, he went round a room for the education in the revolutionary history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seeing historic relics and materials on display, he recollected with deep emotion the glorious course of development covered by the smeltery. He said it has turned into a modern non-ferrous metal producer under the wise guidance of President Kim Il Sung, adding that his undying leadership feats will shine long with the glorious history of the smeltery. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various production processes including the general production control room, he acquainted himself in detail with technological updating and production at the smeltery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching smelters' tapping operation, he was greatly satisfied to see a high level of cultured practices in production and life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching the successfully updated production processes, he highly appreciated the feats performed by the workers of the smeltery and members of the scientists and technicians' shock brigade of Kim Chaek University of Technology. He was greatly pleased to learn that they have completed technological updating of the smelting processes in a short span of time true to the WPK's policy of attaching importance to science and thus drastically increased the non-ferrous metal production and radically changed the appearance of the smeltery as required by the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaking the rounds of the newly built dining hall in the compound, vegetable greenhouse and other supply service facilities, he learned about the supply service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly made a high appreciation of the achievements of the officials, workers and technicians of the smeltery, saying that they have done a lot of work in all aspects including supply service and the creation of a hygienic and cultured environment, to say nothing of production, in a few years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward the tasks to be carried out by the smeltery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Amnokgang Tire Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After looking round a room for the education in the revolutionary history, he dropped in at various places of the factory seething with a great revolutionary surge and acquainted himself with its production and encouraged the workers in their dynamic drive to increase production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching for a long while a variety of quality tires being churned out from each worksite fully furnished with modern equipment, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the workers of the factory replete with patriotic zeal have successfully wound up the project for capacity expansion and kept production going at a high rate by giving full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met again Kim Song Dok and Han Kum Ok, a couple of workers of the finishing shop both of whom he had met at their worksite eleven years back, and highly praised them for such patriotic devotion as having worked with all their wisdom and enthusiasm for the prosperity of the country for decades, remaining intensely loyal to the Party and the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced the tasks to be carried out by the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third leg of his guidance was the Manpho Spinning Mill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself with the production and the supply service at the mill, walking round its production processes, raw material store, workers' hostel and various other places. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mill is not a big local industrial establishment with small manpower but has operated on the principle of profitability by positively introducing new technology, not only bringing not a few benefits to the state but contributing to the people's livelihood, he noted, adding that the experience of the local industrial factories throughout the country including the mill which has profusely paid off clearly proved the validity and great vitality of the  policy of simultaneously developing the central and local industries set forth by the President long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being told about the laudable deed of Ju Pok Sun, manageress of the mill, he had a cordial talk with her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He highly appreciated the feat performed by the manageress, noting that busy as she was as a manageress of the mill, she has taken care of many children as their real parents would do at a difficult time when she was hard pressed for everything and she is, indeed, a woman of fine personality as she is possessed of such communist moral outlook and revolutionary obligation as thinking more of the society and the collective and the Party and the revolution than of herself and devoting her all to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Noting that the Songun era is the great era in which a huge army of the noblest, nicest and purest people in the world is trained, he stressed that invincible is the might of all the servicepersons and people who have embodied the principle of collectivism \"One for all and all for one!\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the workers of the mill to creditably fulfill their duty and thus contribute to the building of a rich and powerful nation and indicated the tasks and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he provided field guidance to the Manpho Restaurant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the exterior and interior of the restaurant built in a magnificent and splendid style and seeing a variety of dishes, he acquainted himself in detail with its operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied to learn that the officials of the city and the employees of the restaurant have not only furnished it with excellent equipment but served citizens with peculiar tasty dishes prepared with locally available foodstuff in the spirit of serving the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more honorable and worthwhile than to serve the people, he said, advancing the tasks to be carried out by the restaurant to manage and operate it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He toured Manpho City to learn about the city management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly pleased to learn that the officials, Party members and other working people in the city have successfully not only built factories but turned the city into a socialist land of bliss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A stirring reality of a great prosperous and powerful nation has begun to unfold in Jagang Province as fresh leaping advances and innovations are being reported day by day and the socialist spirit is running high wherever one goes in the province, he said, stressing that this shining reality serves as a beacon inspiring the Korean people dynamically advancing toward the eminence of a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the people in the province, creators of the Kanggye spirit, would work uninterrupted signal miracles in production and construction and thus play the role of vanguard and shock brigade in the final charge to open the gate to a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK."
