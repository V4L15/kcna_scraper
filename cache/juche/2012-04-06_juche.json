            "content": "NRC Denounces Park Geun Hye for Escalating Confrontation against DPRK\r\nPyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesperson for the National Reconciliation Council (NRC) issued a statement on Friday denouncing the confrontation moves of Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\tWith the approach of the \"National Assembly\" election in south Korea, Park Geun Hye of the \"Saenuri Party\" is more undisguisedly revealing her true colors standing for confrontation against reunification, the statement said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDecrying the DPRK's planned launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3 as a long-range missile test, Park let loose a spate of sophism that the launch would be a \"challenge to the world peace\" and the \"international pressure should be put on it.\" She went the lengths of slandering the dignity of the DPRK, while begging someone to \"stop deportation of human scum to the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShe even tries to defend and put forward human scum in the puppet political arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, she has kicked up coloring offensive against the DPRK, asserting that no one can vouch for anything that may happen if those who deny the \"north's\" involvement in the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking incident are allowed to be members of the \"National Assembly\". She even rejected investing the opposition camp with the \"power\", the camp that has opposed south Korea-U.S. \"Free Trade Agreement\" and the Jeju naval base construction. She also said that those \"left-wing forces siding with the north\" should not be allowed to seize power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conspiratorial racket of confrontation against the compatriots Park Geun Hye has kicked up in collusion with traitor Lee Myung Bak revealed that \"change\" and \"reform\" touted by her were no more than absurd artifice to divert elsewhere the public mindset and opinion and that she is a confrontation maniac little different from traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis proves that Park Geun Hye is a disgusting political prostitute as she used to join hands with the conservative regime and ruling party when the situation turned favorable but coldheartedly turned her back if she found it unfavorable even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fact clearly shows that Park Geun Hye is indeed a political swindler and brazen-faced power-seeker who stoops to any infamy to gratify her political ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear that the north-south relations would never be pulled out of deadlock if such venomous element seizes power as she is keen on reviving the departed soul of erstwhile \"yusin\" dictatorship in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement called on various circles of south Korea to punish the puppet conservative group of traitors in the election, not being deceived by Park Geun Hye and her group."

It appointed vicious confrontation elements to the posts of minister of Unification and president of the south Korean Red Cross, reducing it to a waiting maid of the authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn March of 2010 the regime fabricated \"the Cheonan\" warship case, rendering the situation extremely tense. It announced \"May 24 Step,\" totally scuttling the humanitarian cooperation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts total denial and violation of the north-south declarations and inter-Korean agreements based on them derailed the humanitarian cooperation undertakings which had made brisk headway.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts actions brought the reunion of separated families and relatives, the most urgent of the inter-Korean humanitarian cooperation undertakings, to a total suspension. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group blocked in a high-handed manner the reunion of separated families and relatives which had taken place at Mt. Kumgang resort several times every year since the announcement of June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt also put an end to video reunion of separated families and relatives between the north and the south and their exchange of letters on screen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year alone, more than 4 000 south Korean applicants for reunions in south Korea died, cursing the group of traitors, without having their ardent desire to reunite with their families and relatives in the north realized. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group lured and kidnapped inhabitants of the DPRK and kicked up an anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket, adding to the separated families and relatives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt blocked the above-said cooperation undertakings under the pretexts of diversion to a military purpose and transparency. It also made an overall retrogressive revision of the \"law on exchange and cooperation between the north and the south,\" tightening the legal control over those undertakings so that even a single gram of materials might not go to the north without the permission of the \"Ministry of Unification.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt went the lengths of despicably and viciously disturbing the humanitarian cooperation undertakings related to natural disasters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee declared it as an important policy to pull up the north over its non-existent human rights issue, blustering \"south Korea will say what it should do about the human rights issue of the north.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe appointed an ultra-right conservative element ignorant of elementary conception of human rights as chief of the human right committee, reducing it to a \"government\"-sponsored institution specializing in kicking up human rights racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespite repeated warnings of the DPRK, the puppet group hurled all hues of riff-raffs and anti-DPRK hysteric elements into such campaigns as scattering leaflets slandering it and worthless things by use of balloons into its areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt went the lengths of staging an anti-DPRK human rights racket even in the international arena in a bid to defame the dignity and system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe high treason the group committed when the nation suffered the biggest loss in December last year and the hideous provocations it perpetrated by hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK were the height of its inhumane and unethical acts to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK. These barbaric acts can be committed only by hordes of immoral elements like the Lee group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is something beyond imagination to discuss humanitarianism with such cold-hearted elements and gangsters without equals in the world as the Lee group."

When the north launched satellites in 1998 and 2009, the U.S. imposed sanctions on the north through the UNSC in the wake of similar controversy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north refuted it, saying \"if it can not launch a satellite because it requires ballistic missile technology such as long-range missile, it would mean that it will forever be left with no right to launch satellite\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, satellites were launched from many countries including Japan and Iran and lots of regions unhindered.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north will launch a satellite under the outer space treaty which stipulates that it is the right of all the countries to develop and use space for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the meantime Lee Myung Bak shared the U.S. view that the north should drop the launch plan as it is a provocation violating the UNSC resolution and the U.S.-DPRK agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe even blustered that President Obama and he would adopt durable coordinated defense posture between south Korea and the U.S. and resolutely cope with any threat and provocation from the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt seems that south Korea feels secured backed by the U.S. But it sounds pitiful when it will have to be accepted as its response to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt's sure that the U.S. seeks its own national interests. But doubtful is what south Korea aims to gain by repeating the words of its alliance with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for the February 29 agreement, the north said that \"it clarified in the three rounds of previous DPRK-U.S. high-ranking talks that satellite launch should never be included in the long-range missile launch\". Mentioned in the agreement was the long-range missile, not satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north sent data about the place of the launch, orbit and multistage rocket separation to the International Civil Aviation Organization, the International Maritime Organization, the International Telecommunication Union and other organizations consistent with international regulations and procedures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt also invited foreign experienced experts on space science and technology and journalists to visit the Sohae Satellite Launching Station, the General Satellite Control and Command Centre and other places to observe its launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the February 29 agreement, the north also invited the delegation of the International Atomic Energy Agency for the discussion of the procedures for the confirmation of the moratorium on uranium enrichment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north seems to have developed the technologies capable of putting into orbit working satellite, not only experimental satellites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the south has not yet developed missiles with more than 300 km at range, due to the U.S. restrictions. So the south launched satellites atop Russian missiles more than once only to fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south now plans to lobby Japan, which invaded Korea in the past, to help it launch a satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south has treated Japan with generosity, showing signs of forgiveness, reconciliation and cooperation and letting Japanese Self-Defence Forces take part in south Korea-U.S. joint military drills.  Although the south suffered from decades of the Japanese imperialists' occupation, it formed a friendly relationship with Japan two decades after Korea's liberation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt this moment, the north is busy making preparations for the satellite launch while the south is facing the political situation ahead of the election of \"National Assembly\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Koreans should approach the election with correct understanding of history and cool understanding of the times and with the awareness that alliance is temporary while the nation is eternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe first objective of the divided nation is the country's reunification. The south and the north should hold the initiative in reaching the south-north agreement on establishing federation at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis task is assigned to us. Who would dare try to control our destiny while we insist we can do it ourselves? We have experience of having done such a thing. That was the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration in 2000.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne rare idea comes up to my head over the controversy of satellite or missile. That is \"the south and the north should meet and proclaim the Federal Republic of Corea and put the south artificial satellite into orbit by the north's carrier rocket Unha\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen no country in the world will find fault with it, questioning whether it is a satellite or missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is not a dream. This dream can and must come true."

            "content": "Voice of Russia Snubs Reaction of U.S., Japan and S. Korea to DPRK's Projected Satellite Launch\r\nPyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Voice of Russia issued an article disclosing the desperate efforts of the U.S., Japan and south Korea to realize their sordid ambitions by taking the advantage of the DPRK's projected launch of a satellite for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. was the first to promptly react to the DPRK's plan for satellite launch, the article said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is that the U.S. spy satellites failed to capture DPRK's preparations for the satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSo, Washington was shocked late last year when it heard the news that the DPRK is to launch a satellite shortly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. came back to its senses a few months later and strongly urged the DPRK to cancel the launch, describing it as a ballistic missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis, however, is nothing but an attempt to save its face and wrest the initiative.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's plan for satellite launch will benefit the Obama administration because it will help Obama show Americans once again his determination to fight \"evil\" before the presidential election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. Department of Defense will also benefit from it. The story about \"threat\" from the DPRK would make U.S. Congress provide the U.S. forces with funds needed for their expansion in the Asia-Pacific region despite serious shortage of budget. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. found fault with Russia and China to conceal its belligerence. If Japan's media reports are correct, the U.S. groundlessly urged the DPRK to entrust the launch of its satellite to Russia or China. But the DPRK turned down the U.S. request.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt seems that Japan favors the DPRK's planned satellite launch. Japan can have a pretext for mobilizing Aegis warships and deploying \"Patriot\" interceptor missiles ready for action under the pretext of \"intercepting\" the DPRK missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA destroyer of Japan already left for the East Sea of China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlexei Arbatov, analyst of the Institute of the World Economy and International Relations of the Russian Academy of Sciences, said that Japan tries to \"intercept\" the DPRK missile but it is not its original intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"To intercept such a rocket which is neither a military missile nor a missile targeted against the U.S. and Japan and whose mission is to put satellite into orbit would mean a direct act of war. In other words, this is an act of war that can trigger more serious crisis and armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula,\" he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean military bases were put on an emergency alert, to say nothing of the U.S. military bases there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are frightening the people, saying that the missile debris may fall on their heads. But such hysteria will never help the authorities win public favor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd the DPRK remains unchanged in its stand to launch the satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Conference of the Workers' Party of Korea is to take place in Pyongyang on April 11 amid worldwide attention following the announcement of its plan for satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conference would put up \"Kwangmyongsong\" (meaning lodestar) just as carrier rocket does."
