This is the first factor of the inevitability of the bankruptcy of Bush's one-state hegemony. The key point of Bush's one-state hegemony is that all the countries must be obedient to the United States, or perish. It, in essence, negates the sovereignty of other countries and nations and life of humankind. The U.S. has made the world people its enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's one-state hegemony has stumbled upon the tough rebuff of his allies. This is the second factor of its bankruptcy. The U.S. war against Iraq served as a catalyzer accelerating the breakaway of its allies from it and driving the alliance between the U.S. and Europe to an acute confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strong-arm practices and unilateralism are speeding up the process of isolation and ruin of the \"only superpower.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's aggressive doctrine has become a target of criticism and rebuff even inside the U.S. This is the internal factor of the bankruptcy of Bush's one-state hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. soldiers taken to the war of aggression in Iraq have been disintegrated morally in psychological oppression and agony. The Bush administration is squandering a ridiculous amount of state funds in Iraq. 87 billion U.S. dollars have been marked off in fiscal 2004 for combat spending in Iraq. The budgetary deficit is expected to jump to more than 500 billion U.S. dollars in fiscal 2004 owing to the administration's fabulous military expenditure. This budgetary deficit will impose heavy tax burdens on the shoulders of the American people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush dreaming of \"world's emperor\" reminds the world people of Don Quixote of modern type.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Today the south Korean historians and people are strongly protesting against the U.S. move to build its embassy premises in the site of Toksu Palace, denouncing it as a \"wanton violation of the nation's sovereignty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are hatching a plot to offer the site to the U.S., talking about the \"alliance with the U.S.\" and \"promise.\" They should stop the anti-national criminal act of allowing the U.S. imperialist aggressors to vandalize precious cultural relics of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed expectation that the south Korean historians and people from all walks of life would hold high the banner of our nation-first spirit and turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to firmly protect the national cultural treasures of Koreafrom the vandalism of the aggressors and the sycophantic traitorous forces subservient to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
