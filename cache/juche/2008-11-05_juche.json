What has happened over the past eight months since the emergence of the pro-U.S. conservative Lee Myung Bak regime eloquently proves that the present deterioration of the inter-Korean relations is not attributable to the nuclear issue but to the treacherous confrontational policy of the puppets negating the above-said declarations and their implementations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that there is no change in the Lee group's policy of confrontation with the north and it is becoming more desperate and vicious in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group going reckless, seized with the idea of confrontation with the north, can never go scot-free. The nation will certainly force it to pay for this crime."

This is a mockery of the justice and world conscience and a challenge to them as it was a dangerous attempt to revive militarism in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t What matters here is the political landscape in Japan that encourages the politicians' visits to the shrine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The shrine is known as a shrine managed by a religious organization. Accordingly, it looks like a \"religious organization of civilian nature\". It is the sinister intention of the Japanese ultra-right politicians to convert it into a national cemetery and make the visit to it a state ceremony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t By doing so, they seek to inject the ideas of taking revenge for the defeat of the Japanese imperialists and militarism into the Japanese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Those who have inherited the militarist idea since their birth can never drop it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The moves to revive militarism are beclouding the prospect of Japan and inviting disasters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese politicians had better stop the rash act, pondering over the destructive consequences to be entailed by their moves to revive militarism through the visit to the shrine."
