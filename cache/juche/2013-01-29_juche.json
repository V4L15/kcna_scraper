This is the most important revolutionary task facing the party at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to bring about an epochal turn in building an economic giant and improving the standard of people's living, the party organizations at all levels, party cells in particular, should successfully perform their roles as death-defying corps and scouts for implementing the party's policies and dynamically conduct the organizational and political work to give rise to the hot wind of Kim Jong Il's patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe party cells should galvanize the party members and core masses into action so that a person may rouse ten persons and ten people may motivate a hundred and innovations at a unit may lead to other units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should direct particular efforts to the work with the youth in organizing and mobilizing the masses for the implementation of the party policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should make the flames of the industrial revolution in the new century, the torch for breaking through ultramodern science and technology kindled by Kim Jong Il flare up more furiously in all fields and at all units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the party cells are to creditably perform the heavy missions and duties they assumed before the times and the revolution, it is necessary for the cell secretaries to enhance their responsibilities and roles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un in his speech said the Central Committee of the WPK firmly believed that all the party cell secretaries and party cadres would creditably perform the honorable missions and duties they assumed before the party and the revolution, keenly aware that they were holding the party flag of Juche."

            "content": "EE.UU. causo el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana, comentario de ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 29 de enero (ACNC) -- El 29 de enero de 1958, Estados Unidos declaro oficialmente la introduccion de armas nucleares en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tAun despues de aprobado el Tratado de No Proliferacion, EE.UU. no dejo de introducir armas nucleares en suelo surcoreano convirtiendolo en el arsenal nuclear mas grande del Extremo Oriente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde finales de la decada de 1960, libro incesantemente en el Sur de Corea y su contorno los ejercicios de guerra nuclear de toda indole contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea agravando permanentemente la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa en el periodo de la pasada guerra coreana, trazo el plan de formar en la Peninsula Coreana un corredor de sustancias radiactivas y realizo la maniobra de ataque nuclear contra la RPDC para el mismo fin. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos evidencian que el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana surgio ya hace mas de medio siglo como producto de la politica de guerra nuclear de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. causo el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana e imposibilito su solucion llevando al extremo la situacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC hizo todo lo posible por resolver por via pacifica el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana generado debido a la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAun despues de que adquiriera el disuasivo nuclear con la determinacion de defender la dignidad y seguridad del pais y nacion desde el creciente chantaje nuclear de EE.UU., ella hizo ingentes esfuerzos por la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana tomandola por su politica nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. vino intensificando constantemente el chantaje nuclear y otros actos hostiles a la RPDC despreciando todos los esfuerzos sinceros de esta ultima y utilizando hasta los derechos internacionales como aparatos para justificar su despotismo y arbitrariedades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, fabrico la \"resolucion de sancion no. 2087\" abusando de la facultad de la ONU con el fin de suprimir el derecho independiente de la RPDC al lanzamiento del satelite artificial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio persigue el objetivo de asfixiar a la RPDC en lo economico y neutralizarla en lo militar para facilitar la ocupacion de todo el territorio coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que no cambie la politica nuclear EE.UU., sera imposible la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ahi que sacamos la conclusion final de que la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana no se conseguira antes de que sea desnuclearizado todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de hoy ensena la verdad de que la soberania de la patria y nacion la deben defender solo con fuerzas propias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos militares y civiles coreanos impulsaran la construccion de potencia economica, la conquista del cosmos y el fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear para la defensa nacional y seguridad estatal orientando estas labores al enfrentamiento total para frustrar las maniobras de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera como la RPDC castiga a las fuerzas hostiles y logra el triunfo final."

            "content": "ACNC demanda al Sur de Corea renunciar su politica fratricida\r\nPyongyang, 29 de enero (ACNC) -- La \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea aprobada en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU bajo la instigacion del imperio y sus satelites deviene un grave desafio a la soberania y los derechos legitimos de un Estado soberano y muestra el climax de la politica hostil y de la campana conflictiva de las fuerzas hostiles que no desean el elevado prestigio internacional ni el desarrollo economico con fines pacificos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que la banda de traidores surcoreanos actuo al frente de la aprobacion de la presente \"resolucion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como la RPDC lanzo la unidad no.2 del satelite \"Kwangmyongsong-3\", los titeres surcoreanos insistieron en \"tomar las fuertes contramedidas\" y \"ejercer la sancion dura\" acusandolo de \"provocacion\" a la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVisitaron a sus amos norteamericano y japones y otros paises vecinos para mendigarles la aprobacion de la \"resolucion de sancion\" anti--RPDC en la ONU. No satisfechos con esto sometieron atrevidamente a la consideracion de la ONU el \"proyecto de sancion sobre el Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proceder asqueroso de la banda titere, carente de la conciencia propia de la nacion, muestra la psicologia de los atemorizados por la fuerza espiritual del pueblo coreano y el inagotable poderio estatal de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos recurren con frenesi a la campana de \"sancion\" con el fin de mantener el prestigio desgastado del \"poder\" traidor y continuar la fracasada politica conflictiva anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, la banda titere revelo por si misma a todo el mundo su naturaleza de la horda de traidores y maniacos de confrontacion fratricida que mantienen la vida restante con el servilismo a las grandes potencias y la vendepatria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ensena la leccion historica, no podemos resolver nada con los perseguidores de la confrontacion fratricida, sino se agravaran mas las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no deben pensar en las  conversaciones con la RPDC antes de renunciar su politica fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"sancion\" significa la guerra y la declaracion de guerra contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos aclarado que responderemos a la provocacion de los maniacos de enfrentamiento con el inmediato contraataque, y a la guerra de agresion con la justa guerra por la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere debe actuar con prudencia teniendolo presente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos provocadores sufriran solo la venganza implacable."
