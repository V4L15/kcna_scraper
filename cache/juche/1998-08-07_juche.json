            "content": "U.S. should not seek anachronistic policy of strength\r\n Pyongyang, August 7 (KCNA) -- U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen reportedly told the Kyodo News Service on August 4 that it is necessary for some 100,000 U.S. troops to be stationed in East Asia and the  U.S. military presence will be maintained for \"an indefinite period\" even after the \"reunification of the north and the south of Korea.\"\r\n   Such remarks were officially made by him some time ago, too.\r\n   This is an open challenge to the desire of the Korean people and the world's peaceloving people for a durable peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and a provocation against the trend of the time towards disarmament.\r\n   In the international political arena, an end has been put to the long-standing Cold War situation between the east and the west and countries and nations are going towards the relations of trust, peace and detente from hostile and confrontation relations.\r\n   In disregard of such developments, the United States is seeking to keep its 100,000 troops  in East Asia for an indefinite period. It is an extremely serious development which brings clouds of the Cold War to Asia.\r\n   What is more serious is his remarks that the U.S. troops will be kept for an indefinite period in the Korean peninsula even after the reunification of its two sides.\r\n   Today, the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea is a primary requirement for an enduring peace and stability in the region.\r\n   However, the United States shows no sign of change in its attitude toward the withdrawal but is reinforcing its armed forces in South Korea.\r\n   It has been illustrated by the recent deployment on the seas near the Korean peninsula of Carl Vinson and other  nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nuclear-powered attack submarines, various types of warplanes and troops.\r\n   The facts prove that the U.S. is directing the spearhead of its strong-arm strategy to the Korean peninsula and persistently seeking to gain its military domination over Asia with the peninsula as a base.\r\n   Today when the cold war ended the policy of strength is not almighty  but it is an anachronistic daydream.\r\n   The United States should withdraw its forces from South Korea at an early date, squarely seeing the changed international situation and trend of the times.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

The attempt is a revelation of their ulterior intention to erode the ideology and social system of the north, in league with outsiders and, furthermore, extend the U.S. colonial rule over South Korea even to the northern half of Korea.\r\n    The \"sunshine policy\" is nothing but a rigmarole of the traitors, the enemies of reunification.\r\n    The South Korean authorities are colonial stooges and servants of outsiders. For them to pursue the \"sunshine policy\" toward the north is the height of impudence.\r\n    We cannot remain a passive onlooker to the moves of the South Korean rulers who are getting on our nerves with clamouring about \"induction\" and slandering the Korean people's revolutionary confidence in the socialist system of Korean style, the best in the world.\r\n    If the South Korean authorities are interested in national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification, they should immediately stop pursuing the \"sunshine policy\" against the desire and aspirations of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"
