This proves that the puppet regime is the very one behind the cyber-attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is stepping up the anti-DPRK smear campaign even with the involvement of international hackers' group.

This is totally illogical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Korean nation which suffers most from the tension running high on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's socialist construction with its ultimate goal for improving the standard of people's living and building a thriving nation has faced hurdles and Koreans have substantially been exposed to trials and hardships due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. case is quite contrary to this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lately the U.S. massively introduced all kinds of ultra-modern military hardware under the pretext of coping with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. This has brought the U.S. great benefits of drastically beefing military deployment, pursuant to its strategy of directing focus on the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sent strategic nuclear submarines, one of three strategic nuclear attack means, to waters off the Korean Peninsula and flied strategic bombers to the sky above the peninsula for nuclear bombing drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still it is staging nuclear war exercises targeting the DPRK and sending nuclear carrier task force to operational waters off the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. regards the present tensest situation as an opportunity for containing big powers in the Asia-Pacific region and intensifying stifling offensive against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula is a key link in the whole chain of the U.S. strategy for putting the Asia-Pacific under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. stand is that \"basic in the U.S. foreign policy in the 21st century is its policy to Asia, the Korean Peninsula being its main focus\" and that \"unless it has grip on the peninsula, it can not guarantee its absolute interests in Northeast Asia nor can it establish new international order and guarantee its dominating position and role.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the U.S. is making hasty moves. It seeks to take the initiatives in the region and thus realize its world domination strategy in the new century. It cancelled the deployment of fourth-phase missile defence system in Europe under the pretext of coping with possible \"missile attack\" from the DPRK and decided to deploy 14 interceptor missiles in Alaska and the second radar in Japan and push forward redeployment of the missile defence system for building the third tunnel-type interceptor missile base in its mainland. By doing so, it has stepped up the preparations for rendering the strategic armed forces of big powers ineffective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces stationed on Guam, at Darwin Port and in Diego Garcia base have secured a relatively stable strategic stronghold and monitored the development of situation in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has pushed forward the preparations for forming NATO of Asian version by drawing Japan and south Korea deep into its \"security umbrella.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also plans introducing task force from the U.S. mainland to the Korean Peninsula in case of contingency on it with Japan as a departure base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S. used Okinawa Island as major U.S. miliary base. Now it has converted the whole Japanese Islands into a strategic vantage point for a preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To cope with the situation geared for the outbreak of a war on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. navy set six Japanese ports as major ports namely Kagoshima, Nagasaki, Hakata, Shimonoseki, Niigata, Akita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms and equipment in the region have been bulked up to the maximum level, far beyond that in Europe and Mideast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ultimate goal of Foal Eagle joint military exercises kicked off by the U.S. is to test in the peninsula all elements for realizing its strategy for domination of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war atmosphere that has been fanned up and persisted on the peninsula stemmed from the U.S. foreign and political purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world's biggest possessor of nukes U.S. is waging nuclear strike drill against the DPRK. The latter, also a nuclear weapons state, is thus compelled not to remain an onlooker to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can vouch that exchange of fire will not spill over into an actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Will the U.S. be able to have a complacent smile of satisfaction at that time?"

Korean Puppets' Reckless War Strategy\r\n Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- Recently the south Korean warmongers worked out a \"strategy for making havoc of the north Korean army\". It was designed to reduce the military forces of the DPRK to ashes by mounting a preemptive missile strike upon them in \"case of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Saturday in a bylined commentary observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This war strategy brought into bolder relief the true colors of the south Korea puppets seeking to ignite a war by making a preemptive missile strike upon the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In actuality, the south Korean puppet military is scheming to apply the above-said strategy to OPLAN 5015, a new war scenario targeting the DPRK, while making desperate efforts to introduce long-range air-to-surface missiles capable of striking the whole part of the DPRK from the area south of the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t OPLAN 5015 is a combination of OPLAN 5026 the keynote of which is to mount a preemptive nuclear strike upon the DPRK and OPLAN 5027 the main contents of which are to deploy the U.S. \"rapid deterrent forces\" on the Korean Peninsula, destroy the \"strategic targets in the north\", land huge troops on the coast of the DPRK, \"occupy it by force\" and set up a \"ruling machinery of occupation\" in it. Accordingly, OPLAN 5015 is aimed to let the U.S. forces in south Korea and the puppet army deal a \"preemptive strike\" at the DPRK and occupy Pyongyang in a short time without any reinforcement from the U.S. mainland.
