Nearly half of the documents of the preceding regime in the Archives are odds and ends such as data on the operation of dining hall for Chongwadae employees and there is no datum on day's routine of the \"president\", the report said, adding that it is impossible to bring to light the crimes of the Park Geun Hye group even though the \"records of the president\" are made public with the passage of the time.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is another organized crime which was committed on the direct order of traitor Park, a despicable trick to bury into oblivion all crimes she committed during her office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group of traitors has so far left no means untried to cover up their criminal acts, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An evil deed will be discovered.
