This is creating complexities and difficulties in the way of settling the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north can not but feel disgusted at his mean demeanour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A man in authority should be careful about his words and deeds.    \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical facts and the present situation show that but for powerful military deterrent force, war deterrent force, the dignity, sovereignty and security of a sovereign state would not be defended. It is by the powerful military deterrent force of the DPRK that the Korean nation checks a war and defends peace of the country and its security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This deterrent force is an iron hammer to those foreign forces infringing upon the vital right and sovereignty of the Korean nation but an iron shield to prevent the crisis of war with compatriotic love for the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for this powerful deterrent force the living of the Korean nation, the existence of any political parties and organizations and operation of enterprises would have been unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attitude toward the DPRK's Songun policy and deterrent force is a touchstone verifying the standpoint standing for the security of the whole nation and the peace and independent reunification of the country and that of siding with the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should uphold, support and defend with patriotic mind the DPRK's great Songun policy and powerful military deterrent force, the most precious vital energy of the nation, so as to check a pressing danger of a nuclear war and defend the peace of the country.    \r\n\r\n"

That was why the DPRK proposed this time the format of the DPRK-U.S. talks first and multilateral talks next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. adamant insistence on the north's scrapping of \"its nuclear program\" first and the multilateral talks is aimed to increase the international pressure on the DPRK by dubbing it a \"nuclear criminal\" in a bid to force it to disarm itself and conquer it like Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks is the DPRK's unilateral disarmament, not a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, and the U.S. loudmouthed multilateral talks are designed to internationalize its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seeking a way out in refusing the DPRK-U.S. bilateral talks in a bid to evade its responsibility as a party directly concerned with the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and cover up its true colours as the chief criminal who sparked the nuclear crisis.    \r\n\r\n"

During the years, \"Corea\" had been the formal name of the country recognized by the European powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The feudal government of the Ri dynasty (1392-1910) put the name of Corea in official documents concluded with diplomatic envoys of western powers. The government also dispatched its delegations to international functions under the name of Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The maps made in Europe from the latter half of the 16th century name the East Sea of Korea \"Sea of Corea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  After their occupation of the country, however, the Japanese imperialists changed Corea with Korea in a mean way. Since then, the country has been called \"Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now Korean people are campaigning to regain \"Corea\", while fully disclosing the Japanese imperialists' deliberate and intentional change of the country's name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Philologists and historians of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea held a joint symposium in Pyongyang in December Juche 91 (2002) and called for having the English spelling of the country's name corrected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A north-south joint academic symposium was held in Seoul in March to probe the truth behind Japan's distortion of the Korean history. The participants in the symposium said that Japan changed the first letter \"C\" with \"K\", with the result that \"Corea\" disappeared in the early 20th century. They were unanimous in calling for retaking the original name of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The South Korean newspaper Hankuk Ilbo on May 3 said that \"Corea\" should be retaken to eliminate another leftover of Japan's colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This movement is joined by South Korean academic, civic and social organizations, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The South Korean Council of Youth Organizations sponsored a \"youth seminar for eliminating leftovers of Japanese imperialism and regaining Corea\". Speaking at the seminar, Song Hyon Sok, chairman of the Eastern Seoul Youth Society, revealed that the Japanese imperialists issued a royal ordinance in 1910 urging world powers to spell the English name of the country \"Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Prof. So Kyong Il of Hansin University said that the English spelling of the country's name was Corea in the light of historical records and surrounding situation ranging from the 1200s to the 1800s.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities hit for slinging mud at north's system\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities' mud-slinging at the system in the north is a malignant provocation and insult to the north and an act of seriously bedevilling the inter-Korean relations. The committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland says this in a statement on Monday, demanding them apologize for this.\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities were so impudent as to slander the system in the north, asserting that it is an \"old system\" and \"untrustworthy partner\". They went to the lengths of making insolent remarks that there should be a distinction between the system and residents\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their mud-slinging at the political system in the north is a grave violation of the inter-Korean agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present South Korean authorities have no right to violate such historical agreements as the July 4 Joint Statement, the north-south basic agreement early in the 1990s and the June 15 Joint Declaration which commit the two sides to mutually recognizing and respecting the existing two systems and promise their co-existence. They only have the responsibility and duty to implement them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The negation of the system will bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the Cold War era when the two systems were in confrontation and, in the long run, impose only disasters upon the nation. \r\n The South Korean authorities looked frightful when the north side rightly stated that the escalated confrontation would put the inter-Korean relations at the lowest ebb and disasters would be unavoidable. So, they must have known that their mud-slinging at the system in the north would bring about greater disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on the history, South Korea's acts of negating the system in the north and seeking anti-north confrontation have always been condemned by the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north has never tolerated the acts of impairing its system and imposing confrontation on it and this stand will remain unchanged in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should clearly understand that their mud-slinging at the system in the north will never do them good. They should apologize for their misconduct in any form and by any method and vouch that they will not repeat such act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will watch the future attitude of the South Korean authorities for the sake of improved inter-Korean relations and the reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
