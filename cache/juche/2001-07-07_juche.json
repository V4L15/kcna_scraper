On June 28 Asano, governor of Miyagi prefecture, raised a hue and cry about the non-existent \"kidnapping by North Korean agents.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These remarks only betrayed their ignorance and moral vulgarity and, at the same time, revealed Japan's deep-rooted hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The governor of Nagano prefecture seems to have no elementary knowledge and basic understanding of the nature and character of the DPRK's man-centered social system and its people's independent and creative socio-political life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the governor of Miyagi prefecture was so foolish as to describe the non-existent \"kidnapping issue\" as a \"fact.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what should not be overlooked here is that they echoed what Tokyo metropolitan governor Ishihara, fanatical ultranationalist, asserted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a serious note of these hostile remarks made by those Japanese heavyweights. These outcries not only betrayed their political  immaturity but indicated that Japan's socio-political atmosphere is turning to such ultra-right as to accept the ultranationalist and national chauvinistic remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's turn to the ultra-right would lead to the revival of militarization and precipitate its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese politicians, unawakened, continue to incite in society chauvinism and enmity toward its neighbouring country and persistently turn to the right, it will surely make its younger generation deformed to sustain the same defeat as Japan did in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
