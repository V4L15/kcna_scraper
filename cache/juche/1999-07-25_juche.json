            "content": "\"Relief loan\" of  imperialist's financial capital to S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun on Saturday carried a signed article on the issue of the \"relief loan\" of the imperialist's financial capital to South Korea and its catastrophic consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialist's financial capital, above all,  forced a sweeping reform upon the South Korean ruling quarters with \"relief loan\" as a bait, the article said, and went on to say:  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe IMF has forced the South Korean ruling quarters to carry out \"restructuring\". This is aimed at reorganizing the economic structure of South Korea as required by the United States in a bid to reduce it to a mere appendage of U.S. monopoly capital.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"relief loan\" of the imperialist's financial capital has brought catastrophic and serious consequences to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean economy is, above all, far from relieved of stagnation, beset with ever more acute contradictions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The rate of growth of the South Korean economy was minus 7 percent last year. Entering this year, it is still going downhill.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The export of South Korea last year was down 2.2 percent as compared with the previous year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Foreign debts of South Korea reached 176.7 billion dollars as of the end of last January.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A drastic reduction of export, continued instability of stock market and snowballing foreign debts have resulted in wholesale bankruptcy of businesses. More than 15,000 enterprises, large and small, went bankrupt in South Korea till the end of last year, an all-time high in history.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccording to data released by the \"Ministry of Finance and Economy\" of South Korea, foreign capital that had found its way to South Korea from early 1998 right after the enforcement of the IMF mandate to march 1999 bought the rights to management of 600 enterprises of 27 categories in South Korea at low prices.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean people live in the worst destitution in history and the number of the unemployed is on a steady increase in South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"relief loan\" of the imperialist's financial capital to South Korea only resulted in an unprecedented economic collapse under the mandate, ever-widening gap between the rich and the poor, while it brought excessive profits to specified big businesses and foreign monopoly capital. \r\n\r\n"
