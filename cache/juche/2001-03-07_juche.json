            "content": "Songs of women created in DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Many songs in praise of women have been created in the DPRK.\r\n All of those songs popular among people are based on the important role of women in society, the collective and in home life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently created \"song of wife\" fully reflects the feats of wives who always take care of household without any complaint and devotedly work for them with smile on their faces even under the difficult conditions, and the mind of their husbands ready to dedicate their lives to the worthwhile work for the country with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the Korean women, who account for half of the population, have performed great feats in the whole course of the arduous Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A large number of women took arms to liberate the country from the Japanese imperialists' military rule and dedicated their youth to this sacred war for national liberation. In the fatherland liberation war the Korean women encouraged and helped their husbands and sons and daughters to perform heroic feats in the battles for defending the country more precious than their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also fully displayed the revolutionary faith, optimism, the spirit of overcoming difficulties and the spirit of devoted service in the periods of postwar rehabilitation and socialist construction and, especially in recent years of the \"arduous march\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such beautiful appearance of the simple yet resolute Korean women, who always dynamically push one of the two wheels of the revolutionary chariot, is represented in many popular songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are \"song of woman fighter\", \"don't forget woman guerrilla\", \"my mother\", \"love of great mother\", \"request of mother\" and \"fighter's wife\", which sing of the feats women soldiers performed in the bloody revolutionary war and of the mind of women as mothers or wives who take care of their sons and daughters and husbands so that they can vigorously advance along the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such songs as \"do you know who that girl is\", \"girl on steed\", \"I can't say yet\" and \"urban girl comes to get married\" mirror the high zeal for labour and the tender passion of women who are performing feats in socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are also \"love wife\", \"women are flowers\" and many other songs that reflect the social traits of treasuring and putting forward women, simple and sincere.\r\n Those songs of women are resounding through now when the March 8 International Women's Day is at hand.    \r\n\r\n"
