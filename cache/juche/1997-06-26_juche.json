Last year, however, south Korea's trade deficit soared to d23,700 million, fully revealing the impracticability of the \"five-year plan of the new economy\".\r\n   According to even the underestimated data released by the puppet clique, last year's payment deficit climbed to the record of d23,000 million, 2.3 times 1995's.\r\n   This year's payment deficit in foreign trade is likely to reach d30,000 million.\r\n   The invisible payment deficit takes nearly a half of last year's current payment deficit.\r\n   The \"financial and economic board\" announced that south Korea's foreign debts reached d111,000 million as of the end of last year.\r\n   With the rapid increase of foreign debts and financial shortage caused by the great confusion of financial market, businesses have been declared insolvent en masse.\r\n  The Hanbo business group, the 14th largest in south Korea, went bankrupt in January this year and the 26th largest Sammi business group and the 19th Jino business group defaulted on debts. Thirteen of the 30 leading business conglomerates suffered losses last year.\r\n   In the first four months this year 4,756 businesses went insolvent.\r\n   This year's unemployment has increased 1.6 times last year's, reaching the highest on record in ten years.\r\n   As long as the puppets' traitorous, corrupt and reactionary politics continues, the south Korean economy can never get itself out of bankruptcy. \r\n\r\n"
