This shows that Japan has not yet discarded their ambition for reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should no longer do such foolish acts as adding to the crimes they committed, the statement said, urging the Japanese government to stop at once the suppression of Korean residents and refrain from running amuck.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Imperialists' Moves to Invade DPRK under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- It is the will and stand of the Korean people to respond to dialogue with dialogue and to an unjust war with a just war, says Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary.\r\n Some time ago, the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea announced that the U.S., together with south Korea, would stage in the spring of 2007 RSOI on the largest scale ever in history with an attendance of former vice-commanders of the U.S.-south Korea \"combined forces command\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on it, the daily says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such announcement on the war exercises against dialogue partner was made as soon as it was agreed to resume the six-party talks. This is a wanton challenge to dialogue and an undisguised act of destroying peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A dialogue and war exercise can never go together. Though calling for dialogue, the U.S. is frantically accelerating preparations for a Korean war, bringing the situation to the brink of war. The U.S. lip-service to dialogue is no more than a smoke-screen to camouflage its scheme to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the U.S. has intensively deployed means of nuclear attack in the Asia-Pacific region including south Korea and Japan in recent years. At the same time it also mobilized its satellite forces including the abovesaid countries to stage large-scale war exercises one after another against the DPRK, posing serious threat to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The RSOI the U.S. imperialists are going to stage is very dangerous as it is aimed at rounding off military actions of the U.S. and south Korean forces to make a surprise attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to take the dialogue as an opportunity to realize its stick policy and build up an international environment needed for it, not as a field of negotiation for the solution of the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people hope for a negotiated solution to the problem, but will never allow the U.S. to take the dialogue as a chance for sharpening its sword of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are watching the U.S. imperialists' moves for a new war with high vigilance, fully preparing themselves to cope with any possible situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose Bush forces should stop reckless war moves, clearly mindful that to render the situation of the Korean peninsula strained and provoke a second Korean war will be as foolish an act as further endangering the destiny of the U.S. in a dilemma.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
