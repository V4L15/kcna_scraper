Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"case of the People's Revolutionary Party\" is just a tip of iceberg of numerous treacherous and inhumane false cases and killings committed by the fascist dictators of south Korea in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on the history of south Korea, the era of fascist dictatorial regimes that lasted several decades was characterized by the most shameful and barbarous and dark rule in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the Grand National Party of south Korea has refused neither to admit the crimes nor apologize for them, despite the facts that truth about the case faked up by its predecessors and their killings was probed and those who fell victim to it were declared not guilty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"presidential elections\" are slated to take place in south Korea this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All candidates from the GNP are without exception the descendants of the fascist dictators. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as a pikestaff that if they are allowed to come to power it is impossible to prevent the fabrication of more cases similar to the above-mentioned case and the south Korean people are bound to fall victim to fascist dictatorship again though they strongly desire justice and progress. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And then the measured values are analyzed in the mathematical modeling way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It makes it possible to accurately estimate such cold resistance of the given trees as the minimum growth temperature and distributional height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the estimation method by electric resistance needs less manpower and a short period.

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun policy serves as a powerful weapon for defending the nation as it is displaying its great vitality in the struggle to carve out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past, present and future of the Korean nation would be unthinkable without the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy means a treasured sword of justice for achieving the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending the national sovereignty is an issue related to the life and soul of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mission and purpose of the Songun policy to achieve the sovereignty and creditably guarantee the peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without the Songun policy, the Koreans' efforts to achieve the reunification of the country and the sovereignty of the nation would have been proved to be a daydream in face of the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy is a patriotic treasured sword which reliably guarantees the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the reunification of Korea and the sovereignty of the nation are to be achieved, it is necessary to have the peace on the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the U.S. imperialists are now hurling mud at the DPRK over its powerful war deterrent built up thanks to the Songun policy, the south Korean people are benefiting from it, much less suffering from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy is not targeted against fellow countrymen but against the war-like forces at home and abroad disturbing the peace on the peninsula and doing harm to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How to approach the Songun policy is, therefore, is an important touchstone to tell patriotism from treachery.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
