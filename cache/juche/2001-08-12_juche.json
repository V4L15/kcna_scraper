Putin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people are convinced that people's Korea and Russia will contribute to genuine peace and security of asia and the rest of the world and the solidarity and progress of the world people, it stressed.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's moves for reinvasion of Korea under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentary denouncing Japan for invariably pursuing its wild design to reinvade Korea.\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that Japan is keen to round off ahead of schedule the reexamination of the present \"defense program outlines\" supposed to be finished in 2005, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' loudmouthed \"defense program outlines\" are a dangerous document for overseas aggression, not for \"defense.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are calling for the exercise of the \"right of collective self-defense\" under the signboard of \"international contribution.\" and they are underscoring the need to revise the present constitution in a bid to replace the symbolic \"peace constitution\" by a war constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's distortion of textbooks intended to whitewash the history of  the past aggression and the Japanese chief executive's attempt to visit the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" go to prove that they are desperately working to realize their design for  reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today Japan has emerged as a dangerous force of aggression in Asia. The Korean peninsula is the first target of the Japanese reactionaries. They are directing the spearhead of aggression to the peninsula, talking about a \"joint counter-action\" with the united states in case of \"emergency on the Korean peninsula.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having already worked out the scenario for reinvasion of Korea, they frantically staged landing operation and other attack operation exercises while massively deploying the main units of the \"self-defense forces\" in the western part of Japan near the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their hasty moves to reexamine the \"defense program outlines\" are to round off their preparations to stage a comeback to Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

Japan is not allowed to behave as it pleases as far as the issue of the settlement of its past is concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries that enforced a colonial rule and slavery in the past should admit their legal and moral responsibility and make an official apology. And through state compensation and education in correct history they should show their clear commitments and political willingness not to repeat their wrong past.    \r\n\r\n"
