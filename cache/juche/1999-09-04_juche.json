Her proud deed is evoking a big response from mass media and figures from all walks of life of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn August 30 AFP reported that an unexpected scene was presented at this world marathon race saying that Jong Song Ok, athlete of north Korea, was the first to reach the finish line before other world ace marathoners who were expected to be its winner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that she clocked 2 hrs. 26 mins. and 59 secs by breaking her former record, it said she displayed strong will power despite heat and high humidity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn the same day, Japanese Nihonkeizai Shimbun carried a report under the title \"North Korean Jong Song Ok wins, 'she was confident of her victory'\" saying that unknown North Korean players often won victory. No one paid attention to her at the women's marathon just as at the Atlanta Olympic Judo event where Japanese Ryoyo Tamura failed in the final. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, she was so confident as to say that she ran for more than 2 hours among many other players, thinking she could win the gold medal, it said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reporting that 25 year-old DPRK runner Jong Song Ok took the first place leaving a Japanese runner behind, AP quoted her as saying that the source of her strength was that she ran with a yearning for the great leader Kim Jong Il.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The New York Times reported that DPRK athlete Jong Song Ok startled not only her opponents but athletic experts and won the marathon. She cached up an Ethiopian runner who had retained the Olympic marathon title and stood on the height of marathon, it noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nXinhua and the People's Daily and Itar-Tass and Mainichi Shimbun, Tokyo Shimbun, Sankei Shimbun and Kyodo news service and other mass media of several countries of the world are giving wide publicity to the news that Jong Song Ok appeared like a comet in the world athletic domain and became a champion of the women's marathon race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe chairman of the communist party-KPML (R) of Sweden, the president of the International Olympic Committee and political and public figures of different countries sent messages of congratulations to her. \r\n\r\n"

It is quite a legitimate self-defensive measure to ensure peace and ease the tense situation in the Korean peninsula and defend the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK, declares Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Stressing that the DPRK regards its dignity and sovereignty as life and soul, the paper says the measure demonstrated once again the revolutionary will of its people and army not to allow any encroachment upon its dignified sovereignty and inviolable territory and waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The people and army of the DPRK are fully supporting this step taken to defend the legitimate territorial waters under its military control, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea has been defined as a clear and unquestioned one by the special communique of the KPA general staff. The U.S. forces side has no ground whatsoever to take issue with this most fair and aboveboard self-defensive measure of the DPRK as it fully conforms to the requirements of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the international law. It is all the more reasonable as the United States has refused so far to discuss the matters related to fixing the maritime demarcation line and given up its authority and duty under the KAA of its own accord. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We reiterate that there is no other Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea than the line we proclaimed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should stop an impudent argument about this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean rulers again insist on the \"Northern Limit Line\" to make a challenge to the DPRK, they will entirely be blamed for all the consequences arising therefrom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson in an editorial article hails the special communique of the KPA general staff as a decisive step for the firm defence of sovereignty. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' open bidding for purchase of submarines\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities are reportedly making an open bid for the purchase of three up-to-date submarines by the year 2005, for which Australia, Russia, France and other European countries are competing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not content with their moves to purchase missiles from Israel and up-to-date helicopters from the United States while conducting war exercises against the North Korea, the South Korean authorities are channeling a huge amount of money to purchasing the up-to-date submarines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This touches off great apprehensions at home and abroad as it is a very dangerous behaviour of further keying up the politico-military confrontation on the Korean peninsula to lead it to the brink of war and of fanning arms race among various countries of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As everybody knows, not a few countries in the world have taken a switchover in defence policy with decreased military spending and efficient use of military spending and scaled down the defence budget including fund for purchase of weapons since the end of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the South Korean warhawks are continuing to increase the defence budget. They are planning to allocate nearly 86.670 billion U.S. dollars as a defence budget in the period of the 1998-2002 \"medium-term defence plan\", of which 24.3 billion U.S. dollars are expected to be spent for purchase of weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This eloquently shows that the South Korean authorities are rushing headlong toward arms buildup behind the scene of the so-called \"engagement policy\" in an attempt to militarily stifle the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the Korean peninsula has turned into a biggest-ever  hotbed in the world, in which huge armed forces in the north and the south are confronted with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under such circumstances, even such a trifle confrontation move as taking on the nerve of other side may easily destroy the peace and stability of the peninsula and spark off a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Never-to-be-condoned is the criminal move of the South Korean authorities, who are squandering the funds squeezed from the people, in spite of the severe economic crisis, for arms buildup for a war against the north, obsessed with a wild ambition to have a military edge over the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that some European munitions businesses are joining the arms buildup moves of the South Korean warhawks.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are allegedly hoping for the relaxation of the situation of the Korean peninsula and peace and stability in the region but, in actuality, are offering military equipment to the belligerent South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their offering of new-type military equipment to the South Korean authorities for an egoistic purpose  is nothing but a criminal act which fans their reckless war preparations and aggravates the war like situation on the Korean peninsula and, furthermore, endangers the peace and stability of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If some European countries truly want peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, they should cancel their tender for the supply of submarines ordered by the South Korean warhawks overheated by war fever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should stop purchase of the up-to-date military equipment and the reckless war preparations at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people and the people's army are watching the arms buildup of the South Korean authorities with high vigilance. \r\n\r\n"
