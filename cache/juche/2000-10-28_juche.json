V. Putin recently visited the DPRK at the invitation of chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il. The meeting and talks that took place in Pyongyang in this course marked a landmark event in the history of Russia-Korea friendly relations. Both sides are now working hard to implement the agreements reached at the Russia-DPRK summit and the joint declaration signed by the heads of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russians here are witnessing the Korean people's devoted labour and achievements made by the DPRK government in the work to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries of the world. The Russian people wish the Korean people success in their efforts to build a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia reiterates its support to the north-south joint declaration and welcomes its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n DPRK Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun in his speech said the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries 52 years ago was a historical occasion which paved a broad way for the development of the good neighborly relations between Korea and Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: The friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries are expanding and developing day by day after the publication of the DPRK-Russia joint declaration directly signed by chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il and Russian President Putin, who are supreme heads of the two countries, at the historic meeting and talks in last July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are very pleased to see Korea-Russia relations steadily developing on good terms and believe that the traditional friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries would grow stronger and develop in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Russian people under the leadership of President Putin are making energetic endeavors to achieve social and economic stability and build powerful Russia and multipolar world, opposed to dominationism and highhanded practices in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people sincerely hope that the friendly Russian people will register fresh and greater success in the future thanks to the correct policy of the present leadership. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan accused of its military moves\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- It was reported on October 15 that Japan's \"Self-Defense Forces\" and the U.S. troops have planned to stage in the Iwakuni base in Yamaguchi Prefecture a drill of rescuing GIs in a distress and a drill of evacuating non-combatants as part of the Japan-U.S. joint combined field maneuvers next month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the projected drills, Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that Japan is more hell-bent on the moves to turn it into a military power and prepare for reinvasion backed by the U.S., behind the curtain of \"dialogue\" and \"improvement of relations.\" The reality shows that Japan's war chariot has already been on its track. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what disasters such moves of Japan to realize its ambition to become a military power and launch overseas aggression will bring about, if Japan is allowed to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nations in northeast Asia and countries concerned are taking a constructive stand and attitude out of the desire to achieve peace, but only Japan is going in a different direction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, preoccupied by the ambition for militarist overseas expansion, does not know at all what crimes it is committing against humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is rushing headlong toward a road of war for reinvasion, dreaming a pipe dream. This will only accelerate its own destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan must face up to the trend of the times toward peace and detente and stop such foolish act of going against it at once. \r\n\r\n"

Herein lies a shortcut to achieving the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also important in the principle for great national unity to respect and trust each other, leaving the past of members of the nation unnoticed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an embodiment of our party's all-embracing policy, a benevolent policy, to achieve great national unity on this principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will not dig into the past of even those who committed crimes against the nation in the past, but treat them leniently and join hands with them, if they repent of their wrongs and return to the fold of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il also put forward basic requirements for great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the requirements is for the north and the south to give up a hostile policy towards the other side, transcending difference in ideology and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite possible for the two sides to find common denominators and achieve great national unity on this basis if they give up a hostile policy and make concerted efforts prompted by a sincere desire for unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another basic requirement is to wipe out misunderstanding and distrust between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve great national unity both sides should remove misunderstanding and distrust from the stand of placing the national interests above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north, south and abroad can promote mutual understanding and trust and pool will and efforts for the common aim of the nation and attain great national unity if they exchange visits and have contacts and dialogues and strengthen solidarity. \r\n\r\n"
