This glaringly shows how frantic it has become in its moves to escalate the confrontation with compatriots and conspiratorial operations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The horrifying whirlwind of brutal fascist crackdown kicked off by the group is intended to create a horror-ridden  atmosphere in the south Korean society and put down the struggle of the youth and students standing in the van of the movement for independence, democracy and reunification in a bid to tide over its serious ruling crisis and stay in power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But this will only touch off bitter resentment among the youth and students and other people at the group as it is nothing but death-bed frenzy of those thrown into a dilemma after being forsaken by the public for its bankrupt policy of confrontation with the DPRK and sycophantic, traitorous and unpopular policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the youth and students in the south should join hands with broad strata of people of all social standings and wage more dynamic actions as vanguard in the struggle for making a clean sweep of the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group should halt at once the crackdown on patriotic youth and students and other people."

Korean Chief Executive's Visit to U.S. Humiliating Junket\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, October 22 (KCNA) -- The south Korean chief executive's junket to the U.S. was a humiliating trip as it brought into bolder relief his true colors as a pro-U.S. sycophant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a by-lined commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive, while visiting the U.S., should have blamed it for the GIs' sexual assaults against girl students as their crimes are becoming more rampant than ever before but he put his good face on his American master, keeping mum about the cases, the commentary said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very ridiculous for the chief executive to claim that the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance has developed\", talking about FTA. His recent trip to the U.S. was, to all intents and purposes, a disgraceful and treacherous junket as he put everything including economy and the people's right to existence at its disposal. Accustomed to living in reliance on the U.S., he did not hesitate to talk nonsense before Koreans in the U.S., urging them to \"work hard as Americans\" while defiling the people's just struggle. These reckless remarks proved that he is steeped in pro-Americanism and flunkeyism, bereft of the soul of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his U.S. junket he brought to light his despicable true colors as a nuclear war servant for his master. He challenged the domestic and foreign public call for \"a switchover in his policy towards the north\", hailing with his both hands the U.S. nuclear racket against the DPRK. This is a criminal act to mar the atmosphere of dialogue on the Korean Peninsula and push the situation to the brink of war. He visited even the U.S. Department of Defense to have the \"defence commitment\" confirmed by his American master. This was nothing but a revelation of his scenario for aggression to do harm to fellow countrymen, backed by outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He considered the briefing on the situation on the peninsula for him at the Department of Defense during his recent visit to the U.S. as cordial hospitality accorded to him. But it was the height of shame on him. He does not know yet why chief executives of other countries refrain from visiting the department.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If he was accorded hospitality in the U.S., it was in return for betraying the people's dignity and their interests and serving the purpose of the U.S. chief executive to make the next presidential election favorable for him through the successful conclusion of the FTA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive is sadly mistaken if he calculates he can tide over his ruling crisis with the backing of his master."

This is the tragic reality of south Korea swept by the whirlwind of fascism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such whirlwind of brutal suppression kicked off by the conservative ruling authorities, the one reminiscent of the horrifying period of the Yusin dictatorship, is part of the despicable plots to tide over the serious ruling crisis caused by their treacherous, anti-reunification and unpopular policies and, furthermore, lay a springboard for their stay in power through the \"National Assembly\" election and the \"presidential\" election next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present conservative regime sold off not only political and military interests but even economic sovereignty to the U.S. through servile and tributary diplomacy, the kind of which can hardly be found in the history of international politics. It is staging almost every day exercises for a war of aggression against compatriots in the north in collusion with outside forces, rendering the situation extremely tense and bringing the inter-Korean relations to the worst phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is the south Korean people who are responsible for paving the way for achieving independence and reunification, democracy and people's welfare, the declaration called upon all the people to get united as one and turn out in the struggle to shatter the conservative ruling forces' suppression of the forces for progressive reforms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also urged the people of various strata to launch a dynamic mass movement to fully probe the truth behind various conspiratorial cases cooked up by the ruling conservative forces, punish the chief culprits of fabrications and seek the release of the arrested and detained pro-reunification patriotic figures."
