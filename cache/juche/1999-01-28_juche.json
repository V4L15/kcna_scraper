            "content": "No change in DPRK's position at underground facility negotiations \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the recent DPRK-U.S. underground facility negotiations and \"four-way talks\" in Geneva.\r\n   He said:   The fourth round of \"four-way talks\" took place in Geneva from January 18 to 22 and the third round of underground facility negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. was held around the talks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent negotiations focussed on a question of clearing up \"suspicion of underground nuclear facility\" through one visit to the suspected site in Kumchang-ri, as an exception, and the U.S. compensation for it.\r\n   The U.S. side has not implemented its obligations concerning the delivery of heavy oil and the construction of Light-Water Reactors (LWR), linking the question of clearing up the \"suspicion\" with the framework agreement in a far-fetched manner. We warned the U.S. side of grave consequences to be entailed by the U.S. misbehaviour.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the recent negotiations the U.S. side admitted that the \"suspicion of underground nuclear facility\" is one thing and the framework agreement is quite another and affirmed that it will accelerate the delivery of heavy oil and the construction of LWR. That is a fortunate thing.\r\n   At the same time, the U.S. admitted that the work of clearing up the \"suspicion\" is an exception, and hinted that it affirmatively taking into account the DPRK's demand for compensation. That can be said to be significant progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Clear is the DPRK's position as regards the work of clearing up the \"suspicion.\"\r\n   We will never allow the nation's sovereignty and dignity to be violated even 0.001 percent under the pretext of \"suspicion.\"\r\n   In case the U.S. side has a correct understanding of our position and asks for cooperative settlement of the problem, promising to make a compensation with 300 million U.S. dollars in cash or with  something equivalent to the amount of money, we may consider such a solution as allowing one visit to the site in Kumchang-ri as an exception.\r\n    Our position will remain unchanged at the future negotiations.\r\n   The fourth round of \"four-way talks\" began its activities with the inauguration of two subcommittees.\r\n   An incident of blackmail to and abduction of a diplomat of the DPRK in Berlin, which occurred just before the talks, hindered progress at the talks and made prospects for the future talks gloomy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have enough evidence that the U.S. and South Korea are deeply involved in the recent incident. So, we doubt whether they want to build confidence with us or they seek to escalate tensions and confrontation through such provocation as the incident.\r\n   If the U.S. and South Korea truly want to see the adoption of measures for confidence building at the \"four-way talks,\" they should return our diplomat whom they abducted on the strength of blackmail and should affirm that they will prevent the recurrence of such an incident.\r\n   Along with this, they should meet our just demand for the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea and the signing of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and clear the real obstacles from the way of peace on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We feel regret at making no progress at the recent talks,  with the U.S. and the South Korean side refusing to have discussions on the question of putting a period to the intervention of outsiders, a source of tensions, confrontation and dangerous war on the peninsula.\r\n   We urge the dialogue partners once again to give priority to the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea and the signing of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. if they truly want a lasting peace and reunification on the peninsula.\r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows that it takes no account of the international law and usage and has no respect for the dialogue partner.\r\n   Relations between the two countries can be improved and the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula be smoothly solved according to how both sides try to solve the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula. The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework requires simultaneous actions of the both sides.\r\n   The U.S. has not only delayed the construction of light water reactors but also has not delivered heavy oil to the DPRK as scheduled. It has not \"eased sanctions\"  but tightened them. On the contrary, nuclear and military threats to the DPRK  have been more intensified.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It proves that  the U.S. is not interested in resolving the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula but tries to suffocate, isolate and stifle the DPRK  economically by means of the agreement.\r\n   It had no intention to implement the agreed framework when it adopted it with the DPRK. It foolishly thought that the DPRK \"might collapse\" before parts of light water reactors are provided to the DPRK.\r\n   Its true intention was to block the development of  the self-supporting nuclear power  industry of the DPRK and weaken its economic and military potentials by wasting time with light water reactors as a bait.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An international convention is not such a thing as may be implemented or not. We have suffered economic losses in reward for sincere implementation of the agreed framework. \r\nUnder this condition the u.s. Should make compensation and reparation for that.\r\n   If the U.S.  wants to break the agreed framework, we will not be confined only to it, but will freely develop the independent nuclear power industry.

This prompted him to a strong desire for the culture of a new species.\r\n   To this end, he strove to acquire a rich stock of knowledge needed in his study, enrolled in a study-while-working higher educational system. In the course of this, he finished two university courses and three post-graduate courses in three universities.\r\n   Of course, it was by no means a royal road= obstacles and difficulties had to be met. But never disappointed at his 40 failures, he finally succeeded in the culture of mushroom of a new species.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The study-while-working system in the DPRK includes factory higher technical schools, university-level factory (farm and fishermen's) colleges, correspondence courses or evening courses of regular universities.

He is now inciting a war, crying for concentrating even inter-Korean exchanges and cooperation on the collapse of the north.\r\n   He went so far as to say that the north should be induced to reform and opening through the medium of organised promotion of \"sunshine policy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive of South Korea has engaged himself in putting into practice \"a sunshine theory\" which he claimed is the mainstay of the policy towards the north, but in vain. As a consequence, he replaced the theory with what he calls \"magnanimity.\"\r\n   Hwang, however, acts as if he were an architect of the fiction of the \"opening of the north,\" urging \"Chongwadae\" to make \"organised promotion of the sunshine policy.\"\r\n   As to \"food aid to the north,\" he said that if it is sent to the north as military supplies, the plunder by the army will decrease.\r\n   Indeed, malicious is Hwang who describes even supply of food to the army of the fellow countrymen as plunder and calls for mixing poison into it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a palpable truth that remarks from a renegade do not stand to reason.\r\n   Ridiculous remarks are being made by Hwang, who is prolonging his remaining days in reliance upon the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", in a bid to pay for his food.\r\n   The purpose of Hwang's \"lecture\" given to businessmen is to throw a wet blanket over the desire of businessmen for inter-Korean cooperation and exchange, which is growing stronger with the recent north visit of the Hyun Dai business group. It is also to block the sympathies of a growing number of people for the north.\r\n   \"Chongwadae\" which is taking a mole like Hwang under its wings will certainly fall down and the self-styled \"Government for the People\" will collapse of its own accord.\r\n   It is necessary to leave a mole alone underground. \r\n   \r\n"
