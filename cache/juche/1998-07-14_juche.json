U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen stated that the presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea would be continued even after the reunification of Korea.\r\n   Commenting on his remarks, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   We cannot but take a serious view of the fact that the U.S. military chief repeated his official  insistence on the U.S. troops' permanent occupation of South Korea.\r\n   The planned permanent presence of the U.S.troops in South Korea is very unjustifiable both in view of international law and of the urgent requirements of the present time.\r\n   Why is the United States trying to keep its troops in South Korea for an indefinite period?\r\n   Its strategically design is to stifle the DPRK, the bulwark of socialism, invade Asia with the Korean Peninsula as a springboard, expand the sphere of its domination and thus realise its ambition for world supremacy.\r\n   The U.S.troops in South Korea are pivotal forces for this design.\r\n   They are military means which backs the U.S. Korea and Asia policies with strength. \r\n   They are not a \"guarantor\" of \"regional stability\" but a root cause of instability.\r\n   The United States must discard its anachronistic policy of military occupation and withdraw its troops from South Korea as early as possible. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities denounced for scheming to fabricate new government-controlled tool\r\n  Pyongyang, July 14 (KCNA) -- the secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland published information bulletin No. 766 on July 13 denouncing the South Korean authorities for scheming to set up a government-controlled reactionary organisation called \"all-people council for national reconciliation and cooperation\" in a bid to frustrate the grand reunification festival slated for August 15.\r\n   What they seek in this scheme is to poke their nose into the grand pro-reunification festival under the signboard of a non-governmental organisation for the purpose of frustrating it and, furthermore, completely disorganising and stifling the independent non-governmental reunification movement in South Korea, the information bulletin said, and continued:\r\n   As their attempt to intervene in the festival through \"Minister of National Unification\" Kang In Dok was frustrated, they changed their method and resort to more vicious moves to bring  the festival to a rupture. Worse still, they intend to monopolize dialogue and contact between the north and the south under the  guise of a non-governmental organisation after the method of \"unified channel for dialogue\" employed by the preceding authorities proved ineffective.\r\n   If their moves to set up a new government-controlled council are allowed, the planned grand festival will be frustrated and a new tool \"monopolizing dialogue\" will appear in South Korea. Then, independent non-governmental dialogue and reunification movement will be blocked and the pro-reunification, pro-democracy forces in South Korea will inevitably be disorganised.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must at once stop the anti-reunification moves against the aspirations and desire of the nation, abolish the \"National Security Law\", dissolve the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", release imprisoned pro-reunification patriotic figures and refrain from obstructing the free activities of pro-reunification patriotic forces including the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon). \r\n\r\n  \r\n"

They announced that this was the \"line of no retreat\" or the \"last defense line.\"\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung made a scientific analysis of the balance of forces and the perspective for the war, and put forward a policy of giving no breathing spell to the enemies who were making desperate efforts to arrest the advancement of the people's army, striking successive blows at them, foiling the U.S.aggressors in their plan to maintain the defense line along the River Kum and the Sobaek Range, encircling and annihilating the main force of the enemies in Taejon and in the southeast area of the Sobaek Range and providing favourable conditions for a quick advancement towards the south sea and Taegu.\r\n   The combined units of the people's army crossed the river with the backing of a strong gunfire in the 12 kilometre-Long kongju-thaephyongri section of the frontline, coupled with a  false river-crossing drawing the attention of the enemy, and completely destroyed the defense positions with which the enemies said they could hold out for three years. \r\nThe enemies from different directions were driven into Taejon.\r\n   A combined unit of the people's army the task of which was to move to an area southeast of Taejon, block off the enemy's retreat and cut the route for  reinforcements and thus contribute to the completion of the siege of Taejon met with a persistent resistance of the enemy.\r\n   The president, informed of this, told a people's army unit which had already moved towards the southwest of Taejon to quickly make a detour to the southeast of Taejon to cut off the enemy's retreatment.  True to his instructions, the people's army unit that had been active in  ronsan southwest of Taejon went toward the southeast of Taejon through 40-odd kilometre long mountain range overnight to complete the rencirclement of Taejon.\r\n   The combined units of the people's army launched an all- out offensive to annihilate the enemies in an area as small as about 100 square kilometres.\r\n   Taejon was liberated on July 20.\r\n   In the battle the then commander of the U.S.24th division, dean, was taken prisoner and 24,228 troops were killed or taken captive. More than 150 guns, 49 tanks, some 1,000 military trucks and scores of military freight cars were captured or destroyed.\r\n   The U.S. aggressors' defeat in Taejon was the prelude to their ruin. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, publishing business was promoted considerably in Korea in those days.\r\n   The relics of metal type were unearthed in Kaesong, the capital of Koryo which was the first united state in Korea.\r\n   The oldest record concerning the use of metal type is the preface of the book Kokumsangjongrye (a collection of laws laid down in Koryo, a feudal state, and feudal moral standards) -- which was reprinted around 1234.\r\n   Written in the preface is the fact that the book consisting of 50 volumes was printed in metal types.\r\n   This shows the printing by making use of metal type was conducted widely and on a fairly high level in the early 13th century.\r\n   Koreans continued to develop metal printing type and invented and used lead type in the 15th century. Korean ancestors introduced a lot of inventions into the technical sphere, such as the survey of raw materials, mining, melting and casting so as to cast metal types. In the course of this, the characteristics of the printing engineering of lead which is most suitable for printing type casting material were grasped and the world's first printing type made of lead was invented in 1436.\r\n   This means that Korea was the first in the world to invent and use not only copper but also lead printing types. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
