Any election in the U.S. is a money competition among the rich disregarding the will of the overwhelming majority of the population.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the 2012 presidential elections, Obama, the present chief executive, poured 23.6 million dollars on TV advertisement in less than one month to overpower his rivals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite clear that the will and interests of the working masses accounting for 99 percent of the population can be hardly respected under such money-based election system serving one percent rich persons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. its citizens' freedom of speech, privacy of correspondence and other primary rights are violated by the state power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government has monitored every movement of all citizens in real time with cameras and wiretapping devices and even unmanned drones under the pretext of \"national security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than ten millions of the population are jobless and the number of those in poverty increased to 46.5 millions last year from 39.8 millions in 2008.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The housing price soared 11.5 percent last year, leaving many people homeless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, only 480 billionaires of the country have possessed 2.05 trillion dollars worth of wealth, leading a luxurious and dissipated life.  Last year President Obama spent at least one hundred million dollars on his one-week tour of African countries, evoking criticism from among the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, the U.S. \"GALLUP\" released a polling result that two out of the three surveyed complained of the widened gap between the poor and the rich.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All sorts of crimes rampant in the U.S. pose a serious threat to the people's rights to existence and their inviolable rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t New York City witnessed 1 093 cases of gun-related crimes last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than one hundred thousands of people are affected by gunshots from gangs throughout the U.S. each year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the U.S. administration is allegedly moving to establish the law on gun-related regulations, its attempt has suffered a setback due to obstructions of arms dealers. On the contrary, Illinois and other states have adopted bills on easing arms control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Drug abuse that degrades people mentally and physically has become one of the social problems in the U.S.  Russia's ITAR-TASS reported that the amount of heroin consumption in the U.S. rose 80 percent in recent years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Violent assaults on women are reported one after another in the U.S. Last year a 52-year-old man, Ariel Castro, abducted three women and confined them to his house, inflicting sexual assaults upon them for 10 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S., more than two million women fall victim to family assaults each year and nearly 20 percent of the women suffer from raping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The police, whose mission is to prevent all sorts of social evils, take the lead in committing crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In New York City, there was once a \"cannibal policeman\" who intended to roast 100 abducted women. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is getting more vocal about an \"all-people-equal society\" than any other country, but it is criticized by the international community as a kingdom of racial discrimination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year, the Florida Court gave a verdict of not guilty to a white policeman, Zimmerman, who shot to death an innocent black boy, evoking an array of outcries among the black community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As many as 1 000 ultra-right racist groups are active in the U.S., backed by the government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such poor human rights records can be witnessed in Japan and other Western countries following the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK forces should reflect on their human rights issues and inhumane crimes before styling themselves \"human rights judge\"."
