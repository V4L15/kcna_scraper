            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Exposes Adventurous Nature of Ulji Freedom Guardian\r\nPyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- The Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army (KPA) released a white paper Friday exposing the adventurous nature of the joint military exercises Ulji Freedom Guardian expanded by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper branded the joint military exercises as a direct product of the hideous hostile policy toward the DPRK pursued by the U.S. and its military strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK assumes the most despicable and most ferocious aggressive nature, the white paper said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The main point here is to put the DPRK under their control by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Cold War they invented lots of war scenarios to establish military domination over the whole of Korea and steadily modified and supplemented operational plans of all kinds for their materialization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian which has been staged every year is just an example of the scenarios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Focus Lens joint military exercises which put emphasis on simulation drill on maps were expanded into large-scale war exercises called Ulji Freedom Guardian in 2008 with the U.S. imperialist aggression forces who regard the Korean peninsula as their operational theatre, the puppet forces, all the puppet central and local administrative organs, munitions, civilian enterprises and all human and material resources of south Korea involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After having a confab on offering the puppet forces an \"extended deterrence\" including nuclear war means and diverse conventional armed forces in June, 2009, the U.S. imperialists staged Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises with a focus on raising the operational commanding capabilities of units to be involved in the attack for aggression on the north under new operational plan in August in the same year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2010, the U.S. increased its troops participating in the joint military exercises three times compared with the previous year while trumpeting about \"countermeasure to the north's attack on warship Cheonan\" and brought to the areas around the Korean peninsula huge troops including nuclear carrier attack force and preemptive nuclear attack means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After setting 2015 as \"year of war\" and August when Ulji Freedom Guardian started as \"month of starting the war\", the U.S. went hell-bent on the joint military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian is the largest-ever one simulating an actual war that has been expanded in a phased manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. dispatches tens or hundreds of troops to other countries and regions for military exercises with various missions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian is several hundred times as compared with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t War means involved in Ulji Freedom Guardian also assume extreme adventurous nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the U.S. imperialists kept it as a top secret to mobilize nuclear war lethal weapons in joint military exercises in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today they are openly making public the introduction of nuclear war weapons and their striking power without any hesitation. This proves that their moves for aggression against the DPRK have entered the phase of implementation after going beyond a limit line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Branding Ulji Freedom Guardian as a preemptive nuclear strike exercise that has gone beyond a limit line, the white paper continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the enemies are trumpeting about the theory of preemptive strike premised on \"symptom of use of nuclear weapons\" and \"signs\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of their sinister ambition to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK by their own \"decision\" and \"judgment\" when an opportunity presents itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian is all directed to realizing this scheme for a preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It aims at mounting a surprise preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK once an opportunity is offered as huge nuclear war troops have already been introduced. Herein lie the danger and adventurous nature of Ulji Freedom Guardian.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the trite method of the imperialists to describe war as \"peace\", aggression as \"defense\" and plunder as \"aid\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the face of the flurry of censure and denunciation of the aggressive and adventurous nature of the joint military exercises, the enemies have made profound confusing of the right and wrong with such impudent sophism as \"regular and open exercises\", \"normal exercises whose transparency is guaranteed\" and \"annual defensive drill\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies talk volumes about \"defensive nature\" of the joint military drills but, in actuality, brought riffraffs of nine satellite countries to Ulji Freedom Guardian under the pretext of \"visit\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dancing to the tune of their American master's ballad of \"defence\" the south Korean puppet forces are trying to create fear of \"threat from the north\" among the south Korean inhabitants and incite hostility toward the fellow countrymen in a bid to justify the preemptive nuclear attack drill against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces to realize at any cost their scheme for invading the DPRK can never be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they persistently resort to Ulji Freedom Guardian and other nuclear war exercises against the DPRK, they will face most merciless and miserable end, warned the white paper."

            "content": "Representacion de EPC en Phanmunjom revela peligrosidad de Ulji Freedom Guardian\r\nPyongyang, 2 de septiembre (ACNC) -- La Representacion del Ejercito Popular de Corea en Phanmunjom hizo publica el dia 2 una carta blanca para revelar el caracter aventurero del simulacro conjunto EE.UU.-Sur de Corea Ulji Freedom Guardian que los imperialistas yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos han venido ampliando y fortaleciendo de manera escalonada durante decenios de anos pasados..\n\t\t\t\t\tUlji Freedom Guardian es el producto directo de la brutal politica y la estrategia militar contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, revela la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica norteamericana de hostilidad a la RPDC reviste el caracter mas cruel, mas vil y mas atroz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas principal de ella es ocupar por via militar la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de la guerra fria, EE.UU. trazo muchos guiones de guerra para establecer la esfera del dominio militar sobre toda Corea y, para este fin, vino rectificando y completando incesantemente los planes operacionales de diversas formas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo un eslabon de tales maniobras, despliega cada ano el simulacro conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos cambiaron en el ano 2008 el nombre de Ulji Focus Lens, que se realizaba principalmente como simulacro en el mapa, por el Ulji Freedom Guardian y lo amplifico como ensayo de guerra de gran envergadura en que se incorporan sus tropas que toman la Peninsula Coreana como escenario operacional, el ejercito titere y los recursos humanos y materiales del Sur de Corea incluso los organismos administrativos centrales y locales, los consorcios militares y las empresas civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn junio de 2009, EE.UU. decidio ofrecer a los titeres surcoreanos el \"disuasivo ampliado\" que abarca los pertrechos de guerra nuclear y los armamentos convencionales de diferentes tipos. Y en agosto del mismo ano, desarrollo el simulacro conjunto Ulji Freedom Guardian dando enfoque a elevar la capacidad de mando operacional de las unidades, que se movilizaran en el ataque contra la RPDC, segun el nuevo plan operacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de las \"contramedidas al ataque del Norte contra la corbeta 'Cheonan'\" aumento en 2010 tres veces mas, en comparacion con el ano 2009, el numero de sus efectivos participantes en el simulacro e introdujo en los alrededores de la Peninsula Coreana enormes fuerzas armadas incluso el colectivo de portaaviones nucleares y los medios de ataque preventivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecurrio a los ejercicios belicos conjuntos fijando el 2015 como \"ano de guerra\", y agosto, mes en que se inicia Ulji Freedom Guardian, como \"mes de comienzo de guerra\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUlji Freedom Guardian es el ensayo de guerra real que se amplifica escalonadamente con gran envergadura. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo pasan decenas o cientos de efectivos que participan en los ejercicios militares que EE.UU. libra con distintos rotulos en otros paises y regiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el numero de uniformados norteamericanos que se incorporan en el Ulji Freedom Guardian llega a cientos de veces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos equipos belicos que se movilizan en este simulacro muestran su peligrosidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el pasado, EE.UU. trataba como secreto absoluto los pertrechos de guerra nuclear que se movilizan en los ejercicios militares conjuntos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, hoy dia, los imperialistas norteamericanos dan a la publicidad sin vacilacion alguna la movilizacion de los pertrechos de guerra nuclear y su capacidad, lo cual evidencia que sus tentativas de agresion a la RPDC ya pasaron el limite y entran en la etapa de ejecucion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUlji Freedom Guardian es el ejercicio de golpe preventivo nuclear que paso el limite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, los enemigos preconizan la doctrina de ataque preventivo que tiene como premisa los \"indicios de uso de armas nucleares\" de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto demuestra el malsano intento de asestar el ataque preventivo contra la RPDC segun su propia \"decision\" y \"juicio\" cuando llegue la oportunidad apropiada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUlji Freedom Guardian se enfoca en realizar la artimana de ataque preventivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDescribir la guerra como la \"paz\", la agresion como la \"defensa\", y el saqueo como la \"ayuda\", esto es el metodo rutinario de los imperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAtemorizados ante las criticas y repudios sobre los ejercicios belicos conjuntos de caracter agresivo y aventurero, los enemigos los describen descaradamente como \"entrenamientos regulares y abiertos\", \"normales y trasparentes\" y \"anuales de caracter defensivo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHablan tanto del \"caracter defensivo\" del simulacro conjunto por una parte, y por la otra, introducen bajo el rotulo de \"visita\" a las gentuallas de los 9 paises perseguidores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn adhesion a la sofisteria de \"paz\" de su amo norteamericano, los titeres surcoreanos se desesperan por racionalizar el presente simulacro creando en la poblacion surcoreana el panico por la \"amenaza del Norte\" y la conciencia hostil a la parte connacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon intolerables jamas las maniobras de los imperialistas norteamericanos y los titeres surcoreanos encaminadas a lograr a toda costa la ambicion de agresion a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos siguen recurriendo a los entrenamientos de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC incluso Ulji Freedom Guardian, pagaran el precio mas horrible y tragico."
