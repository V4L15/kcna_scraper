As for such attack, it will be made only by the U.S. and Japan by the use of their special technologies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan uses nuclear, biological and chemical weapons in an attempt to realize its design for overseas aggression, it will, above all, bring irrevocable consequences to Japan itself. \r\n\r\n"

It also allows the police and the SDF to equip themselves with tanks and machine guns and other heavy weapons though their use of weapons during their \"mobilization for public peace\" was limited to light arms in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revision of the agreement, in fact, means one step forward towards Japan's militarization and establishment of a wartime system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's revision of this agreement under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK is an expression of undisguised anti-DPRK hostile policy. This is nothing but a sinister attempt to hide the criminal purpose and dangerous nature of those moves of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should stop at once the anachronistic anti-DPRK hostile moves and the adventurous acts to revive militarism, which will only bring self-destruction to it. \r\n\r\n"

And he saw to it that people from all walks of life who love the country and the nation turned out as one in the building of a democratic, independent and sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung advanced the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--to lay a firm foundation of the national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also laid down the ten-point programme of great national unity to clarify the basic principle and ideological basis to be maintained in achieving the great national unity, and concrete tasks and ways for realizing the unity, the paper emphasizes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the great national unity the great leader Kim Jong Il has persistently pursued the policy of embracing any one who treasures the spirit of the nation and loves the country and the nation, irrespective of differences in thought and system and class and strata. \r\n\r\n"
