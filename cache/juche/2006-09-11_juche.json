This is the essence of their Asian-Pacific strategy.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article slamming the U.S. oceanic strategy for aggression to put the Asia-Pacific under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In their strategy of attaching importance to the Asia-Pacific aimed at realizing their world domination the U.S. imperialists regard Northeast Asia, the Korean Peninsula in particular, as their important strategic stronghold, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to form a front against the anti-imperialist independent countries including the DPRK on the seas linking Japan, south Korea, etc. and deploy naval forces equipped with nukes in a bid to blockade straits, mount preemptive nuclear attacks on them and, furthermore, conduct landing operations against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They intend to use Japan and south Korea bounded on three sides by the sea as important bases for carrying out their oceanic strategy from which to launch aggression against the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spearhead of the oceanic strategy pushed forward by the U.S. imperialists in the Asia-Pacific is directed to the Korean Peninsula at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the main theatre of the global military and political confrontation at present. This is because the U.S. made the DPRK a principal target of the U.S. strategy for world domination, its conception of building a unipolar world. It is a strategic goal of the U.S. to start another Korean war in the 21st century come what may in a bid to seize the peninsula. The Korean Peninsula is the area where the interests of its neighboring big powers are intertwined. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once a war breaks out on the peninsula these countries will not remain passive onlookers to it. In case of a crisis on the peninsula the response of these countries to it will be bound to affect the development. In a word, the second Korean war to be provoked by the U.S. imperialists would mean a new world war. Their oceanic strategy is being pushed forward according to this war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the peninsula and the rest of the Asia-Pacific is getting tenser due to the reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The peace-loving people of Asia and the rest of the world are called upon to see through the sinister aim pursued by their oceanic strategy and wage a positive struggle to frustrate it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was the annals of creation and change in which the DPRK has brought great changes and miracles in the revolution and construction and rushed toward the high peak of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sacred history and traditions of the DPRK which has emerged victorious under the leadership of the President are now being creditably carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is standing up as a fortress of reunification as Kim Jong Il, peerless patriot, provided the June 15 joint declaration, landmark of independent reunification, and is wisely leading the movement for national reunification with his unique political caliber and boundless magnanimity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is led by Kim Jong Il with matchless grit and pluck, the DPRK is steering the world politics, standing against the U.S. that is styling itself the \"only super power\" in the world. The international authority and influence of the DPRK are increasing with each passing day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, great in politics, matchless and ever-victorious in the military field and promising in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation as it is led by Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu, is a genuine homeland of all Koreans and a beacon of hope for the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will uphold Kim Jong Il's idea of national reunification and leadership, bearing in mind the firm confidence that the dawn of a great prosperous powerful reunified state is breaking as it is led by him, destiny and future of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will more dynamically model the ranks of the AINDF on the Juche idea and help the people from all walks of life positively support, defend and uphold the patriotic Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will conduct a more vigorous patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" to decisively smash the undisguised moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK and the ambition of the pro-U.S. right-wing conservative forces to come to power again so as to open a new phase of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
