They added that her placing first in the women's marathon game marked an important occasion that opened a very bright prospect for the sports development of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They expressed hope that she would live up to the nation's expectation by registering good results continuously in future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jong Song Ok told the visitors that she believed north and South Korean athletes can place first at world games if they jointly take part. She expressed belief that Korea would certainly become the \"kingdom\" of sports if the north and the south join hands in developing sports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She asked the visitors to enjoy good health and make greater contributions to the reunification of the country as General Secretary Kim Jong Il wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The visitors looked round the inside of the house of Jong Song Ok and her family and gave them souvenirs. \r\n\r\n"
