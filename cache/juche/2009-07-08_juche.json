And he, with confidence, said that vegetables of the field got rotten because it was in lowland and people thought that as vegetables demanded much water, they would grow well in lowlands but the thought was wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went on to say that as the vegetable plot is located in a low wet land, vegetables grew well in the dry season but rainwater stood in the plot even after a light rain and vegetables grew rotten from the root.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tListening to him, officials of the farm and peasants were deeply impressed by his words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat day President Kim Il Sung gave a clear-cut answer to the problem the peasants who had cultivated vegetables for generations did not solve, thus brightly lighting the way of vegetable farming."
