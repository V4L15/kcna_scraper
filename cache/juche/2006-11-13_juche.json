            "content": "All People Called upon to Work Hard to Build Rich and Powerful Nation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- A great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche the Korean people are working hard to build means a country in which the sovereign right and interests of the popular masses are fully guaranteed in all fabrics of social life including politics, economy, ideology and culture and a country with strong national power which no enemy dares attack. Building this kind of country would bring the prosperity of Korean style. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche means, first of all, a powerful nation with single-minded unity in which all the army and people are united around the leader as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is an indestructible political and ideological power in which the leader and the masses are united as firm as a rock. The single-minded unity of the party, the army and the people means unity in thinking and purpose and sense of moral obligation based on the revolutionary faith and comradeship. This is genuine and solid unity and cohesion which neither nuclear weapons nor crafty psychological warfare can ever break. The DPRK is the only country in the world which has achieved steel-like unity and cohesion around the leader and always emerged victorious with the might of army-people unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche also means a militarily strong nation with its own tremendous military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the matchless military power that the DPRK has firmly maintained its independent stand in the stand-off with the U.S. imperialists and displayed its dignity as an invincible socialist powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can invade the DPRK as it has turned into an impregnable fortress in the true sense of the word, a country with a matchless army having Kim Jong Il, invincible and legendary commander, as the supreme leader of the forces for national defence, fully prepared politically and ideologically and highly modernized in military and technological terms and boasting perfect unity with the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche means, at the same time, a rich and powerful nation in which all the sectors of the economy make a leap forward on the basis of modern science and technology and in which the standard of the people's living steadily improves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are fully determined to more firmly defend the socialist country and build it into a more prosperous one, cherishing through their life experience the strong faith that they become happier when the country gets more prosperous.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is crying out that it has no intention to invade the north, asserting \"it stands for a peaceful solution\" and \"it has no idea of launching invasion\" and the like. This is, however, nothing but hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans from all walks of life should escalate the struggle to drive the U.S. imperialist aggression troops out of south Korea and thus remove the root cause of war, bearing deep in mind that a way out for them is to wage a struggle against the U.S. and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle can succeed only through national cooperation. For the Korean nation to win victory in the stand-off with the U.S. imperialists, group of ferocious aggressors, it should realize national cooperation from the stand of relying upon the strength of the nation with strong sense of national self-esteem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation with aggressive outsiders is an anachronistic act of treachery as it invites north-south confrontation and war of aggression. The south Korean authorities should immediately stop such criminal acts as straining the situation and harassing peace by yielding to the pressure, threat and blackmail of outsiders and joining them in their moves for aggression and war against the fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They killed or crippled a large number of innocent Koreans through deliberate shooting, violence, burglary, rape, arson and traffic accidents in different parts of south Korea, considering its people as \"colonial subjects.\" They have thus inflicted unspeakable misfortune and pain upon civilians there. Not even a day has passed by without blood shed by the people in south Korea. They killed south Koreans, men and women, young and old, and made mockery of them, considering them as games, moving targets, time-killers and playthings. An \"incident of shooting a girl in Kunsan\" in which a GI shot a herb-picking girl to death, calling her a pheasant, an \"incident of carrying a boy in a box in helicopter in Puphyong\" in which a GI stabbed a 14-year old shoe-polishing boy near U.S. Air Force maintenance store in his knees and arms, put him into a box and forced him to board a helicopter before dropping him from it, after being groundlessly charged with \"stealing\" and an \"incident of killing woodman in Phaju\" in which a GI shot a firewood-gathering farmer to death, regarding him as a roe deer are just a tip of iceberg of monstrous crimes perpetrated by the U.S. imperialist ogres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIs' bestial violence against south Korean women, in particular, is touching off towering indignation among the Koreans. They assaulted or gang-raped women in different parts of south Korea as they pleased and even stabbed or strangled them to death if they refused to meet their demands. These are the most hideous crimes against humanity that can be perpetrated only by the Yankees steeped in national chauvinism and misanthropy to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans cannot live in peace even a moment as long as south Korea remains under the occupation of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops who are chiefly to blame for blocking the independent and democratic development of the south Korean society and killing millions of innocent people in cold blood.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
