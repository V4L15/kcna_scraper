The accident claimed casualties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the accident the state emergency mechanism was put into action to conduct an intensive campaign to rescue survivors, treat the wounded and arrange the scene of the accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rescue operation came to an end on May 17. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minister of People's Security Choe Pu Il, General Officer of the Korean People's Internal Security Forces Sonu Hyong Chol, Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee Cha Hui Rim, Chief Secretary of Phyongchon District Committee of the WPK Ri Yong Sik and other officials concerned met the bereaved families, citizens in the district and other Pyongyangites to express deep consolation and apology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Pu Il said the responsibility for the accident rests with him as he failed to uphold well the WPK's policy of love for the people. He repented of himself, saying that he failed to find out factors that can put at risk the lives and properties of the people and to take thorough-going measures, thereby causing an unimaginable accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With nothing can he atone for the crime he committed against the people and he can never be pardoned, he said, repeatedly expressing deep apology to the bereaved families and other Pyongyang citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made a firm pledge to make sure that the Ministry of People's Security becomes a genuine security organ which always protects the interests, lives and properties of the people, true to the party's noble intention of putting the popular masses above all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sonu Hyong Chol said that he was chiefly to blame for the accident as he was in charge of the construction. He expressed heart-felt consolation and sympathy to the victims and the bereaved families and said he was making an apology, his head bent, to other Pyongyang citizens who were greatly shocked by the recent accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The party has always stressed the importance of raising the quality of structure, but he did the construction in a slipshod manner as he did not have the proper stand of serving the people, thus causing such a serious accident, he said, making a solemn determination to do utmost to eradicate the aftermath of the accident and bring the living of the bereaved families to normal as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cha Hui Rim said that the party has always called on the officials to become genuine and faithful servants of the people but he failed to have the proper control over the construction of the apartment houses as a man responsible for the living of the citizens of the capital city, thereby causing such a serious accident. He has no face to stand before the bereaved families and other Pyongyang citizens and feels deep compunction for them, he said, pledging to make sure that the officials of the Pyongyang City People's Committee do their utmost to alleviate even a little the pain of the victims and the bereaved families and bring their living to normal at the earliest possible date and to prevent the recurrence of similar accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Yong Sik said that seeing for himself the victims in the scene of the accident, he felt as if his heart were falling apart and was too shocked to cry. He added that he could not raise his head for his guilty conscience as he failed to protect the precious lives of the people so much valued and loved by the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made an apology to the bereaved families and to the citizens in the district again, vowing to come to senses, though belatedly, and motivate the officials in the district to bring the living of the bereaved families to normal, take good care of them, find out every possible cause of accidents and take preventive measures and thus fully guarantee the lives and security of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Su Gil, chief secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the WPK, said that the recent unexpected accident caused damage but there is loving care of our mother party which takes care of all people of the country and relieves their pain, adding that Marshal Kim Jong Un sat up all night, feeling painful after being told about the accident, instructed leading officials of the party, state and the army to rush to the scene, putting aside all other affairs, and command the rescue operation to recover from the damage as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Pyongyang citizens are sharing sorrow with the bereaved families and victims, he said, adding that the party and the state are taking effective emergency steps to bring the living of the families of victims to normal and provide them with new houses. He called on all to overcome sorrow with courage."

Great irony is that he was so imprudent as trying to justify his provocative remarks while pulling up the DPRK over its \"human rights\" and \"freedom\". Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a people's country established on the initiative of all Korean people. However, there exists in south Korea the puppet regime without any sovereignty which was established by the U.S at the point of bayonet. A \"country\" where the aggression forces swagger about under the U.S. domination is south Korean society deplored by its people. It is self-evident that genuine human rights cannot be ensured in the land where dignity and sovereignty are trampled down by outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is the tundra of human rights and freedom as it is ruled by the Park Geun Hye group seeking only its wealth and pleasures, indifferent to the lives of the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the puppet military group is pulling up the DPRK over its \"human rights and freedom\". Lurking behind this is its sinister intention to get on the nerves of the DPRK and escalate tensions in a bid to tide over the worst ruling crisis caused by the ferry Sewol disaster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group driven into a tight corner tries to raise the \"north wind\" to get rid of the crisis and find a way out by floating a \"rumor about nuclear test\" of the DPRK and announcing the investigation results that the \"north was involved in the drone case\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how frantically the Park group is keen on the anti-DPRK campaign, vociferating about \"human rights\" and \"freedom\", it can not tarnish the dignified image of the DPRK and cover up its sinister intention."

This is impossible if there is no instruction of the management side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such acts are a deliberate murder. It is necessary to institute a law to punish such guys as soon as possible."

            "content": "Cuadros expresan condolencias a familiares de damnificados y piden disculpas a capitalinos\r\nPyongyang, 18 de mayo (ACNC) -- El Partido del Trabajo de Corea y el Estado mantienen la invariable politica de absolutizar y dar prioridad a los intereses y comodidades de los habitantes y proteger consecuentemente la vida y las propiedades de ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, ocurrio el dia 13 en el campo de construccion de un apartamento del capitalino municipio de Phyongchon un accidente grave con saldo de perdidas humanas debido a la irresponsabilidad de los funcionarios que construyeron con chapuceria las viviendas para los habitantes y no supervisaron debidamente esta obra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como ocurriera el accidente, entro en operacion el aparato estatal de medidas emergentes y se libro una operacion intensa para rescatar a los sobrevivientes, tratar a los heridos y ordenar el terreno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro de Seguridad del Pueblo, Choe Pu Il, el general del Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea, Sonu Hyong Chol, el presidente del Comite Popular de la Ciudad de Pyongyang, Cha Hui Rim, el secretario responsable del Comite del PTC en el citado municipio, Ri Yong Sik, y otros cuadros se reunieron el dia 17 en el lugar del accidente, donde termino ya la operacion de rescate, con los familiares de victimas, los moradores de dicho municipio y otros capitalinos y les expresaron profundas condolencias y les pedieron disculpas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChoe Pu Il dijo que la responsabilidad del presente accidente recae sobre el mismo que no acato bien la politica de amor al pueblo del PTC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReflexiono de su error que causo el accidente inimaginable por no haber buscado a tiempo los factores peligrosos para la vida y los bienes del pueblo ni tomado las medidas consecuentes para eliminarlos de antemano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvio a pedir disculpas a los familiares y los ciudadanos diciendo que su crimen cometido ante el pueblo no puede ser remunerado ni perdonado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomo la firme decision de dedicar todo lo suyo, en acato al noble proposito del partido que concede primacia a las masas populares, por hacer del MINSEP el organo verdadero que siempre defiende consecuentemente los intereses, la vida y los bienes del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSonu Hyong Chol reconocio que el responsable principal del accidente es el mismo que se ha encargado de la obra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpreso profundo pesar y consuelo a los damnificados y sus familiares y pidio disculpas con la cabeza inclinada tambien a los capitalinos conmocionados por el accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien el partido instruye tanto elevar la calidad de las construcciones, he causado este accidente grave por haber ejecutado con chapuceria la obra, confeso y juro solemnemente hacer todo lo posible para eliminar cuanto antes las perdidas y estabilizar la vida de los familiares de victimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presidente del Comite Popular de la Ciudad de Pyongyang, Cha Hui Rim, dijo que el Partido siempre enfatiza a los funcionarios que sean servidores fieles al pueblo, pero el mismo no controlo bien la construccion de viviendas siendo encargado de vida de los ciudadanos, lo cual engendro el recien accidente grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que no tiene cara para pedir disculpas a los familiares de victimas y los habitantes ciudadanos y se decidio a hacer todo lo posible para que los funcionarios del comite popular alivien, aunque sea minimo, el dolor de los danados y sus familiares y estabilicen cuanto antes la vida de ellos y no surjan mas otra tragedia semejante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl secretario responsable del PTC en el municipio de Phyongchon, Ri Yong Sik senalo que al ver a las victimas con sus propios ojos, sentia muy apenado y agrego que no podia alzar la cabeza por el sentimiento de culpabilidad de no haber protegido la preciosa vida de los habitantes tan amantes por el Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPidio disculpa otra vez a los familiares de victimas y a los habitantes de su municipio y manifesto su decision de movilizar a los  funcionarios municipales para estabilizar y cuidar bien la vida de los familiares de victimas, tomar las medidas para buscar todos los elementos accidentales y asegurar cabalmente la vida y seguridad de los habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl secretario responsable del Comite del Partido en la ciudad de Pyongyang, Kim Su Gil recalco que aunque surgio el dano debido al inesperado accidente, nos atiende el Partido madre que elimina hasta el dolor del corazon de todo el pueblo del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe refirio a que al informarse del presente accidente, el Mariscal Kim Jong Un no durmio toda la noche sintiendose muy apenado por el caso y ordeno a todos los cuadros del Partido, el Estado y el Ejercito organizar ante todo la campana de socorro y dio las instrucciones detalladas orientadas a liquidar cuanto antes los danos concernientes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSubrayo que ahora todos los pyongyaneses comparten la tristeza con los familiares de victimas y los damnificados y se toman las medidas urgentes del Partido y el Estado destinadas a estabilizar la vida de las familias de victimas y ofrecerles nuevas viviendas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Finalmente exhorto a levantarse con animo como un solo hombre superando tal tristeza."
