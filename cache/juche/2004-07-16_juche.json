It is bitter shame on the nation that the U.S. imperialists are allowed to behave in south Korea as a dominator, trampling underfoot the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. It is the unanimous aspiration and will of the Korean nation to retake the dignity of the nation and demonstrate once again to the world the indomitable spirit as an independent people by putting a definite end to the U.S. domination and interference in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Patriotism is the idea which all the members of the nation can sympathize with and accept, irrespective of idea and social system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are various differences as the Koreans in the north and the south have lived separated for more than half a century, but the commonness as a homogenous nation is much greater than them. Only when all Koreans display to the full patriotism enshrined in their hearts can they achieve great unity irrespective of all differences and settle any difficult issues related to national reunification by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should fully materialize the idea of national independence and patriotism, the best idea common to the nation and an ideological and mental foundation of national unity.

This is not truly aimed at disarmament, peace and detente. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n Terming the U.S. imperialists' reduction and redeployment of its forces a move to bolster its forces, the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. immediate aim is to relocate its forces in south Korea in the area south of the River Han and turn them into a regional force in charge of the Asia-Pacific region including Northeast Asia. This means that the U.S. seeks to expand the sphere of operation of its forces in south Korea, which has been confined to the Korean peninsula, to the vast area of the Asia-Pacific region and use them as a strategic and task force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reduction and redeployment of its forces is targeted against the DPRK, China and Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are working hard to stifle the DPRK and, furthermore, contain and bring under their control its neighbouring countries with south Korea as a military stronghold. This is one of the reasons why they are relocating their forces in south Korea in the area south of the River Han. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intended to help the U.S. forces get out of the range of the People's Army's first retaliatory strike in case of \"emergency,\" preserve them and mount an attack on the DPRK. The U.S. imperialists plan to launch a preemptive attack, wave-like strike and surgical operation-form attack by aircraft, missiles and other means. To this end the U.S. intends to use Japan as the most important military base while implementing its plan for the reduction and redeployment of its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After getting a hold on Mideast and Central Asia in the wake of the September 11 incident the U.S. felt the need to have military bases and armed forces to lay a military siege to China and Russia in those regions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. seeks to achieve this aim through the reduction and redeployment of its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan to pull some of its forces out of south Korea and deploy them in Iraq is part of this move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reduction and redeployment of its forces in S. Korea is a new dangerous military measure to guarantee their \"qualitative edge\" in a bid to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, it concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
