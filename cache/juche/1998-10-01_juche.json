            "content": "Comments on Japan's postwar settlement\r\nPyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- The 20th century that has witnessed unprecedented events in the life of humanity is waning in vortex and the 21st century is drawing near.\r\n   At this historic juncture, it is a trend in international relations to liquidate unhappy things of the 20th century full of vicissitudes before greeting the new century.\r\n   There is, however, a cancer-like nation that tries to bury into obscurity its crime-woven past and repeat it, issuing a downright challenge to this trend of history and the effort of the international community. It is none other than Japan.\r\n   Not only war criminal states and satellite nations but also victor nations have liquidated or are liquidating the past, assuming responsibility for wartime crimes. At this time, only Japan is avoiding postwar settlement and behaving shamefully, far from admitting its history of aggression and crime.\r\n   Japan is a war criminal state that plunged Asia into disaster. For a war criminal state to make apology and compensation to the victim nation is an unavoidable political and moral obligation and duty in view of international law and ethics.\r\n   Japan's postwar settlement should, in essence, be to frankly admit and repent of its aggression and crime and make unconditional material compensation.\r\n   In Japan, however, cabinet members and dietmen make remarks that totally deny and distort the history of aggression and crime= even a film that describes top-level war criminals as \"heroes\" and \"pride\" of Japan is screened overtly= and a samurai-style \"view of history\" that the truth of history cannot be learned within a hundred years is making its appearance.\r\n   During their occupation of Korea, Japanese imperialists kidnapped and drafted more than six million young and middle-aged people and murdered more than a million. Nearly 200,000 Korean women were kidnapped in broad daylight, violated, mutilated and burned to death. This story is still thrilling humankind.\r\n   The international community is indignant at Japan's colonial rule over Korea because it was the most brutal and heinous unethical crime in human history.\r\n   No matter how hard the Japanese authorities may try to distort and deny the history of crime and shameful plunder, this blood-stained history will neither be erased nor forgotten.\r\n   To whitewash the past through denial and distortion of history is a suicidal act that will lead Japan's today and future to destruction.\r\n   Japan has no other alternative but to frankly admit the history of aggression and plunder, make unconditional and thorough state apology and compensation and abandon the anachronistic militarist ambition. This is a criterion of Japan's postwar settlement.\r\n   Japan must utter a word carefully. Before they boast of being a rich nation with \"rapidly growing economy,\" they must remember that their silk quilt is stained with blood and sweat of the Korean people.\r\n   There are many wars, big and small, recorded in history and each of them was accompanied by murder, arson and plunder. But, there is no such nation as Japan that robbed other country of everything, even spoon and chopsticks.\r\n   Today's Japan is an empire of evil that has risen from the sea of blood of the Korean and other Asian peoples.\r\n   The Japanese authorities, however, are disguising themselves as victim by fabricating a fiction of \"suspected kidnapping of Japanese\" in an attempt to escape from their political, moral and historical obligation.\r\n   This shows the savage, shameless feature and political and moral vulgarity of Japan, which is distinct from other countries including Germany that have admitted their war crimes and made apology and compensation.\r\n   While shelving their postwar settlement, the Japanese authorities are now making a fuss with \"countermeasures\" based on the deeply-rooted anti-DPRK policy in the wake of the successful satellite launch of the DPRK. This lays bare their true colors as \"political dwarf.\"\r\n   It is ridiculous for Japan that has not shaken off the ill fame of enemy state to covet permanent membership of the UN Security Council.\r\n   The Korean people have a legitimate right to receive an apology and compensation from Japan. This right is indisputable, unconditional and thorough-going.\r\n   If the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan are to be removed and bilateral relations to be normalized, Japan must liquidate its past, first of all. There can be no improvement in their relations without postwar settlement. \r\nIf Japan continues avoiding postwar settlement, the Korean people's wrath, hatred and revengeful thought against their sworn enemy, Japan, will grow thousandfold.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must be honest before history and make a political decision not to delay the atonement for their past crimes against the Korean people till the 21st century.\r\n   If Japan continues avoiding postwar settlement without making an honest apology and unconditional compensation to the Korean people, it will be criticized by the international community as the most savage, shameless and politically and morally despicable nation ever in human history. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
