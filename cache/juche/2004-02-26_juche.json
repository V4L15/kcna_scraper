His idea of the socialist rural construction and his leadership exploits are the most precious treasure that should be firmly preserved and carried forward generation after generation in the struggle to accomplish the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to invariably and creditably carry forward his idea of rural construction whose validity has been clearly proved in the protracted struggle to embody it, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il's line of economic construction and agricultural policy in the Songun era mean his inheritance and development in depth of Kim Il Sung's idea of rural construction and his exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's agricultural policy clarifies all the theoretical and practical problems in bringing about a great surge in the agricultural production and technological development as required by the Songun era and thereby successfully advancing the socialist rural construction and completing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The officials and workers in the agricultural field should devotedly implement the line of economic construction in the Songun era, well aware of the important mission they have to fulfill for the country, the revolution, the people's livelihood and the defence of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls upon the whole Party and country and all the people to firmly consolidate the socialist class position in the countryside and increase the political and military might of the country in every way and appeals to the whole country to render active support to agriculture so as to provide the people with more affluent and highly-civilized life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countryside of the DPRK will surely take on the appearance of that of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation as long as there are the Juche-oriented idea of socialist rural construction which was founded by Kim Il Sung and is being fully materialized by Kim Jong Il, the best socialist rural management system and the agricultural workers intensely loyal to the Party and the motherland, the editorial concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind the U.S. pressure upon south Korea for additional troop dispatch is a strategic aim to draw south Korea into Iraq in a bid to settle the situation there as early as possible and then ignite a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, only Koreans in the north and the south will suffer disasters. It is, therefore, quite natural for the south Korean people from all walks of life and all other Koreans to take strong actions for the withdrawal of the \"motion on additional troop dispatch to Iraq\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But after the \"Meiji Restoration\" it began to call even its western waters Japanese sea as the Japanese imperialists' ambition and policy to invade Korea got pronounced in a phased way. After occupying Korea the Japanese imperialists registered the sea at the International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) misusing its position as a suzerain state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Japanese imperialists' invasion of Korea was illegal and Korea was liberated with their defeat there was no ground for Japan to keep calling the East Sea of Korea the Japanese Sea. This designation, a leftover of old colonialism, must be abolished and the nomenclature of the East Sea of Korea should be restored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They expressed the conviction that the world conscience that loves justice and truth would recognize the wrong designation of the East Sea of Korea as the Japanese Sea, extend active support and solidarity to the Korean nation in its just struggle to do away with the leftover of colonialism in the designation of seas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to the general secretary of the IHO was adopted at the symposium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the symposium were personages in science, education, culture and other fields in the north and the south, teachers, researchers, officials concerned and working people from different social standings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
