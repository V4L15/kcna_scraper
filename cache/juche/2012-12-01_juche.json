These are associated with the ardent loyalty and devoted efforts made by the social scientists of the DPRK for the prosperity of the country and the development of the social sciences of the country, while remaining faithful to the party and the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The basic duty facing the field of social sciences at present is to further glorify the undying feats performed by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche, successfully solve theoretical and practical matters arising in building a thriving socialist nation and thus actively contribute to accomplishing the cause of modeling whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The letter indicates fundamental principles and general orientation to be constantly maintained in building Juche-oriented social sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It continues:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order for social sciences to make tangible contributions to building a thriving nation as a powerful weapon of revolutionary practices, it is necessary to effect a fresh and great turn in the activities for studying social sciences as required by the times and the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our social sciences should carry forward the revolutionary character and the glorious traditions as the social sciences guided by Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism in name and reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The embodiment of Juche methodology, combination of theories and revolutionary practices and the maintenance of the principle of historicism--this is the most correct way of developing social sciences based on the Juche idea and the principled requirements for ensuring achievements in the study of social sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Academy of Social Sciences has an important mission to defend the Workers' Party of Korea scientifically and theoretically, help the party and the state in shaping policies and take the lead in developing social sciences as a whole with great achievements in scientific research.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should explain in depth the truth, originality, justice and tremendous vitality of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and widely disseminate it at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should properly carry on the work of systematizing and theorizing in a scientific way the great successes and valuable experience gained by the WPK and the Korean people in the revolutionary struggle and construction, and handing them over to posterity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The letter says that it is an important task facing the Academy of Social Sciences to further develop all the fields of social sciences, settling issues arising in the construction of a thriving socialist nation and making them pay off in practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It sets forth tasks facing the fields of social sciences."
