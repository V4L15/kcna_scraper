It also reflected their unshakable faith and will to further strengthen the DPRK government and add lustre to their country and their fatherland, they stressed.\r\n   They noted that while leading the party and state affairs as a whole for scores of years Kim Jong Il has turned the DPRK into a  powerful socialist country, independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in defence, by arousing the whole party, the entire army and all the people in the struggle for its prosperity and development.\r\n   Under his wise leadership the KPA is now demonstrating its invincible might as army strong in ideology, which is firmly armed with the Juche idea and a steadfast, revolutionary outlook on the leader, and as matchlessly strong army,  the speakers stressed.\r\n   They called on all the servicemen to fully equip themselves with the spirit of devotedly defending their leader Kim Jong Il, spirit of human bombs and spirit of suicidal attack,  enhance combat power of the units in every way through intensified military and political training, perform new feats in socialist construction and thus greatly contribute to making the Juche homeland more powerful and prosperous.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Japan's past crimes and wrong stand and attitude concerning the crimes deserve worldwide discussions.\r\n   We will increase the scope of an international campaign to expose, and condemn  the anti-ethical crimes of Japan.\r\n   More than once we warned the right-wing conservative forces of Japan that their attempt to do harm to us with the fiction will bring nothing good to them. The Japanese side should  not ignore our warnings.    \r\n\r\n"

They unanimously said they, through the work, came to know well that the stand and proposal of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government for national reunification are always fair and aboveboard and are clear and consistent.    And they confirmed their will to strengthen solidarity with the stand and proposal.\r\n   Lecture meetings, reading sessions, discussion meetings, press conferences and seminars  on the work were held at the Asian regional institute of the Juche idea and in Libya, Mexico, Russia, the Czech Republic and other countries.\r\n   The work was also widely reported by some 120 mass media in 60 odd countries.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"
