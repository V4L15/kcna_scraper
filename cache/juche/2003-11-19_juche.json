It goes on:\r\n As an international treaty should be concluded between the parties to international law, an international treaty can not be concluded without a contracting party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists cooked up the \"Ulsa (1905) Five-Point Treaty\" on the strength of which they deprived Korea of diplomatic right, prerogative of military command and judicial right. It was allowed to adopt any decision related to its domestic and foreign policies and implement them and appoint any official only under the approval and supervision of Japan's \"resident general.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clearly stipulated in the \"international public law\" at that time and the present international law that the Korean government cannot be a contracting party to a treaty as it was deprived of the diplomatic right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The illegality of the treaty can be explained well by the fact that it was a product of the Japanese imperialists' violence, coercion, threat and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 23, 1910 Terautsi, minister of the Japanese Army and resident general in Korea, amassed in Seoul three battalions of aggression troops from Japan and two regiments stationed in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the outset they did not intend to pay heed to any request of the Korean side nor envisage any agreement. They covered streets of Seoul with their troops to force the Korean side to accept only their unilateral demand, imposing an unconditional conclusion of the treaty on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that such treaty can not have any validity as it was fabricated by the unilateral demand without any agreement under coercion and threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty was a false document which had a forged ratification though a ratification is the most important condition for effectuating any treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the treaty was to take effect, it had to be ratified by the emperors of both sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese imperialists committed such brigandish act as forging the ratification of Emperor Sun Jong contrary to international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treaty had already been branded as an illegal and invalid treaty at the U.N. for its impudent and brigandish nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should stop at once such shameless act of distorting history and apologize for their past crimes and fully compensate for them.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Earlier, U.S. officials openly pressurized members of the south Korean \"consultative group for troop dispatch\" to dispatch combat troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pressure is a manifestation of malicious and brigandish intention to involve south Korea in the war of aggression unleashed by itself, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is wriggling in a dilemma, facing unpredictable difficulties in Iraq. It was revealed that Iraq's \"possession of weapons of mass-destruction\" was no more than a pretext to hoodwink the world public and justify the war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., discontented with a plan for dispatching 3,000 non-combatants recently put forward by south Korea, forced south Korea again to dispatch a 5,000-10,000-strong combat unit of a division scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is the people's mind that even a non-combatant should not be dispatched. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle against the additional troop dispatch to Iraq spreading in all parts of south Korea is an expression of the anti-American will of the south Korean people to defend the national sovereignty and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should reject the U.S. demand and pressure for troop dispatch in an effort to check the troop dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very alarming provocative act to chill the atmosphere of the six-way talks and an indecent action on the part of dialogue partner bereft of any common sense and good faith. Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed commentary today. \r\n The commentary goes on: The Bush bellicose group is contemplating about the deployment of more than 100 tactical ground to ground missiles with a firing range of 300 km in south Korea and staging a joint naval maneuvre with Japan. And Bush in a lecture malignantly pulled up the DPRK over its \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK recently manifested its readiness to participate in the six-way talks if they prove to be a process of realizing the proposal for package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions. This principled stand proceeded from its expectation that it would be possible to build confidence and secure a groundwork of co-existence when the DPRK and the U.S. settle issues one by one on the principle of simultaneous actions. It is the elementary sense of obligation for dialogue partners to reciprocate good faith each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent moves of the U.S. make the DPRK doubt as to whether the U.S. will come out to the talks with a will to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK and co-exist with it in peace and whether the latter will be able to expect any positive results from the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not misinterpret the magnanimity and good faith of the DPRK government as a sign of weakness.

In response to this demand of different public circles of Japan its opposition parties are becoming assertive about the transfer of U.S. marines stationed in Okinawa abroad.\r\n Much upset by this, Japanese right-wing conservative forces are becoming vociferous about \"military threat\" of the DPRK in a bid to justify the presence of U.S. troops in Okinawa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan, who is ultra right-wing element, let loose sophism in his speech made in Chiba Prefecture on Nov. 2 that the \"Japan-U.S. alliance\" is aimed to \"let the U.S. strike the north Korean missile base when it launches a missile\" and protect Japan from it.\" Other right-wing elements also grumbled that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops would adversely affect Japan's \"security\". \r\n This is an expression of Japan's inveterate tendency of submitting to the U.S. This is quite understandable because the right-wing conservative forces are called special class pro-U.S. forces. But their remarks merit a serious attention. What matters is why they are becoming so zealous to peddle the DPRK's \"threat\" whenever an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind their outcries is their sinister intention to accelerate militarization with the backing of the United States and realize their ambition to reinvade Korea and the rest of Asia at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are in Japan huge U.S. forces including many missiles targeted against the DPRK. It is a stark reality of Japan that its moves are being stepped up to emerge a military power. The Japanese reactionaries launched spy satellites and are building large warships, while accelerating the establishment of the missile defence-system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Director General of the Japan Defence Agency Ishiba in his recent interview with a British newspaper advocated the theory of preemptive attack by claiming that \"Japan has the right to attack the north Korean missile base,\" talking about the so-called imminent missile attack of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this eloquently indicates what the Japanese reactionaries seek in peddling the DPRK's \"military threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their notion is that the DPRK's forces that have defended its sovereignty from the U.S. threat of aggression for over 50 years pose a \"threat\" while the U.S. aggression forces and their moves to emerge a military power for reinvasion serve as deterrent forces. This is the militarist way of thinking peculiar to the Japanese right-wing conservative forces steeped in the pro-U.S. idea to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan was publicly branded as a war criminal state for turning Korea and other Asian countries into seas of blood and a shameful state that entered the new century without redressing its crimes committed in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world community will never remain an on-looker to Japan accelerating militarization under the absurd pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK and heading for overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such ruins are few in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent discovery proves that Korea was one of the first nations to produce earthenware with airtight kilns and use them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also marks a signal event demonstrating the long history and developed culture of the Pyongyang area, the cradle and center of human culture, and is another admirable success of archaeologists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
