This is the legal and moral obligation it should fulfil before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since its assumption of office the Abe group has gone all the more insolent in utter disregard of all this, completely ignorant of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A typical example of this is its attitude of flatly denying the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army, the most hideous crime against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently some Dietmen and ultra-right elements of Japan thronged to the U.S embassy in Tokyo and complained that a resolution on the sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army adopted at the U.S. Congress \"twists historical facts on the basis of misinformation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Policy Research Council of the Japan Liberal Democratic Party again denied Japan's crime-woven past, asserting that a 1993 statement of Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono concerning the \"comfort women\" issue was \"self-tormenting.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group tries hard to shirk off the responsibility for such crimes at any cost while denying the coercive recruitment of 200,000 Korean and other Asian women into sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army. This is brazen-faced political hooliganism and an open challenge to the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently Prime Minister Abe and other ultra-right elements offered a lantern to \"Yasukuni Shrine\" symbolic of militarism allegedly to console the soul of the war dead enshrined there. This was part of their moves to embellish the crimes committed by the militarists in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, the Washington Post strongly urged the present Japanese rulers to stop such impudence as denying facts, saying that the public is greatly angered by the recent moves of the Japanese right-wing revisionists of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A \"beautiful country\" much touted by the Abe group without repenting of and redeeming Japan's past crimes will only precipitate its international isolation and destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be well advised to behave itself, clearly understanding where it stands.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an expression of the habitual way and chronic evil habit of the U.S. to find fault with others in a bid to realize its dirty wild ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. is now doing is nothing but an application of serious double standards to the field of nuclear activity and the height of its arrogance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States would be well advised to give up such shameless intention.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These were monstrous aggressive crimes and brigandish arbitrary practices untold in any part of human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminals who brought unspeakable misfortunes and pains to the Korean nation through unheard-of hideous aggression and colonial rule should have made proper apology and compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries lost to shame, far from admitting, apologizing and compensating their shocking past crimes, are distorting and denying the historical facts and justifying the crimes they committed against the Korean nation in the past, while challenging the DPRK over what they call \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Actually, they are getting more undisguised in their hostile policy towards the DPRK while stepping up their moves to stage a comeback to the whole of Korea. The Abe group these days is kicking up a gruesome repressive row to destroy the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, a dignified overseas Koreans' organization of the DPRK, and seize its stronghold and it openly marked the Tok Islet as a part of Japan's territory in the \"Defense White Paper\" for 2007. This goes to prove that the Japanese militarist forces' confrontation with the DPRK and moves to stage a comeback to Korea have reached really a reckless phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality shows that the history of criminal aggression by robbers of the island country has by no means come to an end, though a whole century has passed since the Japanese imperialists forged the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to behave with discretion, facing up to the trend of the times, and make honest apology and compensation for their crimes committed against the Korean nation in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Iniciada VI ronda de conversaciones a nivel de general N-S\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 25 de julio (ATCC) -- Quedo sesionada el dia 24 en la parte sur de Phanmunjom la VI ronda de conversaciones a nivel de general Norte-Sur de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la ocasion ambas partes prosiguieron la discusion sobre la agenda principal de esta cita: \"Sobre las medidas militares para prevenir el conflicto y realizar la pesca conjunta en el Mar Oeste de Corea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El teniente coronel del Ejercito Popular de Corea, Kim Yong Chol, quien preside la delegacion de la parte Norte, analizo de manera contrastante las diferentes posiciones y actitudes de ambas partes manifestadas hasta ahora en la discusion de la agenda y fustigo el injusto proceder de la parte Sur en cuanto a los problemas como la paz del pais y el alivio de la tension militar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque la parte Sur habla del \"asentamiento de la paz\" y el \"establecimiento del sistema de la paz\", elude obstinadamente la solucion raigal del problema de prevencion de los conflictos en el Mar Oeste y trata de malemplear el asunto de la pesca conjunta para implementar sus objetivos politicos, dijo Kim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Revelo que la desatencion de la parte surcoreana a esos problemas pendientes del Mar Oeste demuestra que ella no piensa primero en el destino del pais y la nacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Presa del caduco modo de pensar de la Guerra Fria, la parte Sur rehusa sin motivos justos las iniciativas de principios orientadas a prevenir choques y realizar la pesca conjunta en el Mar Oeste de Corea e insiste atrevidamente en que la supuesta \"linea de limite con el Norte\" es la unica de demarcacion en ese mar, objeto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, en estos momentos del dialogo militar, violando el acuerdo bilateral, el Sur se apela a la dispersion de volantes y otras formas de la sucia guerra psicologica contra el Norte y da mas calor a la intrusion en las aguas jurisdiccionales de este reclamando que son suyas, critico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Desenmascaro que esto deviene una prueba evidente de que la parte Sur sigue siendo el rezagado que se siente atraido todavia por la confrontacion de ideas e ideales y el conflicto armado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al mismo tiempo, el jefe de la delegacion nortena presento una serie de remedios para impulsar este encuentro de acuerdo con la esperanza y la demanda de la nacion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asevero que las autoridades militares de ambas partes deben tener una firme voluntad y decision de solucionar a toda costa la prevencion de choques y la puesta en marcha de la pesca conjunta en el Mar Oeste de Corea siendo patrones de este asunto y separarse valientemente de sus criterios y opiniones que parten del modo de pensar de la Guerra Fria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La parte Sur no debe interpretar a su manera o tergiversar los acuerdos Norte-Sur alcanzados ya con las fuerzas conjuntas de la nacion coreana y los requisitos de los reconocidos derechos internacionales, exigio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por ultimo, destaco que para la marcha de las conversaciones castrenses intercoreanas, nunca deben suceder las acciones que enrarezcan el clima del dialogo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por inmediato, la parte Sur debe parar varias formas de la guerra psicologica, la imprudente intrusion maritima y todos los ejercicios belicos conjuntos con las fuerzas extranjeras, que se cometen contra la contraparte del dialogo, concluyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La cita prosigue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena \"Tratado de 7 Puntos de Jongmi\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 25 de julio (ATCC) -- El \"Tratado de 7 Puntos de Jongmi (1907)\" fue un documento gangsteril que obligo al gobierno feudal de la dinastia de los Ri a gestionar solo con la aprobacion del \"gobernador general\" japones todos los problemas internos como el establecimiento de decretos, el manejo de importantes asuntos administrativos, el nombramiento y destitucion de los altos funcionarios, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido este miercoles en ocasion del centesimo aniversario de la invencion y promulgacion de ese \"tratado\" y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En virtud del citado \"Tratado\" y otros \"convenios\" agresivos y leoninos de toda indole, los imperialistas japoneses ocuparon a Corea y practicaron una brutal y fascista dominacion colonial. Ese infame acto criminal y arbitrariedades de bandido no tienen precedentes en la historia de la humanidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por lo tanto, esos criminales estan en la obligacion de pedir perdon y recompensar por las incontables desgracias y sufrimientos infligidos a la nacion coreana mediante esa barbara agresion y la dominacion el colonial nunca vistas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al contrario, los reaccionarios islenos tergiversan, niegan y justifican esos historicos hechos criminales. Para colmo, desafian a la nacion coreana cuestionando el supuesto \"problema de secuestro\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Efectivamente, cautivados por la ambicion de nueva agresion, practican mas abiertamente su politica hostil a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y sus maniobras de agresion a esta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ultimamente, lanzaron una salvaje campana represiva para exterminar a la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon), digna entidad de los ciudadanos de la RPDC en ultramar, en particular, tratan de arrebatar la Casa Central de ella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mientras tanto, anotaron la isla coreana Tok como su territorio en la \"carta blanca de defensa\" para 2007. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Estos hechos alarman que las maniobras de los militaristas japoneses encaminadas a la confrontacion con la RPDC y a nueva agresion a esta entran en una etapa aventurera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La realidad demuestra que aunque paso un siglo desde la invencion del \"Tratado de 7 puntos de Jongmi\" por parte de los imperialistas japoneses, no ha terminado la historia de agresion criminal de estos gangsteres islenos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios japoneses deben ver correctamente la corriente de la epoca y actuar con prudencia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Y tienen que pedir disculpa e indemnizar sinceramente sus crimenes perpetrados en el pasado contra la nacion coreana.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
