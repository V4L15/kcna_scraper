The same applies to Japan.\r\n   Japan, which has persistently avoided the normalization of ties with the DPRK with unreasonable pretexts and preconditions, intends to make its appearance again as a belligerent. This is what we have long supposed.\r\n   Our armed forces are fully ready to deliver a prompt and severe counterblows to Japan in case it fully takes part in a war against us.\r\n   The United States and Japan had better act with prudence, mindful that reckless military threat and aggression against the DPRK will harm themselves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
