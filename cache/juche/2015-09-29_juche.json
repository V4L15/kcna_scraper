Korean Chief Executive\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released a statement on Tuesday lashing out at the repeated reckless remarks made by the south Korean chief executive inciting confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north at the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said: The south Korean chief executive in her \"keynote speech\" at the 70th session of the UN General Assembly let loose such invectives that the \"nukes of the north constitute a top priority task for building a world without nuclear weapons\", \"the north's additional provocation is aimed at vitiating the atmosphere of the inter-Korean dialogue and hamstringing the efforts of the countries concerned with the six-party talks for resuming the dialogue for denuclearization and \"the north would be well advised to strive to help its residents overcome difficulties through reform and opening instead of making an additional provocation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with hurting the DPRK's dignity and social system, vociferating about \"requirement of the international community\" and the \"urging the improvement of human rights,\" she openly revealed her ambition to achieve \"unification through absorption\" with the backing of foreign forces under the pretext of \"peaceful unification\",.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable provocation to the DPRK and a heinous confrontation act of chilling the hard-won atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A string of silly remarks made by her clearly prove that she is utterly bereft of reason, hell-bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is so reckless as to take issue with the DPRK's nuclear deterrent, a treasured sword of justice for defending the nation while keeping mum about nukes of her American master, the cancer-like harasser of the global peace. This is no more than a sheer jargon of the chief executive, colonial servant who is so steeped in sycophancy towards the U.S. to the marrow of her bones that she does not know what she should support and what she should oppose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of shamelessness for her to impudently talk about someone's \"human rights\" and \"living of residents,\" pretending not to know about south Korea being denounced as the world's worst tundra of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What was funny was that she made no scruple of telling cock-and bull-story that she was dreaming of the arrival of the day when \"the world would hail the unification of the Korean Peninsula\" just as the U.N. \"greeted\" the tragic day when the U.S. puppet regime was installed. This is something that provokes a side-splitting laughter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, this was an open revelation of the wild ambition to achieve \"unification of social systems,\" a foolish act of driving this land into a war and inviting self-ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had already served a stern warning to the south Korean authorities that they would have to pay dearly for their reckless remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Due to the south Korean authorities' reckless confrontation row not only the north-south relations but the reunion of separated families and relatives in the north and the south now being promoted with much effort has been put at serious peril.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities let loose a string of confrontational invectives as now, the event may prove completely abortive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the unanimous view of the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We stand for improved north-south relations but have no idea of continuing to show leniency even to the partner who is persistently pursuing confrontation, turning down our offer of reconciliation and magnanimity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should apologize to the nation for recklessly slandering the fellow countrymen and learn how to properly wag their tongues, bearing in mind that their provocative words and deeds may cause unpredictable misfortune at this crucial time."
