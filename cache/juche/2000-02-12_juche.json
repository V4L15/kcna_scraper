The country and the people will always remember their shining feats, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the KPA, he noted, is not only firmly defending the revolutionary cause of the party with arms but playing the role of vanguard in the socialist economic construction for building a powerful nation. It is a great pride for the party and the people to have such ranks of loyalists and such great army of the revolution as the KPA, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that it is part of the important work for building a powerful nation to give face-lifting to the country to meet the requirements of Juche, he put forward  highly important tasks which will serve as a guideline in making the country more beautiful and richer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He met the soldier-builders who have performed praiseworthy exploits in the reconstruction of the Mujigae tunnel and gave a pep-talk to them before having a picture taken with them. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "FM Paek Nam Sun interviewed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun of the DPRK replied written queries put by home and foreign reporters as regards an official visit to the DPRK of his Russian counterpart Igor Ivanov. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRussian Foreign Minister Ivanov paid an official visit to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea from February 9, 2000 to 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe conveyed the regards and personal letter to General Secretary Kim Jong Il from acting president Putin of the Russian Federation and his own gift. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I, upon the authorization, asked the Russian Foreign Minister to convey warm greetings of the great leader of our party and people Kim Jong Il to acting president Putin of Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Yong Nam of the presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly met and had a conversation with Russian Foreign Minister Ivanov. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The foreign ministers of the DPRK and the Russian Federation had cordial and friendly talks and discussed the treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation between the two countries and signed the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the talks the two sides informed each other of the situation of their countries, exchanged in-depth views as regards boosting the bilateral relations of friendship and cooperation and had an open-hearted discussion about a series of international issues of mutual concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK side reiterated the principled stand that primary and fundamental matters in defusing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and achieving the reunification of the country are the U.S. forces pullout and the dismantlement of its military installations in South Korea and the conclusion of a peace accord between the DPRK and the U.S. It underlined them as cardinal issues related to lasting peace and stability on the peninsula, as well as peace and security in Russia, including the far east. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also said the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK clamored about by the U.S. and other hostile forces is, in essence, a trick to contain big countries, champions of multi-polar world, under that pretext  and maintain their absolute military edge over them. It made clear the principled stand that in order to protect the dignity of the nation the DPRK will, in the future, too, strongly retaliate against any move to discriminate against it in the issue of satellite and missile launch that belongs to the sovereignty of an independent state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Russian side expressed full support to the reunification of Korea that should be realised on the three principles--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--laid down by the great leader Kim Il Sung and agreed upon in principle by the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also expressed understanding of the DPRK's principled stand that for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula the north and south of Korea should be reunified and the U.S. troops, a stumbling block lying in the way of the reunification, should be pulled out of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe foreign ministers of the two countries expressed deep concern over the arbitrary and high-handed practices of the U.S. ignoring the UN Charter and the publicly recognized international laws, the projected \"tripartite military alliance\" of the U.S., Japan and the South Korean authorities that jeopardizes peace and security on the Korean peninsula, in northeast Asia and the rest of the world and the U.S. and Japan's efforts to set up \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Both sides shared the view that the moves to escalate tensions are a source of upsetting strategic balance, increasing the danger of war and sparking a new arms race in northeast Asia and the rest of the world and acknowledged the need for the countries concerned to cope with them with concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recently-concluded bilateral treaty of friendship, good neighborliness and cooperation provided a political and legal guarantee for boosting cooperation and exchanges in all spheres and upgrading the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It will be a substantial contribution to the strengthened friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation between the peoples of the two countries sharing the same border and to peace and security in northeast Asia, the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two sides were pleased with the daily-developing relations between the two countries and expressed conviction that the bilateral relations would grow stronger and develop on the principle of independence, equality and non-interference in each other's internal affairs thanks to the concerted efforts. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Clinton's remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Clinton said a few days ago that the U.S. would relax controls on exports of high-performance computers and semiconductors but strict controls would remain in place on exports to North Korea, and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a clear indication of the U.S. intention to go ahead with its hostile policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK and we cannot but take a serious note of his utterance as the measure was taken in the run-up to the DPRK-U.S. vice-minister-level talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is trying hard to justify sanctions against the DPRK, linking it with a sort of \"issue of terrorism.\" but this is a far-fetched assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As we have already explicitly clarified, we are opposed to terrorism in general. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK, a dignified UN member state, has consistently maintained the stand to oppose all forms of terrorism and any assistance to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK, which has invariably considered independence, peace and friendship as its noble idea of foreign policy and remained true to it, has nothing to do with the inglorious terminology of \"state sponsor of terrorism.\" Therefore, it was an extremely unilateral and contradictory measure taken by the U.S. in pursuance of its hostile policy toward the DPRK for the U.S. to link it with the \"state sponsor of terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. had wished to improve its relations with the DPRK and nurtured a definite will to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK in the letter and spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, it should have already declassified the DPRK  as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But there has been no substantial progress in the implementation of the agreed framework, though quite a long time has passed since its signing. This is, of course, because the U.S. has  not given up such an anachronistic hostile policy as listing the DPRK as a \"state sponsor of terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such an act hostile to the other side of the dialogue before the talks is an undesirable behaviour vitiating the atmosphere for its start and laying an artificial obstacle in the way of achieving its objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should show its will to improve its relations with the DPRK by immediately stop pursuing all its political, economic and military policies designed to isolate and stifle the DPRK, while absurdly linking the DPRK with \"terrorism,\" and taking practical confidence-building measures. \r\n\r\n"
