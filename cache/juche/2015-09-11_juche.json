            "content": "Spokesman for History Society of DPRK Accuses S. Korean Authorities of Distorting History\r\n Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- During her recent foreign trip, the south Korean chief executive attended a ceremony of reopening the building of the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\" at which she talked nonsense that \"there started the legal tradition of south Korea,\" \"it was the base of diverse independent struggles\" and \"it gave the Korean nation hope for regaining the sovereignty.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard a spokesman for the History Society of the DPRK in a statement Friday said that pro-American and pro-Japanese south Korean authorities' visit to the old building of the \"provisional government\" organized by participants of the movement for independence from the Japanese rule was utterly unfit for them. What stunned the Koreans all the more was the south Korean authorities' wicked and impudent behavior of embellishing their treacherous nature, openly distorting the past history, it noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime has neither qualifications nor face to talk about the legal tradition of the \"provisional government in Shanghai.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After illegally occupying south Korea after the liberation of Korea on August 15, the U.S. enforced \"military administration,\" thoroughly eliminating the forces for the independence movement including the figures of the \"provisional government in Shanghai\" and establishing a separate \"government\" made up of hand-raised Syngman Rhee and pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese lackeys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the U.S. backstage wire-pulling traitor Syngman Rhee orchestrated the assassination of Kim Ku, former prime minister of the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\", in daylight in the wake of politically-motivated suppression of him for the mere reason that he called for national independence and alliance with communism and cooperation. It was none other than the south Korean regimes, successors to the Syngman Rhee regime, which connived and protected assassin of Kim for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  They, also referring to the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\", talked about a key role played for \"raising hope for regaining sovereignty\" and a \"base for struggle for independence\", a sheer fabrication distorting historical facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that since its establishment in Shanghai, China in April 1919 till its disbandment in August 1945 the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\" barely kept its existence under the care of the Chiang Kai-shek-led Nationalist Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the Nationalist Party also held the right of command over the \"Liberation Corps\" that was formed by the \"Provisional Government\" in Chongqing, China in September 1940.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Revolutionary Army led by President Kim Il Sung won the historical victory of Korea's liberation through hard-fought heroic struggle against the one million-strong Kwantung Army of the Japanese imperialists in the area of Korea and in the northeastern part of China. Later many armed units of Korea fought bloody battles during the civil war in China for defeating troops of Chiang Kai-shek and rendered material and moral support to the Chinese people, greatly contributing to their final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These stark facts were proved by those witnesses who took part in the anti-Japanese war and even by Japan which enforced harsh colonial rule over the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever willing to talk about independence movement of the Korean nation had better have relevant common sense and if one is not in a position to do that, one had better keep silent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean regime has \"authenticity\", that is its hereditary sycophancy by which it sold out the dignity and interests of the nation to outsiders for the sake of its own wealth and luxury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities try to justify their traitorous nature and elicit \"support\" from others by daring distort the historical fact of Korea's liberation that was won at the cost of blood shed by Koreans, they will meet only derision and censure. They should clearly understand that such behavior is little short of adding to the indelible crimes they already committed against the fellow countrymen and posterity."

            "content": "Spokesman for History Society of DPRK Accuses S. Korean Authorities of Distorting History\r\n Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- During her recent foreign trip, the south Korean chief executive attended a ceremony of reopening the building of the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\" at which she talked nonsense that \"there started the legal tradition of south Korea,\" \"it was the base of diverse independent struggles\" and \"it gave the Korean nation hope for regaining the sovereignty.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard a spokesman for the History Society of the DPRK in a statement Friday said that pro-American and pro-Japanese south Korean authorities' visit to the old building of the \"provisional government\" organized by participants of the movement for independence from the Japanese rule was utterly unfit for them. What stunned the Koreans all the more was the south Korean authorities' wicked and impudent behavior of embellishing their treacherous nature, openly distorting the past history, it noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime has neither qualifications nor face to talk about the legal tradition of the \"provisional government in Shanghai.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After illegally occupying south Korea after the liberation of Korea on August 15, the U.S. enforced \"military administration,\" thoroughly eliminating the forces for the independence movement including the figures of the \"provisional government in Shanghai\" and establishing a separate \"government\" made up of hand-raised Syngman Rhee and pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese lackeys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the U.S. backstage wire-pulling traitor Syngman Rhee orchestrated the assassination of Kim Ku, former prime minister of the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\", in daylight in the wake of politically-motivated suppression of him for the mere reason that he called for national independence and alliance with communism and cooperation. It was none other than the south Korean regimes, successors to the Syngman Rhee regime, which connived and protected assassin of Kim for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  They, also referring to the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\", talked about a key role played for \"raising hope for regaining sovereignty\" and a \"base for struggle for independence\", a sheer fabrication distorting historical facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that since its establishment in Shanghai, China in April 1919 till its disbandment in August 1945 the \"Korean Provisional Government in Shanghai\" barely kept its existence under the care of the Chiang Kai-shek-led Nationalist Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the Nationalist Party also held the right of command over the \"Liberation Corps\" that was formed by the \"Provisional Government\" in Chongqing, China in September 1940.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Revolutionary Army led by President Kim Il Sung won the historical victory of Korea's liberation through hard-fought heroic struggle against the one million-strong Kwantung Army of the Japanese imperialists in the area of Korea and in the northeastern part of China. Later many armed units of Korea fought bloody battles during the civil war in China for defeating troops of Chiang Kai-shek and rendered material and moral support to the Chinese people, greatly contributing to their final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These stark facts were proved by those witnesses who took part in the anti-Japanese war and even by Japan which enforced harsh colonial rule over the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever willing to talk about independence movement of the Korean nation had better have relevant common sense and if one is not in a position to do that, one had better keep silent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean regime has \"authenticity\", that is its hereditary sycophancy by which it sold out the dignity and interests of the nation to outsiders for the sake of its own wealth and luxury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities try to justify their traitorous nature and elicit \"support\" from others by daring distort the historical fact of Korea's liberation that was won at the cost of blood shed by Koreans, they will meet only derision and censure. They should clearly understand that such behavior is little short of adding to the indelible crimes they already committed against the fellow countrymen and posterity."
