            "content": "Prevailing Situation Requires Bolstering of Nuclear Deterrence: Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- For the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear force provides a way of guaranteeing peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region and protecting the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation and socialism. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in an article. It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t Big powers seek to expand the sphere of their influence with emphasis on their politics, economy and diplomacy towards Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is noticeable in this respect is the U.S. arms buildup and military moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These frantic moves of the U.S. are arousing due vigilance among the regional countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. is letting out such rhetoric as that \"intolerable is the attempt to change international order\" and \"it is necessary to modernize the U.S. forces and bolster up troops and weapons and equipment,\" touting \"threat\" from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one has ever asked the U.S. to preserve regional order nor requested to defend peace in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mulling using even such vassal forces as Japan for carrying out its strategy though the latter is keen on meeting its interests in the Asia-Pacific region with the help of big powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. regards it as its primary strategic target to occupy the DPRK out of calculation that only when the former puts the whole of the  Korean peninsula under its control can it dominate Northeast Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace on the Korean peninsula is directly linked to peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. Once a war breaks out on the peninsula, it will naturally spill over into neighboring countries and lead to a global nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation requires the DPRK to put spurs to bolstering up its war deterrence."

To be more specific, the U.S. sold off its weapons to Mideast and Asia en masse. It was reported that countries in these regions vied with each other to order and buy American weapons to tackle regional disputes.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly suggests the aim lurking behind the U.S. strategy toward Mideast and Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This more clearly explains the reason why the U.S. is taking so much pain to intervene in the Mideast disputes and disturb peace and stability in Asia-Pacific. Its ulterior intention is to bring greater profits to its munitions monopolies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the reason why the U.S. is working hard to deliberately escalate the tension in the world's various hotpots including the Korean peninsula, challenging the human desire for peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cycle of tension that repeats on the peninsula every year is not exception.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By deliberately creating \"security crisis\" on the Korean peninsula in a bid to prompt the south Korean puppets to require more arms, the U.S. seeks to sell greater quantities of war hardware to them and thus bring enormous profits to its munitions monopolies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes without saying that the weapons and equipment which the U.S. sold to various countries of the world including south Korea would be a catalyst of arms race and lethal weapons for escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen and killing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the U.S. is a criminal state which stoops to any dangerous act of harassing world peace and security and throwing humankind into destruction in order to serve its selfish purpose."
