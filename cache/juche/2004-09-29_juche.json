Korean Conservative Forces' Anti-North Remarks under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- Conservative forces in south Korea are making groundless accusations over the trend toward the north against the U.S. This only reveals their intention to pursue confrontation with the north, not reconciliation and unity of the nation, and keep south Korea under the U.S. military occupation and domination.\r\n Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing conservative forces in south Korea including the Grand National Party do not bother to let loose such reckless remarks as the society tends towards the north, the Left and anti-Americanism. Conservative media are releasing articles pro-U.S. and anti-communist in their contents, chiming in with their propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a foolish behavior to divert the trend of the times and history as it is an act of chilling the independent and progressive desire of the south Korean people and getting on the nerves of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The trend towards the north against the U.S. is an irresistible one of the society. The pro-north trend leads to national reconciliation, unity and reunification and anti-U.S. actions lead to the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. right wing conservative forces including the GNP should clearly know that their desperate efforts to stem the trend of the times in which the south Korean people struggle to eliminate the old and create the new will only precipitate their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Disbandment of UN Forces Command Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday carries a commentary demanding the U.S. disband the \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea and pull back its forces from south Korea to the last man without delay.\r\n Laying bare once again the illegality of the command, the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe day after the statement was issued by a spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army calling for the disbandment of the command the \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea the command talked nonsense that if the 1953 Armistice Agreement collapses and hostile acts are perpetrated, the member states that signed the agreement will be reorganized for an alliance and play their role as the \"UN Peace-Keeping Force\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that a spokesman for the UN headquarters recently clarified the official stand that the U.S. troops in south Korea are not \"UN Forces\" but U.S.-led allied forces, the commentary explains in detail the background against which the U.S. illegally cooked up the \"UN Forces\" after launching the Korean war, armed forces were provided, how the successive commanders of the \"UN Forces\" were appointed by the U.S. and funds provided for them, etc. The commentary goes on: The \"UN forces command\" in south Korea, to all intents and purposes, is an illegal and anachronistic mechanism and is nothing but a tool for aggression to achieve the U.S. strategic purpose as it is its command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. abrogated the Armistice Agreement and dissolved the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission and has only perpetrated hostile acts against the DPRK. It has done through the \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea nothing but acts of disturbing peace on the Korean peninsula and increasing the danger of war. Its loudmouthed \"UN Peace-Keeping Force\" precisely means the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and its role is to ignite the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are trying to start the second Korean war under the signboard of the \"UN Forces,\" just as they did when they launched the last Korean war. The reorganization of alliance touted by them is aimed to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S. claims the presence of its forces in south Korea is in line with the UN decision, the commentary notes if that is true it should put into practice the UN decision calling for the withdrawal of its forces from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Urged to Drop Its Hostile Policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- The United States is trying to create impression that the resumption of the six-party talks was failed because of the DPRK's delaying tactics in a bid to mislead the public opinion. Blaming the U.S. for this, Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says: There is only one yardstick to measure the possibility of resuming the talks. That is the U.S. renunciation of its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a key to opening the prospect of the talks.\r\n The purpose of the six-party talks is to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. The U.S., however, came out to the talks from their outset with an extremely hostile view that it would never co-exist with the DPRK and has maintained such a stand throughout the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the U.S. has hatched a plot to stifle the DPRK militarily behind the scene of the dialogue, pushing the situation to a more complicated phase. These facts confirmed the DPRK's view that the U.S. dialogue strategy is nothing but a leverage to realize its policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. applied double standards as regards the case of extraction of nuclear substance in south Korea. This proves that it is not prompted by its concern about the nuclear proliferation but by its aim to realize its ambition to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to judge that the DPRK is linking the six-party talks to the presidential election in the U.S. But it only betrays its total ignorance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary urges the U.S. to clarify its willingness to drop its reckless hostile policy toward the DPRK if it is truly interested in seeking a peaceful negotiated solution to the nuclear issue through the six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
