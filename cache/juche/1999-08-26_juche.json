Korea\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- The \"Ministry of National Defense\" of South Korea on August 24 opened to the public a  \"message\" refuting the DPRK's just assertion that a new demarcation line should be fixed at the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the \"message\" the \"ministry\" said that it \"categorically rejects the north's assertion\" and that the \"'northern limit line' is an effective maritime demarcation line.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, the June incident at the West Sea of Korea was a premeditated and deliberate armed provocation by the South Korean warhawks insisting on the \"northern limit line,\" which has been recognized by nobody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"northern limit line\" claimed by the South Korean warmongers can be used by them as a train to ignite a war against the north at the west sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that the chief delegate of the north side, at the recent general officer-level meeting in Panmunjom, strongly reasserted that a new maritime demarcation line instead of the \"northern limit line\" should be fixed at an earliest date to keep such serious armed  provocation as the June incident from occurring again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The extension of the Military Demarcation Line  in the west sea, a just proposal made by the north side, is irrefutable because it is entirely based on the Armistice Agreement and the international law. It was drawn by extending the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do  and Kyonggi-do (line A-B) stipulated in the Armistice Agreement to a line equidistant from Korea and China at sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, the South Korean warhawks are imprudently arguing that the \"provincial boundary line is meaningless.\" They really deserve to be called special-class warmongers finding their ways of existence in provoking a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What must not be overlooked is that the \"ministry\" asserted that the general officer-level meeting is not mandated to discuss the issue of fixing maritime demarcation line between the north and the south of Korea and that the issue should be handled at the north-south joint military commission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is nothing but a foul talk of a colonial stooge who is not allowed to say even a word without an order from his master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of fixing the demarcation line at the West Sea of Korea is an issue related to the Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, it should be discussed between signatories to the agreement, not between the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean warhawks are well advised to stop such nonsense and throw away the \"refutation message.\" \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Great man's trust in popular masses\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- If there be something almighty in the world, it is the popular masses, not \"heaven\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This has been the invariable political belief and faith of General Secretary  Kim Jong Il in the whole course of leading the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It posed itself as a difficult task to undertake a ground work at sea when the construction of a long-distance belt-conveyer was proposed in Unryul mine in South Hwanghae Province in Juche 63 (1974). Officials who took charge of the project were at a loss what to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Informed of this, Kim Jong Il taught the officials that the task could not be carried out by a few technicians alone and the key to the solution of the matter was to go deep among workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A consultative meeting was thus held on the spot with experienced technicians and old workers in attendance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The discussion came to the conclusion that ground work for piers could be done during the low tide and concrete mixture be thrown in them during the next low tide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A practical way was found to carry out the difficult job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was a vivid manifestation of political belief of Kim Jong Il, who values the popular masses as the most powerful being and solves all problems in reliance upon them. His strong belief was also expressed when the Korean workers succeeded in manufacturing a 10,000-ton press by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The independent industry in Korea, which was making rapid progress in the 1980s urgently needed a 10,000-ton press. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time, Kim Jong Il called on the workers of the Ryongsong Associated Machinery Bureau (the then Ryongsong Machinery Complex) and tasked them to manufacture the press, counting on their inexhaustible strength and wisdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They wrought such a miracle as making it in a matter of 15 months in the spirit of self-reliance.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are signs of a new change in the economic construction of Korea. This is thanks to the successful embodiment of the political idea of Kim Jong Il, who is unraveling knotty problems by mixing with the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In recent years  Korea's economy had to undergo grim trials due to the moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and repeated natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many countries, including east European countries, are seeking a way out of serious economic crisis in introduction of foreign funds, reform and opening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, the DPRK is resolving its problems by rousing the popular masses to action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is evidenced by Kim Jong Il's ceaseless on-site guidance to factories, enterprises and agricultural and fishery farms. He sits knee to knee with producer masses and indicates ways of keeping production at a high level and  encourages them to perform feats. \r\n\r\n"
