One should not abandon one's own view and faith, caving in to growing pressure from imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dependence on outside forces in the progress of countries and nations is as dangerous as poison but independence is as good as elixir. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA accuses U.S. of trying to evade its responsibility\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 10 (KCNA) -- After the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework the United States committed itself through its president's message of assurances to take responsible measures for the provision of light water reactors (LWR) to the DPRK. However, the fate of the agreed framework is now in peril due to the U.S. non-fulfillment of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Quite contrary to the DPRK's sincere approach to the implementation of the agreed framework, the U.S. has paid only lip-service to the LWR project and there have been serious fluctuations in its supply of heavy oil to the DPRK as substitute energy, thus creating great confusion and difficulties in the DPRK's economic performance. This fact is widely known.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this connection, the DPRK has warned the U.S. more than once and urged it to show its faith by quickly and honestly implementing the points of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the U.S. has remained unchanged in its wrong attitude. These days it is hatching a sinister plot to shirk its responsibility for its non-fulfillment of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is clearly evidenced by its recent \"congressional research service report\" in which it asserted \"North Korea is highly likely to have the technology to produce nuclear weapons and has many more nuclear bombs than estimated because of a possible influx of plutonium from Russia.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The release of this \"congressional research service report\" on \"North Korea's possible possession of nuclear weapons,\" a baseless story, was timed to coincide with the surface of the issue of U.S. compensation for the delayed LWR project. The U.S. assertion is nothing but a brigandish attempt to shift its blame for the non-fulfillment of the agreed framework  on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a hard fact admitted by the U.S. itself that there is no doubt about the DPRK's freezing of all its nuclear activities right after the adoption of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was also proved by the U.S. visits to the Kumchang-ri underground facility last year and recently and the statement of the U.S. Department of State on the results of the visits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That was why Russia in a press release denying the report said \"the report is clearly biased and contributes nothing to the creation of a favorable climate for the settlement of the Korean problem and the successful holding of the inter-Korean summit.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a matter of fact, the DPRK is suffering tremendous economic losses due to the freezing of its independent nuclear power industry under the agreed framework. There are, therefore, opinions calling for the nullification of the agreed framework and assertions that push for restarting the nuclear power industry before it is too late.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. is well advised to behave in good faith, mindful that it will be accountable for the non-fulfillment of the agreed framework, including the compensation for the economic losses caused by the delayed LWR project, and for its imperiled fate. \r\n\r\n"
