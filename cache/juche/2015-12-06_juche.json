Korean Chief Executive's Call for \"Cooperation in Anti-DPRK Nuclear Racket\" under Fire \r\n Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- Days ago, the south Korean chief executive made a tour of European countries to solicit outside forces for \"cooperation in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket\" again. \n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the south Korean authorities together with the U.S. and Japan went busy, opening the meeting of the chief negotiators for the six-party talks for exploring the way of \"cooperation over north Korea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a commentary says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have persistently begged outside forces for intensified \"cooperation in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket,\" but in vain. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have no qualifications whatsoever to vociferate about \"north Korea's abandonment of nuclear program\" as they are making frantic efforts to ignite a nuclear war against it in collusion with outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop their provocative moves of aggravating the tension on the Korean Peninsula and increasing the danger of a nuclear war while actively joining in the U.S. nuclear racket against the compatriots in the north before begging outsiders for the above-said \"cooperation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more the south Korean executive tightens nexus with outsiders under the signboard of \"cooperation in the anti-DPRK nuclear racket\" prompted by her sinister ambition, the more the way to the improvement of the north-south relations will become distant and confrontation and tension will be escalated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the south Korean authorities may intensify\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tthe above-said cooperation, they can never shake the resolution and will \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tof the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to discontinue take trouble for such a useless farce but mind their own business which has gone bankrupt."
