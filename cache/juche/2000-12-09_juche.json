            "content": "Spokesman of GFTUK c.c. refers to inter-Korean workers' seminar\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (GFTUK) today issued a statement in connection with the highly disturbing atmosphere created in South Korea as regards the north-south workers' grand seminar for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The north-south workers' grand seminar for reunification for implementing the June 15 north-south joint declaration\" is slated to be held on Mt. Kumgang from Dec. 12 to 15. This will be the first seminar in history to be attended by representatives of the workers of the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GFTUK is close to completing its preparations for the seminar according to the agreement it had reached on all the issues related to the seminar with the \"South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" (KCTU) and the \"Federation of South Korean Trade Unions\" (FSKTU). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities are reported to have prevented Ri Kyu Jae, chairman for reunification of the KCTU, from attending the seminar though he was elected delegate of the south side to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this connection, the KCTU is struggling for the attendance of all the members of the delegation of the south side. And it resolutely declared that all of them will not participate in the seminar unless its demand is met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason to bar ri from attending it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities are only making such an ambiguous excuse as he is under \"investigation according to the Security Law,\" failing to clarify specified reasons for disallowing his visit to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is well known to the workers and other people in the north as he made a great contribution to the solidarity and unity between the workers in the north and the south by visiting Pyongyang as a representative of the KCTU and successfully holding the \"north-south football matches for reunification\" last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What he did was for the unity of the workers in the north and south and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The central committee of the GFTUK considers the South Korean authorities' disallowance of Ri's participation in the seminar as a deliberate obstruction to it and strongly urges them to immediately withdraw this measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hardly understandable for the South Korean authorities to come out to chill the zeal of the workers to support and implement the joint declaration, though they should spearhead the work to carry out it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persistently block the attendance of chairman Ri and bring the seminar to collapse, they will be held entirely responsible for all the ensuing consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GFTUK will let its delegation arrive at Mt. Kumgang as scheduled, with the Expection that all the members of the delegations of the KCTU and the FSKTU including Ri will come to the seminar.\r\n\r\n"

And the great leader Kim Jong Il formulated them as the three-point charter of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It lays down under an integral system a main principle and ways of achieving national reunification at the earliest possible date in conformity with the aspiration and demand of the fellow countrymen to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the three-point charter of national reunification is the most precious heritage left by Kim Il Sung for the cause of national reunification, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earlier achievement of national reunification depends on how to carry out the three-point charter of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever loves the country and the nation, be he or she in the north, south and overseas, should turn out to implement the three-point charter of national reunification in hearty response to it. \r\n\r\n"
