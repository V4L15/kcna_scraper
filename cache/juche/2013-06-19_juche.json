Meanwhile, the moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK on the part of the dishonest and hostile forces have faced bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A handful of human scum is moving desperately to deter this progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye and other present puppet authorities of south Korea are openly putting to the fore human scum belonging to the organizations of die-hard defectors from the north, painting them as \"experts in north Korean issue\" and instigating stepped-up criticism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 18, south Korea fed to Yonhap News and The Washington Post articles contributed by defectors saying that copies of book \"My Struggle\" authored by Hitler were presented to officials in the DPRK as gifts and campaign is now under way to learn from the experiences gained in rebuilding the \"Third Empire\" that existed in Germany after the First World War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They even committed the thrice-cursed crime of belittling the matchless great personality of the leader of the DPRK reflected in his loving care for the future generations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK regard it as shame to make mention of defectors from the north, a group of wild dogs in human form.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of human scum marginalized in the bright world has become the main player in the confrontation farce under the patronage of the south Korean puppet group and brigandish U.S. imperialists. They even slandered and insulted the dignity and the social system of the DPRK, an act which can neither be overlooked nor tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, defectors are human scum who were deserted even by home folks and kinsmen being branded as elements subject to legal punishment in the clean society in the DPRK for their crimes of murder, robbery, pilferage, embezzlement of state properties and corruptions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans also know this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south Korean authorities try to escalate confrontation with the DPRK by using them and the U.S. seeks to overthrow the social system in the DPRK in reliance on them. This proves the poor plight of the Park Geun Hye regime and the U.S. politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the present puppet authorities of south Korea which seek to fan up confrontation wind despite their loud-mouthed ballad for \"confidence\" and \"dialogue\". And it is the U.S. which moves overtly and covertly to topple the social system in the DPRK despite its stereo-typed call for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the puppet group of south Korea may try being gripped in extreme uneasiness and horror, they can never prolong their dirty remaining days. The U.S. which tries to attain its aggression aim in reliance on the group is bound to face bankruptcy in its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The National Defence Commission of the DPRK on June 16 warned that all the future developments depend on the U.S. responsible option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are strongly calling for punishing those human scum as early as possible as they are going hysteric as servants escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, far from trying to redress their crime-woven past with death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are daily requests from home folks and kinsmen of those defectors asking to let them kill human scum with their own hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ministry of People's Security of the DPRK, reflecting the grudge of all its service personnel and people, is determined to take substantial measures to physically remove despicable human scum who are committing treasons at the instigation of the south Korean puppet authorities and the gangster-like U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sordid human scum will never be able to look up to the sky nor be able to find an inch of land to be buried after their death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. and the south Korean authorities and wicked conservative media resorting to smear campaign against the DPRK in reliance on them will be made to meet merciless punishment of justice."
