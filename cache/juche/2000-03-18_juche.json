Korean trip of Japanese military boss blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- Yuji Fujinawa, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff of Japan \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF), during his South Korean tour was closeted together with the \"chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\" of South Korea, the \"Minister of National Defense\" and other brass-hats over the \"military situation in North Korea\" and agreed to strengthen military cooperation between Japan and South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Denouncing this, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many Japanese military bosses have so far visited South Korea to discuss military issues with its authorities and clamored about cooperation between them. But, it was something rare that no sooner had he flown into South Korea than he inspected a forefront area along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL), fanning up north-south confrontation and laying bare Japan's intention for re-conquest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are watching for a chance to open fire for reinvasion, the commentary describes Fujinawa's South Korean trip and his \"inspection\" of the MDL area as part of such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no doubt that while looking over to the north side from the MDL, his ambition to stage a comeback to Korea and his will to realise it at any cost Korea stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits serious attention is that his visit was timed to coincide with the anti-DPRK campaign the Japanese ultra right reactionaries launched, crying out for  \"destroying  North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean junket of the \"SDF\" military boss intended to escalate inter-Korean confrontation and step up the moves for reinvasion came at a time when the issue of improving the relations between Japan and the DPRK is high on the agenda. This cannot but be a very serious development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to drop their anachronistic wild dream and behave themselves. \r\n\r\n"
