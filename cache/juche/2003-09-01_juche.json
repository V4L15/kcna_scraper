Such espionage was conducted from about 21:00 on August 13 to about 01:00 on August 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, 11 RC-12 and RC-7B tactical reconnaissance planes continued to fly in the sky above the Military Demarcation Line day and night on August 26, 8 each on August 8 and 25 and 7 each on August 5 and 22 to spy on the front line of the north and the major objects in the east and west coastal areas.    \r\n\r\n"

That conforms to the desire of the world people for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. advertises that it has no intention to invade and attack the DPRK. If it is true, there is no reason whatsoever for the U.S. not to make a radical switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mode of \"security assurances\" without legal guarantee, does not mean a switchover in the hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the U.S. makes a bold decision to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and conclude a non-aggression treaty through the six-way talks, is it possible to settle the issue and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. does not want to do so, the nuclear issue will never be settled any time but result in irrevocable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be aware of the essence of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and make a political decision to drop the hostile policy toward the DPRK at an early date.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry on Six-way Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK today answered a question put by KCNA as regards the six-way talks held in Beijing.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the six-way talks on the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. took place in Beijing from August 27 to 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks were a product of the utmost magnanimity and good faith shown by the DPRK prompted by its will to seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from its principled stand to fundamentally settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, the DPRK took an initiative of proposing to hold the six-way talks, not sticking to any format of dialogue. At the recent talks, too, the DPRK made clear its consistent stand on the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and set out reasonable and comprehensive ways to realize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite our good faith and magnanimity the U.S., however, took a more hard-line stand and raised undisguised brigandish demands worse than its repeated call for the DPRK's \"abandonment of its nuclear weapons program first,\" far from showing its will to renounce hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. asserted that it can discuss the issue of the DPRK's concerns only when it takes a practical action to physically dismantle the \"nuclear weapons program\" in a verifiable and irreversible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the bilateral contact made between the DPRK and the U.S. on the sidelines of the six-way talks the U.S. flatly denied a package solution and the order of simultaneous actions proposed by the DPRK to attain its goal of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula, but made such assertions that a full range of other issues of concerns including missiles, conventional weapons and human rights should be discussed for the normalization of relationship between the DPRK and the U.S. only after its \"nuclear program\" is scrapped. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means the U.S. asking the DPRK drop its gun first, saying it would not open fire, when both sides are leveling guns at each other. How can the DPRK trust the U.S. and drop its gun?  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even a child would not be taken in by such a trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What we want is for both sides to drop guns at the same time and co-exist peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is insisting for no reason that it would think about it only after the DPRK drops its gun first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only convinced the DPRK of the fact that the U.S. has neither willingness to improve relations with the DPRK nor any intention to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK and does not want to co-exist with the DPRK in peace but seeks its invariable sinister aim to totally disarm the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks, therefore, were reduced to armchair argument quite contrary to our expectation and offered only an occasion of demanding the DPRK disarm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This made it impossible for the DPRK to have any interest or expectation for the talks as they are not beneficial to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks only reinforced our confidence that there is no other option for us but to further increase the nuclear deterrent force as a self-defensive measure to protect our sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
