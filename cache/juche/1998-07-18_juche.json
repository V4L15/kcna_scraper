And he had better go to U.S. military camp side towns in South Korea and see how the \"model of human rights\" has been displayed by GIs in brothels.    \r\n \r\n"

Worse still, it says that it will push ahead with inter-Korean dialogue, which is the internal affair of the nation, through \"sincere discussions with outsiders,\" including the United States and Japan, and that the military presence of the U.S. should continue in the south of Korea even after the reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

It is what United States promised and what it is obliged to do.\r\n   The United States should know that if it fails to keep its promise, we will take another choice.\r\n   Our final decision depends on the U.S. future attitude.\r\n   If the agreement is left without any real meaning and the project is delayed, we cannot but reconsider the building of our own nuclear power industry.\r\n   If then, the responsibility for all the consequencies will rest with the United States.    \r\n\r\n"

And they put iron netting on entrances to shelters, pillboxes and pit to shut out handgrenades. A mine field was formed 25-30 metres from the trenches and wire entanglements were put  threefold at 3-5 metre intervals within and without. They called it an \"impregnable fortress.\"\r\n   Units of our army started an attack on the height with volleys of artillery pieces on June 2, Juche 42 (1953). The \"fortress\" built by the enemy for over two years was captured only in fifteen minutes.\r\n   The enemy persistently attacked to retake the height with the support of flying corps, ground artillery pieces, guns of warships, etc. Everything was burnt and  not a rock remained intact.\r\n  When soldiers of the people's army ran out of ammunition in the fierce battle, they fought hand-to-hand fight. \r\n   Wounded soldiers ran into the enemy with handgrenades between their teeth.\r\n   They frustrated dozens of tenacious attacks of the enemy a day  by displaying mass heroism and self-sacrifice and defended the height of the country to the end.\r\n   22 heroes of the republic including Kim In Thaek and Kim Ryong Thaek were produced in the battles to recapture and defend the height.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
