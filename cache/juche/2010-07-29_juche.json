The ranks of the Korean women rallied around her have grown to be the ranks of loyalists of Kim Jong Suk type and the large contingents of the woman revolutionaries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean women are not only the leader's revolutionary comrades sharing the purpose and destiny with him but dynamic and resourceful ones carrying out half of the country's affairs as well as flowers of the revolution and flowers of the country possessed of the most beautiful and noblest traits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The destiny of the Korean women in the 21st century is guaranteed by the ever-victorious leadership provided by Kim Jong Il.

Korea Moves to Provoke Nuclear War Flailed\r\n Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- Choe Su Bong, vice-chairman of the General Association of Koreans in China, in a statement on July 25 said whoever wants the peace and reunification of the country should turn out as one in the struggle to check and frustrate the moves of the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea to ignite a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement referred to the fact that the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers finally kicked off the large-scale joint naval exercises in the East Sea of Korea aimed at mounting a preemptive strike at the DPRK under the pretext of the case of warship \"Cheonan's\" sinking, defying the strong domestic and foreign opposition and denunciation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It noted that not only the said exercises but the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises slated to be staged in mid-August and other war maneuvers to be launched one after another till the end of this year are the largest-ever joint military exercises far surpassing the preceding ones and mock drills simulating the second Korean war which would inflict unheard-of nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going nuclear war exercises are by no means \"demonstration of armed forces of defensive nature\" to deter someone's \"threat\" but war maneuvers for aggression targeted against the DPRK from A to Z, the statement said, stressing that traitor Lee Myung Bak can never evade curses and denunciation by fellow countrymen for all ages for his crimes of having taken the lead in escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, while acting a shock brigade for nuclear war maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General Association of Koreans in China and all the Koreans in China bitterly oppose and reject the moves of the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak puppet group for escalated confrontation with fellow countrymen and war racket for invading the DPRK and will wage more dynamic struggle to defend peace against the U.S. and war, it noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Federation of Koreans in the U.S. also issued a statement on July 23 denouncing the reckless military provocation moves of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers."

Para ese efecto, toma el camino de reorganizar y reubicar las unidades militares y realizar el aligeramiento y alta eficiencia de las armas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, habla tanto de algun cambio en el dominio de reduccion armamentista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Debido al aumento armamentista y la modernizacion de las armas de EE.UU. se fomenta la carrera armamentista y se crea el nuevo peligro de guerra a escala mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad demanda que los paises progresistas del mundo redoblen la vigilancia sobre la enganosa \"reduccion armamentista\" de EE.UU. y se dispongan estrictamente de los preparativos de contramedida militar frente a ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En los ultimos dias, el portaaviones militar y otras fuerzas armadas de golpe estrategico de EE.UU. armaron una campana belica en el Sur de Corea y su contorno llevando la situacion al borde de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La peor situacion de la Peninsula Coreana  prueba fehacientemente cuan justa fue la medida de la RPDC: en el pasado presto atencion al fortalecimiento del poderio de defensa nacional."
