However, they feigned ignorance of this and when the fact was brought to light, they are working hard to mislead public opinion by creating impression that the notice of the DPRK was an unofficial one, talking about \"verbal mention.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the DPRK formally announced its decision to send to the 17th Asian Games slated to take place in Inchon, south Korea the players group and a large cheerleading squad of 350 persons and stepped up the preparations for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the DPRK made public its decision to send the cheerleading squad, the south Korean puppet authorities and conservative forces let loose such sheer sophism as \"it is a group for political operation in the south\", \"it is a group for political propaganda from the Workers' Party of Korea\" and \"it will create discord in the south\" and slandered it with such unspeakable vitriol as \"double-dealing tactics of reconciliation and war\" and \"strategy of using beauties.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thrown into consternation by the great sensation created in south Korea by the news of the dispatch of the DPRK's cheerleading squad, the puppet forces let their paid trumpeters run the whole gamut of invectives that south Korean public attention would focus on the cheerleading squad and then it would be like putting the cart before the horse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities' wrong attitude towards the DPRK's decision to send the cheerleading squad found a clearer manifestation at the north-south working-level talks held on July 17 for its participation in the 17th Asian Games. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was compelled to give up the decision to send the cheerleading squad as they desperately decried its decision, far from rejoicing over and welcoming its sincerity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said facts go to clearly  prove that the south Korean puppet forces are abusing sacred sports and cultural exchange for their sinister political purpose and confrontation with the fellow countrymen  and are chiefly to blame for blocking national reconciliation and unity and the process to improve the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no subterfuge can the puppet forces justify their action taken for barring the cheerleading squad of the DPRK from taking part in the Inchon Asian Games."

Sin embargo, la camarilla titere no hablo nada de ello. Y cuando se ha revelado la verdad, intenta inducir en error la opinion publica como si no fuera oficial el \"aviso oral\" de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, publicamos  oficialmente que enviariamos a los jugadores y el grupo de hinchas compuesto por 350 personas a los XVII Juegos Asiaticos que se efectuaran en Inchon del Sur de Corea y hemos venido acelerando sus preparativos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, tan pronto como se publicara ese aviso, las autoridades y fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas lo calumniaron como \"tactica de dos caras: amistad y guerra\" y \"seduccion por mujeres bellas\", calificando el grupo de hinchas de \"grupo de trabajo politico en el Sur de Corea\" y \"grupo de propaganda politica enviado por el Partido del Trabajo\" y hablando de la \"creacion de discordia entre personas surcoreanas\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY muy aturdidas ante las grandes repercusiones producidas en suelo surcoreano por la noticia sobre el envio de nuestro grupo de hinchas, instigaron a los trompeteros venales a soltar las maldiciones de toda indole tales como \"el grupo de hinchas de la parte Norte atraera la atencion y se alterara el anfitrion y el convidado\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa malsana actitud de las autoridades surcoreanas en cuanto al envio de nuestro grupo de hinchas se puso al desnudo en las conversaciones de trabajo Norte-Sur efectuadas el 17 de julio pasado para discutir la participacion de nuestra parte en los XVII Juegos Asiaticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que los titeres surcoreanos insultan tanto la sinceridad de la parte connacional, lejos de aplaudirla y aceptarla, nos vemos obligados a suspender el envio del grupo de hinchas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, se ha revelado claramente que los titeres surcoreanos malemplean el intercambio deportivo y cultural en sus designios politicos malintencionados y el enfrentamiento fratricida e impiden la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales y la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no pueden justificar con nada su culpa por haber impedido la participacion del grupo de hinchas de la parte Norte de Corea en los Juegos Asiaticos de Inchon."
