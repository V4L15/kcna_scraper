            "content": "Lie about Beijing Secret Contact Spread by Lee Myung Bak Group Refuted\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors let a spokesman for Chongwadae make an official announcement that the \"true intention\" reflected in Lee's \"Berlin proposal\" was conveyed to the DPRK side at a secret contact made between the north and the south of Korea in Beijing.  It had been already disclosed before the world that it was a sheer lie. \n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the first announcement made by the DPRK, the group of traitors falsified the fact, claiming that there was a secret contact with the DPRK but it was a contact not aimed to have \"summit talks\" but wrest \"the north's admittance and apology\" for \"the Cheonan\" warship sinking case and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident. It went the lengths of denying all facts that had been brought to light and negating and distorting them without any ground and sidestepping all issues. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with it, the group orchestrated a new farce pulling up the DPRK with another lie that the \"accounts \" of the secret contact were misrepresented  by the spokesman for the National Defence Commission of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The delegate of the Policy Department of the NDC who participated in the contact gave the following answers to the questions raised by KCNA reporter on Thursday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already opened to the public, the group of traitors came out to the north-south secret contact, prompted by a foolish intention to shirk the responsibility for the total collapse of the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the DPRK was well aware of the group's inveterate rejection of fellow countrymen and its true nature of confrontation hysteria. But when the south side repeatedly proposed having a secret contact while clarifying its stand that \"it would no longer pick up the above-said two cases,\" the DPRK responded to it with the thought that it would not be bad to finally confirm, availing itself of the opportunity, whether it has a will to improve the inter-Korean relations and jointly pave the way for independent reunification, peace and prosperity or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the attitude of the group manifested in the course of the secret contact proved that it sought only one sinister aim: to evade the responsibility for having driven the inter-Korean relations to collapse and create an environment favorable for \"presidential\" and \"national assembly\" elections to be held next year, indifferent to the requirements of the era and the desire of the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation, cooperation, peace and detente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example of its moves was the perfidy committed by the group. It behaved so recklessly as opening to the public before any others the misrepresented accounts of the secret contact. Not content with this, the group played jugglery of persistently evading the blame for what it said and did against the nation in the course of the contact and denying them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to cite specific facts to prove once again how nonsensically the group of traitors uttered. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To begin with, the group's assertion that the already disclosed contact was not aimed to open \"summit talks\" was a sheer lie. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to quote what Kim Chon Sik, policy room chief of the puppet Ministry of Unification, uttered at the contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as he met us, he hyped the \"meaning\" of the recent contact, reminding us that the contact was provided by the direct instruction and \"approval\" of the \"president\" for the purpose of opening \"summit talks\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that Hyon In Thaek, minister of Unification, was directly supervising the whole course of the contact and reporting about it to Chongwadae through an exclusive line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Chon Sik emphasized the fact that the contact was different from the secret contacts the secretariat of the \"president\" and the Intelligence Service had, independent of the above-said ministry in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly requested the DPRK side to keep all the accounts of the contact in secrecy till the contact proved successful as the contact was treated as a top secret known only to Lee Myung Bak, Hyon In Thaek, the chief of the Intelligence Service, the chief of the Secretariat of the President and those who were dispatched to it and if this was known to the south Korean society, it would be very bad because of its peculiarities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next, the south side's insistence that it neither put forth any compromise proposal regarding \"apology\" nor begged for it was a shameful excuse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This moment, too, we clearly remember the words of the south side that the above-said two cases are the two \"mountains to be crossed with wisdom\" for improving the inter-Korean relations, describing them as an instruction from Hyon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When it raised the issue of \"apology,\" while talking about \"feelings of the south\" towards the \"Cheonan\" warship case only to meet a prompt rebuff from our side at the contact, the south side yielded a step and asked the DPRK side to make even a compromise proposal which cannot be interpreted as \"apology\" when viewed by the north side but viewed by the south side as \"apology.\" Finding this not workable, the south side said if the north side expresses \"regret\" at least, the south side would accept it as \"apology\" and roll back its policy of confrontation pursued so far and even the \"summit talks\" could be rapidly pushed forward.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our side explicitly told the south side as follows: To wrest \"apology\" from us for the case we had nothing to do with and for the exercise of its legitimate sovereignty is an insult to the DPRK and a manifestation of the south side's sinister intention to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK. You'd better go back to Seoul at once as such secret contact is unnecessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group was so pitiful and cowardly as to ask the DPRK side to \"make a clear concession\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next, the south side's assertion that it never proposed \"summit talks\" according to schedule nor can it make its proposal is far-fetched sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs regards this, Kim Thae Hyo, presidential secretary for Foreign Strategy of Chongwadae secretariat, might clearly say about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the contact came to a rupture without reaching any agreement between both sides due to the south side's unreasonable insistence quite contrary to the principled and logical assertion of our side, Kim Thae Hyo produced a program he claimed was worked out in reflection of the \"intention of the 'president',\" saying the \"summit talks\" should be opened without fail and the present authorities are pressed for time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was the timetable for holding secret contact once again in Malaysia and then opening ministerial talks before having \"summit talks\" at Panmunjom in June, in Pyongyang in August and Seoul in March next year when the \"summit for nuclear safety\" would be held.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side retorted the south side's assertion, saying what is the use of having such timetable under the present situation where no agreement has been reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Thae Hyo must remember this well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Can the south side deny the truth, insisting it never made such proposal though it unilaterally produced the above-said timetable that specified the dates and venues of such \"summit talks\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is ridiculous for the group to plead as nonsense the fact that enveloped money was offered only to be shamed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fact can be confirmed through Kim Thae Hyo, presidential secretary for external strategy of the Chongwadae Secretariat, and Hong Chang Hwa, department director of the Intelligence Service, who were playing the leading role of the enveloped money case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the contact was on the verge of a rupture, Hong Chang Hwa took out enveloped money from a suitcase at the order of Kim Thae Hyo, who was going to give it to us. We rejected it at once, and Kim blushed and got irritated. Hong hurriedly put the money into the suitcase in an awkward movement and left without exchanging proper parting words with our delegates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At first the group of traitors asserted that there was no case of enveloped money. But now it distorts the fact by claiming that the money was for expenses to be paid traditionally by the sponsor of contact rather than \"reward\" for leading the contact to \"summit talks\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  If it is usage for a party sponsoring any talks to pay necessary expenses as asserted by the south side, why didn't the south side present the enveloped money at the time of the two preceding rounds of contact?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side was well aware that the DPRK embassy provided lodging and boarding and vehicles. Then, was it going to pay the embassy the said enveloped money for living expenses during its stay?  Its far-fetched assertion has gone far.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The money envelope case will be recorded as another behind-the-scene story in the history of the north-south relations as it was a brainchild of such feebleminded traitor as Lee Myung Bak and his top-class servants who are accustomed to assessing everything based on the almighty dollar idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK already knew that the group of traitors is made up of master-hands at fabrication.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason why the DPRK recounts on the secret contact is that the group is now faking up new stories, not content with falsifying the truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak is now letting puppet Prime Minister Kim Hwang Sik who has been kept in the dark about the contact, far from being involved in it say this or that.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, puppet Minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek who engineered the contact has had hard time, distorting the truth and covering up his true colors as a vicious mastermind in an official appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are keeping the participants in the contact in complete isolation from the outer world, holding them incommunicado. And Lee Myung Bak, prime mover of the contact, is keeping mum about it in a bid to prevent the greater effect of the case, out of a fear that \"any word out of the president might trigger strong earthquake or tsunami at the moment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We want to tell those who are anxious to know about the contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t You had better directly ask Lee Myung Bak who instructed officials to hold contact and \"approved\" it. Then you will understand everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And please ask Hyon In Thaek who masterminded the whole course of the contact behind the scene. Then you will have the whole story of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be better to inquire Kim Thae Hyo, Kim Chon Sik and Hong Chang Hwa, participants in the contact, for more details. Then everything will become clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should they continue to decline to reveal the truth and deceive their fellow countrymen and hatch plots, the DPRK will have no other choice but to make public the tape recording the whole course of the contact before the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason why the DPRK takes such measures is that the north-south relations are the most important issue common to the nation and that those measures are aimed to save the policy for fellow countrymen from being abused by some selfish traitors and to make it completely serve the interests of the popular masses, the maker of the policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time will irrefutably prove the nature of the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors as betes noires who had been so brazenfaced as to make the mockery of the nation through falsity and deception, being keen on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors would be well advised to make a clean breast of the contact before it becomes too late."

This brought all Koreans and the whole world into great shock, enthusiasm, cheers and admiration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 event and consequently the amazing development of the north-south relations showed that there is nothing impossible to do on earth when the Koreans join their hands and that the Korean nation can successfully break the walls of confrontation and division and achieve peace and reunification on its own efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, 2007 saw another north-south summit and the adoption of the October 4 declaration amid the lasting heat of the June 15 event. This stirring event fully displayed the Korean nation's reserved strength and wisdom and its fixed will to usher in the era of peace, reunification and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Immense is the effect of the June 15 event on the Koreans' movement for national reunification and the north-south relations and the internal and external situation, and its undying feat will remain long in the history of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If this trend of the June 15 era had continued to go without obstruction of the separatists, the north and the south would have made bigger strides in their relationship, further consolidating the foundation for peace in the Korean Peninsula and moving up the day of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the present reality is very serious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The results of the June 15 event were ruthlessly spoiled and the north-south relations have been driven to the furthest extreme of confrontation and rupture, the state that can be no longer redressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June 11 years ago when the historic north-south summit took place, all Koreans and the whole world burst into cheers, calling it a dramatic handshake and an event of touching the hearts of seventy million Koreans and saying that the door to reunification is open. But, the then deep emotion and excitement can be hardly felt in this land, where there is a raging wind of confrontation between fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day of national reunification the Korean expected to see soon was far delayed, and the crisis of nuclear war is coming nearer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Why did the north-south relations go back to the past of confrontation to be driven into collapse?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is entirely because the south Korean conservative regime has totally denied the historic June 15 joint declaration and resorted to moves to escalate the confrontation and ignite a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fellow countrymen are now stunned by the fact that all the shining achievements made by all Koreans in the efforts for independence, democracy and reunification through a protracted bloody struggle were brought to naught by the group of traitors in a matter of little more than three years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling authorities denied and trampled down the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the basic spirit of the joint declaration, thus destroying the groundwork and the fundamental cornerstone of the inter-Korean relations, first of all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea calls for independently settling the national issue and the reunification issue by the concerted efforts of the Koreans in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by pure patriotism, this idea does not force the ism and ideology of any party on any other party and, moreover, it has nothing to do with such narrow-minded view as one party excluding the other party or breaking with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This idea does not mean excluding the chief executive for a lot of crimes committed in the past and ostracizing the conservative forces such as the \"Grand National Party\". It calls for respecting foreign relations but asserts that they should be beneficial to the national interests, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not bad but good for everybody to advance, joining hands with one another for reunification that would enable all the classes and strata in the north and the south to live well in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why all Koreans unanimously supported and approved of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and even the chief executive of south Korea expressed sympathy with it and signed the declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present puppet conservative group of south Korea malignantly defiled for no reason the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the idea of reunification common to the nation, as the \"north's strategy\" from the outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Furthermore, it declared that it would subordinate the inter-Korean relations to those with foreign forces and responded to it by rolling up its sleeves to boost them as servants for the U.S. colonial domination and the execution of its policy of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that Lee Myung Bak accepted whatever requested by his American master, totally subservient to him, claiming that everything would be OK if south Korea maintained good relations with the U.S., totally indifferent to the destiny of the nation and the deteriorated inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He extremely antagonized his compatriots and sold off the interests of the nation to his master lock, stock and barrel. Not content with this, he made the inter-Korean relations fall victim to the U.S. policy of war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He claimed that the greatest achievement made under his rule was the restoration of the south Korea-U.S. alliance. He went the lengths of talking nonsense that the inter-Korean relations were put on a \"normal orbit\" though they were thrown into catastrophe. His reckless remarks eloquently prove his heinous sycophancy toward the U.S. and his consciousness of opposing reunification and pursuing confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the ill-famed \"Yusin regime\" talked about \"national independence\" and the \"civilian government,\" too, asserted that the \"nation should be placed above the ally, though it was hypocrisy. But Lee begged his master to delay the transfer of the right to control wartime operations of the puppet army despite the fact that the preceding regime tried to regain it under the slogan of \"self-reliant defense\". He zealously followed the nuclear racket and sanctions against the DPRK, blustering that he \"would handle the inter-Korean relations in the relationship with the U.S.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group disallowed even the use of word \"nation\" in official speeches and documents and ordered officials to change it into \"people\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the successive south Korean rulers cried out for boosting the alliance with the U.S. and pursued the policy of toeing the U.S. line but the Lee group was the first group of wicked sycophants and traitors to have put foreign forces above the nation, openly adopted priority to foreign forces as a policy and disallowed even the use of word \"nation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling authorities denied the national reconciliation, unity and reunification contrary to the spirit and requirements of the June 15 joint declaration, and desperately pursued the moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and that of the systems, thus creating extreme distrust between the north and the south and rendering the inter-Korean relations extremely hostile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If national reconciliation, unity and peaceful reunification are to be achieved, it is necessary to recognize and respect the other's ideology and system, revitalize dialogue and negotiations and head for reunification by federal formula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the basic content, basic requirements of the three principles for national reunification and the joint declaration embodying them and the basic principle of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Lee Myung Bak group totally denied this important principled requirement and blatantly challenged it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of separatists dared defile the system of the other party. It not only kicked up a disturbing confrontation row while talking about \"change\", \"opening\" and \"human rights\" but has persistently worked to realize its wild ambition for \"unification through absorption\" on the basis of the imported experience of other country's unification while vociferating about \"unification under liberal democracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the puppet group that scuttled overnight brisk multi-channeled dialogues which had been under way since the publication of the joint declaration. It was again this clique of traitors that threw bigger hurdles in the way of dialogue by putting up such preconditions as the nuclear issue and what it called \"apology\" and it was also the puppet authorities who brought to rupture even the dialogues opened thanks to the positive efforts of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tour of Mt. Kumgang which delighted the whole nation was totally suspended, the Kaesong Industrial Zone was hit hard and exchange, contact and cooperation of NGOs were scuttled due to the confrontation moves of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There disappeared whistles of trains for reunification on the railways linking the north and the south which excited all the Koreans so much, and loud shouts of hurrah for reunification which had resounded forth in Pyongyang and Seoul and on Mt. Paektu and Mt. Hanna are no longer heard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group eagerly wishes to see something take place inside the DPRK while talking about \"waiting strategy\" and \"snail's pace\". This is as foolish and stupid a dream as expecting the sun to fall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the Lee group dares make a mockery of the highest-level dialogue, there is no reason to discuss what it called dialogue between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is 40 years since the inter-Korean dialogue started. A lot of official and unofficial dialogue and secret contacts took place between the two sides and several special envoys visited the north and the south in this period. But there was no such vicious anti-reunification group as the Lee group that hurt the dignity of the other party and defiled its sincerity and frantically hatched plots and pursued confrontation with sinister aims.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling authorities perpetrated military provocations and pursued war moves against fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces, challenging the historic June 15 joint declaration. They thus brought the crisis on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it, clarify the issues of putting an end to the military hostile relations between the north and the south, fulfilling the commitment to non-aggression, preventing a war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the Lee Myung Bak conservative group come to power than threw away the inter-Korean declarations and got frantic with military provocations and maneuvers for a war of aggression on the DPRK after declaring the north as its principal enemy, not as fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, it staged exercises under the simulated conditions of a real war after working out such conspiratorial scenarios as \"emergency ruling plan\" and the like, obsessed by the ambition to cope with \"contingency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Outbursts calling for preemptive attack are heard from among the puppet military warmongers and a whole string of jargons that \"one should not fear a war\" are let loose even by the puppet chief executive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warship sinking case and the Yonphyong Island shelling case, the hideous conspiratorial farces that occurred last year and the war hysteria kicked up under this pretext fully revealed the reckless and belligerent nature of the puppet group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet military warmongers committed such thrice-cursed hideous provocation as setting up the target daring hurt the supreme dignity of the DPRK and firing at it. This is the height of the moves to bring the inter-Korean relations to collapse as it is the most barbarous and cruel act in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite self-evident that such tyrannical hooligans as the puppet group which no longer wants to remain human beings from the outset, much less being members of the same nation, can neither become a counterpart of the inter-Korean dialogue for discussing a crucial matter of the nation nor remain part of the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the south Korean ruling authorities are entirely to blame for the present catastrophic inter-Korean relations as they violated and stamped out the June 15 joint declaration and resorted to vicious moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that as long as the anti-reunification group of south Korea is allowed to stay it is impossible to expect a smooth advance of the June 15 era and achieve peace and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very deplorable that the June 15 joint declaration is flouted by a handful of anti-reunification elements like the group of traitors and the fellow countrymen's movement for national reunification is delayed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present acute situation in which the confrontation between pro-reunification forces and the anti-reunification forces has reached the climax makes the people keenly realize how good the June 15 era was and how dear it was. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why broad circles of south Korea together with all other fellow countrymen are turning out as one in the drive to punish and overthrow the Lee Myung Bak regime under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration, unable to repress the towering indignation at the puppet group's anti-reunification and confrontation moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group is making desperate efforts to get rid of the position where it is attacked from all sides but this only precipitates its disgraceful destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The significance and influence of the historic June 15 joint declaration, which is deeply enshrined in the minds of all the Korean people and whose truth, viability, validity and vitality have been fully confirmed, do not get weakened due to any obstruction on the part of the group of traitors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the contrary, the present reality teaches a bitter lesson that the achievements made after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration can never be lost but hardens the will and resolution of the Korean nation to accomplish the June 15 cause without fail. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans will declare a miserable end to the south Korean group of separatists and certainly bring back the June 15 era as they keenly realize the value of the June 15 joint declaration and pin their hope on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They see the Korean nation's future, independence, peace, reunification and prosperity in the June 15 joint declaration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans will make a clean sweep of the group of wicked sycophants, traitors and separatists and successfully carry forward with pride the June 15 historic cause and thus demonstrate their spirit once again. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nobody on earth can stem the strong trend of the June 15 era."

            "content": "Funcionario del CDN revela la verdad del contacto secreto en Beijing \r\nPyongyang, 9 de junio (ATCC) -- La camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak publicó oficialmente por conducto del portavoz de Chongwadae (Casa Azul) como si la parte Sur hubiera convencido a la parte Norte la \"verdadera intención\" de la llamada \"propuesta de Berlín\" durante el reciente contacto secreto N-S de Beijing.\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, todo el mundo conoció que eso es una mentira pura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespués de publicada nuestra primera declaración sobre ese tema, los compinches de Lee se apresuraron a mentir que si bien hubo el contacto secreto, no fue para la 'cumbre' sino para obtener el \"reconocimiento y la disculpa\" de la RPDC por el incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana 'Cheonan' y el de fuego artillero en la isla Yonphyong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, negaron todos los hechos ya revelados tratando de \"tergiversarlos\" y \"evadirlos totalmente\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, vuelven a acusar a la RPDC inventando otros embustes como si el portavoz de nuestro CDN hubiera \"invertido\" el contenido del contacto secreto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho demuestra que la camarilla del traidor Lee no está todavía en sano juicio y pretende engañar a la opinión pública con sus artimañas mal ideadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el delegado del Departamento Político del CDN de la RPDC, quien había participado en el contacto secreto, dieron el día 9 la siguiente respuesta a la ATCC:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se dio al conocimiento del mundo, la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak se presentó en el contacto secreto Norte-Sur con el necio intento de evadir la responsabilidad por haber llevado al fracaso las relaciones íntercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConocíamos de sobra el acostumbrado veto a la connacional RPDC y la fiebre conflictiva de esa camarilla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, dado que la parte surcoreana propuso en reiteradas ocasiones el contacto a puerta cerrada aclarando la posición de no \"cuestionar más\" el caso de \"Cheonan\" y el de la isla Yonphyong, lo aceptamos pensando que no sería mal aprovechar esa ocasión para averiguar finalmente si la parte Sur tiene o no la voluntad de mejorar las relaciones íntercoreanas y marchar juntos por la reunificación independiente, la paz y la prosperidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la actitud de los traidores surcoreanos manifestada en el contacto comprobó que ellos no tomaban en consideración la demanda de la época ni la aspiración nacional a la reconciliación y cooperación nacionales, la paz y al alivio de la tensión, sino estuvieron concentrados en alcanzar su siniestro objetivo de preparar el ambiente favorable a las elecciones presidenciales y las parlamentarias, que se efectuarán en el año próximo, al liberarse de la responsabilidad por la ruptura de relaciones íntercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn buen ejemplo de ello es la alevosía de ellos de publicar primero los tergiversados detalles del contacto secreto. Como si eso fuera poco, evaden y niegan sus dichos antinacionales pronunciados en el contacto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Volveremos a aclarar citando hechos cuán absurdo es lo que dice la banda surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primero, es una mentira pura el dicho de ella de que el contacto secreto no tuvo por su objetivo la preparación de la apertura de la \"cumbre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Habría que recordar lo que nos dijo Kim Chon Sik, jefe del gabinete de política del Ministerio de Reunificación títere del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tan pronto como se reuniera con nosotros, él ha resaltado el \"significado\" del contacto diciendo que esta cita se ha preparado por la indicación directa  y la \"aprobación\" del \"presidente\" (surcoreano) para abrir la \"cumbre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Agregó que el ministro títere de Reunificación Hyon In Thaek controla directamente todo el proceso del contacto e informa sus circunstancias a Chongwadae  por una línea exclusiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Subrayó que el presente contacto es distinto a los anteriores que sostenían la oficina de los secretarios de Chongwadae y el Servicio de Inteligencia excluyendo al Ministerio de Reunificación.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Dijo que el contacto es un supersecreto que conocen sólo Lee Myung Bak, Hyon In Thaek, el presidente del Servicio de Inteligencia, el jefe del gabinete de los secretarios de la \"Presidencia\" y los enviados al contacto secreto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPidió varias veces que guardáramos en secreto todos los contenidos del contacto hasta que se abra la \"cumbre\", arguyendo que la publicación de ellas tendría muchos inconvenientes en la complicada sociedad surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, se trata de una excusa bochornosa insistir en que esa banda no ha planteado el proyecto conciliatorio de la \"disculpa\" ni la ha suplicado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este momento, viene a nuestra memoria lo que nos dijeron ellos citando a Hyon In Thaek: los dos incidentes referidos son una \"montaña a atravesar con inteligencia\" para mejorar las relaciones S-N.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la mesa del contacto ellos suplicaron la \"concesión\" del Norte sobre el incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana hablando del \"sentimiento del Sur de Corea\". Al tropezar con el rechazo inmediato de nuestra parte, comenzaron a proponer una \"variante conciliatoria que no signifique 'disculpa' para el Norte, pero sí la parezca para el Sur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando nuestra parte la ha negado también, ellos nos dijeron que si el Norte expresa por lo menos la lástima sobre los incidentes, la aceptarían como \"disculpa\", abolirían la política de confrontación mantenida hasta ahora y promoverían rápido los preparativos de la \"cumbre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, les dejamos en claro nuestra posición: tratar de conseguir la \"disculpa\" sobre los incidentes enajenados de la RPDC y el ejercicio de nuestro legítimo derecho a la autodefensa deviene una muestra de ánimo conflictivo e insulto a la RPDC. No necesitamos un contacto como éste y así que regresen ahora mismo a Seúl.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, tomaron una postura tan miserable y baja suplicándonos así: \"Por favor, háganos una concesión\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Esta verdad no podrá refutar nadie por muy elocuente que fuera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tercero, es una insistencia absurda decir que ellos no han propuesto ni pueden proponer los programas de la \"cumbre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa respuesta de eso la podría dar Kim Thae Hyo, secretario jefe por la estrategia exterior de la oficina de los secretarios de Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el contacto llegaba al fracaso sin dar ningún acuerdo bilateral debido a las injustas insistencias de ellos que contravienen a nuestras justas opiniones de principios, Kim Thae Hyo nos presentó la agenda trazada reflejando la \"intención\" del \"presidente\" apuntando que la \"cumbre\" debe abrirse sin falta y las actuales autoridades no tienen tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa agenda proponía otro contacto secreto en Malaysia y presentaba el horario de la \"cumbre\" que incluía convocar las conversaciones ministeriales, y luego tener el encuentro de las cumbres en junio en Phanmunjom, en agosto en Pyongyang y en marzo del próximo año en Seúl cuando se realizará la \"cumbre de seguridad nuclear\", sucesivamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe refutamos preguntándole por qué hace falta ese cronograma si en el contacto no se ha logrado ningún acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Thae Hyo también recordaría bien nuestras palabras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t¿Será posible que ellos eludan decir la verdad aunque insisten ahora que no nos han planteado ese horario de la \"cumbre\" elaborado unilateralmente fijando hasta la fecha y el lugar?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuarto, es ridículo que ellos dijeran ahora que no han pasado la pena mientras trataban de sobornarnos con el sobre de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Thae Hyo y Hong Chang Hwa, director de departamento del Servicio de Inteligencia, son los autores principales del incidente del sobre de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando el contacto llegaba a la ruptura, Hong sacó de su maleta un sobre de dinero siguiendo a la indicación de Kim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim lo tomó y trató de ponerlo en nuestras manos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando lo hemos botado en el acto, Kim se puso colorado sin saber qué hacer y Hong volvió a meterlo en su maleta con movimientos incómodos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsí no pudieron intercambiar debidamente el saludo de despedida con nosotros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda del traidor Lee insistía al principio en que no ha sacado el sobre de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY ahora tergiversa el hecho diciendo que ese dinero no se trata del soborno para orientar el contacto secreto a la realización de la \"cumbre\" sino para pagar los gastos según la costumbre de que la parte que tomó la iniciativa del contacto debe pagar los gastos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi eso fuera verdad, ¿por qué ellos sacaron el sobre en la última jornada del contacto, cuando se hizo evidente la ruptura del mismo, y no lo hicieron en las anteriores dos jornadas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemás, ellos sabían que la embajada de la RPDC cubrió todos los gastos de hospedaje y transporte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t¿Serían tan buenos ellos como para pagar los costos de permanencia a nuestra embajada?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste incidente es otro producto de la falta de visión del traidor Lee Myung Bak y sus lacayos de alta jerarquía que creen que con el dinero se resuelve lo todo. Y se registrará como otro episodio bochornoso en la historia de relaciones N-S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSabemos que la banda del traidor Lee es el gran maestro de falsificación.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresentamos detalladamente la verdad de lo ocurrido en el contacto secreto, porque la camarilla de Lee sigue inventando nuevos embustes tras tergiversar los hechos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, el traidor Lee impone al inocente premier Kim Hwang Sik, que no sabía ni jota del contacto lejos de estar involucrado, a hacer declaraciones incoherentes al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras tanto, el ministro de Reunificación Hyon In Thaek está sudando gotas gordas en lugares públicos tratando de tergiversar los hechos y ocultar su fachada de responsable principal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, los títeres surcoreanos mantienen apartados a los participantes en el contacto secreto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl traidor Lee Myung Bak, máximo autor del contacto, intenta prevenir la gran consecuencia de tal incidente guardando el silencio, bien consciente de esta opinión pública: \"En estos momentos, la boca del ´presidente´ puede causar el terremoto o el tsunami más fuertes\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Encomendamos así a los que quieren saber el contenido y la verdad de lo ocurrido en el contacto secreto:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregúntenlos directamente a Lee Myung Bak que ordenó y \"aprobó\" ese contacto. Entonces, ustedes podrán saber lo todo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi quieren conocer los detalles, indáguenlos a Hyon In Thaek quien controló por detrás todo el proceso del contacto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSería mejor todavía que inquieran a los participantes en el contacto Kim Thae Hyo, Kim Chon Sik y Hong Chang Hwa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi todos ellos siguen engañando a los compatriotas y tejiendo artimañas rehusando decir la verdad, nos veremos obligados a publicar a todo el mundo las grabaciones de todo el proceso del contacto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomamos estas medidas porque las relaciones N-S son un importante asunto nacional y no se debe permitir que la política para los compatriotas fuera malempleada en los sucios objetivos egoístas de un puñado de traidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa política debe servir estrictamente para los intereses de las masas populares que son dueñas de ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tiempo en transcurso demostrará cuán descarada y repugnante es la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak de dos caras, que está enloquecida por la confrontación fratricida y viene burlándose de la nación con mentiras y engaños.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSería conveniente a ella decir la verdad con su lengua antes de que se haga tarde."
