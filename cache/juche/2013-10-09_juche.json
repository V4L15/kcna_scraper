            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blasts U.S.-Japan-S. Korea Joint Naval Maneuvers\r\n Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's sincere efforts to ensure peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula are now faced with a grave challenge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. let its nuclear carrier George Washington get involved in the joint naval maneuvers to be staged by it with Japanese and south Korean forces in the South Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gravity of the situation is that the military drills started right after U.S. military authorities flew into south Korea and officially announced \"tailored deterrence strategy\" targeted against the DPRK, fostering military confrontation and war hysteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strategy calls for stifling the DPRK by mobilizing all military forces including conventional armed forces of the U.S. and puppet south Korea and missile defense system, not content with the offer of a nuclear umbrella to south Korea by the U.S., the world's biggest possessor of nuclear weapons. It is, in essence, a plan to increase nuclear threat to the DPRK and mount a preemptive nuclear strike at it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military drills planned against this backdrop are a serious military provocation against the DPRK and an outright challenge to the efforts made by the DPRK for peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has made positive efforts to check the vicious cycle of tensions and create peaceful environment essential for building an economic power and improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It made a series of dialogue proposals on its own initiative prompted by the desire to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and denuclearize it through dialogue and negotiations. It exercised utmost restraint when the U.S. held Ulji Freedom Guardian military exercises with the puppet south Korean forces with the involvement of a nuclear strategic bomber in August.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. is staging nuclear war exercises by introducing nuclear carrier, rendering the situation extremely tense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that it is none other than the U.S. which is harassing peace and escalating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deliberate act of escalating tensions on the peninsula despite the DPRK's patient efforts for peace is aimed to bar the DPRK, a nuclear weapons state, from achieving economic prosperity. This act is also aimed to justify its bolstering of the armed forces to hold a military edge in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is precisely for this reason that the U.S. has resorted to military provocations, while persistently shunning the DPRK's just demand for ensuring peace and stability on the peninsula through dialogue and negotiations without preconditions. There is a limit to patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK loves peace but never begs for it and it is ready for both dialogue and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will invariably keep to the road of its own option and surely build a prosperous country on this land, no matter how desperately the hostile forces may try."

Korean Authorities Urged to Reflect on Their Behavior before Blaming Someone\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- The Policy Department of the National Defence Commission  of the DPRK (NDC) on October 4  served a warning to Park Geun Hye and her group against their recent reckless remarks hurting the dignity and social system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard the Park group is challenging the warning like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\", instead of cogitating and drawing a due lesson. Diehard conservative minions of the puppet Ministry of Unification and reptile media are taking the lead in this fuss under the wire-pulling of Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A spokesman for the Policy Department of the NDC gave an answer to the question put by KCNA on Tuesday as regards their moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement released by the DPRK this time is the first warning served by its army and people under the situation where the moves of Park and her group to escalate the confrontation with it reached an intolerable phase, the spokesman noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group would be well advised to seriously consider the above-said statement and prudently reflect on its behavior and opt to rectify it, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, it is becoming more insolent, running the whole gamut of inconceivable means and methods to make clumsy excuses and pretexts and evade the blame for its crimes and hide them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An adage says sow the wind and reap the whirlwind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said statement would not have been issued if the Park group had done neither such wicked and disgusting things against the north quite contrary to common sense nor evils in violation of moral laws of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the DPRK served the recent warning, the Park group claimed that the inter-Korean relations should be based on the \"spirit of mutual respect,\" terming it \"an unreasonable behavior\" contrary to human etiquette and morality. It went the lengths of shamelessly urging the north to make \"polite demeanor.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chiefs in charge of security of the Park regime who claim they are handling policies towards the north and conservative media vied with each other to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK on the basis of false stories.

Did they do all this in respect of the DPRK?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The DPRK still remembers how Park invited disgusting human scum to Chongwadae and entertained them to wining and dining, instigating them to confrontation with it at a time when the inter-Korean relations were inching close to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fortunately, this time the Park group was right to say when it recalled that the north-south agreement called for refraining from slandering each other but respecting each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If trust and reconciliation were to be promoted between the two sides as they had already agreed, it is necessary to stop slandering the other side, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Frankly speaking, the DPRK has contended so far that it is long since Park and her group were unaware or had forgotten that such points were included in the agreement adopted between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Otherwise, Park and even conservative media would not have joined in so persistently and malignantly hurling mud at the north in noisy chorus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the warning served by the DPRK this time is little short of giving Park and her group an opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has always been lenient towards those who repented of their wrongs and treated them with magnanimity, not asking about their past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to seriously reflect on what they did and rectify it before groundlessly blaming someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that they can claim their titles only when there is no tongue-lashing unbecoming their positions, there is no domestic and foreign public criticism of their rash actions and when there are no wrong assertions and views contrary to people's mind-set.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will not view the Park group's heed to their recent warning as an \"act of yielding.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK would like to watch the future behavior of Park and her group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No rising waves in waning wind."

They are shunning a practical measure for removing the root cause of the nuclear issue on the peninsula and keep mum about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proven by history and recognized by the world people, the nuclear issue on the peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK from A to Z as it has persisted for more than a half century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which provoked a war of aggression to stifle the DPRK, threatened the Korean people with A-bombs and shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No country in the world has been exposed to undisguised hostile acts and nuclear threats of the superpower for such a long period as the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even now the U.S. is waiting for a chance to translate its scenario for nuclear attack on the north into reality and staging ceaseless drills for a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to find a solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula the U.S. which compelled the DPRK to have access to nukes should roll back its hostile policy and completely defuse its nuclear threat. This is the indispensable priority task for settling the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces should reflect on the historical source and background of the issue and their bad nature of persisting in the anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK with cool head before insisting on their hypocritical assertions of the nuclear issue of the peninsula. Only then will they have the face to talk about \"sincerity\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. regards the nuclear weapons as a major means for realizing its strategy for domination of the world in the 21st century. It constantly keeps three nuclear strike means on the peninsula and has already adopted the plan of preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK such as \"tailored deterrence strategy\". Under such situation the prospect of settling the nuclear issue on the peninsula has become dimmer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can bring the DPRK to its knees with its military threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The promotion of the denuclearization of the world will hasten the denuclearization of the peninsula, component part of the denuclearization of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The denuclearization of the whole Korean Peninsula is the behests of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and consistent goal of policy of the DPRK government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is the DPRK's stand to ensure the peace and stability on the peninsula and realize the denuclearization through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever make all efforts for the peace, stability and denuclearization of the world and remain faithful to its responsibility and duty before the international community."
