Even he compared the DPRK with the \"Islamic State\" while calling the anti-terrorist war an example of the super-local war. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday in a commentary says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. intention is to justify its hostile policy toward the DPRK by branding the DPRK's capabilities for self-defense as \"threat\" and labeling it as a \"disturber of peace\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the strategic goal of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK with unchallenged military supremacy and advance to the continent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and the U.S. are technically at war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation, if the U.S. makes provocation, it will not be confined to a local war but lead to an all-out war and surrounding countries will be embroiled in it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. took issue with ballistic missiles of the DPRK to justify its assertion. But it is the illogical sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which has the biggest number of ballistic missiles in the world. The U.S. deployed those missiles in south Korea and other different parts of the world, threatening other countries and openly revealing the attempt at a preemptive attack on them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The comparison of the DPRK with the \"Islamic State\" while talking about the situation of the Middle East is an intolerable insult to the DPRK.
