This umbrella also means an institutional mechanism for putting them into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was after China's first nuclear test in 1964 that Japan was definitely put under the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt that time Japan claimed that China's access to nukes posed \"threat\" to it just as it is blaming the DPRK at present. This resulted in bolstering up the U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" for Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the 1970s south Korea pursued a clandestine nuclear weapons development program only to be uncovered and curbed by its U.S. master. This helped south Korea to come under a more reliable U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" in return for its abandoning of the nuclear development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo one will believe the claims of Japan and south Korea that they are exposed to \"nuclear threat\" as they are under the \"nuclear umbrella\" of the U.S. which tops the world's list of nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, the U.S. forces are present in Japan and south Korea on a permanent basis and the U.S. warships and airplanes equipped with nuclear weapons regularly visit Japan and south Korea to conduct ceaseless nuclear war exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs seen above, one may safely say that both Japan and south Korea are practically armed with nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut quite different is the case with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has never been provided with any nuclear umbrella by outsiders to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere was the \"DPRK-USSR treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance\" in the period of the Soviet Union. But the USSR made no promise to protect the DPRK with its nuclear weapons in case the U.S. attacks the DPRK with nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the treaty came to an end with the collapse of the Soviet Union. And there is no legal obligation between the DPRK and Russia at present to render mutual assistance in case of emergency. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs far as the treaty of friendship, cooperation and mutual assistance between the DPRK and China is concerned, it was concluded when China was a non-nuclear state. It is, therefore, quite irrelevant to the provision of \"nuclear umbrella.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is our view that China has pursued the policy of keeping \"minimum nuclear deterrent\" for protecting itself only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, China's existing nuclear armed forces are not big enough to protect other countries and they do not stand comparison with the nuclear armed forces of the U.S. threatening the DPRK, in particular. This is a well known fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was only the DPRK that was left unprotected by nukes when south Korea and its neighboring countries were equipped with nuclear weapons or provided with nuclear umbrella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnly danger of war will increase when one of the two hostile parties is armed with nuclear weapons or protected by a \"nuclear umbrella\" while the other remains defenseless, having none of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's access to nukes helped keep a nuclear balance in Northeast Asia even in the least, thus making it possible to deter a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome individual right-wing elements in Japan are crying out for going nuclear but this is not prompted by their worry about any threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat they seek is to go nuclear with the DPRK's access to nukes as a pretext and thus call back the departed soul of the militarists who attacked Pearl Harbor and worked hard to realize the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" This is a reality of this region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe arithmetic logic that Japan and south Korea may go nuclear because the DPRK has had access to nukes is an expression of ignorance of those who are bereft of an elementary sense. This is only part of a clumsy psychological warfare launched against the DPRK's access to nukes."

Korean Ruling Forces' Separatist Moves Flayed\r\nPyongyang, July 22 (KCNA) -- The Paektusan Czech-Korean Friendship Association and the Czech Group for the Study and Materialization of the Juche Idea released a joint statement on July 13 denouncing the south Korean authorities for their politically-motivated crackdown upon the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon). \n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement referred to the fact that political campaign against the pro-reunification patriotic forces and personages is now going on in south Korea. It disclosed that traitor Lee Myung Bak recently had the puppet prosecution announce \"results of investigation into the cases of violation of the 'National Security Law'\" and detain the chairman and two other leading members of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch fascist repression goes to clearly prove that the south Korean authorities do not want Korea's reunification but are engaging themselves in all sorts of machinations to escalate the tension on the Korean Peninsula and stamp out the reunification movement, it pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement said that the said association and group resolutely condemn the south Korean ruling forces for their moves to hinder national reunification and exterminate the democratic organizations of south Korea struggling for cooperation and prosperity between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt urged the south Korean authorities to put an immediate halt to the political suppression of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and ensure free and democratic political activities of all the forces of south Korea struggling for reunification and democracy."

            "content": "ATCC comenta teoria de \"reaccion en cadena\" sobre armas nucleares\r\nPyongyang, 22 de julio (ATCC) -- En estos tiempos, Estados Unidos difunde a los paises circunvecinos el rumor de que se originaria una \"reaccion en cadena\" en Japon y el Sur de Corea si no se logra impedir la posesion de armas nucleares de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Es decir, si la RPDC tiene las armas nucleares, Japon y el Sur de Corea se sentiran \"amenazados\" y optaran por armarse con las mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque parece razonable prima facie, esta logica no pasa de ser una hipotesis absurda y no pegada a la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La humanidad aspira a un mundo desnuclearizado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si los paises hubieran competido en poseer las armas nucleares por ser amenazados por ellas, este mundo se habria repletado ya de los paises provistos de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El arma nuclear es el medio que adquiere por ultimo e inevitablemente un pais cuando no le queda otro remedio para hacer frente a la amenaza nuclear a que es sometido practica y gravemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, Japon y el Sur de Corea son protegidos desde mucho antes por el \"paraguas nuclear\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Este paraguas consiste en la promesa de EE.UU. de tomar la represalia con armas nucleares norteamericanas si un pais aliado fuera victima de ataque nuclear y en el aparato institucional para cumplirla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japon se guarecio mas bajo el \"paraguas nuclear\" del imperio desde 1964 cuando China realizo la primera prueba nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entonces, Japon refunfunaba que la tenencia de arma nuclear de China le representaba una \"amenaza\", como lo esta haciendo ahora con la RPDC, y por consiguiente, EE.UU. dio la \"proteccion nuclear\" mas solida al primero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sucedio lo mismo en el caso del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Sur de Corea tuvo que abortar el desarrollo de arma nuclear, que impulsaba en la decada de 1970 sin que lo supiera su amo gringo, cuando este se dio cuenta de esto y le ofrecio el \"paraguas nuclear\" mas solido a condicion de que renuncie a ese proyecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie creera a Japon y el Sur de Corea, que son protegidos por EE.UU. que cuenta con el arsenal nuclear mas grande del mundo, por mucho que ellos insistan en que son \"amenazados\" con armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, en ambos paises estan acampadas permanentemente las tropas norteamericanas y vienen y van regularmente los buques de guerra y los aviones norteamericanos con armas nucleares a bordo para ejercitar la guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe puede decir que Japon y el Sur de Corea estan repletos de armas nucleares porque son protegidos por EE.UU. con las mismas y tienen en sus territorios un gran numero de efectivos norteamericanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el caso de la RPDC es diametralmente diferente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC nunca ha tenido un paraguas nuclear extranjero que la protegiera de la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien en el periodo de la ex URSS existia el \"Tratado de amistad, cooperacion y ayuda mutua RPDC-URSS\", no hubo la promesa de que esta nacion euroasiatica iba a vengarse de EE.UU. cuando Corea fuera atacada por armas nucleares de este imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, ese tratado dejo de existir junto con el derrumbe de la Union Sovietica y actualmente entre la RPDC y Rusia no hay ningun compromiso legal sobre la ayuda mutua en el tiempo de emergencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl tratado de igual indole entre Corea y China es mucho mas desvinculado al suministro de \"paraguas nuclear\" porque fue firmado cuando China era un Estado sin armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, se cree que China tiene la politica de mantener el \"minimo disuasivo nuclear\" para proteger solo su territorio nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, las actuales fuerzas nucleares de China no alcanzan para defender a otros paises y son incomparablemente debiles que las de EE.UU. que amenazan a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin, la RPDC se quedaba como la unica parte sin armas nucleares en la Peninsula Coreana y su zona periferica cubiertas de esas armas y el paraguas nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las relaciones entre las dos partes en antagonismo, si una parte tiene armas nucleares o se halla bajo \"el paraguas nuclear\" y la otra se encuentra indefensa sin ninguna de las dos cosas, creceria solo el peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando la RPDC dispuso de su propia arma nuclear, se establecio, aunque en lo basico, el equilibro entre las fuerzas nucleares en el Nordeste Asiatico y por resultado, se hizo posible disuadir mas la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora algunos elementos derechistas de Japon abogan por el armamento nuclear no porque estan preocupados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta insistencia es el disparate del fantasma militarista que trata de escenificar de nuevo el ataque a Pearl Harbor y establecer la \"esfera de co-prosperidad de la gran Asia oriental\" al emprender el camino de armamento nuclear aprovechando y pretextando la tenencia de armas nucleares por parte de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la realidad de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa logica de la primaria, de que la posesion de armas nucleares de la RPDC causara el efecto domino en Japon y el Sur de Corea, es la expresion de la ignorancia que proviene de la carencia de la basica sensibilidad a la realidad o el colofon del complot psicologico mal ideado para calumniar la tenencia de esos artefactos de la RPDC."
