This is a very unreasonable behavior. \r\n Minju Joson says this in a signed commentary today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programme set forth by Hanchongryon and its activities conducted to carry it out can in no way be a target of suppression as they reflected the aspiration and demand of the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the South Korean \"security\" authorities are calling into question the activities of Hanchongryon for independence and democratization of society and national reunification and raising a whirlwind of suppression. This is prompted by their ulterior intention to keep South Korea under the domination of outside forces and perpetuate the division of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"security\" authorities are intensifying the suppression of the hardcore members of Hanchongryon, the vanguard of the one million fellow students of South Korea, after labeling it as the \"enemy-benefiting organization\", and laying an obstacle in the way of implementing the north-south joint declaration, a declaration for national independence and reunification. These anti-national and anti-reunification acts are intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hanchongryon will not yield to any suppression but achieve its sacred cause by the concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should withdraw the label of the \"enemy-benefiting organization\" attached to Hanchongryon, guarantee the freedom of its activities and discontinue the suppression of the patriotic students.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
