What is most important is to clearly see through the true nature of capitalism which is making desperate efforts bluffing with its ruin at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The idea of the inevitable ruin of capitalism clarified by the President Kim Il Sung serves as a powerful weapon for the world revolutionary people in intensifying their anti-imperialist struggle for independence. \r\n\r\n"
