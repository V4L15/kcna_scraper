This clearly proves that the U.S., \"empire of devil,\" is posing a grave threat to the world peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a military adventure of the U.S. to sharply increase military expenditure and escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" in a bid to spark the second cold war is bound to face a stern punishment by the world public.    \r\n\r\n"

They singled out the Korean peninsula as a major target of their aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to make one's way to the continent without seizing Korea and Korea is, indeed, a \"silk road\" for Japan's overseas expansion. Such idea held sway among the Japanese imperialists through their military occupation and rule over Korea for more than 40 years in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' idea of invading and dominating Korea remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"military threat\" from the DPRK peddled by Japan while zealously following the U.S. policy of stifling the DPRK is no more than a pretext to step up the preparations for war of overseas aggression in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK is its sinister intention to foster antagonism between the north and the south in a bid to keep Korea divided permanently and push the Korean nation to ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the predominant idea of Japan that if Korea is reunified, it will be a big obstacle in the way of carrying out Japan's policy of continental aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's escalated hostile policy toward the DPRK is a factor of straining the relations of confrontation between the DPRK and Japan and increasing the tensions on the Korean peninsula and the root cause of military conflicts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should redress its past crimes and drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK.  This is the way of terminating the hostile relations, ties of confrontation between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This will do Japan good in many aspects.    \r\n\r\n"

If Bush attacks the north, it means the outbreak of the second Korean war, the statement said, and added: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a preposterous attempt that Bush is putting pressure upon the north and threatening to attack it under the pretext of its possession of weapons of mass destruction. And it is nothing but a bid to find a pretext for pressure and war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, Ri In Su, co-chairman of the headquarters of the people's movement for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, in a commentary titled \"our principal enemy--the United States\" on Feb. 5 said that if the U.S. unleashes a war of aggression on the Korean peninsula all the people should wage a death-defying resistance to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solidarity for the implementation of the south-north joint declaration in South Korea in a statement on Feb. 5 said: National assemblymen from the ruling and opposition parties declared that the Bush administration is the principal offender who is leading the inter-Korean relations to rupture and expressed \"opposition to the U.S. military action and expansion of war, respect for the principle of resolving the national issue between the south and the north, parties concerned, and expectation of the peaceful progress of the DPRK-U.S. relations.\" This is an act conforming with the interests and demand of the Korean nation living in the era of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is unreasonably interfering in the Korean national issue, the political camp should take on a new look to suit the era of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
