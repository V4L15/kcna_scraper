This is nothing but shameless sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has deliberately strained the situation whenever the DPRK tries to improve the relations between the north and the south. This proves in practice that it is none other than the U.S. which is wrecking peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is massively introducing lethal weapons into south Korea, ceaselessly staging frantic war exercises to deliberately bring the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. This proves, in the final analysis, that the U.S. is a violator of the UN resolutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people of conscience should turn out in the just struggle to condemn the wrecker of peace and security on the Korean peninsula."
