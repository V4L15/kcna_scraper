to bolder relief recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t La Juventud, organ of the March 26 Movement of Uruguay, carried a photo-accompanied article recently which said that 24,000 prisoners in 50 prisons in 12 U.S. states staged mass protest for 40 days against the police barbarous actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Website VOX said that the protests were attributable to the barbarous acts of police and labor conditions of \"modern version of slavery\" which was enforced at national, federal state and private prisons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prisoners in different parts of the U.S. staged protests all at once on the 45th anniversary of the killing of prisoners in Attica Prison, New York, a clear indication of the serious human rights abuses in the U.S. prisons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, there was a riot of prisoners in the prison on Sept. 9, 1971 against the inhumane treatment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 1,000 protesters waged a fierce struggle for four days, being armed with clubs and iron tube.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They punished executioners and threw into prison warders and demanded immediate release of all political prisoners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the then Nixon group sent hundreds of military police to put down the protesters in the course of which 33 prisoners were killed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, too, the prison warders armed with small arms and tear gas guns encircled protesters and threatened them and committed such inhuman act of coercively feeding the prisoners who were on a hunger strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now in U.S. there are more than 2.2 million prisoners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to internet newspaper Global Post, the U.S. which accounts for just 5 percent of the world population holds 25 percent of the total number of prisoners worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clint Smith, post-graduate student of Harvard University, said that lots of people are being put behind bars on charges of involvement in widespread socio-political cases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Human rights abuses in prisons baffle human imagination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Torture has been adopted as a policy in the U.S. and not only methods used during the medieval era but means aided with modern science and technology are being used to torture prisoners in the severest manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t CIA spent tens of millions of U.S. dollars to invent new torture techniques and methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They include making prisoners stand for 180 hours, letting them maintain stressed posture, not allowing them to sleep with their hand-cuffed hands held up, ice bath torture, torture by letting them lie in coffin, letting them eat and sleep in water, putting insects into a small box where a prisoner is kept, forced feeding, electric torture and sexual torture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, delegates from more than 110 countries to an international meeting in May last year exposed human rights abuses committed in the U.S. and tendered at least 350 recommendations to the U.S. authorities on putting right the inhuman and unethical human rights performances. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The horrible human rights situation in the U.S. finds its vivid manifestation in the ceaseless gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against the backdrop of rapid increase in murder of black people by police, there was a barbarous shooting of a Ugandan man called Alfred Olango by police in California, U.S. toward the end of September.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t

He went the lengths of letting out a whole string of vituperation that \"serious human rights abuses are unabated\" and \"the north's human rights issue should be discussed by the international community.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even today when he is to lose the job as UN chief, he is taking the lead in the campaign to \"impose sanctions on the north\" and pull up it over \"its human rights issues\".

VOX transmitio que la causa principal de esas protestas estuvo en las barbaries de la policia y las condiciones laborales calificadas de \"esclavitud de cuno moderno\" en las carceles estatales, estaduales y privadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta lucha simultanea comenzo con motivo del 45o aniversario del asesinato masivo de los encarcelados de la Prision Attica de Nueva York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El 9 de septiembre de 1971, mas de un millar de prisioneros armados con palos y tubos de hierro se rebelaron contra las vejaciones inhumanitarias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante 4 dias, ellos castigaron a los verdugos, pusieron en cautiverio a los carceleros y demandaron la liberacion inmediata de todos los presos politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La camarilla de Nixon movilizo a cientos de policias militares en la operacion antimotin que dejo como saldo 33 reos asesinados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Actualmente, permanecen tras las rejas mas de 2 millones 200 mil estadounidenses a lo largo de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  De acuerdo con el periodico online Global Post, los encerrados en EE.UU. constituyen un cuarto de la poblacion encarcelada en todo el mundo aunque la poblacion de ese pais ocupa solo el 5 % de la mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En opinion de Clint Smith, estudiante de postgraduado de la Universidad Harvard, numerosas personas se encarcelan por casos sociopoliticos mas amplios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En EE.UU., donde la tortura es una politica, se tortura a los recluidos con metodos medievales abusando hasta de los medios cientifico-tecnicos modernos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La CIA invierte decenas de millones de US$ en la invencion de nuevas tecnologias y crueles metodos de tortura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En una reunion internacional celebrada en mayo del ano pasado, los delegados de mas de 110 paises condenaron mordazmente las practicas de violacion de DDHH en EE.UU. y presentaron a las autoridades de este pais la mocion de casi 350 puntos para la reparacion de la inhumanitaria y antietica situacion de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, se reportan sin parar en ese pais los crimenes asociados con el uso de armas de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A medida que crecen bruscamente los casos de asesinato de negros por la policia, ocurrio a finales de septiembre en el Estado de California el tiroteo indiscriminado de la policia contra el ugandes identificado Alfred Olango, la 217a victima de este tipo del ano en curso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El embajador ugandes en EE.UU. protesto oficialmente al gobierno norteamericano demandando la averiguacion pronta del incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sociedad estadounidense los crimenes con armas se hacen una \"epidemia\" incurable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe cometen por doquier los horribles incidentes de homicidio con armas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA citar por ejemplo, el 2 de octubre pasado, quedaron muertos los dos estudiantes en el recinto de la Universidad Provincial de North Carolina, y el dia siguiente, ocurrieron los dos crimenes con armas en la ciudad de Miniapolis del Estado de Minnesota dejando como saldo 6 lesionados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY los dias 15 y 18, los otros casos semejantes ocurridos sucesivamente en Los Angeles del Estado de California y en San Francisco quitaron la vida de varias personas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe oyen a menudo los disparos de homicidio por doquier del pais incluso las escuelas, calles, apartamentos, tiendas, parques, hospitales, establecimientos publicos y hasta en los casinos e iglesias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de armas que tienen los moradores estadounidenses alcanza a 300 millones, aproximadamente. Y cada ano resultan muertas mas de 30 mil personas y lesionadas mas de 200 mil en los crimenes de armas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, una publicacion estadounidense transmitio que \"es lamentable que los estadounidenses maten entre si y pasen los dias con inquietud y panico en la oscuridad medieval\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este planeta no hay otro pais como EE.UU. donde no se garantizan la subsistencia y la seguridad del hombre y se ven pisoteados despiadadamente hasta los derechos elementales de los seres humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl reino criminal e infierno humano, esto es la realidad de la sociedad estadounidense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy cinico que este caudillo de crimenes anti-DDHH actue como \"juez de DDHH\" cuestionando la situacion de \"derechos humanos\" de otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, la sociedad internacional opina que la violacion de derechos humanos es el \"privilegio\" de EE.UU., pais de extermino de DDHH sin igual en el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe atender primero la situacion de DDHH de su propio pais antes de hablar del \"problema de DDHH\" de otros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad internacional exige unanimemente a someter al imperio americano al banquillo de acusado del tribunal de derechos humanos y sentenciarle el castigo duro. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia saldara la cuenta estricta de los crimenes de EE.UU., archi-violador de DDHH."

Para colmo, dice que \"no cesa la grave violacion de derechos humanos\" y \"el problema de DDHH del Norte de Corea debe ser un tema de debate internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste acto verbal es una artimana barata para ocupar el sillon presidencial del Sur de Corea adulando a Estados Unidos y la banda de Park Geun-hye cuando termine su mandato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBan es lacayo proyanqui de primera categoria que detesta el pueblo surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde que debuto en el circulo politico sirviendo a EE.UU., el vino dedicandose al servilismo proyanqui y la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando era ministro de Asuntos Exteriores y Comercio del Sur de Corea, empeoro las relaciones intercoreanas repitiendo la teoria de la \"renuncia nuclear primero\" de Bush e insistio en el envio de efectivos surcoreanos a Irak. Por su diplomacia a favor de EE.UU., el fue calificado como \"diplomatico estadounidense\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de ser elegido como secretario general de la ONU bajo el control de su amo, abuso del escenario internacional como campo de confrontacion fratricida sumandose a la campana de sancion anti-RPDC y las intrigas de DDHH de EE.UU. y la banda de Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo es casual que durante el decenio de mandato de Ban, la ONU se haya hecho aparato internacional mas incapaz, impotente y corrupto en que se predominan la arbitrariedad y el despotismo de EE.UU. y sus fuerzas seguidoras y se legalizan la agresion y la injusticia contra los paises debiles y pequenos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una verguenza de la nacion que ese vendepatria actue libremente en la arena internacional sin hacer cosas provechosas para los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstaria muy equivocado Ban, denunciado por la nacion como traidor y fanatico elemento conflictivo anti-RPDC, si el piensa que puede tomar el sillon \"presidencial\" con la ayuda de EE.UU. y aduloneria a Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras repercute en toda la extension surcoreana el clamor de los habitantes de distintos estratos que demandan enjuiciar y destituir a Park Geun-hye, hasta los colaboradores cercanos de ella en Chongwadae y el \"Partido Saenuri\" se precipitan a salir del \"barco de Park Geun-hye\" para salvarse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto es la realidad surcoreana de ahora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aferrarse a Park cuya vida se esta apagando es una tonteria como subir al barco en pleno hundimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La opinion publica del Sur de Corea ya condeno a muerte a Ban Ki-moon cuya popularidad cae en picada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El debe tener presente que si sigue actuando como ahora, no podra volver al Sur de Corea ni en calidad de ciudadano comun, lejos de \"presidente\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ni el perro del campo le dara bienvenida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Escrito por el periodista Ryang Phil."
