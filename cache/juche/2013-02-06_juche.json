Japan is a war criminal state and, at the same time, it is a dangerous state as it gives spurs to its militarization while denying its past crimes, defying the demand of the international community. Japan is regarded as a target of vigilance in the international community because of its moral vulgarity and shamefulness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries in the world are airing their concern about Japan's spy satellite launch, expressing hope that it would neither spark off a vicious cycle nor give unnecessary impetus. Among them are passive onlookers to Japan's spy satellite launch. What type of world is the United Nations Security Council making?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is by no means the one for the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. tries to handle international issues in line with its strategy for domination from the standpoint of its interests, styling itself the \"only superpower in the world\" as it did in the past. Many countries know well about this but they are allowing the U.S. application of its double standards, taken in by its trick. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the U.S. handling of issues according to its biased and ambitious decision is rendering the overall international situation complicated.

This proves that Tok Islets are part of the territory of Korea from the olden times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets are not territory whose owner is not clear as clamored by the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan makes a far-fetched assertion that the territory of Korea is its land. This despicable behavior is a hysterical fit of those obsessed by the territorial ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By making the Japanese convince that Tok Islets are \"land of Japan\", Japan seeks to get them ready for the Korean war for the territorial expansion and turn those islets into an advanced base and a military bridgehead for realizing the territorial ambition and reinvading Korea. Herein lies Japan's sinister intention in persisting in its moves for grabbing Tok Islets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By building up public opinion to make the international community convince in Japan's dominium over Tok Islets, Japan seeks to put not only the islets but the whole territory of Korea under its military control and realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's bid to set up an office exclusively dealing with the Tok Islets issue within the government indicates that its moves to grab the islets have entered a more dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's territorial claim to Tok Islets can never be tolerated as it is a criminal act of wantonly violating the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should stop the useless act, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by its reckless territorial ambition."
