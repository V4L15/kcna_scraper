            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Comments on Japan's Launch of Spy Satellite \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary denounces Japan's recent launch of a military spy satellite as part of preparations for reinvasion of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia, a criminal action of seriously threatening peace and stability in the region.\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan defiantly launched the military spy satellite despite the apprehension and warnings of the international community. This shows that the Japanese militarists' moves to turn Japan into a military power for reinvasion have reached a grave stage. The launch of the satellite is all the more dangerous as it synchronized with the Japanese reactionaries' interpretation of \"the right to collective self-defense\" and undisguised moves to amend the constitutional law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have designated the Korean Peninsula as the primary target of their overseas aggression. The Japanese militarists are watching for a chance to reinvade Korea in an attempt to begin with aggression on Korea to embark on the road of conquering Asia as they did in the past. The recent launch was prompted by this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already warned that Japan's launch of military spy satellites constitutes a grave threat to Korea. Nevertheless, Japan is continuously launching spy satellites aiming at Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will take imperative self-defensive measures to counter the Japanese militarists' dangerous moves for reinvasion.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Without that, the transfer would be meaningless and would only entail a new war on the Korean Peninsula in the long run.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
