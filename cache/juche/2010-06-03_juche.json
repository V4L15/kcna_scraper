            "content": "KCNA on Hatoyama's Miserable Fate\r\n Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama resigned on Wednesday.\n\t\t\t\t\t This was a stern judgment given by the Japanese people and history to him as he unhesitatingly betrayed the people's mindset and yielded to the U.S. to realize his political ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As universally known, he emerged prime minister from the Democratic Party, putting an end to the long history of the Liberal Democratic Party's rule because he advocated \"independence\" in Japan's policy toward the U.S. and made an exceptional election promise to ensure that the U.S. forces base in Futenma is transferred to an area outside Okinawa Prefecture or outside the country as strongly demanded by the Japanese people including the inhabitants of the prefecture, in particular. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese people expected him to put his promise into a reality and the international community followed with interest his attitude in the subsequent period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Hatoyama betrayed them by reneging on his promise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the coalition regime of the Democratic Party showed the sign of stability at its initial stage, he began backing from his \"hard-line policy toward the U.S.\", making eyes at it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such tendency surfaced at the outset of the year as a cowardly behavior intended to stay in the premiership full time by clinging to the coattail of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the election and right after the assumption of his office, he made much fuss in a bid to create the impression that he was breaking with Washington, trumpeting about importance to East Asia based on the \"idea of fraternity\" and the like. But the public gradually began hearing from him remarks that the \"Japan-U.S. alliance is an axis of the Japan security policy\" and a spate of other outbursts identical to the pro-U.S. one-sided policy pursued in the period of the LDP's rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such about-turn of Hatoyama hinted at the fact that the DPJ might find itself in a political crisis any time while dithering without its own principle just to please the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. became vociferous about \"threat from north Korea,\" citing the case of the warship \"Cheonan,\" Hatoyama met the U.S. demand over its military base in Futenma as if he had been waiting for this to happen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Various parts of Japan were swept by waves of demonstrations and rallies demanding the resignation of Hatoyama as he behaved against the people's mindset, yielding to the pressure of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Social-Democratic Party of Japan withdrew from the ruling coalition, and there increased the pressure from the opposition parties, forcing him to step down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political pitfall into which Hatoyama fell was, in fact, dug by the U.S. It made an utmost use of Hatoyama who posed a great threat to the U.S.-Japan alliance and the implementation of its Asia policy while asserting what he called \"independence\". But it compelled him to step down of his own accord in the end. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, he was shot by bullets fired by two sides for having behaved without political independence and creed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan witnessed a frequent replacement of its prime ministers and its political situation was hardly rid of a whirlwind of ceaseless unrest in recent years. This is closely linked with the hostile policy pursued by the Japanese authorities toward the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those prime ministers of Japan including Abe and Aso were compelled without exception to leave their offices before the end of their tenure as they were frantic with the moves to stifle the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and with militarism in pursuance of the U.S. hostile policy toward it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, by no means, fortuitous. It goes to prove that the hostile policies pursued by them were anachronistic ones going against the wishes of the Japanese people and the trend of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Hatoyama, lost to all sense of decency, so zealously toed the U.S. policy that he volunteered to act a servant of the south Korean puppet regime, lackeys of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the outbreak of the case of \"Cheonan\" sinking he went the lengths of blustering that \"Japan would take the lead in sponsoring a UN Security Council resolution\" against the DPRK when requested by south Korea. This suffices to indicate that he had lost his qualification to remain a chief executive of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pro-U.S. attitude and flunkeyism to it are not the way for Japan to follow. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If one follows flunkeyism, one is bound to become an idiot and if a country takes to flunkeyism, it is bound to go to ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should not forget this truth of history."

Pero, salieron poco a poco de su boca las palabras, que consuenan con la politica de favoritismo a EE.UU. practicada en el regimen del Partido Democratico Liberal, tales como \"la alianza Japon-EE.UU. es el eje de la politica de seguridad de Japon\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este cambio de su actitud insinuaba que era una cuestion de tiempo la caida del Partido Democratico en la crisis politica por adular a EE.UU. actuando sin su propio criterio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando el imperio preconizaba la \"teoria de la amenaza del Norte de Corea\" bajo el pretexto del intrigante caso del buque de guerra \"Cheonan\", Hatoyama aprovecho esta oportunidad para aceptar la demanda de EE.UU. en el problema de traslado de la base de Futenma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En todas partes de Japon se desataron las manifestaciones y mitines en demanda de la renuncia del premier que dio espaldas a la opinion publica doblegandose ante la presion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Partido Democratico Social se retiro del poder de coalicion y se fortalecio mas la presion del partido en oposicion a Hatoyama que se vio obligado a declarar su renuncia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t    La ruina politica de Hatoyama se debio por otra parte a la trampa armada por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tras sacar todos los provechos posibles de Hatoyama, el imperio propicio la renuncia de el que habia creado seria amenaza a la alianza EE.UU.-Japon y al cumplimiento de la politica norteamericana sobre Asia hablando de la supuesta \"independencia\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El fue castigado asi por dentro y por fuera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   En los ultimos anos, en Japon se han cambiado con frecuencia los premieres y la situacion politica del pais se halla en la voragine de desestabilizacion, lo cual esta relacionado estrechamente con la politica sobre Corea de las autoridades japonesas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Abe, Aso y otros premieres, que se aferraban al militarismo y a las maniobras de aplastamiento anti-RPDC y anti-Chongryon en adhesion a la politica estadounidense de hostilidad a Corea, tuvieron sin excepcion el mandato corto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no es nada casual, sino comprueba que la politica hostil a Corea es la anacronica que contraviene a la demanda del pueblo japones y a la corriente de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Hatoyama, que perseguia a ciegas a EE.UU., cumplio hasta el papel de sirviente de los titeres surcoreanos, lacayos de EE.UU., sin ningun sentido de orgullo y honor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dijo que si el Sur de Corea solicita una resolucion anti-RPDC del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU en cuanto al incidente de hundimiento del buque \"Cheonan\", \"Japon debe esforzarse en la delantera por conseguirla\". Ese dicho basta para saber que el ya ha perdido la calificacion de maximo gobernante del pais llamado Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El servilismo a EE.UU. no es la opcion de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El servilismo a grandes potencias convierte a una persona en un idiota, y a un pais, lo lleva al arruinamiento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon no debe olvidar esta verdad de la historia."
