It was also a great event of worldwide significance that fully demonstrated the vitality and validity of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n The vice-chairman of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) said this in a statement on Monday marking the second anniversary of their repatriation, according to voice of national salvation from Seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korean people have keenly felt that Kim Jong Il, who is creating a great epic of comradeship and human love, is the supreme incarnation of humanity, the sun of the nation and the benevolent father to whom the 70 million fellow countrymen entrust their destinies and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will accelerate the nationwide march for the implementation of the joint declaration so as to realize the desire for the nation's independent reunification and bring earlier the day when they live a happy life under his benevolent care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that other unconverted long-term prisoners are still kept in south Korea due to the moves of the anti-reunification elements, the statement held that they should be sent back to the north as early as possible in the spirit of the joint declaration and according to their will.    \r\n"

It blustered that the DPRK should accept the IAEA's nuclear inspection and if not, it would not provide the LWRs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the core point of the 1994 AF is the U.S. provision of LWRs to the DPRK by 2003 in return for the latter's freezing of its nuclear facilities, the commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has fulfilled all its commitments under the AF more than 100. But the U.S. did nothing but starting ground concrete tamping belatedly. It is, therefore, a height of folly for the U.S. it to talk about a nuclear inspection under this situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. threat and bluffing will never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should properly approach the DPRK, well aware of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last half a century the U.S. bellicose forces only suffered a defeat, setback and shame while desperately working to contain the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most pending issue between the DPRK and the U.S. at present is how to abide by the AF, not a nuclear inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of nuclear inspection will naturally be settled when the AF is implemented and the construction of LWRs makes successful progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK will get the U.S. nowhere. This is a lesson the U.S. should draw.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Withdrawal of U.S. troops from south Korea called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- If the north and south of Korea are to independently achieve the reunification of the country by improving their relations through their concerted efforts, they should put an end to the United States' interference in the issue related to the north-south relations and make its forces quit south Korea as early as possible.\r\n A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs said this in his answer to the question raised by KCNA today 57 years after the U.S. troops occupied south Korea right after the end of the second world war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States cites the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defense pact\" as a pretext for its forces' occupation of south Korea but its presence is totally unjustifiable as it diametrically runs counter to the Korean armistice agreement (KAA) which calls for the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea and principles of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KAA clearly stipulates the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea and a resolution on this issue was already adopted at the 30th session of the U.N. General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the united states has kept south Korea under its military occupation for over half a century and sought the permanent presence of its forces.  This is aimed to meet its strategic interest in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not pleased to see a good atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula and improved north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is because the U.S. calculated that if peace and reunification are achieved on the Korean Peninsula through the dramatic improvement of the north-south relations, it will be hard for it to dub the DPRK \"a dangerous force\" any longer or seek any pretext to keep its forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. pretends to hail the north-south dialogue and sincerely hope for improved inter-Korean relations and, in fact, tries by hook or by crook to stop them from dealing with main issues in real earnest, confined to having ordinary exchange between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason the U.S. under the pretext of \"cooperation\" is forcing south Korea to get its approval of Seoul's every stand on issues related to the north-south relations and, in this course, is putting the brake on inter-Korean negotiations after staging the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercise to spoil the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation between the north and south and thus deliberately strain the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reality goes to prove that the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea are not a \"guardian\" of stability in this area but disturber of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula and the main source of all sufferings and misfortune resulting from the split of the Korean nation    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
