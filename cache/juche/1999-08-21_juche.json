Korean rulers' misdeed denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The South Korean rulers are threatening to take legal actions against reunification envoys of South Korea under the \"security law\" the moment they return on charges that they \"illegally visited\" Pyongyang. At the same time, they are investigating delegates of the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and its workers football team for reunification on groundless charges although they visited Pyongyang with the prior permission from the authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such misdeeds of the South Korean rulers are another political gangsterism of throwing a wet blanket over the ardent desire of the whole nation for reunification. They are also evil deeds which can be committed only by the separatists who dislike reunification and an unpardonable treacherous  move to break the strong will of all the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas to accelerate the reunification of the country through the independence and great unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers ruthlessly cracked down upon the grand pan-national pro-reunification festival sponsored by pro-reunification patriotic organisations in South Korea while employing every conceivable mean plot and trick to block it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is clear evidence that they have no willingness to work for the country, the nation and reunification but seek only confrontation with the north, the country's division and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   North visits for reunification are patriotic ones which cannot be incriminated in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers must discard the ill-intentioned design to punish those patriotic people who visited the north or held events related to the grand pan-national pro-reunification festival by branding their acts as \"enemy-benefiting.\" \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Truth behind U.S. row over \"missile threat\" revealed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea released on August 17 an open letter on the truth behind the U.S. row over the \"missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTerming the U.S. row over the \"Taepodong missile\" on which its hue and cry over the non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK is based as an extension of its U.S. \"nuclear\" racket kicked up in a bid to stifle it, the letter gave a detailed account of its origin and truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States used to pick up a \"missile issue\", while escalating its row over \"nuclear suspicion\" from long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the DPRK-U.S. negotiations, the United States has unilaterally demanded a halt to the DPRK's export and development of missiles, linking it with the signing of a peace agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the U.S. proposal to discuss the \"missile issue\" at the negotiations was its aim to secure a lever to launch an offensive to stifle the DPRK on the plea of the \"missile issue\" and find a pretext to disarm it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The phase of crisis caused by the U.S. row over the \"nuclear suspicion\" gradually turned into a phase of stability following the adoption of the agreed framework between the DPRK and the United States in October 1994. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Upset by this development, the bellicose circle which represents the U.S. hawks raised the issue of \"suspected underground nuclear facility in north Korea\" from the end of 1998, but the visit to the \"problematic\" underground facility deprived the United States of its last card in the \"nuclear\" row. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then the United States dreamt up the fallacy of the \"missile threat,\" describing the DPRK's satellite as a \"missile\" in a bid to resume the anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The row over the \"missile threat\" has been escalated to the phase of military preemptive attack after going through the phases of fabrication of misinformation, political, diplomatic and economic countermeasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has resorted to every method to achieve the aim sought by it in this row, including efforts to build up  public opinion and political and military methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. hard-line conservatives have been spreading the \"fiction of missile re-launch\" since the end of May this year when their visit to the Kumchang-ri underground facility was over, asserting that the DPRK was preparing for the test-fire of \"Taepodong 2.\" They were busy creating the urgency of the situation by trying to convince the public opinion that the test-fire \"was imminent,\" \"suspended\", \"is going on\" or \"has been rounded off\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States directly linked the north's \"missile issue\" to \"security\" in order to bring it into relief as a pending important political issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean authorities consider the fiction of north's \"missile threat\" to be an important means of sanctions to isolate the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was evidenced by the Japan-U.S. summit talks held last September, the South Korea-Japan summit talks in march this year and the South Korea-U.S. summit talks in July this year which discussed measures to build up a \"cooperation system\" whereby the U.S., Japan and South Korea would jointly cope with the \"missile threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. Defense Secretary Cohen's tour of Japan and South Korea at the end of July this year was a criminal one intended to map out a \"scenario for military counteraction\" and the first phase of the scenario discussed there was preemptive \"deterrent to launch\", the second \"deployment of armed forces\" and the third \"preemptive attack\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The real aim sought by the U.S. hard-line conservatives in their row over the DPRK's \"missile issue\" was to provoke the \"second June 25 war\" in a bid to launch into the development of the U.S. \"National Missile Defense\" system which requires an investment of fund amounting to astronomical figures and thus build up a new system of combat forces after the end of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world public likens the present situation to the June crisis in 1994. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gravity of the problem lies in the fact that the war-like situation in 1994 was created because of the counter-offensive \"operation plan 5027\" while the present touch-and-go situation is the result of the tensions that have escalated due to \"operation plan 5027-98\", a scenario for a preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The crisis did not originate from the north's \"missile threat\" but has been caused and escalated by the massive deployment of strategic weapons in the United States, Japan and South Korea and the row kicked up by them over the north's missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Threat is not posed by a satellite launched by the north or its re-launch but is caused by sanctions taken by South Korea, the United States and Japan in a bid to isolate and stifle the north and their attempt to mount a preemptive attack on the north on this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThreat does not come from the DPRK's missile development, an exercise of a sovereign right to self-defence but from thousands of U.S. strategic weapons deployed in South Korea, Japan and the U.S. mainland targeted at the north and war exercises for their use under the simulated conditions of real battles and the U.S. economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A way out for the U.S. lies not in the development of the \"missile defense\" system but in the U.S. forces' pullout from South Korea, a way out for Japan lies not in the introduction of the U.S. \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system but in the drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK and a way out for South Korea lies not in purchasing U.S. \"Patriot\" missiles but in its policy switchover to national independence and great national unity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
