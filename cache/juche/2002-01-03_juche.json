And he comprehensively laid down the general line of the Workers' Party of Korea for the building of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ten years have passed since the publication of the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This decade has been annals of victory and glory in which validity and vitality of the ideas and theories advanced in the work have been fully demonstrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has been a proud course in which the might of the driving force of the Korean revolution has been considerably increased. That might has reached the highest level under the unique army-based policy of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last one decade has been a period of heroic struggle when the socialist principles have been adhered to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has also been marked with leaping advances and innovations as a vista has been opened for the march toward the building of a socialist economic power in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the past ten years proves in practice that the army-based policy is the most powerful mode of politics in our era, which makes it possible to successfully carry out the WPK's general line for the building of socialism.    \r\n\r\n"

It is an irresistible basic trend of our times, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The common desire and struggle of the progressives advocating independence are a decisive factor of opposing all the oppressive forces including imperialism, colonialism and dominationism and radically changing the appearance of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their struggle means a struggle against imperialism, the biggest dominationist forces opposed to independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists consider aggression and interference as the goal of their foreign policy and threaten and encroach upon the sovereignty of other countries and nations in pursuance of this policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary struggle alone can put an end to all sorts of subjugation and shackles including class and national exploitation and oppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent development of the country and nation would have been unthinkable without a struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence against imperialism represents a banner of the people's struggle at the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The global independence is steadily progressing thanks to the efforts of the people to destroy the old order of domination and subjugation and realize independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic trend of the history which no force on earth can ever stem.    \r\n\r\n"

It called upon the 70 million fellow countrymen to wage a nation-wide patriotic movement for reunification to open up an epoch-making phase for the independent national reunification under the uplifted banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Political parties and organizations in the north, south and abroad heartily responded to this call. And people from all walks of life including representatives of various political parties and social organizations, workers, farmers, intellectuals, youth and students held meetings at which they demonstrated once again the reunification will of the fellow countrymen to promote reconciliation and unity and opening the door of national reunification at any cost by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the 2001 grand festival for national reunification held in august in a peculiar manner. It was the biggest national meeting in the history of festivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The festival brought together hundreds of representatives from each of the north, south and overseas sides. This involved solidarity stage of youth for reunification in the new century, a joint performance of artistes from the north, south and abroad, meetings of businessmen, religionists, workers and farmers of the north and the south and a forum of women of the north and the south for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These events clearly proved the Koreans are a homogeneous nation that cannot live separated from each other and they can surely accelerate the reunification if they get reconciled and united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year also witnessed various functions for reunification such as a grand seminar for national reunification to commemorate the 1st anniversary of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a may day meeting of the workers of the north and the south for reunification and a meeting of farmers of the north and the south for reunification which were held frequently on an unprecedented scale.    \r\n\r\n"
