But it is a very sensitive political issue of global nature as it is related to Japan's approach towards its past war of aggression and the issue of the damage done to the Asians and hints at the way to be followed by it in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy placing visits to the shrine on a regular political basis the ultra right conservative forces of Japan seek to infuse strong militarist idea into the Japanese to keep them ready to go out for a war of aggression any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the Japanese reactionaries are bringing into bolder relief their true colors as cobra-like militarists and arrogantly insisting that they are taking the road chosen by them, lending a deaf ear to the Asian countries' opposition to the visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing Japan of stepping up in real earnest the arms buildup including nuclear weaponization and the introduction of the missile defense system and the advance of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" overseas under the pretext of \"security,\" the commentary warns this would only precipitate its isolation and ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It marked a great event which provided basic principles and ways for accomplishing the cause of reunification to the compatriots and brought about a new turn in the movement for national reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article dedicated to the 33rd anniversary of the historic July 4 joint statement. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity are the programme for national reunification which laid down the fundamental cornerstone for solving the problem of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence is the fundamental one to be maintained in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the principle of independence is observed in the efforts to accomplish the cause of national reunification is it possible to settle the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans in line with their demand for independence and fundamental interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for national reunification would be unthinkable without national independence as it is aimed at solving the issue of the nation. Outsiders will never make a present of reunification to the Korean nation because they seek their own interests. This is the reason why the principle of independence becomes a cornerstone for solving the problem of the nation and a fundamental principle to govern the struggle for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of peaceful reunification clarified the basic ways for solving the issue of reunification as unanimously desired by all the compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south recognized the common points in the north side's proposal of low-level federacy and the south side's commonwealth proposal in the June 15 joint declaration and agreed to work for reunification in this direction. This constitutes a step forward in the efforts to accomplish the cause of reunification by applying the principle of peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity is guidelines for action as it calls on all the Koreans to unite as one under the banner of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans are now pushing forward the process of reconciliation and reunification, united as one in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity serve indeed as a great programme for reunification common to the nation in line with the will and desire of the nation for reunification and the country's reality and an immortal banner for accomplishing the cause of national reunification, the article stresses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also babbled that G-8 would sympathize with the position of Japan. \r\n A political aim Japan pursues on the occasion of the summit of G-8 is to meddle in the settlement of the nuclear issue of world concern to implant in the international community the cognition that Japan does its share and speak for the U.S. stand to create favorable conditions for its bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council, observes Minju Joson Monday in a signed commentary.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot but be a revelation of inveterate habit peculiar to Japan. No country can match Japan in finding other's fault to draw water to its mill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula is not a matter for such an insincere and clumsy political dwarf as Japan to deal with. So it is desirable that Japan may step aside to see the settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will certainly pay a high price for interfering in the process of resolving the nuclear issue by the relay method of what the U.S. says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless behavior of Japan will result in taking its participation into consideration even in case the six-party talks resume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should bear in mind that it needs for Japan to stop the foolish act.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
