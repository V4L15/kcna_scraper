            "content": "Vicious challenge to peace under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The United States reportedly plans to reorganise its forces in South Korea and set up and expand the commanding and control, military training and other establishments till the year 2010. it also plans to build apartment houses in military bases on a large scale to accommodate more families of U.S. servicemen.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today describes the new military measures as moves to perpetuate the U.S. military presence in South Korea and round off the preparations to provoke another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"threat\" from the DPRK is sophism intended to justify its military presence in South Korea and persistently pursue the policy of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the DPRK but the U.S. that increases the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. forces in South Korea are a U.S. detached force of aggression, not a \"war deterrent force,\" as evidenced by the testimonies made by Americans. The U.S. seeks to unleash a new war with South Korea as a forward base and the U.S. forces in South Korea as the main force, swallow up the whole of Korea and, furthermore, put Asia under its military domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by this design, it is keen to escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula at any cost so as to perpetuate its military presence in South Korea and invent a new pretext to ignite a new Korean war. The DPRK wants peace, not a war. So, the DPRK strongly demands that the U.S. pull its forces out of South Korea. As long as the U.S. forces remain in South Korea, it is impossible to preserve peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and clear it of the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces pullback from South Korea is a yardstick showing the U.S. attitude toward war and peace. If the U.S. truly wants to work for peace on the Korean peninsula, there is no reason whatsoever for the U.S. to refuse to withdraw its forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not put spurs to the war preparations, but drop the anachronistic Korea policy and take its hands off South Korea at once.    \r\n\r\n"
