This is the height of shamelessness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the outset of its office the Lee Myung Bak group brought forward an anti-reunification proposal for confrontation such as \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 U.S. dollars,\" pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, and thus upset overnight the inter-Korean relations which had developed in favor of national reconciliation, unity and reunification through an all-out offensive for confrontation with it.

This is nothing but a ridiculous jargon of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" This is evidenced by the present reality in which the inter-Korean relations are in the worst phase since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and manifold ordeals and difficulties are lying in the way of national reunification, the greatest desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Facts patently prove that the Lee group only seeks to realize its criminal ambition to stifle fellow countrymen and achieve \"unification through the invasion of the north\", backed by the United States, utterly indifferent to the efforts to improve the  inter-Korean relations and achieve peaceful reunification."

It is preposterous, therefore, for Japan to raise a hue and cry over the \"threat\" from the DPRK as it is nothing but a cynical ploy to justify Tokyo's militarist moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the fact that the Japanese reactionaries again claimed in the white paper that Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, belongs to Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said lie told by them only betrays their sinister intention to seize it anytime.

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday warns this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Late in the 1990s the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters designated Hinomaru and Kimigayo, synonyms for aggression, war, genocide, plunder and destruction, as an official national flag and song. They are now using them for inciting militarism on a legitimate basis and launching overseas aggression in real earnest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the outset of the new century Japan has frantically stepped up militarization under the zealous support and patronage of its U.S. master and intensified the overseas advance of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) and military operations in combat areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Defense Agency was upgraded to a ministry, the plan for establishing a missile defense system zealously pushed forward, an operation commanding system of the SDF was set up to wage a modern warfare and Japan's plan for the militarization of space has reached a phase of its implementation, etc. All these moves patently show what phase the Japanese militarists' reinvasion hysteria has reached. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the showy signboard of \"contribution to peace,\" the Japanese reactionaries adopted various war legislations, paving a wide avenue for the SDF's overseas military operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have gone the lengths of openly disclosing their scenario for making a preemptive strike at the \"missile launching base\" of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By forcing Japanese to hoist Hinomaru and sing Kimigayo, they seek to infuse into the Japanese youth and children sort of pride of the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression, nostalgia about militarism and determination to retrieve the defeat they suffered in the past. They are putting visits to \"Yasukuni Shrine\" on a regular and popular basis and busy distributing reactionary films and publications and other propaganda materials in a bid to turn Japanese society to the Right and militarize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a matter of time that the Japanese militarists revived and rearmed will embark upon the road of Asian reinvasion flying Hinomaru and singing Kimigayo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Japanese reactionaries should draw a proper lesson from the history of the defeat suffered by the Japanese imperialists in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days in the 20th century when they went on the rampage in the world, chanting the slogan of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese reactionaries launch overseas aggression at any cost, they will meet only a miserable end."

It is the most just line of economic construction as it makes it possible to give play to the might of the of the DPRK's economic structure with main emphasis on defence industry and heavy industry and ensure the rapid development of all other fields  with it as a driving force. The validity of this line is proved with added clarity as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Songun politics reflects the clairvoyant wisdom of General Secretary Kim Jong Il who foresees far distant future of the country and his courageous mettle of carving out its morrow with strong faith of independence and pluck. It also reflects his personality as a great man as he has always provided rich and prosperous future, firmly believing in the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Songun is so deeply rooted in the minds of the servicepersons and the people that it is inseparable from socialism in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the Korean people Songun means independence, dignity, future and a banner for the prosperity of the generations to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm faith and will of the army and people in the DPRK to wage a more dynamic struggle, true to the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il, and thus bring earlier the day when the shouts of hurrah for the victory in the drive for building a great prosperous powerful nation will resound forth on this land."
