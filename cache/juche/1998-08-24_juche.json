They are also making the most of pumping and other facilities needed for drainage.\r\n   A work to rehabilitate the railways, roads and telecommunication networks destroyed by strong rainy winds and downpours is now underway.\r\n   Workers in land and environment protection and city management domains strive to overcome natural damage.\r\n   Relief work, as well as restoration, is brisk in the afflicted areas.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

The triumphant progress is unthinkable without the  leader Kim Jong Il, a resolute defender of the sovereignty of the DPRK.\r\n   Finding out the basic way of defending the sovereignty of the country and nation in military power, he mercilessly punishes the enemies with a strong politico-military strike, whenever they intensify their offensive to make a mockery of the Korean nation.\r\n   A helicopter gunboat of the U.S. imperialists was shot down by a people's army soldier on guard, when it was intruding into the territorial air space of the DPRK on December 17, Juche 83 (1994). With a view to destroying socialism of Korea and reducing the people to their slaves with any means and methods the enemies committed that crime when the whole country was overwhelmed with the biggest grief at the death of Kim Il Sung, the father of the nation.\r\n   That day, informed of this, Kim Jong Il, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, told commanding officers of the KPA that this showed the mettle of the Korean people to the U.S. aggressors. He went on to say this proved in practice that the declaration of the DPRK that the DPRK would never tolerate the aggressors, if they dare invade its territorial land, airspace and seas was not empty talk. This was a stern punishment to the U.S. aggressors who were stepping up new war preparations behind the curtain of the DPRK-U.S. talks, he added.\r\n   The rackets kicked up by the U.S. imperialists in the wake of the armed spyship \"Pueblo\" incident (1968), the reconnaissance plane \"EC-121\" incident (1969) and \"Panmunjom\" incident (1976) and the clamour for \"nuclear inspection\" and the threat of \"collective sanctions\" became impotent, when they were confronted with merciless military strikes of the supreme commander.\r\n   The Supreme Commander said it was his will to give a thousandfold retaliatory punishment to the enemies when they dare pounce upon the Korean people. With such a spirit and grit he leads the whole party and all the people to pull through difficulties.\r\n   The triumphant progress in the \"arduous march\" and the on-going forced march of socialism caused by the continued campaign of the enemies to isolate and stifle the DPRK and years of big difficulties and natural disasters has been guaranteed by the spirit and grit of the Supreme Commander.\r\n   All the Korean people, aware that that spirit of his is almighty in pulling through all the difficulties, are firmly defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, rallied close around him.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
