            "content": "U.S. Forces' Relocation Operation under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- Papers in Pyongyang Friday comment on the plan for the relocation of the U.S. forces overseas published by Bush on August 16. They dismiss it as one molded by the policy of strength of the new conservative forces to maintain and enlarge the U.S. domination over the world with modern mobile forces.\r\n A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun says the relocation operation, an offspring of unilateralism and arbitrariness, is a phase of global practice of the U.S. \"doctrine of preemptive attack\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws special attention is that the operation is focused on the Asia-Pacific region. The U.S. has argued that the 21st century will be an Asia-Pacific century. Now it is granting special importance to this region in its military strategic redeployment. Its plan to transfer its troops present in south Korea to the area south of Seoul is aimed to set the stage for the preparation of a preemptive strike at the DPRK, while reducing its losses to the minimum in case of \"contingency\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLurking behind the relocation operation is also the intention to impress its allies displeased with the U.S. unilateralism and hegemonism and thus make them obedient to it and pull them into the fulfillment of its strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, however, a foolish ruse to try to veil its aggressive nature with the relocation of its forces overseas and realize its wild ambition for world supremacy through the strategy of mobile forces and expansion of the \"anti-terrorism war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. new conservative forces persist in their unilateral policy of interference, the evil cycle of terrorism and retaliation will go from bad to worse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group had better give up its deceitful jugglery camouflaged with \"relocation\" and \"reduction\" of its forces, take its aggression forces back to their lair from south Korea and all other areas and leave all the countries to live their own way. The army and people of the DPRK will hold higher the banner of Songun line and bend all efforts to increase its self-reliant defence capabilities in every way against the reckless strategy of preemptive attack of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Minju Joson news analyst says that the U.S. doctrine of preemptive attack and its practical move compel those countries which feel their danger to build their own deterrent force. Under this condition, the DPRK either has no alternative but to take necessary countermeasures, he states. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK will continue to hold high the banner of Songun. as long as imperialism remains on the earth and there is danger of aggression posed by it, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe governor of Arequipa Province of Peru, addressing the opening ceremony of the exhibition said he was deeply impressed by the unique Songun policy pursued by Kim Jong Il.

            "content": "Accomplishment of Songun Revolutionary Cause Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 27 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Friday carries a lengthy signed article titled \"It is high pride of the army and people of the DPRK to successfully carry forward the great Songun tradition.\"\r\n The Songun revolutionary tradition of the Workers' Party of Korea serves as a powerful weapon which gives a strong impetus to the advance of the Korean revolution in the 21st century, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun tradition has tremendous vitality as it was created and developed in depth in the crucible of the unprecedentedly difficult and complicated revolutionary struggle and has been proven in the practice of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun tradition is an eternal treasure for the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung laid down the principle of attaching importance to military affairs based on the Juche idea for the first time in history and led the Juche-based revolutionary cause of Songun on that basis. A revolution starts and is carried to completion by an invincible military force, all achievements of the revolution are possible thanks to armed forces and protected and glorified by them and top priority should be given to military affairs in the revolution. These were the principle and formula of revolution he clarified in the period of the anti-Japanese revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis principle serves as a foundation that supports all contents of the Songun tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foundation of the philosophy on the army marked a historic event as it meant the beginning of the great revolutionary struggle to defeat the most wicked and formidable imperialist enemies with the youngest revolutionary forces. The anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle was a great revolutionary one that brought about a victory, guided by the Juche-oriented idea of attaching importance to arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of Songun revolution set out by the President served as a starting point in working out the line, principle, strategy and tactics of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the Songun tradition that has been successfully carried forward, the article says that it is leader Kim Jong Il who has creditably carried forward and developed the anti-Japanese Songun tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary history is one of the great illustrious commander and statesman who has led the struggle for carrying forward and completing the Juche cause to victory in reliance upon the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the \"Arduous March\" when the Korean revolution was caught in the cleft stick he embarked upon the long journey of Songun and led the struggle to defend socialism to victory. He chose the road of Songun at the historic crossroads of military or economy, a manifestation of the high sense of his mission to shoulder upon himself the destiny of the country and the nation to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the genius of revolution as he has developed in depth the President's idea of attaching importance to the military affairs and laid down guidelines for the Songun era. He, endowed with clairvoyant wisdom and insight, extraordinary thinking and pursuit and rare ability to analyze and judge things, scientifically ascertained the justice and greatness and universality of the President's Songun idea and clarified its essential contents and requirements. The ideas and theories set out by  Kim Jong Il in the era of Songun have immensely enriched the ideological and theoretical treasure-house of mankind. They include the theory of turning the revolutionary army into the army strong in idea and faith and into a matchless army, the conception of forming the revolutionary forces with the revolutionary army as a core force, the idea of building the economy centering on national defence industry, and building Songun revolutionary culture, the theory of transforming the society on the pattern of the idea, spirit, virtue and fighting spirit created by the revolutionary army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is a peerless statesman who formulated the unique and basic socialist political mode based on the President's Songun revolutionary tradition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He successfully applied to the present reality the President's unique revolutionary leadership formula whereby he led the revolution and construction by giving priority to the army and formulated it as a perfect basic socialist political mode, Songun political mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the bright prospect of the Songun tradition and the Korean revolution, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun tradition constitutes the core of the revolutionary traditions of the WPK.\r\n The Juche ideological system, indomitable revolutionary spirit, noble exploits and a wealth of experience in struggle, the revolutionary work method and popular work style which form the contents of the WPK's revolutionary traditions were created in the course of blazing a trail of the arduous Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's Songun tradition is strictly based on the Juche principle and faith. The noble spiritual world of the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners was characterized by the strong independent will to carry the revolution to completion by their own efforts, not with someone's support or aid, their high sense of self-esteem not to tolerate those who infringe upon the national dignity and their ardent patriotic spirit of devoting themselves to the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful inheritance of the Songun revolutionary tradition provides a sure guarantee for winning a decisive victory in the fierce confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun tradition was established in the crucible of the fierce struggle against imperialism and the class enemies on which hinged the destiny of the country and the nation. Reflected in the Songun revolutionary tradition is the firm class viewpoint that neither concession nor retreat should be allowed in the struggle against the enemies who brandish swords and an unshakable will to settle accounts with them once they fight them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fighting a fierce battle to defend socialism on which hinges the destiny of the nation. Sound mentality and the readiness to wage a life-and death-struggle against the imperialists and the U.S. would serve as the best weapon in this struggle. The army and people of the DPRK will be able to successfully carry forward the ever-victorious traditions of the Korean revolution only when they fight just as the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners did in the spirit that they would surely wipe out the enemy though they might die a thousand deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The road of revolution to be covered by the DPRK in the new century is the journey of Songun the President started with two pistols, the article says, underscoring the need for the army and people of the DPRK to defend the glorious Songun tradition and add shine to it under the leadership of Kim Jong Il and thus accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche started on Mt. Paektu.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It means only making a person insane or killing him or her can be considered to be torture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of this cruel logic, the U.S. Department of Defense in March 2003 worked out an unethical defense report stipulating that such torture is not illegal as it was ordered by the U.S. president, and has instigated U.S. soldiers to brutal murder and torture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact shows that U.S. human rights abuses, a target of worldwide denunciation, have been legalized as a state policy under the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the middle of the last century the fascist states, prompted by an ambition for world supremacy, invented various evil laws to legalize torture and murder against other nations. But in the 21st century the Bush administration, which declared human slaughter as a state policy, is the general headquarters of human rights violations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous for the U.S. to style itself a \"champion of human rights\" and \"defender of liberty\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should not desecrate the term of \"human rights\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
