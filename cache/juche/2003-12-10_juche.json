            "content": "Spokesman of DPRK Foreign Ministry on Issue of Resumption of Six-Way Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards a wide range of opinions worldwide on the issue of the resumption of the six-way talks:\r\n The DPRK's principled stand on the resumption of the six-way talks has been known well on various occasions and it remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the life and soul to rely on the method of a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions in the settlement of the nuclear issue and it is the core issue upon which the DPRK and the United States should agree. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Focussing on this matter, we have, in fact, made many concessions so far for an early resumption of the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. feels uncomfortable with the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S., we clarified that we are ready to accept the proposal for giving \"written security assurances\" made by President Bush if it presupposes the U.S. co-existence with the DPRK in peace and acceptance of our proposal for a simultaneous package solution to the nuclear issue. And we expressed a magnanimous view that if the U.S. is concerned over the phraseology of simultaneous actions, we can accept an expression favored by the U.S. as long as there is no change in its content. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through a New York contact channel on Nov. 1 we directly conveyed to the U.S. side our stand to resume the second round of the six-way talks early in December. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This stand of ours, we believe, has been properly conveyed to the U.S. side through a series of channels in the meantime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have so far expected that the U.S. administration would answer our magnanimity with good faith. According to what is now afloat and what we hear, the U.S. stood is greatly disappointing us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to work hard to completely eliminate our nuclear deterrent force by giving just a piece of paper called \"written security assurances.\" In fact, it is no more than a commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unthinkable for us to allow ourselves to be disarmed believing in the lukewarm commitment of the U.S., the hostile partner, under the present situation where the U.S. forces are still present in south Korea and putting spurs to the arms buildup targeted against the DPRK in south Korea and around the Korean peninsula, to say nothing of the belligerent relationship between the DPRK and the U.S. that has lasted for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. has just legislated on the research into the manufacture of smaller nukes leveled at the DPRK and made a huge budgetary allocation for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent goal set by the DPRK from long ago to denuclearize the Korean peninsula. But we are compelled to have a nuclear deterrent force today. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. nuclear threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. stand to reason, it should have completely removed the military threat to   the DPRK in a verifiable and irreversible manner before the latter moved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, however, proposed a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions as the basic way of settling the nuclear issue, prompted by the fair and aboveboard intention to build confidence through the simultaneous practical actions on the part of the two sides. Our stand is not confined to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our stand is to agree upon the first-phase action by making \"words for words\" commitment at the next round of the six-way talks at least if the U.S. is not in a position to accept our proposal for a package solution at one time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, measures such as the U.S. delisting the DPRK as a \"terrorism sponsor\", lift of the political, economic and military sanctions and blockade and energy aid including the supply of heavy fuel oil and electricity by the U.S. and neighbouring countries should be taken in exchange for the DPRK's freeze of nuclear activities. This would lay a foundation for furthering the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is clear is that in no case the DPRK would freeze its nuclear activities unless it is rewarded. We have already clarified this proposal to all sides to the talks by various methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason whatsoever for the U.S. not to accept the principle of simultaneous actions if it sincerely wants to co-exist with the DPRK peacefully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the six-way talks in the future entirely depends on whether an agreement will be reached on the DPRK-proposed first-phase step or not.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

On December 1 he signed a bill on lifting the ban on researches into smaller nukes and providing budgetary funding to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is alarmed at such grave developments that bills on nuclear war financially guaranteeing the full-scale moves of the Bush administration toward a nuclear war were worked out one after another, approved and legitimized immediately in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan Times said the U.S. decision to seek the development of nuclear weapons of a new generation is a mistaken one which has dealt another blow to the NPT system which is already staggering. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese Mainichi Shimbun quoted the first deputy chief of the General Staff of the Russian Army as stating that the new nuclear development to be promoted by Russia is unavoidable as it is a countermeasure toward the U.S., saying \"nuclear weapons were considered to be a political deterrent in the past, but are now going to be weapons in battlefields. It is terrible.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. Congressional Research Service already voiced concern and warning and the world community and media commented, the U.S. projected development of smaller nukes is an utterly adventurous plan for a nuclear war that would plunge the world into a horrible nuclear disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The legalization of the development of smaller nukes to carry into practice the Bush administration's rash strategy of preemptive nuclear attack by laws such as the law on defense expenditure clearly shows once again that the U.S. loud-mouthed \"nuclear non-proliferation\" is a hypocritical call to restrict and neutralize the self-defensive nuclear deterrent of other countries and thus secure the military position as the only superpower and that the U.S. is, indeed, a nuclear fanatic and a rogue state threatening peace and security of humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nothing but balderdash can be heard from this guy and no one, therefore, would lend an ear to his tongue wagging. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This ugly looking man is completely unable to judge what is going on. Yet the south Korean authorities are using him for their sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but call this dishonest behavior to question. They only betrayed their awkward position by instigating Hwang to cry out for the so-called \"solution\" to such crucial political issue as the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities only laid bare their true colors by letting this good-for-nothing talk nonsense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang committed too hideous crimes that he was afraid of taking a back alley. Recently he toured the U.S. and is strutting about, having interviews with foreign media. This was possible only under the protection of the present south Korean authorities and thanks to the prearranged script of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present south Korean authorities transferred him to a new place from the Intelligence Service in a bid to goad him into letting loose anti-north vituperation with bitterer grudge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shame on the nation that such human scum as Hwang is still at large. To patronize and use him is an anti-national criminal act of bedevilling the inter-Korean relations and going against the nation's desire for exchange, cooperation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a common sense that a failure to see through everything from a national stand and properly deal with it would result in playing into the hands of foreign forces and the traitors to the nation and bringing the inter-Korean relations to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts go to prove that the south Korean authorities are neither interested in the improvement of inter-Korean relations, nor have any willingness to have dialogue with the north and settle the nuclear issue but have the same wrong way of thinking as Hwang's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should behave in a responsible manner from a national stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical to talk about dialogue, contact, reconciliation and cooperation while letting renegade and traitor Hwang defile the system and dignity of the dialogue partner and cry out for \"overthrowing\" the system in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never sit idle in case the south Korean authorities allow Hwang to slander again the system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
