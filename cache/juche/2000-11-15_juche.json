If the old idea of invading and dominating other countries is further incited among the Japanese reactionaries and put into practice, humankind will again suffer horrible disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Conniving and tolerating Japan's wrong attitude not to redeem its past crimes is little short inviting misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether Japan becomes a full-fledged member of the international community or finds itself in a tight corner, condemned by the world depends on its attitude. \r\n\r\n"

Korean naval warships commit military provocation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- South Korean naval warships committed a serious military provocation on November 14 by illegally intruding into the territorial waters of the north side, according to military sources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At around 8:30 a.m. that day four naval warships intruded deep into the territorial waters of the north side west of Jangsan cape by sailing among several fishing boats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n As a patrol boat of the navy of the Korean People's Army promptly sailed to the waters, the warships got ready for action after leaving the fishing boats behind. Three South Korean naval warships left Paekryong islet for the territorial waters of the north to join those warships, as if they had been waiting for the chance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Scared by the prompt sailing of the KPA naval patrol boat, those warships fled southward in a flurry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar intrusion into those territorial waters of the north side was committed on November 5, 6 and 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these grave military provocations committed against the north cannot be construed otherwise than deliberate and premeditated maneuvers of the South Korean military authorities to stop the situation from turning favorable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The navy of the Korean People's Army is highly alerted and keeps itself fully ready for action to cope with the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities will be wholly responsible for the consequences to be entailed by the military provocations in the west sea. \r\n\r\n"
