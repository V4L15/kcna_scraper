Korea\r\n Pyongyang, February 19 (KCNA) -- The Park Geun Hye regime of south Korea announced on Feb. 7 that it would negotiate with the U.S. for the deployment of THAAD in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on it, south Korean media termed the negotiations a gesture for clinching the deal, claiming that Washington and Seoul have already thrashed out such issues as deployment and operation expenses, site for deployment and offer of its infrastructure through informal contacts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that deployment of THAAD sparking concerns of Asian countries has entered the phase of execution after going beyond the stage of discussion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD, which Lockheed Martin developed and steadily increased its firing range with an investment of tens of millions dollars for years, is known to be capable of intercepting ultra supersonic objects flying even in outer space. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The range of the X-band radar, its main component, reportedly covers thousands of kilometers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case THAAD is deployed in south Korea, the sphere of U.S. military domination will extend to the depth of the Asian continent only to trigger off a hot arms race for developing cutting-edge weapons and escalate military tensions in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime is set to play a flagship role in carrying out the brigandish and hegemonic scenario of the U.S. to neutralize with MD system the military offensive capability of rapidly developing Asian countries, notably the regional powers, and establish the sphere of political, economic and military control in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling Asian countries trade partners and the like in public, the Park regime is unhesitatingly bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the people in the region behind the scene, pursuant to the scenario of the U.S. It is as sly as a herd of foxes, the unpardonable common enemy of the Asian people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is justifying the deployment of THAAD under the pretext of \"threat from nuclear weapons and missiles\" of the DPRK. But no one will be taken in by such sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strong war deterrent for self-defence of the DPRK is means of justice for punishing the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean puppet regime persists in its puppy-like behavior, calculating that it can stifle the compatriots in the north and attain all other ill-advised purposes with the backing of outsiders, it will only precipitate their ruin when a merciless war of justice is launched by the service personnel and people of the DPRK against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political and military tensions to be ratcheted by the deployment of THAAD will inevitably lead to physical conflicts and, in this case, south Korea, a nuclear outpost of the U.S. for realizing its strategy for dominating the Asia-Pacific, will become a primary target of the neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the deployment of THAAD will only precipitate the self-destruction of the south Korean puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime would be well advised to face up to the reality and stop running riot."

            "content": "ACNC califica de autodestruccion intento de emplazar THAAD en territorio surcoreano\r\nPyongyang, 19 de febrero (ACNC) -- El pasado dia 7, la banda surcoreana de Park Geun-hye publico oficialmente que realizara con su amo norteamericano la consulta para emplazar el sistema antimisiles THAAD en el suelo surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, los medios de prensa surcoreanos revelan que ya en los contactos informales anteriores, Estados Unidos y el Sur de Corea discutieron en detalles los asuntos de gastos del emplazamiento de THAAD, la carga de gastos de gestion, el ofrecimiento de terreno y establecimientos basicos, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho demuestra que el emplazamiento de THAAD, que provoca gran preocupacion de los paises asiaticos, no esta en discusion sino se pone en la practica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl sistema antimisiles THAAD fue desarrollado por la compania estadounidense Lockheed Martin. Durante varios anos ultimos se ha aumentado su alcance de tiro gastando decenas de millones de US$. Es reconocido como armamento capaz de atacar hasta las aeronaves supersonicas fuera de espacio atmosferico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDicen que la distancia de deteccion de radar de la banda de frecuencia X, componente principal de THAAD es de miles de km.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de emplazarse el THAAD en el suelo surcoreano, la esfera de alcance militar de EE.UU. se ampliara a la profundidad del continente asiatico, se agudizara la carrera armamentista y la de desarrollo de armas sofisticados y se aumentara la tension militar en la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park Geun-hye actua como brigada de choque para el cumplimiento de las maniobras hegemonicas de EE.UU. tendentes a neutralizar con el sistema antimisiles la capacidad de ataque militar de los paises asiaticos en desarrollo vertiginoso, en particular, las potencias regionales y tomar el control politico, economico y militar en esta region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park Geun-hye, enemiga comun de los paises asiaticos, les preconizan como acompanantes comerciales mientras les acarrean el nubarron de la guerra nuclear sumandose a las maniobras de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos justifican el emplazamiento de THAAD pretextando la \"amenaza nuclear y de misil\" de la RPDC. Pero, ningun pais sera enganado por esta sofisteria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fuerte disuasivo de guerra de autodefensa de la RPDC constituye un medio para castigar al imperialismo norteamericano, enemigo jurado de la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas los titeres surcoreanos actuen con imprudencia con la ilusion de obtener todos sus designios incluso el aplastamiento a la parte connacional bajo el amparo de su amo norteamericano tanto mas seran objetos de primer castigo despiadada de nuestro militares y civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tension politica y militar que se agravara por el emplazamiento de THAAD en el suelo surcoreano no puede excluir los conflictos fisicos. Y en este caso, el suelo surcoreano, convertido en la base avanzada nuclear a favor del cumplimiento de la estrategia hegemonica de EE.UU. sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico, sera el primer blanco de ataque de los paises perifericos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, el emplazamiento de THAAD en el Sur de Corea adelantara la autodestruccion de los titeres surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park Geun-hye debe actuar con prudencia teniendolo presente."
