This is sophism enough to make even a cat laugh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As he holds the post of the U.S. Secretary of State, he should know the historical facts that once joint military exercises were suspended after the U.S. complied with the demand of the DPRK for it and that those exercises have been one of major causes that made the hard-won DPRK-U.S. agreements go bust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. joint military exercises on the Korean peninsula are not attributable to the DPRK's access to nukes but because the U.S. steadily increased nuclear threats while ceaselessly holding war exercises for aggression, the DPRK was compelled to opt for having access to nuclear deterrence and bolster it up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true aim sought by the U.S. is to shift the blame for the tension on the Korean peninsula on to the DPRK, secure a pretext for its arms buildup and joint military exercises pursuant to its rebalancing strategy in Asia-Pacific for aggression, and dodge the neighboring countries' protest and criticism of its decision to deploy THAAD in south Korea as an immediate task.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can predict what situation the U.S. reckless arms buildup and the upcoming August joint military exercises will create on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. frantic hostile policy toward the DPRK will prompt the DPRK to do everything it can to defend its sovereignty and dignity, and the U.S. will be held accountable for all the ensuing consequences."
