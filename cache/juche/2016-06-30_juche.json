Pero, en realidad, EE.UU. es el autor que provoca y amenaza a la RPDC y viola flagrantemente la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSignifica una provocacion la entrada en el Sur de Corea y su contorno del submarino nuclear Mississippi, los bombarderos estrategicos B-52H y otras muchas propiedades estrategicas de EE.UU. Y la amenaza esta en los sucesivos ejercicios de guerra nuclear para atacar a la RPDC que tienen lugar bajo el rotulo de \"la operacion de descabezamiento\", que toma por su blanco la Direccion de la RPDC, y \"la de ocupacion de Pyongyang\", etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya hemos aclarado en la carta enviada al secretario general de la ONU, ?donde esta la ley internacional que estipula que la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de cohete balistico constituyen amenaza para la paz y seguridad del mundo?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos tomando una tras otra las medidas para el fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear frente a EE.UU. que recurre a la amenaza nuclear y provocacion contra nuestro pais violando flagrantemente la Carta de la ONU y las leyes internacionales. Esto es natural y justo procedimiento de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, no obtiene el visto bueno en la arena internacional el escandalo que estan armando la Casa Blanca, el Departamento de Estado y el Departamento de Defensa de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, EE.UU. libra ahora la campana internacional para expresar \"preocupacion\" por el lanzamiento de \"Hwasong-10\" instigando a los paises satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlgunos paises se suman a ello \"publicando la posicion\" sin criterio propio y con actitud confusa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi ellos no saben guardar el decoro de Estado soberano y cometen el acto totalmente inutil para la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tObservaremos la conducta miserable de esos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad de las catastroficas consecuencias recaera totalmente a EE.UU. y sus satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs absurda la actitud de EE.UU. que menciona el problema de dialogo obstinandose por otra parte en la campana internacional para aislar y aplastar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica de hostilidad no es compatible con ningun dialogo. Esto es la posicion de nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lo adelante, la RPDC fortalecera continuamente en lo cuantitativo y cualitativo el disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo en correspondencia a las hostilidades de EE.UU."
