Only when the anti-reunification evil law is abolished and the U.S. troops quit can the South Korean people become masters and can independent and peaceful reunification be achieved, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops and their bases in South Korea are chiefly responsible for the continued division of Korea, the failure to implement the June 15 joint declaration, and economic stagnation, to say nothing of tremendous damage done to the civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on the alliance to take the lead in the anti-U.S. struggle to probe the truth about mass killings of civilians by GIs and certainly have the Koreans' land returned.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA demands withdrawal of U.S. troops from S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- A joint editorial issued by the newspapers of the Workers' Party of Korea, the Korean People's Army and the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League of the DPRK on the occasion of the New Year 2002 strongly urged the bellicose quarters of the imperialists to drop their attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK and immediately withdraw their aggression forces from South Korea.\r\n It is due to the U.S. anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and its forces' continued presence in South Korea that peace, stability and national reunification have not been achieved on the Korean peninsula though the world greeted the second year of the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration that emerged last year is escalating its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, much displeased with the progress made in the process to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations already in the period of the former government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This further strained the situation on the Korean peninsula last year and had a baneful impact on the inter-Korean relations that had been favorably developing since the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that though the U.S. is pretending to be interested in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and improved inter-Korean relations, talking about the end of the Cold War and global peace, it has, in actuality, not got rid of its way of thinking in the era of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a product of the cold war that Korea remains divided into two parts and the DPRK and the U.S. have been in the hostile relationship for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a long time since the Cold War, a reflection of the confrontation between the east and the west and the Soviet Union and the U.S., was over with the collapse of the Soviet Union in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has, therefore, an unavoidable obligation to eradicate the leftover of the cold war era on the Korean peninsula as a party responsible for its division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. drop of its hostile policy towards the DPRK, a conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea are the key issues in eradicating the above-said leftover on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop paying lip-service to the unconditional DPRK-U.S. dialogue and create a favorable atmosphere and condition for dialogue and drop the attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops should quit South Korea forthwith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To talk about the issue of \"reduction of conventional armed forces\" of the DPRK, keeping as ever the U.S. troops in South Korea, is nothing but a brigandish demand for totally disarming it in violation of its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops present in South Korea are the source of all misfortune and sufferings of the Korean people and their withdrawal from South Korea after the end of the Cold War is the job to be done by the U.S. before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to properly understand the Korean people's desire and will for national reunification and the historical needs of the international community and the times and show its will in its practical activities to solve the Korean issue.    \r\n\r\n"
