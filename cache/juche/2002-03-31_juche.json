There is no reason for the compatriots in the north and the south to fight each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is our revolutionary stand not to allow anyone to infringe upon our sovereignty and dignity, wantonly challenging our peace-loving efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war and their presence in South Korea are the basic factor of disturbing peace and barring the peaceful reunification of Korea and the root cause of bringing a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists are allowed to carry on their war moves and perpetuate their forces' presence in South Korea, a new war will engulf our country and put the nation's destiny and the future of our country in danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the DPRK failed to increase the national defence capability and follow an army-based policy, The U.S. imperialists would have ignited a new war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is a true patriotic policy to defend the nation's security and the country's peace. This has been clearly proved by the present reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is aimed to defend and glorify the socialist system and mount a fierce attack upon and deal merciless blows at the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n"
