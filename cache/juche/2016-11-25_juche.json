Then he had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Choe Ryong Hae and Ri Yong Gil."

Similar crimes targeting the black, Muslims and minorities have increased more than 67 percent, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last week alone, a black man opened fire at a policeman for no reason in San Antonio in Texas before taking to flight and ambush attacks against four policemen took place one after another in three states of the U.S., killing one and wounding three.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media comment this as retaliation against white policemen in Louisiana, Minnesota and Texas who \"hunted\" innocent black men after branding them as \"criminals\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The evil cycle of \"hatred-driven crimes\", murder, and retaliatory murder that stem from extreme racism and religious contradictions is an incurable malignant tumor grown by the reactionary social system in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People suffer from uneasiness and horror of being killed any moment, far from being protected, for the mere reason that they have colored skin and differing religious faith. This is a true picture of the American society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., kingpin of human rights abuses, has to worry about its own deplorable human rights situation, far from finding fault with the \"human rights performance\" in other countries."
