Kim Young Sam, the thief, is its \"President\" and exercises one-man dictatorship and the political, economic and social life as a whole is corrupt under the rule of Kim Young Sam and his son.\r\n   To overthrow the traitor Kim at an early date is the best way for justice in south Korean society. \r\n\r\n"
