He even described our fair policy for dialogue and negotiations as intended for \"development of the revolutionary situation\". He took the lead in raising the north's \"nuclear issue\" and in claiming that continued pressure should be put on the north to guide it to \"reforms\" and \"opening.\"\r\n   Worse still, in frequent interviews with \"social education broadcasting\" he systematically and maliciously slandered and defamed our party and our system. For his heinous crimes against the country and the nation he has been disqualified from taking the \"post of minister\" and he has lost the right to exist as member of the nation. \r\n   We cannot understand how this special class anti-reunification element was named for the post of minister of the unification board. This naming makes us doubtful about the south side's will for dialogue and reunification.\r\n   We, who value dialogue and negotiations between the north and the south, will watch the future attitude of the south. \r\n        \r\n\r\n"

The complex introduced more than 60 technological innovation proposals into production last year and saved 10,000 tons of coal and 576,000 kwh of electricity.\r\n   Railway transport workers have applied cement brake shoes to every wheel of carriages. The brake shoes are 3 times longer durable and 1.5 times more efficient than those made of pig iron. \r\n   The August 28 factory has introduced an electric slag furnace and an iron core induction furnace, decreasing the consumption of electric power 30 percent lower than the previous. In recent years it introduced hundreds of technological innovation proposals into production and produced 550 more loaders and 150 more electric cars for coal and ore mines, saving more than 800 tons of iron and steel and thousands of tons of coal.\r\n   The Kujang Area Coal Complex is increasing coal carriage two times the previous by a new transport method without using belt conveyers, winches and electricity in pits.\r\n \r\n"

Herein lies the profundity of the revolutionary strategy of the WPK and its great vitality. \r\n   The victory or defeat in confrontation with the counterrevolutionary forces is decided by the army taken by the party and the leader in their hands.\r\n   To annihilate those who dare to thrust their claws to the headquarters of the Korean revolution and become lifeguards of the supreme commander is the first mission and great honor of our army, the mainstay of revolution.\r\n   The army can never be matched in ideology, class consciousness, unity, combat power, fighting spirit and moral trait. \r\n   More than 50 years have passed since General Kim Jong Il was born as son of guerrillas and bright star of Mt. Paektu and over 30 years since he began the great leadership over the revolution. In the period he cultivated the strongest army in the world and built the eternal pillar of the Juche revolution with the idea of attaching importance to the military, the idea which was left over by President Kim Il Sung and woman General of Mt. Paektu Kim Jong Suk.  As the sacred revolutionary cause of President Kim Il Sung has been successfully carried forward in the 20th century by the invincible party and army, the cause of General Kim Jong Il, the cause of Mangyongdae and Mt. Paektu, will continue creditably in the 21st century on the strength of them.     \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Paektu \r\nPyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- The Mansudae Art Studio, a centre of creating fine art works in Korea, recently produced 40 odd fine art works portraying Mt. Paektu, the holy mountain of the Korean revolution.\r\n   Mt. Paektu (2,750 metres high) in the northern part of Korea is the holy place of the revolution and the cradle of the history of the Korean nation where  President Kim Il Sung waged the anti-Japanese armed struggle and brought the dawn of the liberation of the country.\r\n   Painters depicted the noted places and ever-changing weather phenomena of Mt. Paektu with diverse techniques of Korean painting.\r\n   The Korean painting \"Lightning above the Lake Chon of Mt. Paektu\" (145cm long and 97cm wide) created by people's artist Kim Song Min portrays a lightning above Mt. Paektu running into the Lake Chon, breaking through inky clouds. \r\n   The bright and sharp flash of lightning against a very black cloud seems to thunder and break gladiate cliffs around the Lake Chon.\r\n   The same-size Korean painting \"Flag-Shaped Cloud above Janggun Peak\" created by merited artist Ko Yong Gun portrays a fluttering flag-shaped cloud coloured red by glow above the Janggun Peak towering on the Lake Chon.\r\n   The same-size Korean paintings \"Twin rainbow peak on Mt. Paektu\" and \"Tiger Rock of Mt. Paektu\" vividly depict rocks of noted places with delicate and peculiar techniques.\r\n   Among art works are several large Korean paintings including \"Red Glow over the Lake Chon of Mt. Paektu\" (5m long and 1.8m wide) which was jointly created by people's artist Jong Yong Man and other painters.\r\n   Besides, the Korean paintings \"Owl Rock of Mt. Paektu\", \"Bears' Hill Rock of Mt. Paektu\" and \"Eagle Rock of Mt. Paektu\" are Reminiscent of a Zoo, and \"Tank Gun Cloud above Hyangdo Peak\" and \"Warship Cloud above Haeppal Peak\" shows natural wonders.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il saw these paintings and expressed great satisfaction with the creation of many fine art works of high ideological and artistic value, and gave thanks to the painters.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
