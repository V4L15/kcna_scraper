At the six-party talks, he noted, Bush insisted on the strategy of putting pressure on the DPRK while convincing it that it was \"isolated\" in the international community. But, in actuality, it is the U.S. and Japan that were isolated at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He ridiculed the U.S. act of ignoring the reasoning of other countries participating in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Senator Joseph Biden told a reporter that Bush's Korea policy had come a cropper. The U.S. needs to have direct talks with the DPRK for a solution to the nuclear issue, he said.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

We warn this to our posterity\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the mid-1860s the Korean people had emerged victorious in battles for sinking the pirate ship General Sherman and for repulsing armed invaders of the U.S. and European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On April 25, 1871, Taewongun (1820 - 1898), the then ruler of the feudal state of Ri Dynasty, saw to it that the monuments were erected in Seoul and other towns of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most of the monuments, however, were destroyed by the Japanese imperialist aggressors and Queen Min and other reactionary ruling quarters who were flunkeyists and capitulationists between 1882 and 1915. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The visitors to the house realize once again that the true nature of the U.S.-led imperialists will never change and harden their will to wipe out the aggressors once and for all.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
