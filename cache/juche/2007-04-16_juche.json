Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 14 (KCNA) -- GIs' crimes including sexual abuses have been committed in south Korea in an unbroken chain, sparking off strong social furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On April 5, two GIs in south Korea sexually abused a woman passerby in her thirties to be caught red-handed. No sooner had they been investigated by police than perpetrated a similar crime against a woman in her twenties. GIs committed such crimes against a woman in her sixties in Seoul in January and beat a taxi driver in Uijongbu in March before taking to flight by the taxi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceaseless hideous crimes committed by the GIs are products of their wrong idea of despising south Koreans and their arrogant and high-handed practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since their occupation of south Korea, the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces have committed plunder, murder and violence in the most brutal manner and imposed immeasurable misfortune and sufferings upon south Korean men and women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unheard-off massacres of civilians in Jeju, Rogun-ri and Maehyang-ri, the \"case of cutting the hair of a woman in Tongduchon short,\" the \"case of painting a woman in Uijongbu,\" the \"case of sexual abuse against a young girl\" and other crimes can be cited as examples. These atrocities that stunned the world were committed by the GIs stooped in extreme misanthropy and national chauvinism to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Murder, violence, plunder and other crimes never cease in south Korea entirely due to the U.S. forces' presence there. Whenever their crimes are brought to light, they stage such farce as uttering the words of \"apology\" and \"steps.\" But they are no more than a gimmick. That is why the number of the GIs' crimes in south Korea reached more than 100,000 cases for four decades since the shackling \"Status of Forces Agreement\" took effect and there occur at least five cases on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are the devils and a group of savage brutes ruthlessly abusing the rights of south Korean women and other people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only south Korea where women's chastity is now violated and many innocent people are killed by foreign aggressor forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest disgrace of the nation that the destiny of the south Korean people is mercilessly trampled down and women are exposed to outside forces' unbearable insult and humiliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea, Korea would not have been divided nor so many Koreans would have met tragic deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' presence in south Korea goes to prove that their bestial nature has not changed even a bit but will remain unchanged in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people will not be free from murder, rape, plunder and other misfortune and disasters as long as the U.S. forces remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should wage a more dynamic struggle to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea and sweep away pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors from the land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
