Such being the hard reality, the bush administration is poised to mount a military attack on the DPRK, pursuant to the hard-line policy to stifle it.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean police suppression of students condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the South Korean police headquarters announced that legal actions would be taken against graduates and students of a university in Seoul, for the mere reason that they formed an organization, distributed copies of a \"document praising the north\" and used them for teaching materials.\r\n Commenting on it, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of a ruthless repression of students and people's free choice of idea and free political activities. it is an intolerable anti-national criminal act of throwing a wet blanket over the fellow countrymen's desire for the reunification of the country and challenging the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of the Koreans for national reconciliation and unity and reunification is very strong now, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It shows the great vitality of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, which was solemnly proclaimed at home and abroad, as it calls for achieving the independent reunification of the country by the united efforts of the Korean nation, responsible for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the South Korean police authorities are incriminating and repressing students' activities beneficial to the implementation of the declaration, instead of encouraging them. This cannot but be an act of undisguisedly denying dialogue and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We bitterly denounce such repressive move, branding it as an intentional and criminal act of going against the spirit of the joint declaration and putting the brake on its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is the greatest desire and the most urgent task of all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad at present. Turning aside this issue and standing in the way of its solution will be condemned as a never-to-be-condoned crime.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. branded as rogue state of worst type in world \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed article terming the United States the rogue state of the worst type in the world.\r\n Referring to the U.S. government's number of \"grounds\" to label other countries as \"rogue states\", the article says: \r\n The first is the development of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is the very country which is to blame for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It ranks first in the world in the number of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons and missiles. It surpasses all other countries by far in their quantity and destruction power. it is the criminal state of the worst type which inflicted the most fatal calamities upon humankind by use of these weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It dropped atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, thus becoming the only and sole country in the world which used nuclear weapons against humankind for the first time in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Korean War, it repeatedly tried to use nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second is \"terrorism-sponsor.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an \"annual report on terrorism\", the U.S. department of state on May 1 listed some countries as \"terrorism-sponsor states\". Quite contrary to their advertisement, the criminal sponsor of international terrorism is none other than the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acting as if it were a \"judge of terrorism,\" it, listing other countries as \"terrorism-sponsor states,\" puts pressure upon them and uses armed forces against them under this or that pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After its appearance, the Bush administration committed several rounds of air bombings against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is condemned as the rogue state of the worst type in the world for its reckless misbehaviours which cannot be imagined by other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its military actions against Yugoslavia two years ago contravened the international law and norms of international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's recent official announcement that it would not comply with the \"Kyoto protocol\" is the reckless act of a rogue country which unhesitatingly commits any unjustifiable acts for its own sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such arbitrary and strong-arm practices of the United States will not work in the present world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Humankind will certainly bring the U.S. to the court of history and severely punish it.    \r\n\r\n"
