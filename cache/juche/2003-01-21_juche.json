            "content": "KCNA on deceptive and hypocritical balderdash about dialogue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Recently, high-ranking officials of the U.S. administration spread the rumor that they have no \"intention to invade North Korea,\" \"may provide security\" and will come out to \"dialogue\" and let loose a string of contradictory sophism that \"it may talk but negotiations are impossible.\"\r\n In a word, this represented their arrogant attitude that they may have a dialogue with the DPRK but \"would discuss only how North Korea implements its commitments.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-exposed that the Bush administration's ballad on \"dialogue\" is no more than a hypocritical farce to mislead the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue between sovereign states means that they sit face to face to settle the divergence of views through negotiations. This is the universal duty and right of both sides assuming before the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a model of shamelessness based on the American-style superpower's view of value that the United States has the right to force its unilateral demands on the DPRK and the latter has only the duty to accept it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such attitude taken by the U.S. is an insult to the unbiased world public and an unpardonable mockery of sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. should be one in which the two parties sit face to face to discuss and settle all the pending issues between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the Bush administration blustered that it \"has no intention to invade the DPRK\" and \"it would provide security guarantee,\" There is no reason why the U.S. should not fix such a guarantee through a legal document. It is the unavoidable responsibility and moral duty of the U.S. that spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and drove it out to the worst state as it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. wants a dialogue to force the DPRK implementation of commitments only, ignoring its responsibility and duty, there would be no more foolish thinking than this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to act with discretion, mindful that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can be settled only when the U.S. provides security to the DPRK by law through the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the United States, the largest missile producer in the world, is threatening other countries with missiles and mounting preemptive strike at them, those countries posed to the missile threat are compelled to take self-defensive measures to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a more urgent need for the DPRK to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile program is strictly of self-defensive and peaceful nature. Therefore, it does not expose any threat to those countries that respect the DPRK's sovereignty, right to existence and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the reactionaries of the United States and Japan are persistently clamoring for the DPRK's \"missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels the DPRK to increase its defence capability as it is little short of declaring that they would not normalize relations with the DPRK but mount only attacks on it, keeping it listed as an enemy state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their continued clamour for the DPRK's \"missile threat\" will not do them good but only harm them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing to be called into question if mutual confidence is built through talks and relations are normalized on this basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, they had better pay attention to the issues of building mutual confidence and normalizing relations instead of regarding the DPRK as the enemy and trying to mount a preemptive attack on it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
