Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea serves as a beacon and a banner of struggle leading the 70 million Koreans to reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, in name and reality, the idea of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It represents the idea of strong self-determination of Koreans to achieve national reunification by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a right and due obligation of the Koreans to independently wage the struggle to retake the national sovereignty in line with their desire and interests as masters. The idea precisely means the idea of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also means the idea of peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" represents the noble patriotic spirit of the fellow countrymen to remove the dark clouds of a war hanging over the country by their concerted efforts and hand down the reunified prosperous peaceful country to posterity.\r\n It is the idea of patriotism as it helps the Koreans, who are more interested in the peace and security of the country than any others, pool efforts to create a peaceful atmosphere on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea also means the idea of great national unity as it unites the members of the nation in one mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing impossible for the Koreans when they go united as they, as a homogenous nation, have developed the brilliant cultural tradition with one and the same language throughout its history spanning 5,000 years. The idea of \"By our nation itself\" serves as a banner of such unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should wage a vigorous struggle to realize the three forms of cooperation?cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism--guided by the idea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
