According to the plan, 40% of over 460,000 reservists of over 90 occupational categories who have been excluded from training of reserve forces will be hurled again into military exercises which will begin next year.   Among them are drill teachers of high schools, itinerant lecturers on family planning and locomotive engineers and other employees.   This proves that the South Korean rulers are further reinforcing manpower as well as lethal equipment in an attempt to round off preparations for a war against the north.  \r\n  \r\n"

They stated that they would wage brisk activities against the discriminatory policy of the Japanese authorities so that legitimate demands of Korean residents in Japan, the overseas citizens of a sovereign state, could be met.   Prior to the press conference, the defence counsel group  offered the human rights protection committee of the Japan federation of bar associations a request for accepting Japan-resident Koreans' applications for the abjuration of the Japanese nationality.  \r\n\r\n"

The abnormal production performance in the economic field and the people's unstable living are attributable to the imperialist's machinations and the severe natural calamities that have hit the country for the last several consecutive years.    The imperialist have resorted to every conceivable move to isolate and stifle socialist Korea since the revival of capitalism in the erstwhile socialist countries early in the 90s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proved no small impediment to the economic development of the country adversely affected by the breakdown of the socialist market. On top of this, severe flood, drought, tidal wave and typhoon, and so on. That have struck the country for the last several consecutive years either rendered lots of industrial installations and equipment submerged or damaged.    The shortage of power, raw and other materials and equipment has hit hard the national economy as a whole and made it impossible for the state to service the people' daily needs for consumer goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hardest hit by this was agriculture.    Last year alone, farming failed in tens of thousands of hectares of the cultivated land and the grain production shrank by half or even more in the country's granaries as compared with normal years.    The food situation this year still remains very difficult. The DPRK is trying to solve this food problem with a variety of food substitutes.    It is persevering in its efforts to build a prosperous and powerful nation in near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A number of problems have found a successful solution to make their prospect bright.    The industrialization of the method of making iron by blowing oxygen in February in the wake of putting into orbit the country's first satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\" last August to rank itself among the satellite have went a long way toward increasing the Juche character and independence of the metal industry.    The production of an electron microscope of 300,000 magnifications gave a momentum to the researches in the field of up-to-date science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a good prospect for the solution of the food problem, too.    The DPRK has a favorable condition and environment for increased diverse economic exchange, joint development and collaboration with many other countries.    Multi-faceted international cooperation is given to the DPRK in the promising joint exploration of oil and other rich resources.   All this provides a sure guarantee for building a powerful nation. \r\n \r\n"

The South Korean authorities are talking about the dispatch of their \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" to the session  to clarify their position on the issues of \"repatriation of south side's POWs\" and \"re-union of divided family members.\" the DPRK cannot overlook this ridiculous move.   Their move stems from a silly attempt to improve their image by raising the issues in line with the so-called \"sunshine policy\" peddled by the present chief executive and take an upper hand in the confrontation with the north over human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of the \"repatriation of the south side's POWs\" the South Korean authorities are going to raise at the forthcoming UN human rights session is no more than a fiction they invented in order to accuse the north of \"human rights violation.\"   There is now not a single South Korean taken prisoner in the north. In the north there are only those who defected to the north, refusing to serve in the disgraceful army and are enjoying a happy life on the work sites they chose by themselves according to their wishes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as the issue of \"re-union of divided family members\" is concerned, the South Korean ruling quarters are not entitled to say anything. Guided by the idea of great national unity and proceeding from the compatriotic stand, the Workers' Party and the government of Korea have always considered the issue to be a principled matter related to national reunification and made sincere efforts to solve it. Therefore, the responsibility for the failure to settle it rests entirely with the south side.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities, not content with making a fuss over the issues at home, are trying to take the issues to the UN Arena. It cannot be construed otherwise than a crafty move to divert elsewhere the world's public criticism of South Korea, a wasteland of human rights, and build up a world opinion by making the north's \"human rights issue\" a fait accompli in a bid to tarnish the DPRK image. \r\n \r\n"

The news analyst says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is natural that north's songs loved by foreigners were sung by fellow countrymen in the south. Students' forming a \"Chollima Singing Group\" and singing songs of the north should not be incriminated in any case.\r\n    The South Korean rulers never let a chance pass by without talking about \"engagement policy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whom and how can they engage while failing to embrace even those who sang songs of the north?   \"Improved inter-Korean relations\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation\" loud-mouthed by them are nothing but a window-dressing.   They are now employing every base move to dampen the ever growing desire of the South Korean people to achieve reunification through reconciliation with the north and communism and to impair the high authority of the north. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
