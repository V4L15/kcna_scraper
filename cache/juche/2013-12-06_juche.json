Korean Authorities of Abusing Education for Confrontation \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Education Commission of the DPRK Friday made public a statement denouncing the south Korean authorities for defaming even the brilliant history of the DPRK and abusing noble education for the purpose of escalating the confrontation with fellow countrymen and propping up their colonial fascist rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago the puppet Ministry of Education of south Korea took issue with the parts of history textbooks dealing with the DPRK to be used at high schools next year produced by various publishing houses of south Korea and pressurized them to unconditionally amend and supplement them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A scrutiny into what the conservative group is pressurizing their writers to include in those textbooks shows that it is the hostile and provocative parts falsifying historical facts and inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen including sentences slandering the land reform carried out in the DPRK, the Juche idea and socialist economy and shifting the responsibility for the warship Cheonan case and the Yonphyong Island shelling onto it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their moves are another unpardonable political provocation against the DPRK and an intolerable insult and violation of noble education, the statement said, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Education in history is an important work related to the rise and fall of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their denial of the objective historical facts and acts of trampling down through \"witch hunt\" schools where truth and justice should be taught bring to light the ulterior intention of the Park Geun Hye group to imbue the south Korean youngsters with hostility towards the DPRK and a reactionary outlook on history in a bid to render south Korean society more conservative and fascist and thus revive \"yusin\" dictatorship at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History can never be changed by any distortion and coercion at the point of bayonet. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proud history of the DPRK will always remain shining in precious textbooks teaching genuine justice and truth to the people and posterity along with the country and nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group will never escape a severe punishment by the nation as it falsifies the hard reality of history."
