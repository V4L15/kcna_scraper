This is the true picture of the DPRK and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As recognized by the international community, a signal progress made by the DPRK for the promotion of the people's wellbeing and the building of an economic power has won the admiration of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Die-hard traitors who have steeped in confrontation awareness and repugnance of the fellow countrymen can not see this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By raising a hue and cry over the \"threat\" from the DPRK in his \"policy speech\", the traitor gave vent to his anger as he was beaten hard by the might of the single-minded unity and of Songun of the DPRK during his tenure of office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His political destiny has reached the extreme point for his huge crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, censured by the nation for the total bankruptcy of the domestic and foreign policies, is being forsaken internally and even by his American and Japanese masters.

This was just a last resort aimed to evade his responsibility for having plunged the north-south relations to the complete deadlock by pursuing vicious confrontation policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the outset of his office the traitor said that \"he is ready to let the south-north relations remain in the frozen state till the end of his office\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He totally denied and systematically stroke down the common idea of the nation and its achievements for the past several years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In active pursuance of the U.S. and Japanese masters' hostile policy toward the DPRK, the traitor tried hard to bring about a \"regime change\" and provoke a new war, while crying out for \"unification under the liberal democratic system\" throughout his tenure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the traitorous regime's confrontation policy, the north-south relations have taken up the confrontation structure worse than that in the Cold War period. The Korean Peninsula, a cradle of life of the Korean nation down through generations, turned into the world's biggest hotspot where a nuclear war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean newspaper Hangyore once carried the article titled \"Poodle of the U.S.\" in which it said that \"Lee Myung Bak approached the south-north relations from the Cold War perspective, insisting on 'high-handed approach toward the north' and 'south Korea-U.S. alliance' without any philosophy and principle. This provoked a big laughter. The engineering work and diplomacy as well as the south-north relations are all locked in the '1970's mode'\". This irony perfectly fitted the traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak faces only disgraceful ruin just as the preceding traitors of the nation met miserable ends.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So pitiful is the fate of the traitor who still makes nonsensical remarks on his lonely journey to the other world."

The declaration clarifies all the fundamental matters of expanding and developing the inter-Korean relations on the basis of the June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday in a bylined article says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe October 4 declaration serves as a practical program and action guidelines for the north and the south to fully embody the June 15 joint declaration by pooling their will and efforts in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the October 4 declaration been steadily implemented along with the June 15 joint declaration, the inter-Korean relations would have been put on a high level of development, the peace on the Korean Peninsula consolidated and, accordingly, the day of national reunification, a cherished desire of all Koreans, been hastened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the inter-Korean relations were frozen all of a sudden due to the U.S. and its lackeys the south Korean Lee Myung Bak puppet regime though they had once favorably developed and a touch-and-go situation is prevailing on this land where the desire for national reunification was growing stronger, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present deplorable situation of the inter-Korean relations clearly shows that it is impossible to achieve national reconciliation, unity and peace and peaceful reunification and prosperity common to the nation if the June 15 joint declaration and October 4 declaration are disregarded and their implementation is denied. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation calls on the Korean nation to make a clean sweep of the Lee group of traitors in order to preserve and implement the north-south declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans' cause of national reunification advancing along the road indicated by the north-south joint declaration despite challenges of the anti-reunification forces is sure to be accomplished, concludes the article."
