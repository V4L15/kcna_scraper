The proposal is a fair and practical one to reunify the country independently, peacefully and at the earliest date, with neither side conquering the other because different ideas and systems exist in the north and south of Korea.\r\n   \"I always remember the President's active support to the Cuban people's struggle.\r\n   \"President Kim Il Sung's brilliant life and exploits will remain forever in the hearts of all the progressive people in the world.\" \r\n\r\n"

The daily notes:\r\n   The \"support rate\" of south Korean public for the Kim Young Sam regime is reportedly no more than three percent. A rumor about Kim Young Sam's resignation is in vogue even in political circles. Kim Young Sam is throwing away his confidential servants like a pair of wornout shoes to evade from the crisis, conceal the crimes committed by him and his son and remain in power. Kim Tok Ryong and other vassals who have been left to the mercy of the prosecution continue revenging themselves on Kim Young Sam and his son.\r\n   Kim Young Sam is a rare political swindler who unhesitatingly sacrifices even his faithful servants for his greed of power and accumulation of wealth, and south Korean \"politicians\" have no political creed and seek only personal comfort and fortune.\r\n   The dog fight within the puppet ruling group predicts that the end of the corrupt regime of Kim Young Sam is drawing near. \r\n\r\n"

It is also one more crime to block the democratic development of south Korean society.\r\n   The present situation obtaining in south Korea clearly shows that with Kim Young Sam group left intact, the noble idea of independence, democracy and reunification cannot be realised, nor can the future of the students can be expected.\r\n   The south Korean students should turn out daringly in the decisive resistance to cut off the windpipe of the dying Kim Young Sam group and kindle a fiercer flame of the struggle for overthrowing the \"civilian\"-veiled fascist dictatorship all over south Korea.\r\n   All the students in the northern half of Korea will as ever extend full support and encouragement to the just, patriotic struggle of the south Korean students to overthrow  Kim Young Sam group and build a reunified country, independent and democratic. \r\n\r\n"
