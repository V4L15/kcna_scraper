They branded as unwarrantable the threat of the south Korean regime to severely punish those students who rejoin Hanchongryon and evinced their firm determination to enlist former members of Hanchongryon who had seceded from it at an early date and thus extensively reinforce its organisation.\r\n   Their determination shows that they are vanguards of the just patriotic struggle of the south Korean people, who do not yield to any bloody suppression by the Kim Young Sam group and that nothing can block their struggle to defend and strengthen their organisation, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says, and continues:\r\n   Their struggle is very just because it reflects the unanimous will and aspiration of the democratic forces in south Korea.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group are now suppressing and obliterating Hanchongryon, a vanguard organisation in the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification, in an attempt to find a way out of their serious crisis.\r\n   Intensifying the crackdown is the last-ditch effort of those who are doomed.\r\n   Justice can never be suppressed by arms.\r\n   Hanchongryon and other pro-reunification democratic forces in south Korea will not lower their banner of struggle but relentlessly fight until their idea and cause are realised.    \r\n\r\n"
