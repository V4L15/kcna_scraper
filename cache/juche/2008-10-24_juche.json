Lurking behind this is a sinister intention of the dishonest forces to defame the indestructible political system in the DPRK in which all the servicepersons and people are single-mindedly united around the party and the leader, displeased with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known well, the two newspapers are known to be typical reptile papers serving the Japanese ultra-right conservatives and have long played the role as media hatching plots against the DPRK in league with those forces hostile toward it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, too, those newspapers released articles peppered with lies and fabrications only to become a laughing stock of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that Yomiuri Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun are made up of wicked money grabbers who do not hesitate to fake up articles about the health condition of the top leader of other country, not content with fabricating stories out of the greed for money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK does not recognize the said newspapers as media as they are keen on breeding plots, bereft of any elementary press ethics, nor will deal with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK hold the prestige of their top leader dearer than their lives and will never tolerate any act of defaming it."

Nothing is more impudent and brazen-faced than this attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan can hardly be considered as a party to the six-party talks both in the light of what it has done at the talks so far and the insincere stance taken by it towards the fulfillment of its commitments under the agreement reached at the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, indeed, preposterous for Japan to create complexities in the way of the talks, imprudently expressing a different opinion on the \"nuclear verification.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The countries concerned still remember the hurdles laid by Japan to create complexities in the way of the talks. They are, therefore, cautious about the present Japanese government bringing to light its sinister intention, displeased with the current development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan now deserves cool treatment for opposing the new \"verification proposal\" of the DPRK under the pretext of the \"alliance.\" It is now running helter-skelter, left behind alone after the U.S. announcement of its above-said decision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Aso regime seems to feel lonely as it is unable to foresee even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the Japanese politicians have even an iota of conscience, they had better be wise, though belatedly, not losing an opportunity to provide them with a favorable condition for making a switchover in the policy towards the DPRK. This would be a beneficial option for them."

This is the brilliant fruition of the great Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political and ideological position remained strong and the spirit of the socialist red flag prevailed throughout the society despite so stern trial during the \"Arduous March\", the forced march because the Party, the headquarters of the revolution and the heart of society, was pervaded with the Juche idea, the Songun idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists have been frantic with the reactionary ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare against the DPRK. They, however, can never break the unity and cohesion of the WPK and the revolutionary ranks in thinking and purpose which have grown strong for several decades."
