It openly demanded the DPRK disarm itself, refusing to recognize its system. All this is little short of denying the foundation of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) adopted on the basis of mutual recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demanded the DPRK dismantle its \"nuclear weapons program first\", sidestepping the DPRK's proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty. This is nothing but a demand that the DPRK put down arms and appear before the U.S. barehanded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula should be settled under any circumstances on the principle of simultaneous action under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion of the non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. provides the best way of settling the serious situation on the Korean Peninsula and solving its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal is a very just and realistic peace proposal in view of the trend of the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the ever-deteriorating belligerent relations between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason for the U.S. to fail to positively respond to the DPRK's proposal if it has no intention to invade the DPRK but is truly willing to settle the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula as the \"world's only superpower.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sidestepping the DPRK's proposal means its intention to invade it. The U.S. ruling quarters' remarks that they have no intention to invade the DPRK is nothing but hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to properly understand the DPRK's unshakable principled stand and respond to Pyongyang's constructive proposal, away from its short-sighted and self-righteous way of thinking and stand.    \r\n\r\n"

It also clarified its will to clear the U.S. of its security worries if it legally assures the DPRK of its non-aggression on the DPRK including the nonuse of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pyongyang's proposal is the best way to bridge over through dialogue and negotiations the grave situation created on the peninsula due to the threats of nuclear attack and preemptive attack posed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. insists on its absurd assertion that it would negotiate with Pyongyang only after it scraps its nuclear weapons program, persistently sidestepping the DPRK's call for legally guaranteeing non-aggression. By doing so, the U.S. seeks to mislead the world public opinion and create an environment for putting diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK. \r\n This once again laid bare the U.S. brigandish design to disarm and stifle the DPRK and goes to prove President Bush's remark that the United States has no intention to invade the DPRK is sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the United States have long been in confrontation due to deep-rooted antagonism. The mistrust and confrontation between them have become bitterer than ever before since the emergence of the present U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the DPRK to produce various types of weapons by every possible means under the present situation where the DPRK and the U.S. are in the most hostile relationship and the former is exposed to the real threat of aggression from the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Is there any need for the DPRK to exert so tremendous efforts for increasing the defence capability and make even special weapons despite its difficult economic conditions if such hostile relations do not exist between the DPRK and the United States? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to state explicitly the U.S. demand for the DPRK's scrapping of its \"nuclear weapons program\" is sparking a new clash and compelling it to take a stronger corresponding measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not move first to get \"recognition\" by the hostile country and does not feel any need to beg for it.    \r\n\r\n"
