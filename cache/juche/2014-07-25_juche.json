            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Accuses U.S. and S. Korean Authorities of Ridiculous Propaganda \r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean authorities asserted that the Korean war was a \"victorious war\" by origin, but it has been called \"forgotten war.\" They are now busy describing the day of defeated war as the day of the \"victorious war,\" claiming that now is the time to reassess it as the day of \"forgotten victory\". Rodong Sinmun Friday in a commentary terms this a burlesque arousing the derision of everybody.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group in the world who are brazen-faced enough to paint the defeated war as the \"victorious war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind their shameless propaganda is a cynical ploy to ignite the second Korean war at any cost in a bid to recover from their ignominious defeat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, this is nothing but a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who sustained the above-said defeat should bear this in mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The times have changed. The military muscle of the DPRK is incomparably stronger than what it used to be more than six decades ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has the nuclear forces for self-defence powerful enough to break the U.S. nuclear stick at a single strike and the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces of Mt. Paektu always ready to wipe out the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet group dare ignite a new war, oblivious of the lesson drawn from the Korean war, the army and the people of the DPRK will wipe out the aggressors to the last man so that there might be no one left to sign a surrender document and accomplish the historic cause of the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers would be well advised to bear in mind the resolute declaration of the DPRK."
