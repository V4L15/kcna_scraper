It is entirely attributable to the Japanese authorities' anachronistic policy hostile toward the DPRK and policy of national discrimination against the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese authorities truly respect the dignity and rights of the Korean residents in Japan, they should get rid of the past wrong policy, guarantee their legal status, ensure their democratic national rights and stable living conditions and immediately withdraw the \"bill\" which was submitted to the diet in conspiracy with the South Korean rulers. \r\n\r\n"

But, the early communist movement was undergoing ups and downs due to scramble for power and factional strife for hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The President Kim Il Sung was opening up a new path for the Korean revolution to follow after embarking on the road of revolution in his early years. He unrolled a plan to found a revolutionary party by building a grassroots-level party organization with young communists not affected by factional strife and expanding and strengthening it, not wedded to the established practice of forming a central organization before founding a party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under such a plan, he powerfully pushed ahead with the work to lay mass bases of the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn this basis, he formed the first party organization with hardcore members of the leadership in Kalun in July, Juche 19 (1930) trained by the \"Down-with-the-Imperialism Union\" (DIU). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At an inaugural meeting of the first party organization, he put forward the tasks to be fulfilled by its members, including the issue of expanding grassroots-level party organization and establishing a system of unitary leadership over it, the issue of achieving unity and cohesion of the ranks and the issue of building mass bases for the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also underlined the need for the party organization to steadfastly maintain an independent stand in all its activities and closely combine the party construction with the anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe first party organization took the same program and rules as was adopted by the \"DIU\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He proposed to name the organization the society for rallying comrades in the sense that a revolution begins with winning comrades and an ultimate victory of the revolution could be achieved only by rallying more and more comrades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The society was just like an embryo and a seed of the Worker's Party of Korea, the revolutionary party of Juche type. \r\n\r\n"
