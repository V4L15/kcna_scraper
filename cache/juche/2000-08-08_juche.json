Songs are also heard from the brightly lit flats in evenings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The author pointed out that songs of the north reflect the noble mental world characterized by love of the country, trust in the Worker's Party of Korea and boundless veneration for their leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim described the songs of the north as a nutrient to keep life in beautiful bloom and a tonic to add fragrance to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is thanks to the peerlessly great man that the songs in the north inspire the people in their life and struggle, the author noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Il Sung made a long journey of the bloody anti-Japanese battles with songs and won one victory after another right after liberation in the June 25, 1950 war, in the post-cease-fire period and the period of socialist construction, singing songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President's will has been inherited by leader Kim Jong Il. Regarding music as a means of making a revolution, he discovered the leadership philosophy among songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He has united the people as one and trained the people into those who have iron will and faith and are responsible for creation and changes with the help of songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The north will emerge victorious and thrive forever thanks to songs. \r\n\r\n"

It announced that it would dispatch an official of its Foreign Ministry to the UN headquarters to have an \"exhaustive discussion on the overhaul of the UNSC\" at the UN General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As everybody knows, the UN is a sacred world body aimed to discuss important matters related to global peace and security against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should do things helpful to global peace and security if it wishes to fulfil its responsibility as a permanent member of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, Japan is censured as a root cause of disturbing world peace and security for seeking to become a military and nuclear power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For Japan to sit on the UNSC it should abandon such aggressive and bellicose attempt and win trust from the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One of the most urgent things to be done by Japan to get trust from the international community is to fully redress its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's redress for its wrongs done against Korea in the past is not only a political matter but an issue whose solution is indispensable for getting its status as a member of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yet, Japan has not settled its past but is making a desperate bid for the UNSC permanent membership, showing its bulgy moneybag off. This cannot but be a mockery of the UN and the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should bear in mind that the permanent membership of the UNSC is not something to be sold or bought nor can international trust be won by bribery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A top priority job to be done by Japan to sit on the UNSC is to honestly redress its inglorious past and win international trust. \r\n\r\n"
