Pero, si la banda titere surcoreana se atreve a atacarnos, como ya hemos declarado, acabaremos totalmente con el circulo vicioso de confrontacion fratricida usando las poderosas fuerzas armadas revolucionarias que hemos consolidado para la ultima batalla de enfrentamiento con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Igualmente, haremos balance de los crimenes de los traidores a la nacion, incluyendo esos imbeciles que idearon el \"problema de procesamiento\" de los funcionarios de nuestros organos judiciales abrigando el irrealizable sueno de la \"unificacion mediante la absorcion\", y les cobraremos sin falta el precio correspondiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En particular, nuestras instituciones judiciales buscaran y enjuiciaran sin piedad en virtud de nuestra ley a todas las figuras connotadas del circulo judicial surcoreano que fabrican las leyes infames a favor de EE.UU. y enfrentamiento fratricida y en contra de la democracia y las ejecutan al frente siendo lacayos de la implementacion de la politica de dominacion colonial de su amo gringo."
