That is why it is floating the fiction of \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to calm down the anti-U.S. sentiment in South Korea and justify its occupation and war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the U.S. strategic aim to build the ambitious \"missile defense\" system to contain big powers and establish its military domination. Its loudmouthed \"missile threat\" from the DPRK is designed to justify its \"missile defense\" program and escape international criticism. The U.S. intends to realize its vicious ambition at any cost by getting \"support\" from Japan, its junior ally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. must discard its wild ambition to build the \"missile defense\" system under the pretext of the \"threat\" from the DPRK and establish its military domination over Asia. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Imperialists urged to drop its anachronistic ambition \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA)-- The imperialists are working hard to browbeat and blackmail other countries by force and bring pressure upon them or interfere in their internal affairs and realize their strategy for world supremacy with a military edge. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary, urging them to drop their anachronistic ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The United States keeps increasing its military spending the bulk of which goes to the development of \"missile defense\" system. This is aimed at containing other big powers advocating a multipolar world and implementing its strategy to build a unipolar world and establish world supremacy.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In other words, the U.S. seeks to enfeeble Russia, China and European countries through a fresh arms race and have a military edge over them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What a great hope the imperialists pin on the military edge can be explained by the fact that the U.S. is desperately seeking to retain and expand the NATO and other military blocs and overseas military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also finds a vivid expression in that the U.S. is working out such new strategic documents as \"joint vision 2020\" to invade other countries.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is quite foolhardy for the imperialists to count on their military edge as it runs counter to the people's desire for independence and the trend of the times, it is a factor of impeding the building of a new equitable international order and they are finding themselves in a pretty fix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists' shameless design to have a military edge can never come true, concludes the commentary. \r\n\r\n"
