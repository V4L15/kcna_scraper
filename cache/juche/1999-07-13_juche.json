And he proposed to  table it in the U.S. congress and government.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun  today in a signed commentary says:   This shows that Japanese themselves feel ashamed at the past crimes and call for repenting of them. It was against this backdrop  that the U.S. state legislator  urged  his  government to exercise its influence on the Japanese government to make an apology and compensation for its crimes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now Germany and other countries which committed crimes against humankind in the past are becoming more earnest in their actions to fully liquidate  them before greeting a new millennium. Contrary to this,  the Japanese authorities are working hard to flee from the responsibility for the anti-ethical grisly crimes, far from admitting and apologizing for them. Their behaviour glaringly reveals their shamelessness and impudence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a commitment for the United States, which is wholly responsible for the revival of Japanese militarism, to urge Japan to apologize for  its past crimes and liquidate them.   Japan is well advised to drop its foolish behaviour to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\", oblivious of the past lesson, and opt to liquidate its past with a sincere and honest attitude. This is entirely beneficial to Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan  obstinately avoids apologizing for its past crimes and liquidating them, indifferent to the grievance and resentment of the Korean and other Asian peoples and the demand of the era and the call of human conscience, they will have to pay an unimaginably high price. \r\n\r\n"

He often recollected the benefactors, who actively helped him during the period of the anti-Japanese struggle, and a woman party member of the Rakwon Machine Factory, a grandmother in Thaesong-ri and the workers of the Kangson Steel Works, who inspiringly told him in trial-ridden period after the liberation of the country and felt happiness in  their high sense of loyalty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He found his greatest happiness in the monumental edifices built by the people by their own efforts, in the looks of the people, who were enthusiastically cheering him in the celebration square and in the eyes of children, who were growing in health.\r\n   Therefore, the President devoted his all to the wellbeing of the people.\r\n   Over nearly half a century from the day he called on the workers of the Kangson Steel Works after his triumphant return home to the last day of his great life, the President spent more than 17,800 days, including 2,530 Sundays and other holidays tantamount to seven years, for his on-site guidance for the people's happiness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He conducted his revolutionary activities, receiving love from his comrades. \r\n   He believed his  comrades and the people as himself. He also valued and loved his comrades and the people more than himself.   He elucidated the truth of the revolution that one could never carry on the revolution apart from revolutionary comrades and showed all conceivable love and trust to the comrades.   It was the greatest pleasure, pride and happiness for the President to have Kim Jong Il as his successor.   The ode the President had personally written on the 50th birthday of Kim Jong Il was that of his happiness of having as his successor Kim Jong Il, who is enjoying love and respect from all the people for his distinguished leadership ability and personality, loyalty and devotion and for his enduring exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the President was alive, he said he had never felt as worthwhile as at that time while carrying on revolution. That is because I am convinced of the victory of our revolution under the leadership of comrade Kim Jong Il, he added.As he was possessed of such a lucid outlook on the successor, he ensured the high authority of Kim Jong Il in every way and strengthened the single-hearted unity of the party, the army and the people around Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President personally signed a decree on marking Kim Jong Il's birthday every year as the greatest holiday of the nation and took all measures to build a large hall to preserve the gifts to Kim Jong Il from foreigners, near the international friendship exhibition, including the selection of its site. \r\n   As seen above, Kim Il Sung's happiness was the happiness which a true man and revolutionary could feel while devoting his all to the people, comrades and the successor, before enjoying  trust and respect from them. \r\n \r\n  \r\n"

At the June G-8 summit meeting he was busy with a soliciting diplomacy, calling for \"joint cooperation\".   Clear is the purpose of the anti-DPRK diatribe of the Japanese authorities who are persistently describing the DPRK's satellite launch as \"missile launch\" and zealously creating an atmosphere of hostility towards the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They attempt to step up the militarization of Japan and overseas aggression in full swing on the plea of the DPRK's satellite launch.   As far as the DPRK's satellite launch is concerned, it belongs to the legitimate right of an independent and sovereignty state and, moreover, scientific research into the peaceful development of the space is not to be made by specified countries only.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If one thinks that we, who regard independence as our life and soul, will not do what we should do because of somebody's slander and \"influence\" upon us over the issue pertaining to our sovereignty, it is a height of folly and a foolish daydream.\r\n   We will go straight guided by our faith and decision, no matter what others may say.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are well advised not to act rashly, mindful that they will get nothing but a bitter frustration because of their persistent clumsy soliciting diplomacy intended to achieve their aim with other's help. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
