Korea Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- Laporte, commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, in a recent interview with a south Korean broadcasting service, made extremely provocative and bellicose remarks that the U.S. is capable of deterring and defeating the DPRK, while saying this or that about the latter's access to nuclear weapons.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks can be interpreted as ones representing the stand of the hard-line conservative forces of the U.S. They clearly indicate what kind of dialogue the U.S. wants and what it seeks through it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the strong aspiration and will of all Koreans to rejoin the severed ties of the nation and reunify the country as early as possible through reconciliation, unity and national cooperation, not through confrontation and war. The U.S. bellicose forces are, however, pursuing a war, deliberately straining the situation in the peninsula quite contrary to the Koreans' enthusiasm and desire for reunification. They are contemplating staging a mock exercise in the middle of this month, a drill aimed at mounting an attack upon the DPRK under the pretext of coping with a \"crisis\". This is also part of their adventurous moves to ignite a war by deliberately escalating the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The above-said outcries made by U.S. bellicose forces are nothing but an undisguised threat to the dialogue partner and, at the same time, an attempt to torpedo the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere of the dialogue would not do the U.S. good either as it is an act of blocking the settlement of the nuclear issue and driving the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. to a war. The U.S. escalating threat and blackmail against the DPRK and increasing danger of war on the Korean Peninsula would only compel the DPRK to further bolster its defence capability for self-defence.\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary observes: The U.S bellicose forces, overheated with war fever, are sadly mistaken. If they seek to stifle the DPRK by force of arms as now, chilling the atmosphere of dialogue, this will only render the settlement of the nuclear issue harder.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the sinister scheme of the Japanese reactionaries buoyed with expansion fever to stage a comeback to Korea and embark upon overseas aggression by joining the United States in its malicious moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK on the plea of the afore-said issues. \r\n Japan's refusal to normalize relations with the DPRK under the pretext of such matters as the \"abduction issue\" which has already been solved is intended to evade its obligation to settle its past crimes against the Korean people and set about gratifying its ambition of overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never freely evade the settlement of its crime-woven past. The Korean people will certainly force Japan to make an apology and compensation for its past full of crimes, whether it wants this, or not.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
