Though Choe clarified his will to resign from the post of the representative, there will be no change in the GNP's objective and traitorous nature. The GNP gentries are desperately working to tide over its crisis and bring the situation under control through its \"congress\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No chance should be given to the GNP in the \"general election\". The south Korean people should intensify the on-going anti-GNP struggle to bring this traitorous party to a ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
