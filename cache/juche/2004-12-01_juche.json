This, therefore, can not but be an outright challenge to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foolish anti-DPRK psychological operation and intelligence campaign can never work on the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that the U.S. has become all the more frantic in its moves to stifle the DPRK, guided by its logic of strength and doctrine of a \"preemptive attack,\" it goes without saying that the DPRK is left with no option but to significantly increase its deterrent force for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will heighten their revolutionary vigilance and cement the ideo-political position and the front of anti-imperialism and military affairs.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Korean \"Cooperative Self-Reliant National Defence Plan\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 30 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the Defence Ministry of south Korea made public a \"cooperative self-reliant national defence plan\" under the signboard of \"future-orientated development\" of the south Korea-U.S. alliance.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary in this connection says: Under the plan the south Korean military would reorganize the Joint Chiefs of Staff on an expansion basis with a view to strengthening the war execution system and actively pushing forward research and development in the munitions industry. To this end, it is contemplating military spending running into astronomical figures for four years to come. It is a very dangerous development as the move reveals the trigger-happy nature of the south Korean authorities keen to stand in military stand off with the north and launch a war of aggression against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the \"self-reliant national defence\" on the lips of the south Korean authorities, the commentary says that it is very self-contradictory for the south Korean authorities to talk about \"self-reliance\" while they are strengthening the traitorous nexus with the aggression troops stationed in their land despite the outsiders' clear attempt at aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"cooperative self-reliant national defence\" is, in essence, nothing but a traitorous slogan to put south Korea under the U.S tighter military control, strengthen the relations of \"cooperation\" with the U.S. and round off preparations for a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is a reunification-oriented era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration when all the Koreans are pooling efforts to achieve independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities can never escape bitter curses and denunciation of all the Koreans as they are whetting swords to invade the north in a bid to bring a disaster of war to the Koreans, while giving lip-service to the inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a deliberate and planned military provocation to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is massively bolstering its naval and air strike forces equipped with ultra-modern military hardware in south Korea, Japan and other areas around the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of \"reduction of the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea and security vacuum.\" This is aimed to carry out its strategic plan to start the second Korean war mainly in reliance upon the above-said forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose elements seek to occupy a vast front in the air and sea, avoiding clash on the land, and neutralize the DPRK's war capacity through medium- and long-distance strikes and intensive surgical assault. This way they intend to win a blitz war, while minimizing their casualties and material losses as much as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to its strategy to achieve the war objective by massively mobilizing naval and air forces, the U.S. is deploying a huge naval force including nuclear-powered aircraft carriers, nuclear submarines and destroyers and an air force with long distance performance capability and tremendous striking power around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists have taken a measure to merge their 13th Air Force Command in Guam with their 5th U.S. Air Force Command in Yokota base in Japan. Moreover, they reorganized their commanding system whereby the U.S. Forces Command in Japan is invested with an independent right to command the U.S. ground, naval, air and marine forces in Japan while the operation room of this command is directly linked by satellite communication with the U.S. Pacific Forces Command in Hawaii, the Defense Department and the U.S. president's office of the White House in Washington. These facts eloquently prove that they have become desperate in the moves to realize their wild ambition to invade the DPRK and their projected start of the second Korean war is becoming a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. dare preempt an attack on the DPRK, its army and people will make merciless strikes at the aggressors by mobilizing all their tremendous self-defensive deterrent forces which have been built up for decades, reliably defend the sovereignty of the country and socialism and achieve the historic cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
