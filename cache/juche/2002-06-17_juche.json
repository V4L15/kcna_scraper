After watching the servicepersons in training, he was greatly satisfied to see all the servicemen trained as indomitable combatants firmly defending the security of the country and the people and indicated the tasks that would serve as a guideline in increasing the combat power of the unit in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at the houses of officers Kang Nam Sik and Ri Song Gil of the unit to acquaint himself with their living down to details and had a cordial talk with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to learn that their family tradition of attaching importance to arms has been carried forward generation after generation and said the KPA is invincible as such admirable commanding officers unfailingly loyal to the party and the revolution are reliably standing guard over every post. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n he posed for a photograph with the servicemen of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his inspection was a women's company under the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised servicewomen for their total dedication to the noble work for the defence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He enjoyed an art performance given by the company servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the servicepersons of the company a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as souvenirs before posing for a photograph with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong.     \r\n\r\n"

He on behalf of the DPRK government expressed thanks to the governments of various countries, international organizations and individual figures for having provided such aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that if the food security is to be achieved worldwide at an early date it is important, first of all, for all the governments to reconfirm their political will to implement the action program of the world summit on food in conformity with their specific conditions and abide by the principle of making the best use of their locally available potentials to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, he called for giving priority to establishing fair relations of international trade and finance favorable for the achievement of food security for all and developing the international economic relations based on equality and mutual benefits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will as ever maintain close relations of cooperation with FAO and other international organizations and their member nations in the efforts to achieve world food security and will make sustained efforts to implement the action program of the world summit on food, he concluded.     \r\n\r\n"

This is an undisguised challenge to the world peace-loving people desirous of living in a world free from nuclear arms race and nuclear weapons, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n Recalling that it is the invariable ambition of the U.S. imperialists to mount preemptive attacks on other countries with nuclear weapons and dominate the world, the commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. singled out the DPRK as its primary target. What merits serious attention is that after the U.S. imperialist warmongers listed the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and the target of its nuclear attack the U.S. Defense Department recently carried out computer mock exercises against the DPRK and other countries and even worked out a relevant top secret war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can predict when they will provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK. Any slackening of vigilance against their moves for a nuclear war would entail irrevocable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These desperate moves of the u.s. imperialist hawkish forces compel the DPRK to take corresponding measures. This is the legitimate sovereign right of the DPRK.     \r\n\r\n"

All the production processes of the farm ranging from breed raising to hatching, young ostrich raising and fattening are computerized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Scientists in this field have achieved great successes in the researches into increasing the rate of egg-laying, fertilization and hatching per ostrich. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Signal progress has been made in the development of anti-epidemic medicines, effective feed and ostrich fattening in winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of these successes a drive for building ostrich farms is now under way in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ostrich farms appeared in Kaechon city and Yonthan county recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massive ostrich breeding in the DPRK is the fruition of the devoted service of the Workers' Party of Korea to the people, a party which spares nothing for them.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
