The DPRK reiterates its active participation in the UNESCO's future work to realize its noble idea, he said, and added: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is important for the organization to strengthen education in the new century, too, on the basis of the successes already made and pay primary attention to rendering effective cooperation to the member countries in conformity with their specific conditions and the level of their educational development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the right option made by the UNESCO that it proposed to the developing countries to confirm the priority areas for scientific development, shape national scientific and technological policies and strategies to suit their actual conditions and increase national capability for scientific researches to implement them and is planning projects for the increased regional and international cooperation for their realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We consider it necessary for the organization to take practical measures to equip the developing countries with urgently needed scientific research  facilities, while paying greater attention to the training of scientists and technicians and technological cooperation to the developing nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that the DPRK joined the convention on the preservation of the world culture and natural heritage and has taken a number of steps to implement the convention. \r\n\r\n"

This is intended to secure a legal ground to commit a wholesale crackdown upon the dissident movement organizations by branding them as \"enemy-benefiting organizations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also attempt to stipulate in the law conditionally that the DPRK can be declassified as an \"anti-state organization\" according to how its attitude will change, including \"drop of its intention to achieve reunification by force of arms.\" This, in fact,  lays bare their intention to  more desperately pursue the anti-north confrontation, regarding as ever the DPRK as an \"enemy\" and persisting in their smear campaign  against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' \"revision of the security law\" is, in the final analysis, nothing but a crafty trick to keep the framework of the law as it is, defying the strong public demand at home and abroad for the repeal of the evil law and carry out its fascist mal-revision  in a bid to invoke it for intensifying crackdown upon the movement of the people for independence, democracy  and reunification and escalating the north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not mock at the nation through the farce of \"revision\" but unconditionally and totally rescind the \"security law\" without delay as demanded by the times and the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Korea denounced\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries an article \"Negation of nation's ancestral father is unpardonable criminal deed,\" contributed by Prof. and Dr. Son Yong Jong of the history institute of the Academy of Social Sciences of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In South Korea some dishonest Christians are these days destroying statues of Tangun, the ancestral father of the Korean nation, or coming out against the building of his statues. However, the rulers of the self-proclaimed \"people's government\" are conniving at and encouraging such anti-national vandalism . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From olden times the Korean nation has worshipped Tangun as the ancestral father of Korea, the author of the article notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As widely known, the remains discovered at king Tangun's tomb were verified scores of times by the latest technical means and have proven to be over 5,000 years old. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Besides, there are  a large number of historical relics and remains and records, which prove that a state was founded and existed in Korea over 5,000 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Studies of documents and relics of Tangun temples prove that Tangun is not a mythical person but has been the object of national and social memorial services ever since ancient Korea. \"Susanjip,\" \"Ijaejonso\" and other documents say Tangun established the state five thousand years ago, not 4,300 years ago written in \"Samgukyusa\" and \"Jewangungi,\" and so on.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Scientific facts make it obvious that Tangun really existed in history and is the ancestral father of the nation. Damage to Tangun's statues and call for their pull-down can be done only by traitors who are indifferent to the nation and the ancestors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Connivance at the destruction of Tangun's statues and the move for their pull-down is also a criminal act that encourages those practices and a product of the criminal effort of the imperialists and their stooges to deepen discord within the nation. The South Korean authorities who live on the nation's split are driving a wedge between religious circles, fanning antagonism and confrontation among religionists and encouraging discord and split within the nation, in a bid to put down the people's spirit of national independence and check the growth of the pro-reunification patriotic forces. It is a pity that some dishonest religionists in South Korea, ignorant of the essence of this anti-national policy of the domestic and foreign reactionaries, are playing into the hands of the imperialists and authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We must clearly know the essence of the anti-Tangun moves of the imperialists and their stooges, frustrate their crafty intrigues, have correct understanding of the nation's history and contribute to the development of the nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
