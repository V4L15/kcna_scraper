            "content": "Utterance of U.S. secretary of defense accused \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- U.S. secretary of defense Rumsfeld addressing a recent closed meeting of the armed service committee of the U.S. House of Representatives said that the bush administration is now working out a new flexible military strategy to cope with an \"inevitable occurrence of unexpected situation\" such as a Korean War.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His utterance clearly suggests what the administration seeks on the Korean peninsula is a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has not given up an ambition for world domination by \"force\" and is working hard to achieve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation where the united states is making the outbreak of the second Korean war a fait accompli in a bid to realize its design once again convinces the Korean people of the greatness and vitality of the army-first politics of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the army-first politics of the wpk the people's army and people of Korea have a fixed will. If the enemy opts to start a new war at any cost, the army and people of the DPRK will deal a telling blow to him by displaying the strength they have so far built. It is their will and resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need to explain what consequences this devastating strike will bring. \r\n The U.S. had better bear this in mind and have a right option.    \r\n\r\n"

And he instructed this year that dead wives of martyrs should be buried in their husbands' graves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an expression of his unbounded love and deep trust in revolutionary comrades and their children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As of the end of may, remains of over 100 wives were buried in their husbands' graves at the cemetery.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA slams Japan's moves for aggression\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- Nakatani, director general of the Japan Defense Agency, told the security committee of the house of representatives on May 31 that \"cooperation from the self-defense forces is needed for the U.S. troops, if they are exposed to danger in the event of contingency in areas surrounding Japan.\" and he urged the government to allow the exercise of right to the collective self defense through the revision of the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that Japan is accelerating the moves to legalize the overseas aggression by the \"SDF\", a shock brigade in executing the U.S. world strategy, pursuant to the bush administration's policy of \"giving importance to Japan.\" At the same time, it shows the Japanese politicians are veering to the right so fast as to call for adopting militarisation as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present constitution of Japan bans, in principle, the possession of an army, the use of armed forces against any other country, and the exercise of \"right to collective self-defense\" intended for joint military actions with its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In spite of it, Japan keeps, in actuality, an army called \"SDF\", and has laid a groundwork for joint military actions such as the \"guidelines for U.S.-Japan defense cooperation\", reducing the pacific constitution to a mere name. What remains to be done by Japan at present is only to rewrite articles of the constitution in favour of militarisation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What cannot be overlooked is that the U.S. and Japan are in collusion with each other over the issue of the \"right to collective self-defense\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The former and new U.S. ambassadors to Japan recently called for the U.S. cooperation in this matter. Such call was repeated this time by the director general of the Japan defense agency. It is because the U.S. and Japan have the same interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to use Japan as a shock brigade for the implementation of its world strategy while the latter schemes to launch reinvasion of the Asia-Pacific region with the help of the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its vaulting ambition for militarisation. The U.S., too, had better refrain from the criminal conspiracy with Japan.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean air force exercise under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) --  The South Korean air force announced that it would stage a five day-long \"2001 exercise for supporting air battles\" from May 30 to be participated in by all its units and \"examine its results\".\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Participating in the exercise billed as a \"drill for the best maintenance and the increase of the capacity for arms support\" are F-4 and F-16 and other type fighters, training planes and  transport planes of different types and helicopters. specially selected \"elite ground crews and arms handlers\" are set to undergo training under the simulated conditions of an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To stage a drill of fitting planes with live ammunition and assembling bombs and examining its results under the simulated conditions of an actual war is a very dangerous development to be seen only on the eve of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a challenge to the joint meeting of political parties and organizations in the DPRK that discussed immediate measures and made an important proposal for opening the door of reunification by the efforts of the Korean nation on the occasion of the first anniversary of the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and also a provocation to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic idea of the declaration is to realise the country's reunification independently by the Korean nation's efforts in the north and the south, the main agent of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve the independent reunification, the north and south should get reconciled and united and reject the foreign interference in the internal affairs of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the South Korean military authorities are favouring foreign aggressor forces' hostile policy toward the DPRK and giving spurs to the arms buildup and the modernization of military hardware targeted against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitors to the nation cannot go scotfree while attempting to block the implementation of the declaration after rejecting fellow countrymen's offer for reconciliation and cooperation and joining hands with foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they bring the north-south relations back to the state of confrontation and tension before the adoption of the declaration, they will meet irretrievably serious consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean military authorities will have to be entirely responsible for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Through this they seek to stage military operations in any part of the world, which  precisely means Japan's overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, their moves for overseas invasion have entered the phase of its realization. \r\n If they begin overseas invasion, they will not be able to escape the same miserable doom as what the Japanese imperialists met for committing a war of aggression in the past.    \r\n\r\n"
