The assertion is, in the final analysis, prompted by its black-hearted intention to spark off territorial disputes and thus invent a pretext for launching reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the issue of the relations between Korea and Japan over the dominium over Tok Islet, it is an issue for Japan to make reparation to the DPRK for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists by invading Korea and grabbing Tok Islet in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese ruling quarters and paid historians are persistently asserting that Tok Islet belongs to Japan based on groundless \"data\" while working hard to destroy historical evidence proving truth.

            "content": "Unity of Patriotic Force Called for\r\n Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- Unity of the patriotic force serves as a decisive guarantee for advancing the victorious movement of independent reunification of fellow countrymen by smashing all sorts of challenges of history, Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can settle the issue of Korea's reunification related to national sovereignty in place of the Korean people and it is none other than the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad who are responsible for it, the article notes, and continues: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paying lip-service to national reunification while inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen and seeking the split of the country, contrary to their reconciliation and unity are treachery little short of opposing the national reunification and harming the interests of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the patriotic force in the north and the south and abroad should advance in close unity under the banner of independent reunification. Herein lies a main key to achieving the reunification and prosperity by the efforts of Koreans despite of any challenge on the part of separatists at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality goes to prove that unless the patriotic force in south Korea turns out as one in the struggle for the national reunification in close unity, south Koreans' desire for independence, democracy and national reunification can be trampled down by the fascist tyrants and irrevocably serious consequences be entailed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is hard to say that one has fulfilled one's mission as a member of the Korean nation at present if one sits with folded arms calling for the country's reunification and denouncing traitors in word only. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhoever loves the country and worries over the destiny of the nation ought to join in an unflinching struggle for the great national unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf all classes and strata closely unite on the principle of putting the desire and interests common to the nation above anything else irrespective of differing ideology, political view, religious belief, property status and social position, the strength of the patriotic forces will grow strong enough to clear any obstacle lying in the way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the people from all walks of life in the north and the south and abroad achieve firm unity as a patriotic force, no force on earth can match it and the Korean nation's just cause will surely emerge victorious, the article concludes."
