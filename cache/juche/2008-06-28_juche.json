            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry's Spokesman on U.S. Lifting of Major Economic Sanctions against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Friday as regards the U.S. announcement of its decision to lift major economic sanctions against the DPRK: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 26 the U.S. made public a decision on starting the process of taking the DPRK off the list of \"state sponsors of terrorism\" and exempting it from the \"Trading with the Enemy Act\" as a practical measure for lifting economic sanctions against the DPRK under the October 3 agreement reached at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK appreciates and hails this as a positive measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in the days ahead is for the U.S. to fundamentally drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a policy that compelled it to have access to a nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The measure taken by the U.S. to lift the major sanctions which it has applied against the DPRK, listing it as an enemy state for more than half a century, should lead to totally withdrawing its hostile policy toward the DPRK in all fields in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only then can the denuclearization process make smooth progress along its orbit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Other participating nations of the six-party talks should also fully honor their commitments to make economic compensations in time as already promised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six parties should have the fulfillment of all their commitments verified and monitored on the principle of the September 19 joint statement which calls for denuclearizing the whole Korean Peninsula in a verifiable manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will sincerely implement the September 19 joint statement, closely following each party's fulfillment of its commitment on the principle of \"action for action\" in the future, too, as it submitted a complete and accurate declaration on its nuclear activities this time in keeping with the U.S. measure for political compensation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Additional Negotiations on Beef Import Termed Humiliating Ones \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group, much upset by the massive resistance of infuriated south Koreans, are trying to calm down them through \"special press conference,\" reshuffle and additional negotiations on beef import. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are even talking about taking \"measures related to economy and people's livelihood\" and \"accommodating requests of workers\". In the meantime, they are busy hurling ultra-right conservative organizations into streets to perpetrate rash acts against candlelight demonstrations staged by people from all walks of life and egging conservative media on to hype \"the change in the pure nature of candlelight demonstrations\" while intensifying the fascist suppression of demonstrators by mobilizing a huge police force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the National Reconciliation Council in a statement on June 27 said that even though the Lee group conducted additional negotiations with the U.S., much upset by the massive resistance of south Koreans from all walks of life, they proved once again to be humiliating negotiations as there was no change in essence and a cynical ploy to mislead public opinion and deceive the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee seeks to deceive and mock at the people the same way the military dictators usurped the fruits of the struggle for democratization through such political fraud as \"June 29 declaration\" during the June Popular Uprising more than two decades ago, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee should clearly understand that it is no more than a daydream to try to hoodwink the people's mind-set and mislead public opinion at home and abroad by such a hackneyed method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ongoing candlelight actions in south Korea are, in essence, a stern punishment meted out to the Lee group for pursuing a sycophantic, treacherous and servile policy to serve the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a mockery at the people and threat and blackmail against them for the Lee group of traitors to talk about \"the change in the pure nature of candlelight demonstrations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With neither cynical ploy nor fascist suppression can they arrest the struggle of the south Korean people for an independent life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should certainly foil the Lee group's appeasement and deception and blackmail and intensify the resistance and thus bring the group of traitors to their knees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group should unconditionally meet the unanimous demands of the south Korean people, clearly understanding that only shameful destruction awaits those who go against the desire of the people and the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
