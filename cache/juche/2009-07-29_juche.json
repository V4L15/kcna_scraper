Japan can hardly redeem all those crimes even if it spends all its assets and sells the whole of its territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that Japan is seeking its way out in persistently stepping up its hostile policy towards the DPRK, evading its legal and moral responsibility to make reparation for the misfortune and pain and damage inflicted upon the Koreans.

The true aim sought by it through the said campaign is to justify its fascist terrorism by linking it with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contradiction and conflict between the patriotic and traitorous forces, between progressive and conservative forces and between the working masses and the privileged circle which the group describes as \"south-south conflict\" in south Korea are festering as the days go by due to the traitorous politics and fascist actions of the group against people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Lee group is misleading the public opinion by spreading misinformation that the \"south-south conflict\" is fostered by someone.

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica confabulacion militar Japon-EE.UU.\r\n Pyongyang, 29 de julio (ATCC) -- Recientemente, los encargados de los asuntos diplomaticos y de defensa de Japon y Estados Unidos sostuvieron en Tokio una reunion de trabajo con vistas a aprobar la nueva \"declaracion conjunta de seguridad Japon-EE.UU.\", que incluya, entre otras cosas, la ampliacion de la alianza bilateral, hacia 2010 en que se cumpliran 50 anos de la enmienda del \"tratado de seguridad Japon-EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  En un comentario individual difundido este miercoles, el rotativo Rodong Sinmun califica esa reunion de peligrosa conspiracion militar entre esas dos fuerzas belicistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esa ocasion los debates fueron enfocados al problema de cooperar estrechamente en el dominio militar, inclusive el ofrecimiento del \"ampliado disuasivo nuclear para defender a Japon\" por parte de EE.UU., adelanta el comentarista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Igualmente, ambas partes coincidieron en solidarizarse y cooperar estrechamente en la \"defensa\" para hacer frente a la inexistente \"amenaza\" de la RPDC y continuar la reorganizacion de las tropas norteamericanas estacionadas en Japon como ya fue acordado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como resultado, se dieron las posibilidades de emplazar en el territorio japones mas armas nucleares y otras fuerzas de ataque estrategico de EE.UU. y ese pais isleno podra aumentar abiertamente en gran medida sus fuerzas agresoras pretextando la ampliacion de la \"alianza\" bilateral.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Japon tiene por su estrategia principal la conversion en una potencia militar y el expansionismo a ultramar a fuerza de bayonetas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si se fortalece practicamente la cooperacion militar entre esos dos paises con vistas a la aprobacion de la nueva \"declaracion conjunta de seguridad Japon-EE.UU.\", se generara y se agudizara la nueva carrera armamentista en Asia y a la larga, se daran las circunstancias tan catastroficas como la guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo insoslayable del caso es que Japon impulsa abiertamente la aprobacion de esa \"declaracion\" bajo el pretexto de la falsa \"amenaza militar\" proveniente de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto refleja la anejada politica hostil de los reaccionarios japoneses a Corea y el intento de ellos de agredirla confabulandose con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nueva \"declaracion conjunta de seguridad Japon-EE.UU.\" causara a este pais isleno solo los desastres catastroficos que daran la muerte a los reaccionarios japoneses."
