It was not until Juche 43 (1954) when President Kim Il Sung visited there that it began to develop into a modern integrated farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The souvenir sheet carries an oil painting that depicts the President on his visit to the county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taehongdan is associated with the struggle of the anti-Japanese fighters and honored with inspection trips by leader Kim Jong Il, who has boosted it into a pace-setter in the nation's potato farming and provided its population with welfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stamp shows in the upper part the slogan \"Bring about a decisive turn in potato farming to convert Taehongdan county into a communist paradise \" and in the center the facelifted appearance of the county as a modern farm. \r\n\r\n"

The proposal indicates a basic way of achieving the reunification of the country most fairly and smoothly on condition that the north and the south tolerate ideologies and systems there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three-point charter of national reunification set forth by the President Kim Il Sung and formulated by the respected leader Kim Jong Il is a highly important guideline to be held fast to by all Koreans desirous of reunification. \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, the Kanggye spirit were created and torches lit by the Songjin Steel Complex and the Rakwon Machine Plant to bring about a great revolutionary advance across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This revolutionary practice more firmly convinced the Korean people that they are sure to win despite many ordeals and difficulties as long as they are under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can break the single-hearted unity in the DPRK based on the leader's boundless love and devoted service for the people and their absolute trust and loyalty to him. \r\n\r\n"
