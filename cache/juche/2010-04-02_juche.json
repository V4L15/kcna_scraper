E hizo establecer nuevamente varias leyes para dar la garantia legal a la labor de salud publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Senalo que gracias a la sabia direccion del Presidente y el Dirigente se lograron los grandes exitos en esta rama durante los 30 anos pasados y se manifestaron con vigor la superioridad y vitalidad de la ley en cuestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La peculiaridad propia del socialismo consiste en anteponer el bienestar del pueblo y absolutizarlo y prestar todos los beneficios a este, dijo y destaco que los trabajadores de salud publica deben cumplir cabalmente dicha ley y hacer que los beneficios del partido y el Estado se dirijan mas bien a los trabajadores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la ocasion estuvieron presentes el secretario del CC del PTC Choe Thae Bok, funcionarios y trabajadores destacados de salud publica."
