Now is the time for you to open to public the fact that \"confidence-building process\" and \"gaining a great opportunity of unification\" touted by you was chicanery to realize the wild dream for \"unification through absorption\" at the U.S. beck and call, isn't it?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Will you persist in shameless acts to conceal the fact that what you touted was a trite artifice to cover up your sinister design to realize the wild ambition for \"unification through absorption\" now that your confrontational intention has been fully revealed?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. You cry out for a \"preemptive strike\" with the backing of the U.S. Do you not care about Seoul including Chongwadae and all other parts of south Korea being reduced to a sea in flames and debris by a prompt and merciless counter-strikes of the DPRK?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Do you think you can remain indifferent to the above-said event and you can survive a nuclear war? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Don't you know that your open agitation of \"defection from the north\" is hideous allurement and abduction and a thrice-cursed crime against humanity diametrically running counter to international law and the UN Charter? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Openly agitating \"defection\" among the people of a sovereign state is just a blatant challenge and wanton violation of the UN Charter and international law stipulating it as the fundamental principle to respect sovereignty of all countries and not interfere in their internal affairs and specifying abduction as crime against humanity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t You often accuse others, talking about \"observance of the UN Charter\" and \"international law\", but make no scruple of committing inhuman crimes, ignorant of the above-said elementary principle, don't you?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Can you own responsibility for groundlessly distorting the reality in the DPRK and decrying its sincere efforts for mending the north-south relations by running the whole gamut of lies, tricks and fabrications to incite hostility toward the compatriots in the north during your tenure of office?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ruler ill-famed for lies and fabrications is bound to meet a stern punishment of history after being forsaken by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCan you own responsibility before history and the nation for falsifying truth about the DPRK and desperately inciting bad blood toward the fellow countrymen in the north by floating wild rumors about them?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Can you allow south Koreans to come here and see what is happening in the north for themselves when all ways to the north are kept open, not preventing them from seeing and hearing about the DPRK as you are desperately negating the eye-opening realities in the DPRK?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYou'd better come here and see if you want to help south Koreans dispel their doubts about \"contingency\", \"instable social system\" and \"effective sanctions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t You may send all who want to come here and see if you are not in a position to personally come here for fear of punishment for your sins.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6. Are you ready to acknowledge the thrice-cursed crimes you have committed by hurting the dignity and honor of the service personnel and people of the DPRK and face a stern judgment at a DPRK court?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe supreme judicial organ of the DPRK branded you as a top-class criminal and sentenced you to capital punishment long ago according to the criminal code of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs you unhesitatingly and desperately insulted the symbol of the dignity and glory of the DPRK, you should be \"emboldened\" to pay a dear price for it.

Many south Koreans concerned of the cooperative relations between the north and the south entered the 100-day all-night sit-in demanding the puppet authorities roll back its policy of escalating the confrontation with the north with the anniversary of the October 4 declaration as a momentum.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in an article the massive anti-\"government\" struggle of the south Korean people of all social standings is an eruption of the pent-up grievance and resentment at the Park Geun Hye group of traitors as it has turned south Korea into a barren land of democracy, human rights and people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The worst \"era of people's misfortune\" and \"era of people's despair\" is coming to south Korea due to the brutal tyranny of the Chongwadae witch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Countless are those who commit suicides, unable to live and those emigrating to other countries after abandoning \"nationality\" in south Korea where all crimes and scandals are rampant and horrible disasters occur one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unable to live any longer under the unprecedented unpopular rule of  the group of traitors which has driven the people's living into destitution, the south Korean people are rising en masse in the anti-\"government\" struggle in the death-defying spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The massive anti-\"government\" struggle of the south Korean people represents their protest against the confrontation maniacs bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can be neither slightest compromise nor concession to the group of traitors challenging the people's aspiration and desire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The earlier such regime collapses, the better."

This only provokes a side-splitting laughter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Preemptive attack on the north\" Park touted as \"solution to the nuclear issue of the north\" is no more than reckless hysteria to be kicked up by an idiot on the deathbed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The preemptive attack on the DPRK, the world's nuclear power, is bound to lead to the final destruction of the U.S. and the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She would be well advised to behave herself, mindful that nothing is more foolish than attempting to dodge the DPRK's retaliatory nuclear strike with such ineffective means as THAAD. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is still counting on her racket for sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK though she has bitterly experienced they are no longer workable. She must be a halfwit, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she tries to destroy through sanctions and pressure the bulwark of independence, invincible political and military power cemented under the banner of independence in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliance in defense over the last several decades, this is as foolish an act as working hard to sweep the sea with a broom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as \"solution to the nuclear issue of the north\" is concerned, it is necessary to root out the fundamental factor that compelled the DPRK to access to nuclear weapons."

Ella esta hablando abiertamente del \"ataque preventivo\" depositando la confianza en EE.UU. ?No le importa que se reduzcan a cenizas no solo Seul, donde se halla Chongwadae, sino toda la extension geografica surcoreana por el inmediato y despiadado contraataque de la RPDC?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Piensa acaso que podra salvarse en la guerra nuclear cuyo resultado se decide en el acto?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. ?No sabe acaso que la abierta agitacion de la \"fuga del Norte\" es el brutal acto de rapto y secuestro y el crimen antietico que desafian a las leyes internacionales y a la Carta de la ONU?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa abierta agitacion de \"sumision\" sobre los habitantes de un Estado soberano deviene un desafio frontal y flagrante violacion de la Carta de la ONU y las leyes internacionales que estipulan como principios fundamentales el respeto a la soberania de todos los paises y la no intervencion en asuntos internos y como brutal crimen antietico los actos de secuestro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye esta acostumbrada a acusar a otros hablando a menudo de la \"observacion de la Carta de la ONU\" y las \"leyes internacionales\". Entonces, ?cometera ella sin vacilacion alguna los escalofriantes crimenes inhumanitarios y antieticos sin conocer tales cosas elementales? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. ?Puede asumir ante la historia y la nacion la responsabilidad de haber inculcado la hostilidad a la parte connacional durante su mandato tergiversando y difamando con mentiras, fraudes e inventos el verdadero aspecto de la RPDC y sus sinceros esfuerzos por mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gobernador, habituado a mentir e inventar, pierde sin falta la popularidad y sera condenado a la severa sentencia de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5. Ella trata de tapar la vista y oidos de la poblacion surcoreana negando obstinadamente la realidad brillante de la RPDC. Entonces, ?sera capaz de venir a nuestro pais para confirmar los hechos con ojos propios, ya que le dejaremos abiertos todos los caminos?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA Park le convendria venir a la RPDC para aclarar las sospechas de la poblacion surcoreana sobre la demagogia de ella, tales como el \"estado emergente\", la \"inestabilidad del regimen\" y los \"efectos de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no puede hacerlo por el miedo al castigo correspondiente a sus crimenes anti-RPDC, que mande a todas las personas que quieran visitar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t6. ?Tiene la osadia de recibir la severa sentencia en el tribunal de la RPDC reconociendo sus inauditos crimenes de ofender la dignidad y el orgullo de nuestros militares y habitantes e insultar la vida feliz de ellos?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace mucho tiempo, segun el codigo penal de la RPDC, nuestro supremo organo judicial sentencio a la pena capital a Park al calificarla de criminal de pesima calana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que ella fue tan atrevida en insultar el simbolo de toda la dignidad y gloria de la RPDC, deberia ser \"resuelta\" tambien en pagar sus actos criminales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Tendria acaso Park Geun-hye el coraje de hacerlo?"
