Korean Forces' War Exercises Flayed--Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The puppet warmongers of south Korea staged a large-scale joint air rehearsal in the sky above the west of the Korean Peninsula from May 23 to 27 together with the U.S. air forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t Involved in this anti-DPRK rehearsal were more than 50 aerial warplanes and nuclear preemptive attack means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rehearsal was very provocative and dangerous in content and nature as it was conducted in way of setting up \"enemy formations\" and then \"repelling\" someone's \"provocation for overall war\" with big offensive formations and dropping strategic bombs on main ground targets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was a vivid expression of the scheme to mount preemptive attack on the DPRK and a reckless military provocation aimed to escalate the tension on the peninsula and spark off a war of aggression on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are now escalating grave military provocation to the DPRK as never before in the West Sea of Korea under the signboard of \"threat from the north\" and staging almost every day anti-DPRK war games in the western area of the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Especially, naval firing exercises and war confabs against the DPRK are going on one after another in and around the five islands in the territorial waters of the DPRK on the West Sea of Korea. And big south Korea-U.S. joint marines rehearsal is to be staged around Paekryong Island in July for the first time of its kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces have recently got hell-bent on setting up of trial \"command for defense of northwest islands\", calling for \"defense reform\" the keynote of which is to \"strengthen joint action\" of the three services and the marine corps. Accordingly, the madcap war games in the western region are a blatant challenge and provocation to the DPRK which is making every possible effort for the improvement of the north-south relations and peace of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We love peace, but will mete out merciless and strong punishment to those seeking do harm to it. We never make an empty talk."
