His demeanor would not help settle the issue but only put indelible stain on his reputation and image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His efforts to internationalize the DPRK's issue at the instruction of the U.S. go to clearly prove once again before the international community that the secretariat of the IAEA is no more than a poor servant and a mouthpiece of the U.S.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

This is no more than a crafty attempt and sophism to equate an assailant with a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the Bush administration that nullified what was achieved in the efforts to improve the DPRK-U.S. relations during its preceding administration, listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and singled it out as a target of preemptive nuclear attacks, thus breaching the basic spirit of the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's decision to withdraw from the NPT is being described by some of the international community as an international issue of universal importance related to the fate of the NPT because of such base moves of the U.S. and the IAEA which acts its political waiting maid away from the principle and impartiality as an international organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If other countries are interested in the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, they should bear in mind that the only thing they are requested to do is to urge the U.S. to come out to the negotiations with the DPRK without preconditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they behave with the contention that the DPRK should move unilaterally or it is the way of solving the issue to internationalize it, ignoring the unavoidable stark historical fact related to the settlement of the issue, they will only create an unpredictable complexity and difficulties in the solution of the issue and the efforts to establish justice and equality in the international relations will fail, either.    \r\n\r\n"
