            "content": "Kim Yong Il Reiterates Will to Contribute to Building Better Asia\r\n Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will fulfill its responsibility and role in opening a bright prospect for developing economy, environment and energy in an effort to make a positive contribution to the building of better Asia. Kim Yong Il, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, who is heading the WPK delegation said this in his speech at the 6th general meeting of the International Conference of Asian Political Parties on Dec. 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the importance of the development of economy, environment and energy at present in carving out a better future, he underscored the need to ensure socio-political stability in order to successfully solve this issue as required by the ideal of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that socio-political stability is fully ensured in the DPRK, he noted that the WPK set it as a primary important political task to protect environment and develop clean energy in building an economic power and improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After giving a detailed account of the fact that the DPRK has directed great efforts to environmental protection, he declared that the WPK and the DPRK government would boost cooperation with international organizations and other countries in the efforts to settle the issue of global environmental protection and climate change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stable environment in the vicinity of the country presents itself as the most urgent issue at present in the WPK's activities for developing national economy and promoting the people's well-being, he said, adding that outsiders' interference and constant threat of the forces hostile to the DPRK persist on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity even in the 21st century after the demise of the Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ulterior aim sought by south Korea in perpetrating the recent provocations against the DPRK around Yonphyong Island, the sensitive waters along the maritime boundary line in the West Sea of Korea, was to make the public believe that the DPRK recognized the waters off Yonphyong Island as \"territorial waters\" of south Korea in case the former does not take any physical counter-action. The DPRK, however, has neither recognized them nor will do so in the future, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another aim sought by south Korea was to let the U.S. nuclear carrier George Washington sail into the West Sea of Korea at any cost under the pretext of the above-said incident. In the final analysis, south Korea played the role of a marionette for its American master this time again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the WPK's Songun policy the danger of war is defused and peace ensured on the peninsula and the Korean people's cause of building a thriving nation has been successfully pushed ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In closing, he expressed thanks to political parties of different countries for extending support and encouragement to the WPK and the Korean people in their just cause."

            "content": "KCNA Warns against US-S. Korean Puppet Group's Rash Acts\r\nPyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency is authorized to release Sunday the following report:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group, far from drawing a lesson from the deserved punishment it faced for its reckless firing of shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side around Yonphyong Island, is getting more frantic in military provocations and war moves under this pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group staged the largest-ever madcap combined exercises together with the U.S. in waters of the West Sea of Korea with its nuclear carrier flotilla involved right after the shelling incident on Yonphyong Island. It plans to stage large-scale combined naval maneuvers with huge armed forces of the U.S. Seventh Fleet including its nuclear submarines involved in the near future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It noisily announced that firing exercises would be staged at 29 places in the East, West and South seas of south Korea simultaneously from Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Taechong Island, one of the five islands in the West Sea very close to the territory of the DPRK, is included in them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are loudly advertising that they would fire shells into the territorial waters of the DPRK side from Yonphyong Island, i.e. in the same direction they did when committing the recent provocation. This indicates how frantic they have become in their provocative acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  They are getting very busy massively introducing latest weapons including MLRS and missiles into Yonphyong Island to reinforce the fire power and installations and stage a take-shelter drill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet military war-like forces were reported to have already worked out the so-called \"retaliatory plan\" which calls for sparking off an armed clash after getting on the nerves of the DPRK militarily and taking a large-scale counter-action under this pretext and designated Yonphyong Island as an ignition point to put it into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that the Lee Myung Bak group is set to orchestrate the second Yonphyong Island incident at any cost and ignite a war come what may under this pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is so hell-bent on the moves to escalate the confrontation and start a war that it is recklessly behaving, bereft of reason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war-like forces including the new puppet defence minister vociferated about the \"principal enemy\" and the like while daring take issue with even the leadership of the DPRK. They blustered that they would make a \"precision strike\" at artillery positions of the DPRK and \"reduce them to ashes\" by modifying the \"rules for battles\" and setting in motion all the war means including aircraft. They went the lengths of letting loose outbursts that they would use the defence positions on the five islands in the West Sea as springboards for attack from which to strike the strategic targets deep inside the territory of the DPRK including Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The frantic provocations on the part of the puppet group are rapidly driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an uncontrollable extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can predict to what extent the situation will deteriorate in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is now maintaining a maximum self-possession and self-control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If an all-out war breaks out between the north and the south, it will seriously affect peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Public opinion at home and abroad and the parties concerned are called upon to pay a serious attention to the daily worsening situation on the peninsula and properly understand who is a provocateur and who is a defender of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet group would be well advised to stop acting rashly, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their reckless military provocation."
