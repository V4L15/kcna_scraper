It is persistently letting loose a spate of sophism intended to slander the just and fair stand of the DPRK and embellish its traitorous \"policy toward the north\", uttering such words as \"threat\" and \"regret\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t It is the unanimous desire of the fellow countrymen and the requirement of the history of the nation to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for honoring it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t The group is now driving the inter-Korean relations to a serious situation reminiscent of the eve of their collapse, while insulting and defaming the DPRK's system and, furthermore, disclosing even its intention to invade the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t At the recent 40th south Korea-U.S. \"annual security consultative meeting\" the puppet warmongers again hatched a dangerous nuclear war plot to consolidate \"military cooperation system\" for stifling the DPRK and round up the overall operation posture for attacking it while calling for \"preparations to cope with an emergency situation\" of somebody. It is, at the same time, reneging on all military agreements between the north and the south by going on with the provocative scattering of leaflets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t This glaringly reveals its belligerent ambition to stifle the DPRK at any cost in league with foreign forces, denying its ideology and system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t We can never allow the Lee group to hurl slanders and calumnies at our just response while spelling out \"threat\" and \"regret\". It is more intolerable as it is a revelation of the group's sinister anti-reunification aim to vitiate the atmosphere of implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, denying the DPRK's ideology and system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t To implement the above-said declarations is the only way of developing the inter-Korean relations and achieving the peace of the country and the common prosperity of the nation, concludes the article."
