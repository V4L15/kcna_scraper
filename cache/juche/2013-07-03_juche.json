            "content": "Kim Jong Un Gives Field Guidance to Kangdong Precision Machine Plant\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, gave field guidance to the Kangdong Precision Machine Plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the room for the education in the revolutionary history of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the plant developed into a model one relying on its own efforts under the wise guidance of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he examined new-type precision machine products on the spot, adding they were excellent ones. Noting the plant successfully carried out the task Kim Jong Il assigned to it in the last period of his life, Kim Jong Un said Kim Jong Il would have been very pleased if he had seen the Korean-style machine product characteristic of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to spruce up the room for the education in the revolutionary history and bring the undying leadership feats of the great Generalissimos home to its employees so that they may steadfastly carry forward the tradition of the plant in which it had devotedly carried out any task set forth by the Generalissimos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching the monument to the field guidance of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Un underlined the need to erect well such monuments at the units associated with leadership feats of the Generalissimos. He gave an important instruction to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching precision machine products made at the plant, he said they look nice and are convenient for use and very high in their performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different shops, he learned about production and modernization there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the processing shop he learned that workers are operating numerically controlled milling machines and other CNC-based equipment manufactured by their own efforts and with indigenous technology. He once again highly appreciated their revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the assembling shop, he watched with keen attention the assembling of products. Paying deep attention to working environment, he indicated an orientation and ways to improve it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning about the performance of precision machines, he told workers to make a good performance note. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learnt about the production of daily necessities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at umbrellas, door-knobs, hair-clippers, etc. he said that it is necessary for the plant to fulfill its plan for the production of not only precision machines but daily necessities without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The plant has an important role to play in developing the nation's machine-building industry, he noted, setting forth tasks to be fulfilled by the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the plant should honor its production plan for this year without fail and wage a dynamic drive to boost the production of precision machines, he set the goal to be attained by the plant in a few years to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the plant could improve the performance and quality of its precision machines as it put the processing equipment on a CNC-basis, he emphasized that it should realize the modernization of equipment at a higher level in order to increase the production of machines and ensure their precision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to make precision machines prove efficient in practice, it is necessary to wage a dynamic technological innovation drive for ensuring the reliability of products and making them light.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the workers of the plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Hwang Pyong So and Hong Yong Chil."

All facts go to prove that the real provocateur and main culprit of acute tensions is none other than the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such unceasing vicious cycle of acute tensions on the peninsula is attributable to the deeply-rooted hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has not recognized the sovereignty of the DPRK but pursued all sorts of sanctions, pressure and military provocation against it for more than half a century since it designated the DPRK as enemy from the very day of its founding for the mere reason that it has differing ideology and social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to settle the nuclear issue on the peninsula and any other matters and the vicious cycle of tensions will persist nonstop unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy toward the DPRK and defuses its nuclear threat to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. drop of its hostile policy should start from the conclusion of a peace treaty between the U.S. and the DPRK on the basis of the respect for the latter's sovereignty and halt to all sanctions and military provocations against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year marks the 60th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We once again call for an immediate dismantlement of the \"UN Command\" which has existed so far by abusing the name of the UN as a leftover of the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is our stand to put an end to the tensions on the peninsula through dialogue and negotiations and to contribute to the regional peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the DPRK proposed high-level talks between the authorities of the DPRK and the U.S. to have sincere discussions on wide-ranging issues including defusing military tensions on the peninsula, replacing the Armistice Agreement by a peace mechanism and \"building a world without nuclear weapons\" touted by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the international community is expressing serious concern over the tense situation on the peninsula, if the U.S. truly wants detente, it should respond to the bold decision and goodwill of the DPRK without any precondition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Proceeding from its invariable stand for independent reunification of the country and peace and prosperity of the nation, the DPRK will make responsible and patient efforts to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK foreign minister expressed belief that the member states of the forum would extend support and solidarity to the sincere efforts of the DPRK to end the vicious cycle of tensions and achieve durable peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government will as ever make every effort to boost the friendly and cooperative relations with the regional countries, guided by the idea of its foreign policy -- independence, peace and friendship -- and protect peace and security in the region including the peninsula, he stressed."
