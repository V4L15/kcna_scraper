But, some hostile forces are attempting to pull up the DPRK over its step for bolstering up the self-reliant defence capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn June 23, a press statement was made at the UNSC to \"denounce\" the test-fire, calling for the implementation of \"resolution on sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe totally reject this UNSC press statement, which is devoid of impartiality and a product of double-standard, as an invention of the U.S. chiefly responsible for the escalated tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe successful test-fire of strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-10, a normal action pursuant to the DPRK's line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force, was a self-defensive step to reliably defend the security of the country and its people from the U.S. and other hostile forces' constant threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever the UN Security Council adopted what is called a press statement and cried out for the implementation of the \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK. This is an unreasonable deed of turning black into white.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK is a product of high-handedness wantonly violating the sovereignty of an independent state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UN Secretariat, too, has not brought up the legal basis for justifying it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is the very one that threatens the DPRK by force and aggravates the situation intentionally, steadily hurling into south Korea such strategic means as nuclear submarines and strategic bombers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a legitimate self-defensive step for the DPRK to secure the corresponding powerful attack means now that the U.S. is constantly posing threats to the sovereignty and vital rights of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs already declared by the DPRK, detente and stability on the Korean peninsula cannot be realized by anyone's unilateral efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is well advised to recall how the DPRK emerged a nuclear weapons state and has steadily bolstered war deterrence, before criticizing the latter's efforts to increase the military strength, and reflect on its extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts sustained strategic mistake and rash deed are now driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the uncontrollable extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will take in succession the self-defensive countermeasures of its style as long as the U.S. continues resorting to nuclear threat, sanctions and pressure on it."

The Park Geun Hye regime of south Korea was entirely to blame for this situation as it has been hell-bent on acts of treachery with the daydream of isolating and stifling the compatriots in the north in collusion with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the puppet forces are going so impudent as to find fault with the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over \"scrapping\" and \"violation.\" This is just like a guilty party filing the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime has lost face or qualifications long ago to talk about the north-south agreements as it is bringing the danger of a nuclear war to hang over the nation after reducing south Korea to the world's biggest nuclear outpost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group can never evade the responsibility for having totally denied and scrapped the inter-Korean agreements.
