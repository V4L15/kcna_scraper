It is also the Koreans who are capable of doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of reunification related to the national sovereignty should not be left to foreign forces to settle it.

Commenting on this, foreign media noted that south Korea is finding itself in a more awkward position as it has to read the face of both the U.S. and China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become an irresistible trend of times at present to advance toward multi-polarization against the U.S. brigandish unipolar domination system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the vicious obstructive moves of the U.S. the number of countries and regions joining in the establishment of the bank is on the steady increase and they are stepping up preparations including the accumulation of funds after setting it as their goal to open the bank at the end of 2014 or early in 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on it, Ta Kung Pao, a newspaper in Hong Kong, China, and other foreign media reported that the establishment of the AIIB in the pipeline is to cope with the domination system including the ADB led by the U.S. and Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that once the new bank officially starts its business, the black tentacles stretched out by the U.S. to the region will prove all the more incompetent and the conflict between China and the U.S. will further fester.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, infrastructures of the U.S. aimed at world domination are shaking to their very foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should face up to the present era in which no nation allows domination and subjugation."
