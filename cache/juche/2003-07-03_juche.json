Korea urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- The Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, the All India Indo-Korean Friendship Association and the Indian Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification in a joint statement on June 24 demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. military bases and forces from South Korea on the occasion of the Month of Anti-U.S. Joint Struggle (June 25-July 27).\r\n The statement said that June 25, 1950 was the day the United States unleashed a despicable war of aggression against the Korean people and July 27, 1953 was the day the Korean people won a victory in the war by defeating the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the proposals for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country advanced by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il and the struggle of the Korean people for materializing them, the statement said: We express great concern about the U.S. moves to ignite an all-out war against the DPRK, a peace-loving socialist country, by using modern weapons of mass destruction in disregard of the world opinion and violation of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula, it will be a nuclear war which will not be confined to the peninsula but will spill over into other regions to bring a horrible nuclear holocaust to humankind and the u.s. will not escape responsibility for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The continued presence in South Korea of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces equipped with modern weapons poses a constant threat to the Korean peninsula and lays a main obstacle to the peaceful reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We extend firm solidarity to the Korean people in their just struggle to improve the inter-Korean ties and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n"

This indicates that the Bush administration's psychological operation to isolate and stifle the DPRK has reached its zenith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is part of various plots hatched by the U.S. to tarnish the dignified image of the political system in the DPRK and escalate the international pressure upon it. This is a serious interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Article 67 and 68 of the Socialist Constitution of the DPRK stipulate that citizens are guaranteed freedom of speech, of the press, of assembly, of association, of demonstration and of religion and all the popular masses are provided with independent rights, vital rights, rights of equality and development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no human rights issue in our system as the leader, the party and the masses are single-heartedly united and the whole country forms a harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is to blame for human rights abuses before any others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not qualified to talk about this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which killed so many innocent civilians and reduced cities and villages to debris in Afghanistan and Iraq, bringing the worst disasters to their people after provoking wars of aggression there under the signboard of \"anti-terrorism\" in a bid to meet its aims and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is ridden with the worst racial discrimination and the most horrible crimes due to social conflict and class confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to official information released by the U.S. judicial authority, 265 people are being shot and 87 of them are left dead on a daily average and more than 1.3 million cases of such crimes of violence as rape, robbery and plunder are reported every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indiscriminate attacks are being made on members of other sects for the mere reason that they challenge the U.S. view on value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that amnesty international in an annual report issued last year on its 40th anniversary listed the U.S. as a stumbling block in the human rights performance in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will not be able to escape international isolation and self-destruction if it keeps resorting to arbitrary and high-handed practices, hatching plots and seeking hegemony, while wantonly infringing upon the sovereignty of other countries under the hypocritical motto \"protection of human rights.\"    \r\n\r\n"

The committee, as a partner of Hyundai, categorically refutes the \"results\" and expresses deep regret at the investigation, the statement said.\r\n The \"results of investigation\" evoke the nation's concern and denunciation as it is an anti-reunification act that goes against the history, downplays the significance of the historic Pyongyang meeting in the nation's history and torpedoes the good process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can downplay the significance of the historic Pyongyang meeting and the June 15 Joint Declaration in the nation's history and their great vitality no matter what others may say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An astronomical amount of dollars has been spent for the U.S. imperialist forces' presence in South Korea and their overseas aggression and billions of dollars were used to pursue the so-called \"northern policy.\" yet, those involved in the investigation kept mum about this but are going to bring those related to the inter-Korean cooperation to a \"court\" and take a legal action against them for spending a small amount of money for it. This can not but be shame and tragedy for the nation, before talking about the backward and treacherous nature of South Korean politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All those involved in the Pyongyang meeting should be acquitted and set free as they performed feats before the history and the nation and the unreasonable \"suit\" brought against them should be withdrawn immediately. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south side finally tries those related to the Pyongyang meeting and punishes them, going against the nation's desire and trend of the times for reunification, it will be held entirely responsible for the serious impact the action will have on the north-south relations.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. assertion that the DPRK's export of missiles is illegal and threatens other countries and thus they should break off trade and military cooperation with the DPRK is a frantic violation of the principle of respect for the sovereignty of independent states and non-interference in others' internal affairs, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had exported weapons worth nearly 50 billion dollars from 1997 to 2001. The U.S. tops the list of weapon export states, gaining huge profits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. that has committed illegal acts in exporting weapons and threatened other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sinister anti-DPRK campaign aims to internationalize \"threats\" from the DPRK to lay a \"collective siege\" to the DPRK. The U.S. moves to form a \"collective siege network\" against the DPRK are, in essence, the revelation of its dangerous attempt to bring the DPRK under its control by the allied imperialist forces and international reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's development, deployment and export of missiles is a matter belonging to the sovereign right of the Korean people. If the DPRK does not have such a powerful war deterrent force as missiles, it may be attacked by the U.S. any time. \r\n The U.S. racket about the development, deployment and export of missiles in the DPRK can never go down with the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The determination of the Korean people to strengthen the self-defensive military power in every way under the Songun banner will never be shaken whatever others may say.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
