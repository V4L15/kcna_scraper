Myohyang splashed in the golden scarlet of autumn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After a singing and dancing entertainment by Kindergarteners and their teachers, Ri Un Jong, a fourth-year girl pupil from Moranbong Senior Middle School no. 1, stepped forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 14-year-old poet was born of a worker. As a child, she often delighted her family with singing and dancing. As a nursery kid, she learned reading and writing and took a fancy to \"writing\" on her own, starting on her \"diary\". This gift caught the attention of her mother and teachers. They taught her how to write a diary and poem and often read to her good pieces of children's poems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When she was a primary school pupil, she exhibited a keen interest in literature. She was constantly absorbed in thinking and writing, gradually increasing her stock of poems. There was little to miss her attention, and even a flower or sculpture in a park inspired her. Last year her poem, \"a bull in the children's park\" was greatly favored at the national our classroom prize literary contest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The budding talent was a source of wonder and pride to her school teachers, who examined all her pieces and taught her essentials in writing and imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her literary practices went deep and steady at home, at school, on the way to and from there, and at the time of camping and study tour. Her poem, \"A Silent Teacher\" from her visit to a revolutionary battle site, was a hit at the National April 15 Mangyongdae Prize Literary Contest. Her another piece, \"A Letter\" on the children's veneration of leader Kim Jong Il as their father, bagged the top prize at the 13th National Our Classroom Prize Literary Contest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In her meeting with the former prisoners, she recited \"Undying Eagles\" in a resonant voice, in a vivid reference to their integrity and willpower. Part of it runs:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n Grandfathers, your splendid spirit &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Has been embedded in our hearts &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As pillars of faith and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this faith and will &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We eight million youth and children &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Will follow father Kim Jong Il to the end.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n The former prisoners were touched to the quick, and they hugged her in tears, blessing her bright future. \r\n\r\n"

It is a blatant challenge to the DPRK and its people and a shameless affront to the unbiased press and public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The magazine's spread of sheer lies is a malignant and dastardly diatribe against the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and part of the campaign to drive a wedge in the relations between the north and south and fan up inter-Korean confrontation and enmity toward the DPRK among the Japanese people. Lurking behind this smear campaign is the black-hearted intention of the Japanese reactionaries to swim against the trend of the world situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to make the article sound plausible the magazine used an ambiguous pen name for it and cited a forged material what it called \"statements\". But it became clear that the material the magazine classified as \"top secret\" was full of gross misrepresentations of clipped official publications of the DPRK and was dreamed up with contents and sentences quite contrary to facts and expressions not in use in the country. This only betrayed the clumsy and shameless method employed by the magazine in cooking up the false story. The magazine has been reduced to a sham reptile media organization by committing an unpardonable act to mislead public opinion, infringe upon the sovereignty of an independent state and disturb the relations among countries and peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to stop acting rashly, deeply mindful of the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their persistent hostile policy towards the DPRK. The magazine should make a thorough-going probe into the issue of the false story and officially apologize for it, if it is aware of its mission as a media organization even a bit. \r\n\r\n"
