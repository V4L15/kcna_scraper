The point is that Israel, the occupation force, prudently accepts the advisory opinion and discharges its obligation under international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countries deeply involved in the Palestinian issue must respect the opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acts patronizing and encouraging Israel's violence by taking advantage of the privileged position in the Security Council must be stopped at once and the Security Council must recover the fairness and credibility of its work by making practical contributions to measures for ending the unlawful state incurred by the construction of the wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Righteous is the cause of the Palestinian and all other Arab peoples for retaking the lost territory, their human rights and right to self-determination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He contended that it was confirmed \"a patrol craft of the north side crossed the northern limit line\" and that the north \"told a lie.\" He cried that the government should sternly protest the \"intrusion\" and get \"a promise to prevent its recurrence.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary Thursday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intolerable that he dared take issue with the north, knowing nothing about the truth of the incident. This was an intentional provocation against the north which was committed undoubtedly with the encouragement of the military which does not want detente in the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The so-called \"intrusion\" of a patrol craft of the north side which the south Korean army announced to the public a few days ago is a whopping lie and a thinly veiled fabrication. The north has already made its stand clear about this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Improper is the behavior of the south Korean military in cooking up the incident, but still more disgusting and malicious is the manner of the GNP which, having no inkling of what had happened, chimed in with the anti-north campaign, as if a golden chance presented itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We know that the GNP can never give up its bad habits like the old saying that a crow can not be whiter for often washing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point is that the GNP has not yet sobered up, though it drank a bitter cup of defeat for its treacherous habit of desperately trying to find fault with the fellow countrymen in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Tok Ryong was, by origin, a trusted man acting the left hand of the dictator of the \"civilian government.\" It is self-evident that nothing but treachery can be expected from him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a tragedy that, however madly the riffraffs of the GNP like Kim Tok Ryong may run about, they cannot escape the wretched lot of their predecessors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The time will surely come when accounts will be settled about the crimes of the GNP and its floor leader.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reality requires the army and the people of the DPRK to heighten the vigilance against the U.S. two-dealing tactics. The DPRK has no option but to employ every possible means to increase the self-defensive military power both in quality and quantity as the U.S. is stepping up its preparations for an actual war, developing even new type missiles capable of underground penetration and deploying them in south Korea in a bid to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK are fully determined to deal a thousand-fold retaliatory blow at the U.S. which forces a smile at the negotiating table and whets a sword for aggression to do harm to the dialogue partner behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly understand the will of the army and the people of the DPRK and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
