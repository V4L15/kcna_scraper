            "content": "KCNA on Japan's Short-Sighted Policy  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- Japan is so politically short-sighted that it can not see even an inch ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, the Japanese Diet adopted a resolution urging the U.S. not to make haste in implementing its commitments under the February 13 agreement, saying that the U.S. plan to cross the DPRK off the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" would seriously affect Japan-U.S. relations of alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The kernel of the resolution is that the U.S. should cater for Japan's taste not caring about peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ludicrous for Japan to have adopted such resolution peppered with \"threats\" and \"admonition\" while challenging the general trend of the international situation although it does not know what it should do in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When judging from the viewpoint of the progressive international community wishing for global peace and stability, Japan is evidently standing in the way of the progress of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that media of several countries including the Voice of Russia warned of the danger of Japan's moves that may hamstring the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula as it behaves quite contrary to the commitments to be honored by the countries concerned under an agreement at the six-party talks for the mere reason that it does not meet its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries hope to see the Korean Peninsula turned into one for peace and cooperation, not confrontation, and therefore, pay due attention to the normalization of the DPRK-U.S. relations and the successful progress of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. are the two major responsible parties at the talks and no one can replace them in playing such roles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a stark fact, Japan is talking about the face-saving on the part of an \"ally,\" while busying itself peddling the \"abduction issue\" in a bid to meet the feelings of the right-wing conservatives at home, far away from the main purport of the six-party talks. This clearly indicates that Japan weak in its ability to assess the development has reached the limit in its ability to face up to the trend of the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, it is cold-shouldered even by the six parties as it has stood in the way of others while not doing what it should do with its eyes shut to its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an aim sought by Japan to deter the DPRK-U.S. relations from making progress and thus scuttle the six-party talks by every possible means and method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that Japan is neither qualified nor justified to participate in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better stop being involved in the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, at a meeting of heavyweights of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan he insisted that the Diet session should not be allowed to back away as it has been extended for the passage of the above-said \"bill.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary carried in this regard observes: The moves going on in Japan to adopt the new \"law\" lay bare the crafty artifice of the Japanese reactionaries to secure a legal groundwork for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In short, Japan seeks to realize its wild ambition for overseas aggression by legalizing overseas dispatch and operation activities of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) under the pretext of \"cooperation in the war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the end of the Second World War, Japan, as a criminal state, has not hurled SDF into overseas military operation fearful of the pressure at home and abroad for more than a half century. It was against this backdrop that 9/11 occurred in the U.S. in the new century. As if Japan had been waiting for this to happen, it cooked up the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" under the pretext of \"supporting the U.S.,\" sharply extending the sphere of activities of SDF as far as the region of the Indian Ocean. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the period, this law has been extended several times. Then, the validity of the \"law\" expired on November 1. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"law\" became invalid due to the strong rebuff of the opposition parties which dominate the House of Councillors. Being regretful for this, the Japanese reactionaries proposed a new \"bill on special measures against terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is working hard to institute a law allowing the extension of the sphere of activities of the Maritime \"Self-Defence Force\" beyond the boundary of Japan under the pretext of preventing the maritime transport of \"materials related to weapons of mass destruction\" on the premise of realizing military overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are emerging war forces for overseas aggression gravely threatening the peace and security of Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are pursuing a neo-colonialist policy in a bid to attain their goals of aggression and plunder. They are thus intensifying their domination and plunder of other countries, pursuant to the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-colonialism pursues a new policy which calls for subjugating colonial countries politically and economically by \"recognizing\" their independence and using \"aid\" as a bait and putting them in military bondage by making them subject to a military alliance or treaty, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said policy is mainly targeted against the countries which are rich in strategic resources and of military importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When they find those countries fail to meekly obey them, they egg anti-governmental forces on to create social and political confusion and disorder and carry out their scenario to overthrow the governments of those countries in a bid to turn them into their colonies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is working hard to put the areas of strategic importance and major regions rich in resources under its military control through the escalation of \"anti-terrorism war\" and intensify the domination and plunder of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are escalating the reactionary ideological and cultural offensive against other countries in an effort to benumb the people's consciousness of national independence and fighting spirit and destabilize and degenerate them for the purpose of attaining their goal of neo-colonialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are becoming more vicious in their moves for neo-colonialism through their hypocritical policy of \"aid.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their \"aid\", in essence, means state-sponsored infiltration of monopoly capital overseas and a lever for economic aggression and subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists put the new born independent countries under their economic control and stepped up the expansion of monopoly capital overseas with \"aid\" as a bait and used the export of capital and various concessions as means of plundering them of their rich resources and material wealth and hamstringing the development of their national economy in a bid to achieve their purpose of neo-colonialist subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neo-colonialism is little different from old colonialism in its nature.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a tragedy of the world politics in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such unfair and old international political order should be corrected without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stark reality that the worldwide efforts for nuclear non-proliferation are now proving futile owing to the double-standard policy of specified countries in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that to drop the double standards is needed more urgently in the nuclear field than in any other field.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "ATCC comenta actitud de Japon en cuanto a cita seis-partitas\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 18 de diciembre (ATCC) -- Japon es un pais falto de vision politica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Recientemente, arguyendo que el plan de Estados Unidos de excluir a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de la \"lista de los paises que apoyan el terrorismo\" ejercera graves influencias sobre las relaciones de alianza con Japon, la dieta de este pais dio visto bueno al \"proyecto de resolucion\", que demanda a aquel no apresurarse a cumplir sus compromisos segun el acuerdo logrado el 13 de febrero en las conversaciones a 6 bandas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo clave de ese proyecto es que EE.UU. siempre haga cosas que gusten a Japon pase lo que pase con la paz y estabilidad de la region de Asia y el Pacifico, inclusive la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es una conducta muy ridicula que ese pais isleno, que ni siquiera sabe lo que le toca hacer en el escenario internacional, aprobara ese \"proyecto\" plagado de ciertas \"amenazas\" e \"instrucciones\" desafiando a la corriente general de la situacion internacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para la sociedad internacional progresista, que desea la paz y la estabilidad del mundo, Japon no es mas que el estropeador de dichas conversaciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No por casualidad, la \"Voz de Rusia\" y otros medios de prensa extranjeros advierten que la postura de Japon, que rechaza el cumplimiento de compromisos por parte de los paises interesados segun el acuerdo referido porque esto no le conviene a sus caprichos, puede llevar al fracaso el proceso de desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Numerosos paises desean que la Peninsula Coreana fuera la zona de paz y cooperacion sin confrontacion y prestan debida atencion a la normalizacion de las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. y a la marcha fructifera de la cita seis-partitas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nadie podra reemplazar a estos dos paises que son miembros principales de ese dialogo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, ignorando tal realidad objetiva y el objetivo principal de las conversaciones, Japon escandaliza el \"problema de secuestro\", que refleja la corriente conservadora derechista de este pais, y aboga por guardar el decoro de \"aliado\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto muestra la ya carente facultad de Japon de juzgar la tendencia de la epoca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Este pais es menospreciado entre los participantes en la cita a 6 partes porque solo se dedica a echar a perder cosas ajenas en lugar de recompensar sus crimenes del pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El objetivo de Japon es impedir a todo trance el mejoramiento de las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. y llevar al fracaso ese dialogo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los hechos demuestran que el pais isleno no tiene calificacion ni justificacion para tomar parte en esa cita. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Seria aconsejable que Japon deje de participar en las conversaciones a 6 bandas.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
