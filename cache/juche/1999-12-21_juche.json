She said it was most important to think that in case one's  bullet misses the target one can not defend commander Kim Il Sung and carry out the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Scores of years have passed since her brisk activities after the country's liberation. But still touching the right chord in the hearts of the people are such stories as \"her early morning program,\" \"a reading lamp and its shade,\" \"umbrella carrying best wishes,\" \"'loyal bridge' in Onpho brook,\" etc. They tell about how Kim Jong Suk devoted herself to the safety and longevity of Kim Il Sung and to lessen his burden when he was busy steering the building of a new country at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Resourcefulness of woman commander of Mt. Paektu,\" \"becoming herself election campaigner,\" \"travelling at night for comrade,\" \"teaching us to become faithful servant of people\" and hundreds of other anecdotes tell about noble patriotism, ardent comradeship, indomitable revolutionary spirit and unparalleled courage of Kim Jong Suk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They greatly encourage the Korean people in their struggle to build a powerful socialist nation under the leadership of the great leader Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

Then the immortal revolutionary hymn \"Song of  General Kim Jong Il,\" \"Let Us Hold High the Red Flag,\" \"We Will Advance Full of Conviction,\" \"My Great Country\" and many other songs instilled the conviction of certain victory and courage into the hearts of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are running at a canter to build a powerful nation, with the firm confidence in victory, despite the manifold ordeals and difficulties, loudly singing these songs. \r\n\r\n"
