And hot red pepper, garlic, onion, ginger and meat, fish, pickled fish and other nutritive substance are added to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kimchi which can be made regardless of season is good for health as it promotes appetite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It contains a lot of vitamin C and  mineral which keeps the balance between acid and alkali in human body. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kimchi is known to have scores of varieties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kimchi is prepared as a non-staple food for winter. It is meant for consumption for five months from November to March next year. That is why it is called a half-year food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of Kimchi for winter are unsliced cabbage Kimchi, pickled sliced radishes and cabbages seasoned with pepper (Sokbakji), pickles wrapped in a large cabbage like a bundle (Possam Kimchi) and radishes pickled in salt water (Tongchimi). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unsliced cabbage Kimchi prepared with various ingredients is main winter Kimchi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To make this kind of Kimchi it is necessary to keep cabbages in salt water for more than 24 hours before washing and put a proportionate mixture of seasoning between the leaves of the halved cabbages before putting them into a large earthenware jar. Sliced radishes are put also into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is necessary to properly season all of them with salt after a few days before keeping the jar tightly covered. It can be taken 10 days later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sokbakji is also called Ssoregi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To make Possam Kimchi it is necessary to put a good mixture of seasonings between the leaves of pickled cabbages and cut them into pieces before wrapping them with big cabbage leaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To make Tongchimi it is important to put unsliced radishes into a jar and properly season with salt water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also popular are sliced radishes Kimchi and leaf mustard Kimchi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kimchi is well known to other Asian countries and European countries for its special taste and good effect on human health. \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. ambassador to South Korea reportedly asserted at an \"international seminar on security\" sponsored by the \"South Korea-U.S. Security Research Council\" some time ago that the DPRK may easily change its decision though progress has been made in the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This provocative remark is a very improper behaviour as it casts doubt about the DPRK's faith and efforts for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations. It is no more than a sheer jargon reflecting the position of the right-wing forces who are still seized with enmity toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, what is the real intention of the ambassador groundlessly spreading such rumour of the DPRK's \"possible change of decision\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, in fact, not the DPRK but the United States that has not kept the promise and faith over the past years. As for the construction of light water reactors to be provided under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, the U.S. has not fulfilled its commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to Kyodo, a member of the EU Parliament from the British Labour Party, who visited the DPRK from Oct. 31 to Nov. 4 as a member of the EU Parliamentary delegation, said that \"the LWR project is unlikely to be finished before 2010.\" His statement indicates that it is hard to guess when the project will be finished and that the project may be baffled in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, the U.S. ambassador well informed of the situation did not mention it but picked a quarrel with the DPRK which has honestly implemented so far its commitment made to the U.S. his impudent deed of going against the trend of the times was evidently prompted by an insidious political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can never be a solution to any issue. And this does not work on anybody. \r\n\r\n"

It is hard to expect that he would fulfil his duty to implement the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He should officially apologize to the whole nation for behaving in contravention of the basic spirit of the declaration. \r\n\r\n"
