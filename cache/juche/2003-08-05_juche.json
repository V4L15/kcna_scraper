Noting that the GNP, the local spy party of the U.S. which stakes its fate on it, kicked up a dust over \"human rights\" after the U.S. made an outcry over them, the commentary says: this reminds us of a parrot.\r\n The GNP has no need to look afar and is not in a position to disparage others over the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the reality of south Korea that people have to shed blood and meet an unexpected death at the hand of aggression army soldiers and even a one-time \"national assemblyman\" has no one to pour out his woes after being beaten by them in broad daylight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 10 thousand people commit suicide every year and suicides of parents in company with their children are reported in an unbroken chain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can the GNP crow over other's human rights issue, having such worst human rights problem and no grit to solve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should be a party having a correct view of the human rights issue and resolving it. If it makes a stir over a matter which is out of question, while failing to solve an issue awaiting a solution, it is no more than a fool. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should mind its own affairs, not wasting time in taking issue with other's fictitious \"human rights problem.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only too natural that the south Korean people are turning their backs on the GNP for acting as a bugler and marionette of outside forces, not knowing what it must do.    \r\n\r\n"
