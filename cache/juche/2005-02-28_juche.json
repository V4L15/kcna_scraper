Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n The true features of the Korean people forming integrity with socialism are the brilliant fruition of the outstanding ideological and theoretical activities of leader Kim Jong Il and his wise leadership, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is a society in which the independent nature of man, the popular masses, is embodied. This is a Juche-oriented theory on the inevitability of victory which was uniquely clarified by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialist society based on collectivism is the most advanced society conforming with the independent nature of man as it is the way of man's existence to live in the social collective and man's demand for independence can be creditably met through collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scientific accuracy, truth of socialism is fully proved in the practice of our revolution today. The Korean people are now building socialism under more difficult conditions than others. However, the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) has always closely united the popular masses around itself and the leader organizationally and ideologically, strengthened the driving force of the revolution and enhanced its role as demanded by the Juche idea, thus successfully hewing out the way of victory of socialism. The Party has placed the work of remolding man and his idea above all other work, strengthened the political and ideological might of our revolution in every way and firmly consolidated national economic power and self-reliant military power so as to push ahead with the revolution and the construction even under the complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people are now vigorously advancing toward a high goal of building a great prosperous powerful nation, keeping in mind Korean-style socialism as invariable truth and dauntless faith. Our way is the justest one and our socialist system is the best -- This is the scientific faith the Korean people have always kept in their mind in any storm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people will resolutely advance along the socialist way of Juche in any storm and stress, bearing in mind the revolutionary outlook on the world that it is victory to defend socialism and death to give it up.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now intending to put this in practice. The Japanese militarists' claim to Tok Islet is, in actuality, a move for comeback to Korea. They are aggravating the issue of territorial disputes with China and Russia by persistently asserting that Diao Yu Island of China belongs to Japan and\r\nthey should retake four islands in the Kurils of Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but be a dangerous move straining the regional situation.

This can not be construed otherwise than a mean behavior aimed to deliberately scuttle the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and an improper act which can be committed only by a militarist steeped in the bitterness towards the DPRK to the marrow of his bone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that his malarkey has something in common with the anti-north Korea ruckus kicked up by the government to impose sanctions on north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, the chief executive of Japan asserted it is quite natural that the demand for economic sanctions against north Korea is mounting in Japan, saying that \"the request for applying sanctions against north Korea has grown strong in Japan to an undeniable extent\" and that \"we want north Korea to be more sincere.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government and the ruling party fabricated the \"story about false remains\" and have since gone ahead with considering ways for applying sanctions. They are now talking about 5-phase \"proposal for the application of economic sanctions against north Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Economic sanctions are the strategic method conceived by the Japanese reactionaries to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now they have gone beyond such limit and reached the phase where to legislate on economic sanctions against north Korea as a state policy and put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the economy in the DPRK is not such an economy that would shake or collapse due to sanctions as it was built in the spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government is working hard to convince the international community of the necessity to apply economic sanctions against north Korea, even seriously desecrating its idea of humanitarianism over the \"abduction issue' in defiance of the reality. This clearly shows to what extremes their hostile policy toward the DPRK has gone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is ludicrous is that such guys as Abe who is ignorant of the might and potential of the self-reliant national economy of north Korea and who do not even want to know about it are trying to use the economic sanctions as a means for winning their political clout, talking about its effectiveness, pursuant to the government's policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said behavior of the ultra-right hardliners including Abe is nothing but a political chicanery of political philistines to hold important posts in the next government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people in the DPRK can not repress their bitter indignation at Japan as it is going crazy in its moves against the DPRK, talking about sanctions and pressure, far from redressing its crime-woven past even in this new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' anti-north Korea ruckus to apply sanctions against it and pressurize it only compel its army and people to harden their resolution to certainly settle accounts with Japan, their sworn enemy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
