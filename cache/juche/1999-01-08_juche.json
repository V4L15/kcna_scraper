            "content": " DPRK urges U.S. to compensate for economic losses \r\n  Pyongyang, January 8 (KCNA) -- The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee in an indictment published Thursday demanded that the United States make compensation for the economic losses suffered by the DPRK.   According to the indictment, the United States is these days creating greater military threats to the DPRK, crying that the DPRK is violating the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework reached in Geneva by building an \"underground nuclear facility.\"\r\n   Branding it as a brigandish act like a thief crying \"stop thief,\" the indictment urged the United States to make up for the DPRK's economic losses.\r\n   It further said:\r\n   The U.S. moves to delay implementing the Geneva agreement have created four years of vacuum in the development of our self-supporting nuclear power industry and caused a great shortage of energy, thus having a serious effect on  our socialist planned economy as a whole.\r\n   Direct losses caused by them amount to tens of billions of dollars.\r\n   If the project of building our self-supporting nuclear power industrial base had been promoted as planned, it would have been completed by this time and, accordingly,  there would have been no shortage in the supply of energy and our socialist economy would have produced a great fruition.\r\n   In the long run, what we have gained in \"reward\" for faithfully implementing the Geneva agreement are nothing but economic losses.\r\n   It is  common sense in view of international law or usage that if one side does harm to the other side by violating an agreement, it should make compensation or reparation for the losses.\r\n   The United States has the obligation and responsibility to make compensation for the economic losses inflicted upon the DPRK and must pay for them in any form.\r\n   The frantic racket of the United States and its followers over \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" and their military threats against the DPRK mean the abandonment of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, a declaration of war and provocation against the DPRK. if the U.S., approaching the Geneva agreement with insincerity, continues to delay implementing it although it promised before the world,  the DPRK also has no intention of observing it, suffering only losses. The DPRK is fully ready to cope with a declaration of abandonment of the agreement, a declaration of war or any provocation. if the U.S. finally imposes military confrontation in violation of the Geneva agreement, the DPRK will unhesitatingly counter it and not miss the opportunity to wreak the pent-up grudge of national division and accomplish the cause of national reunification.\r\n   The United States. the South Korean authorities, the Japanese reactionaries and other followers will never flee from the responsibility for violating the Geneva agreement.\r\n   They would be well advised to clearly see what consequences will occur and stop running rashly. \r\n\r\n"
