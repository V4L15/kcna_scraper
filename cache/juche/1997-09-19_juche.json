Earlier, they called out more than 2,000 policemen to suppress the unionists of the Changwon Thongil Heavy Industries Company in a strike and arrested some 50 protesters.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime's murder of a righteous youth who took the lead in the movement for independence, democracy and reunification and brutal suppression of innocent workers calling for freedom and right to existence prove that they are a herd of blood-thirsty beasts, the commentary says, and goes on:\r\n   The atrocity of the Kim Young Sam regime hell-bent on the suppression of the people is the last ditch effort of those doomed to ruin.\r\n   The south Korean students and people should never remain passive onlookers to the white terrorism of the puppets. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Is \"Japanese press association prize\" for false report?\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- It has been said that the Japanese Sankei Shimbun's report about \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl by a north Korean agent\" would shortly beawarded the \" Japanese press association prize \".\r\n   It is natural that special news items representing justice and truth are honored with proper prizes. But it is ridiculous that the \"Japanese press association prize\" would go to a false report.\r\n   The Ssankei Sshimbun has long been stigmatized as venal newspaper and its pressmen have engaged in misleading public opinion, bribed by south Korea's \"Agency for National Security Planning\".\r\n   It goes without saying that the \"ANSP\" and the Sankei Shimbun invented the fiction about \"kidnapping\" for the purpose of inciting anti-DPRK feelings among Japanese people.\r\n   Conveying truth is the mission of the press and is the most important thing in their activities. If one engages in deception, he deserves denunciation as hack writer.\r\n   As for the Sankei Shimbun, it has long served the \"ANSP\". \r\nMost of the Sankei Shimbun's news items about Korea are what were offered by the south Korean intelligence agency. From this point of view, the collusion between the \"ANSP\" and the Sankei Shimbun is very obvious.\r\n   Many of the press organs have fully discharged their honorable mission as mouthpiece of justice and truth. But some of them have engaged in injustice and falsity for their moment's profit.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun has only served an intelligence agency of the south Korean .\r\n   Awarding the prize to a false report carried by such a newspaper is a political cartoon. The fact shows that the \"Japanese press association prize\" is needed for hack writers.\r\n   What the Sankei Shimbun deserves is not a \"prize\" but demolition.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
