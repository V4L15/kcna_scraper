All the members of the WPK are firmly united as one in mind around their leader, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the functions watched Korean films \"Respected Comrade Kim Jong Il Is a Great Thinker and Theoretician\" and \"Care Shown to Make Their Lives Shine.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, the Defense Installations Agency is to be integrated into the Ministry of Defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday notes that the Abe team seeks in this legal step to lawfully hasten the revival of militarism and overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan coaxed the United States into allowing it to use U.S. bases   in Alaska, Guam, Hawaii, etc., going beyond its boundaries. This is a ruse of the Japanese militarist forces to use U.S. bases outside Japan as springboards for military operation of the SDF overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn recent years SDF troops staged various joint war games with the U.S. forces in their bases overseas. By doing so, the Japanese reactionaries have made it a usage and fait accompli for the SDF to go beyond Japan's boundaries and stage military exercises and got it ready for conducting military operations designed for overseas aggression. These moves are an irrefutable proof that the SDF is being turned into armed forces of offensive type. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war-thirsty Abe team is mulling the purchase of 100 F-22A Raptor stealth fighters, ultra-modern air strike planes, from the U.S. while openly seeking the exercise of \"the right to collective self-defense\" and promoting the development of the missile defense system. This well illustrates to what dangerous extent it has gone in its push for the building of a military giant and overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the Abe group steeped in this drive, Japan is now turning into a war-seeking state and the war danger is growing in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe team should stop its reckless militarist folly, if it does not want to end up in a tiger moth's lot.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only when all Koreans remain true to it, is it possible to preserve the Juche character and national character of the homogeneous nation and successfully carry out the tasks of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, the sign post for carving out the destiny of the Korean nation in the new century, is to settle the issue of national reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the Koreans as they are responsible for it, the article says, and goes on: As the issue of national reunification is, in essence, the matter related to the sovereignty of the nation, the Koreans should be responsible for it and should settle it by their concerted efforts in accordance with the independent will and requirement of the nation. Doing everything in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is an inviolable right of the Korean nation and the idea of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is urgent for the Korean nation is not to settle the issue of the differing ideologies and systems but wipe out the distrust and confrontation that have lasted for several decades, promote harmony and rejoin the blood ties of the nation through its concerted efforts. This is what all Koreans urge at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Big progress and signal success have been made in the movement for national reunification in the June 15 era of reunification despite several decades-old differences in ideologies and social systems. All this has been possible because they worked hard for inter-Korean reconciliation, unity and cooperation for the common interests of the nation, regarding the idea of \"By our nation itself\" as the basic idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the U.S. and ultra-right conservative forces including the Grand National Party in south Korea subservient to the U.S. of standing in the way of the Korean nation advancing in the spirit of \"By our nation itself,\" the article calls on all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to go united and deal deadly blows at the U.S. imperialists and pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP who challenge them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So what he uttered is no more than a foolish ploy to convince others that he is not useless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is this folly of the U.S. that only delays the settlement of the nuclear issue and brings into bolder relief its true colors as the criminal responsible for hamstringing the process of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula and harassing peace and stability in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights represent state sovereignty. It is impudent enough for the U.S. to interfere in the matter pertaining to the rights and sovereignty of other country as it is plagued with so many serious problems and hideous crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the country with the world's poorest human rights record as it hurled a great many Americans into battle fields to meet miserable deaths under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\" and has tightened the system of fascist policing and control through enactment and effectuation of such wartime laws as \"Patriot Act\" aimed at violating human rights and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying Afghanistan, Iraq and other sovereign states through unjust war of aggression the U.S. tortured and killed prisoners in the most savage and despicable manner in the history of human civilization in the 21st century at modern \"Oswiecim concentration camps\". The U.S. is the country of beasts which regards man-hunting as pleasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 655,000 innocent Iraqi civilians were killed from March of 2003 when the U.S. ignited the Iraqi war to early October last year and thousands of civilians died in one month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is sheer hypocrisy and mockery of humankind for the U.S. to talk about human rights after causing such horrible tragedy. The U.S. is the world's worst human rights abuser which is not entitled to say anything about human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop styling itself a \"human rights judge\" which nobody recognizes and repent of its human rights abuses, instead of interfering in the \"human rights issue\" of other countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia expansion a ultramar de fuerzas belicosas de Abe\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 11 de junio (ATCC) -- Recientemente la camara de consejeros de la dieta japonesa aprobo oficialmente la \"ley de establecimiento del ministerio de defensa\" y \"ley de fuerzas de autodefensa\". Se dice que de acuerdo con ellas la Agencia de Instalaciones de Defensa se unira al Ministerio de Defensa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con tales medidas juridicas las fuerzas belicosas de Abe intentan acelerar legalmente el resurgimiento militarista y las maniobras de agresion a ultramar.   Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual insertado en su edicion del dia 11 y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon persuadio a Estados Unidos para recibir el permiso de este de que las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" utilicen las bases norteamericanas de Alaska, la isla Guam y Hawai como trampolin de sus operaciones militares en ultramar. En los ultimos anos las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" de Japon libran toda clase de ejercicios militares en las bases norteamericanas en ultramar junto con las tropas yanquis. Los reaccionarios japoneses regularizan y hacen hechos consumados los ejercicios militares de las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" en ultramar para practicar la operacion militar de agresion a otros paises. Tal movimiento sirve de una clara prueba de que las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" de Japon van convirtiendose en las fuerzas militaristas ofensivas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las fuerzas belicosas de Abe persiguen abiertamente el ejercicio de \"derecho a autodefensa colectiva\", promueven el desarrollo del sistema antimisiles e intentan adquirir de EE.UU. 100 unidades de caza Stealth \"F-22A Raptor\" para el ataque movil aereo de ultima moda, lo cual demuestra a que grado peligroso llegan las maniobras de conversion en potencia militar y de expansion a ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon se convierte paulatinamente en estado belico agrandando el peligro de la guerra en el Nordeste Asiatico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las fuerzas belicosas de Abe deben poner de inmediato fin a tal temeridad militarista.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
