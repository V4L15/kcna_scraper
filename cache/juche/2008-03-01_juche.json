            "content": "Japan's Scheme to Grab Tok Islet Unchanged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 29 (KCNA) -- Japan is getting more desperate in its protracted moves to seize Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, the Japanese land topographical bureau marked Tok Islet, an inviolable part of the territory of Korea, as Japan's islet in a detailed map on the scale of 1:25,000 which was drawn with the mobilization of a Japanese earth observation satellite and a commercial satellite of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is designed to legalize and justify Japan's bid to grab the islet by convincing the international community that it \"belongs to Japan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Afraid of world opinion, Japan had claimed \"dominion\" over Tok Islet through the mouth of a local government. In the new century, however, it has got quite outspoken in its attempts to seize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Japanese chief executive spun out the piffle in early 2004 that the islet is \"a part of Japan's territory\", a post and telecommunication company of Japan issued a stamp marking it as Japanese and members of a rightist organization even staged a demonstration on the sea, blaring that \"Tok Islet belongs to Japan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must not go unnoticed that the Shimane Prefectural Assembly in 2005 adopted \"an ordinance\" declaring February 22 \"Takeshima (Tok Islet) Day\". And the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology opened a meeting of the Committee for the Examination and Approval of Textbooks and \"passed\" a history textbook arguing that Tok Islet \"belongs to Japan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shimane Prefecture published more than 260,000 copies of a book claiming \"dominion\" over Tok Islet and distributed them to families in the prefecture and the local administrative bodies all over Japan from January 18, 2006. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 2006 the Japanese government specified the islet as Japan's \"territory\" in its \"defense white paper\" and informed the International Hydrographic Organization of its intention to make a hydrographic survey nearby the islet, claiming that the waters there are the exclusive economic zone of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Furthermore, the Japanese authorities attempted to take the issue to the International Court of Justice by building up public opinion over its \"dominion\". They went such length as illegally encroaching upon the inviolable sovereignty of Korea over its territory by sending even warships and planes to the surroundings of the islet, threatening that a decisive physical countermeasure might be taken with regard to the issue of the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 2007 the Japanese government again marked the islet as one belonging to Japan in its \"defense white paper\" and adopted \"Basic Law of the Sea\" to be effective from July 20. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus, Japan's claim to the \"dominion\" over the islet and its moves to seize it by force of arms reached the culminating point. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its shameless moves will face a stern punishment by history.  \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Adherence to Principle of National Independence Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 29 (KCNA) -- The principle of national independence calls for solving all issues by the concerted efforts of the nation, rejecting the aggressive and anti-reunification foreign forces' domination and interference. It serves as a fundamental principle of national reunification over which the Korean nation should neither make any slightest concession nor allow itself to slacken it under any circumstances and lifeblood for achieving independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said principle serves as lifeblood for the movement for independent reunification because the issue of national reunification is an internal issue of the Korean nation, in any respect, as it is related to the destiny of the Koreans and their prospect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of national reunification is an issue of the Korean nation which allows no interference from outside forces and a matter on which the future of the nation hinges. No foreign forces, therefore, have any right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and no one can replace the Korean people in the struggle to reunify the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of independent reunification can be successfully achieved in line with the will and interests of the nation only through the concerted efforts of the Koreans, the driving force for national reunification. It is only the Korean nation that has the will to achieve national reunification and is capable of doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can achieve anything in the world should all its members have the strong spirit of national independence to wage the movement for national reunification by firmly believing in their strength and relying on them, rejecting flunkeyism and dependence on the foreign forces. The spirit of national independence represents the firm will and faith to settle all problems arising in the movement for reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, vehemently opposing and rejecting the foreign domination and interference in the matter of achieving the cause of national reunification, an issue related to the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should adhere to and apply the principle of national independence which does not allow any foreign domination and interference even a bit, fully responsible for accomplishing the cause of national reunification. Herein lies the master key to settling the issue of national reunification independently in line with the desire and interests of the nation.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It serves as a source of strength for every country and nation to accelerate the building of a new independent society by its concerted efforts its own way, not reading others' faces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic experience proves that the idea of independence alone helps each country and nation work out an independent line and policy reflecting its specific conditions and its people's wishes and interests and achieve independent development according to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pursuing an independent policy based on the idea of independence presents the most just idea as it makes it possible to enlist the inexhaustible creative power of the popular masses for the building of a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the wishes of the peoples of the progressive countries now engaged in the building of a new society to make them rich and powerful as they are directly interested in their prosperity and development. It is the idea of independence that helps realize their desire and wishes most fully and quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of independence constitutes a basis on which the DPRK shapes and implements all its policies and a fundamental principle governing its external activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will as always firmly uphold and thoroughly implement the idea of independence and thus exalt the independent dignity and authority of the DPRK and positively contribute to promoting the cause of global independence, concludes the article.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ademas, los miembros de las entidades derechistas desarrollaron hasta una manifestacion en el mar vociferando que \"la isla Tok es la japonesa\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn particular, la asamblea departamental de Shimane aprobo en 2005 un \"proyecto de reglamento\" que define el 22 de febrero como \"dia de Takeshima (isla Tok)\". En tanto, el Ministerio de Educacion, Cultura, Deportes, Ciencia y Tecnologia celebro una sesion del comite de revision de manuales, en que se dio luz verde al manual de historia que define la isla Tok como un territorio japones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl departamento de Shimane edito a partir del 18 de enero de 2006 260 mil ejemplares del libro que insiste el \"derecho a la posesion\" de la isla Tok y los distribuyo a las familias de su localidad y a los organos de administracion locales de todo el pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El gobierno japones anoto en la \"carta blanca de defensa\" para el 2006 la isla Tok como una parte de su \"territorio\" y anuncio a la Organizacion Internacional Hidrografica la decision de realizar la medicion de la via fluvial en las cercanias de la isla Tok insistiendo en que esta pertenece a la zona maritima economica exclusiva de su pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No bastandoles con todo esto, las autoridades del pais isleno difundieron el rumor del \"derecho a la posesion\" de la isla Tok tratando de llevar este problema a la Corte Internacional de Justicia. Y al hablar de las contramedidas fisicas, emplazaron los buques de guerra y aviones en los alrededores de la isla amenazando y violando el sagrado derecho territorial de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El gobierno japones en la \"carta blanca de defensa\" para el 2007 volvio a anotar que la isla Tok es la suya. Ademas, aprobo la \"ley maritima principal\" y decidio ponerla en vigor a partir del 20 de julio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La insistencia en el \"derecho a la posesion\" de Japon y su maniobra de usurpacion militar de la isla Tok seran castigadas por la historia.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
