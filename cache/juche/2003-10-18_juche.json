Through this intensified suppression and terrorism against Chongryon organizations and Koreans in Japan they seek to wrest a sort of concession from the DPRK and attain their sinister political and military purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon is an inviolable overseas citizens' organization and a legitimate organization of the DPRK. Moreover, it has performed the mission and role as a diplomatic mission for friendship with Japanese people in the absence of the diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the army and people of the DPRK to call for strongly reacting against the reckless suppression and terrorism of the Japanese right-wing gangsters against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, considering them as deliberate political and military provocations of the Japanese government to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There exists long-standing confrontational sentiment between the two countries. The Japanese government's hostile policy toward the DPRK and Chongryon is little short of adding to the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past. It only stirs up the bitterness of the army and people of the DPRK towards Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never allow any slightest compromise and concession on the encroachment upon the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country. It will take only a powerful self-defensive step against the violation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will certainly force Japan to pay dearly for its double and treble crimes.    \r\n.    \r\n\r\n"

This is clearly evidenced by the following facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has escalated the international \"blockade and pressure\" upon the DPRK, while staging a \"naval inspection exercise\" and raising a hue and cry over its non-existent \"flesh traffic.\" And it has massively deployed aggression armed forces in and around the Korean peninsula to increase its military threat and blackmail against the DPRK, thus deliberately coiling up tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has never fulfilled its commitments to solve the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. Yet, it is now vociferous about a \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue. Why? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the U.S. invariably seeks to mislead the world public demanding a fair and earlier solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., buy time to step up its military preparations to stifle the DPRK and thus stifle it in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is also entitled to have an option and free to take any action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will continue to increase its self-defensive nuclear deterrent force to cope with the U.S. invariable hostile policy toward the DPRK and persistent moves to stifle it by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to understand the DPRK's stand and have a proper option.    \r\n\r\n"

It tightened the international siege to the DPRK and staged a sea inspection exercise and intensified the espionage against it by mobilizing new type unmanned reconnaissance plane \"Shadow 200\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about such \"peaceful solution\" can not but be a mockery of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK and the U.S. nuclear threat to it. The key to settling the issue lies in whether the U.S. makes a bold decision to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula can never find a solution unless the U.S. makes a bold switchover in its policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. clamor for a \"peaceful solution\" without dropping its hostile policy toward the DPRK is nothing but a deceptive trick to detain its dialogue partner in the conference hall and gain time in a bid to meet its needs and stifle Pyongyang in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has neither interest nor expectation for any talks where the U.S. remains dead-set against making a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop paying lip-service to a \"peaceful settlement\" and clarify its will to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK without delay.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
