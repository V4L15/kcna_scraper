But the issue of building a unified state as one nation, transcending difference in ideologies and systems, is the supreme task of the nation whose fulfillment brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History proves that Korea cannot be reunified by means of conquering the other side. In other words, its reunification allows neither war nor a peaceful method that involves this process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Reunifying the country through federal formula based on the conception of one nation, one state, two systems and two governments is the great principle of achieving national reunification in keeping with the specific conditions of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The principle is applied to the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo (DFRK) advanced by the great leader Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal for founding the DFRK is the most realistic and reasonable, fair and aboveboard proposal for reunification acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation and truly wants reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the country is reunified by federal formula, the north and the south will realize the nation's cherished desire for reunification with their interests not being encroached upon, and will demonstrate to the world the resourceful and proud image of the reunified nation. \r\n\r\n"
