            "content": "DPRK NDC Reiterates Its Stand to Fight It Out against U.S. and S. Korean Regime \r\n Pyongyang, October 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK issued the following statement Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime finally made public so-called new \"missile policy declaration\" on October 7. It has so far been locked in the confab for the \"revision of missile guidelines\" with the U.S. for a long time despite big concerns and opposition of the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The declaration envisages extending the firing range of south Korea's missiles to 800 km capable of attacking the entire region of the DPRK from the previous 300 km, increasing the weight of warheads to over 500 kg when necessary and even equipping the army with new lethal unmanned assaulters 2.5t in weight and 300km in cruising range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime let officials of Chongwadae and \"Defense Ministry\" speak loudly that the new \"missile policy declaration\" will make it possible to satisfactorily deter \"threat\" and \"provocation\" of the DPRK and to affect the northeastern area of China and even the far eastern region of Russia, to say nothing of the whole area of the DPRK with a missile fired from Taejon and other middle areas of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"missile policy declaration\" which the regime calls \"the biggest achievement\" it gained from its American master in recent years is a product of another conspiracy of the master and the stooge to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the extreme pitch of tension and ignite a war against the DPRK any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Demand for the declaration raised by Chongwadae and the \"Defense Ministry\" and \"Foreign Affairs and Trade Ministry\" of south Korea was accepted by the White House, U.S. Defense Department and State Department. U.S. President Obama also responded to the imploration made by traitor Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak required Obama to extend the firing range of missiles on scores of occasions typically in last July and this March.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had south Korea made public the \"missile policy declaration\" under the scenario worked out by it than the Obama administration expressed its official stand by praising it as the most balanced and clear counteraction and absolutely appropriate measure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the prevailing situation the National Defence Commission of the DPRK clarifies its principled stand as follows: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the army and people of the DPRK will fight it out to put into practice the slogan \"Annihilate the U.S. imperialists, sworn enemy of the Korean people!\", given that the U.S. hostile policy has become clearer through south Korea's \"missile policy declaration\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only shortly ago that President Obama openly clarified his stand to exist in peace with the DPRK. State Secretary Hillary also expressed the same stand. Leading policy-makers of the U.S. National Security Council and Central Intelligence Agency said the U.S. does not have hostile policy toward the DPRK when they had official and unofficial meetings with DPRK officials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the situation gives the lie to all the U.S. messages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given the clarity being added to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, the army and people of the DPRK are of the fixed stand that they can not stop the final battle with the U.S. for settling accounts with their sworn enemy for whom they bear great grudge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime will not be able to find a room for hiding as it blindly follows its master's ambition for aggression, being steeped in sycophancy and submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, now that the south Korean puppet regime is seeking attacking the whole area of the DPRK by missiles at the instigation of its master, the army and people of the DPRK will bolster military preparedness in every way to cope with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not hide that the revolutionary armed forces of Mt. Paektu including the strategic rocket forces are keeping within the scope of strike not only the bases of the puppet forces and the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' bases in the inviolable land of Korea but also Japan, Guam and the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is prepared to counter nuclear attack and missile attack of the U.S., south Korea and all other following forces in kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What remains to be done now is the DPRK's resolute action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the strong will of its army and people to let them feel the real taste of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, we would like to take this opportunity to appeal to the governments, political parties, organizations and peace-loving people of all countries around the world that value justice and sympathize with truth to heighten vigilance against the U.S. arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"missile policy declaration\" which the south Korean regime made public in conspiracy with the U.S. is not simple missile range extension guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is the U.S. sinister domination aim to lay strategic siege network to Asia and upset peace and stability in the region and thus establish the U.S. hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still lots of world people have failed to realize the U.S. arbitrary trick behind situations in Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Syria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time to heighten vigilance against the U.S. arbitrary practices and turn out in actions to frustrate them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should not forget even a moment that wolf never subsists on grass as long as it breathes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will as before hold high the banner of struggle against the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces and wage dynamic actions to achieve the country's reunification and the world independence."

They are now busy conducting diplomacy in the international arena to build up public opinion on this and fan up the atmosphere of confrontation with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but the last-ditch effort of those in the grip of the worst ruling crisis, badly beaten by the toughest retaliatory offensive of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a trite method employed by the successive puppet ruling quarters of south Korea to invent a pretext for making provocations and stoke the atmosphere of confrontation, vociferating about the non-existent \"threat of southward invasion\" and \"north wind\" whenever they faced a ruling crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the Lee group is now more dead than alive as politicians due to the total failure of its domestic and foreign policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee has pursued sycophantic and treacherous policies, letting loose sophism \"no south Korea without U.S.\" and \"south Korea can achieve prosperity only under the U.S. patronage.\" This has put the south Korean people's living into destitution and driven the inter-Korean relations into the lowest ebb. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that south Koreans from all walks of life are calling for toppling the present regime and bringing about a policy switchover, terming the politics pursued by Lee over the last five years \"failed politics\" and \"politics leaving nothing to be reviewed.\" Such open derision and negative comment are being manifested among even ruling quarters of south Korea and U.S. and Japanese masters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee and his clan are finding themselves in a bottomless quagmire due to the continued disclosure of hideous scandals committed by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is now seized with utter uneasiness as he is suffering from the nightmare that he may be beaten to death any time in these remaining days of his office for so many crimes committed by him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His group is orchestrating deliberate and premeditated provocations in a bid to weather its worst crisis. It is keen to extremely rattle the nerves of the DPRK and spark off such shocking incidents as armed conflict in an effort to seek a pretext for keeping afloat the conservative regime, its last stronghold. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the group is trumpeting about \"insecurity\" and \"north's interference in the presidential election of south Korea\". It is, at the same time, unprecedentedly beefing up its armed forces in the biggest hotspot in the West Sea of Korea and crying out for \"strengthened alert posture\" while touring the frontline areas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the group should bear in mind its desperate efforts in the abyss of ruin would only put its fate at greater peril. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, nobody in the world would be taken in by its worn-out method of provocation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless military moves of the Lee group would help all Koreans and the international community clearly see who is the provocateur and from where the danger of a war is coming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's outdated \"fiction about threat from the north\" and provocations would only precipitate its doomsday."

Tambien lo hizo la secretaria de Estado Hillary a traves de los medios de prensa. Y los elaboradores claves de la politica del Consejo de Seguridad Nacional y la Agencia Central de Inteligencia de EE.UU., que se han reunido con nuestros funcionarios en ocasiones oficiales y extraoficiales, afirmaron tambien que no hay la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la realidad muestra que todos esos mensajes de EE.UU. son mentiras puras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Dado que se torna cada dia mas clara la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC de EE.UU., los militares y civiles coreanos se mantienen en la invariable posicion de no parar ni un momento la guerra antiyanqui para aniquilar al enemigo jurado que causo de siglo en siglo incontables sufrimientos al pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la contienda antiyanqui no podran buscar refugio los titeres surcoreanos que acostumbrados al servilismo y sumision a grandes potencias, se mueven a ciegas para satisfacer la ambicion agresiva de su amo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, puesto que bajo la instigacion de su amo norteamericano, los titeres surcoreanos intentan atacar todo el territorio de la RPDC con los misiles, el ejercito y el pueblo de esta fortaleceran por todos los medios la disposicion militar frente a ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo ocultamos que el poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu, incluyendo las fuerzas coheteriles estrategicas, ha colocado en la mira de su golpe certero el nido de los titeres surcoreanos, las bases de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes de la mitad del sagrado territorio patrio, Japon, la isla Guam y hasta el territorio norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos preparados perfectamente para responder a las armas nucleares y misiles de EE.UU. y sus satelites como los titeres surcoreanos con los mismos armamentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo unico que hace falta es la accion resuelta de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHacerles probar la guerra de verdad, que no conoce todavia ni puede imaginar el mundo, he aqui la ferrea voluntad de nuestro ejercito y pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, aprovechando esta oportunidad, exhortamos a todos los gobiernos, partidos politicos, entidades y los habitantes pacifistas del mundo, que aman la justicia y simpatizan con la verdad, a elevar la vigilancia a las arbitrariedades de EE.UU..\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"declaracion de la politica de misil\" no es la simple orientacion sobre el alargamiento del alcance de misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla parte del siniestro intento dominacionista de EE.UU. de formar el cerco estrategico al continente asiatico, destruir la paz y la estabilidad de esta region y establecer asi la \"esfera de dominio de EE.UU.\" sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodavia numerosas personas del mundo no calan la artimana y las arbitrariedades de EE.UU. que hubo detras de los incidentes de Iraq, Afganistan, Libia y Siria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora es el tiempo en que se debe elevar la vigilancia a las arbitrariedades de EE.UU. y levantarse en la lucha por frustrarlas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo debe olvidar ni un momento que el chacal nunca se convierte en oveja.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC, lucharan firmemente en el futuro tambien por realizar la reunificacion del pais y la independencia del mundo levantando la bandera de la lucha antiyanqui y anti-titeres surcoreanos."
