Al mismo tiempo, aprendio la leccion de que la lucha contra las fuerzas conservadoras no debe parar hasta que alcance la victoria final. Puesto que las fuerzas progresistas surcoreanas intensificaron unidas la lucha contra el \"gobierno\" y el \"Gran Partido Nacional\", la banda de traidores sufrio una amarga derrota en dichas \"elecciones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion son la unanime aspiracion y deseo de los habitantes surcoreanos. Las demandan todas las fuerzas progresistas aunque existen diferencias de criterios y doctrinas entre ellas. De veras, ellas constituyen la bandera comun de las fuerzas progresistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando las fuerzas progresistas castiguen severamente con la unidad y la superioridad absoluta a los conservadores reaccionarios que impiden la independencia y la democratizacion de la sociedad y la reunificacion de la patria, los habitantes surcoreanos realizaran sin falta su deseo de la independencia, la democracia y la reunificacion."
