            "content": "U.S. strategy for world domination refuted\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, George Kenyan, a veteran diplomat and a historian of the United States, criticized the U.S. for its impracticable design to become a \"leader\" of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In an article contributed to the magazine New York Review of books he insisted that the U.S. refrain from interfering in internal affairs of other countries, saying this or that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, Pyongyang-based newspapers today say that his statement is based on comparatively correct analysis of the realities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   George Kenyan was a down-to-earth anti-communist, anti-socialist element, who personified arrogance of the U.S. style and its design for domination over the world. It is not by accident that he warned of unreasonableness of the U.S. hegemonism and inevitability of its failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. ruling quarters' ambition for domination over the world is growing stronger under the objective situation in which the confrontation structure of strength has been destroyed by the termination of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But this ambition can never be realized.  If the U.S. continues pursuing hegemonism, it will result in its further isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson stresses that as George Kenyan acknowledged, the U.S. strong-arm action against the DPRK is like hammering on cold iron. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is ready to take military counteraction to foil the U.S. military actions against it. \r\n\r\n"

The decision of the U.S. And the Japanese reactionaries to step up the development of the \"TMD\" system under the pretext of the DPRK's \"missile threat\" indicates that its arrow is directed to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the U.S. and the Japanese reactionaries are finally examining and rounding off the \"U.S.-Japan joint operational plan\" in a bid to start a new Korean war while going ahead with a more detailed \"study of emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. Some time ago, the United States and the Japanese reactionaries agreed to set up a U.S.-Japan joint coordinating center allegedly to \"cope with the situation\" in the surrounding areas. Needless to say, it will function as a military headquarters to command their battles for aggression in the \"event of emergency\" in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The joint military drills staged by them scores of times this year are aimed at a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The intensified U.S.-Japan military tie-up results in escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula and increasing the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is evoking great apprehension of the Asian people. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
