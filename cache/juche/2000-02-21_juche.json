            "content": "To bar conclusion of DPRK-U.S. peace agreement \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary assails the South Korean authorities' \"stand\" concerning the issue of concluding a peace agreement to be taken up at the talks and contacts between the DPRK and the U.S.\r\n   While clarifying their \"stand\" the South Korean authorities made a far-fetched assertion that they cannot \"accomodate\" the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and the replacement of the armistice agreement with a peace agreement is a \"matter to be handled between the north and the south.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also talked the nonsense that they were \"seeking\" the \"establishment of a system based on a peace agreement\" through the \"four-party talks\" and the position and role of the \"U.N. Command\" could be firmly maintained only when the armistice agreement is preserved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The replacement of the old armistice system by a new peace-keeping system is a matter to be handled by the DPRK and the U.S., the signatories to the armistice agreement, not an issue that allows an interference by the South Korean authorities who do not have any real power, including the prerogative of the supreme command over the army, the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities were not a signatory to the peace agreement and are now keen on provoking a fratricidal war. it is, indeed, ridiculous for them to assert that they cannot \"accomodate\" the conclusion of the agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is equally impertinent for them to talk about \"seeking\" the \"establishment of a system based on a peace agreement\" through the \"four-party talks\" as they have neither political sovereignty nor independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their talking about the position of the \"U.N. Command,\" adamantly insisting on the armistice agreement, which is only gathering dust, is a revelation of their criminal attempt to maintain the outdated system of confrontation and war and keep the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in South Korea for an indefinite period in a bid to escalate the moves for a war against the north with their master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their assertions are, in a nutshell, intended to disturb and block the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They had imprudently behaved several times in the past to lay a hurdle in the way of the talks between the DPRK and the U.S. But every time their efforts went for nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The result cannot be otherwise this time, too.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Popular writer \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- There is a very popular song \"Road Taken With Deep Love\" in the DPRK. \r\n   It is based on the theme that the journeys made by the leader Kim Jong Il for on-the-spot guidance, eating rice balls and taking a short and uncomfortable sleep are to bring joy and happiness to the people and glorify socialist Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was written by Ryu Tong Ho, a writer of the central committee of the Korean Writers Union. He, 45, is one of the famous poets who have distinguished themselves in the creation of poems  and songs in Korea in recent years. On the new year's day the central television aired footage of Ryu standing on the peak of Mt. Paektu at the sun-rise and reciting a lyric poem about a rosy future of socialist Korea heading for a powerful nation, thus deeply impressing the viewers. His career as a writer began after graduation from a three-year writer course at Kim Hyong Jik University of Education in 1988. He has created at least 450 poems and songs over the last more than ten years. Typical of them are a lyric poem \"supreme commander and guard soldiers\" and words of songs \"Our Comrade Kim Jong Il\", \"The Country and I\" and \"I Love My Hometown.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The songs created by him are very popular among the people for their truthful representation of the needs of the times in Korea today. Particularly the song \"Answer of Soldiers\" is loved by officers and men of the Korean People's Army as it reflects their confidence of certain victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He has grown to be such a popular writer under the particular care of Kim Jong Il. He began to be interested in creative activities when he worked as a lathe operator in a factory, after finishing a senior middle school in Jonchon county, Jagang Province. During 15 years of work at the factory he acquired fundamentals of literary creation and wrote several simple poems and words of songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Taking into consideration his uncommon talent for literature, Kim Jong Il made sure that he was given an opportunity to get professional training. Saying that Ryu is a talented poet produced from among workers, he has led him to improve his creative skill with loving care. At least 200 poems and songs out of over 450 pieces of his work have been completed under Kim Jong Il's guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il saw and guided his works in 1997 alone on more than 40 occasions. Under such loving care he wrote words of five songs this year alone, including \"Our Home Is Soldiers' Family\" reflecting the idea of the Workers' Party of Korea on attaching great importance to the military.    \r\n\r\n"
