The crimes it committed during its occupation of Korea are innumerable. It, preoccupied with the historical view of militarism even though more than half a century elapsed, is rushing headlong along the road of reinvasion. \r\nIt still refuses to make up for the greatest losses of man power and materials it imposed upon the Korean people.\r\n   It is clear to anyone that Japan, which has not dissociated itself from the past of unprecedented crimes, is not entitled to gain a permanent seat on the UNSC, a responsible position to deal with important issues for world peace.\r\n   Hong, however, tried to curry favour with Japan, saying that Japan has an important role to play in the UN and that he has a high opinion of Japan's share of expenses for the UN. By doing so he proved to be an avowedly pro-Japanese element.\r\n    The South Korean authorities are making sheep's eyes at Japan one after another in the wake of the South Korean chief executive's recent trip to Japan during which he \"invited\"  the Japanese king to visit South Korea, regarding him as his saviour. All this clearly shows that the South Korean \"government for the people\" is to all intents and purposes a herd of pro-Japanese authorities.\r\n   The Korean people will never pardon the authorities.\r\n\r\n"

As they have committed excessively many crimes against Korea and the Korean nation, they feel upset in the wake of our recent satellite launch.\r\n   Their call for guiding the DPRK to \"reform\" and \"opening\" is all the more ridiculous.\r\n   People around the world call the Japanese authorities political dwarfs. The South Korean authorities are colonial stooges without an equal in the world. Is it not ridiculous for these fellows to call for guiding the DPRK to \"reform\" and \"opening\"? \r\n\r\n"
