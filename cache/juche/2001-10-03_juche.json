In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says:\r\n If the \"SDF\" is ordered to conduct an overseas military operation, it will signify the first undisguised action for overseas aggression in the post-war period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality indicates that \"the law on emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\" is not aimed at its \"security\" but it is a legislation for aggression allowing Japan to legally participate in overseas military operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the law, the vast area of Asia is included in the sphere of \"SDF\" operations. This indicates that almost all the countries in Asia can be targets of Japan's military attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists have frantically whetted their swords for aggression and revenge. Betraying their true colours in the new century, they are embarking upon carrying out their military operation for aggression, flying Hinomaru, a symbol of militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Asian people are closely watching every move of Japan.    \r\n\r\n"
