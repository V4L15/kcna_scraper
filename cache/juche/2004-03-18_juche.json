This is arousing resentment among the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The harsh penalty proposed by the prosecution for the Korean scholar with foreign nationality on the charge of violation of the notorious \"Security Law\" by groundlessly linking him to the north is an unpardonable act of seeking permanent division and confrontation in contravention of the spirit of national concord reflected in the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for Song, he emigrated to other country long ago, disillusioned with the military fascist dictatorial regime while struggling for democratization in south Korea. It is nonsensical to assert that he should be punished for paying several visits to the north of the divided country, though he did so with kindred feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that south Korea is, indeed, a graveyard of human rights where those who aspire after cooperation, exchange, unity and coexistence between the north and the south with ardent desire for reunification are suppressed and punished. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the \"Grand National Party\", a group of traitors to the nation, that took the lead in taking the above-said legal action against Prof. Song on the charge of violation of the \"Security Law\" which defines the north as an \"anti-state organization\" and calls for punishing whoever gets in touch with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the anti-reunification forces including Choe Pyong Ryol, representative of the GNP, were zealous in making the nonsensical claim that Song should be punished on the charge of violation of the \"Security Law\" and he is a \"follower\" of someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should nullify the judgment passed upon him and set him free at once, clearly mindful that his punishment is a criminal act of diametrically running counter to the June 15 joint declaration and national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, there appeared everywhere in the province a vast expanse of land reminiscent of a large plain in the era of the Workers' Party, changing the province's appearance beyond recognition as required by the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round Mubon Plain in Jungsan County, Mayong Plain in Onchon County and other places of the province, Kim Jong Il acquainted himself in detail with the land realignment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He praised the servicepersons and volunteers who have taken part in the land realignment project as dependable and proud performers of exploits as they fulfilled the vast tasks in a short span of time, valiantly overcoming all sorts of trials under difficult conditions where they were hard pressed for everything. Our cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation is sure to be accomplished with success as we have such an admirable army and people, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in accelerating and completing the land realignment to give face-lifting to the land and bring about an epochal turn in the agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the land realignment is brought to an end in the province, it will be completed in the major granaries of the country in the main, he said, stressing the need for the remaining provinces to exert all their efforts to successfully carry out this work in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to increase the grain production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a solid foundation has been laid in the province to steadily increase the grain production thanks to the completion of the land realignment and the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong waterway project, all the people should work hard with the firm determination to bring about a great leap in the agricultural production, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward tasks to realize the mechanization and widely use chemicals in agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that mechanization and an extensive use of chemicals in the farm work are heavy yet honorable revolutionary tasks to be carried out in the present generation on all accounts, he earnestly called for providing the generations to come with a socialist land of bliss good to live in and work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to successfully carry out the project for reclaiming the Kum Song tideland under a long-term plan to build a large modern farm there as wished by President Kim Il Sung, he set forth tasks and ways to do so.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
