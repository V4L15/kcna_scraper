Fairness and equality are embodied in operating the federal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal defines all the issues arising in the building of a unified state in full accord with the nation's common desire and wish, not allowing one side to stand at advantage over the other side or meet its own interests or do harm to other side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The federal formula serves as the best way to most smoothly achieve national reunification independently and peacefully on the principle of great national unity, neither side occupying the other nor being occupied, given that differing ideologies and systems exist in the north and south. Herein lie the realistic, fair and just characters of the proposal for reunification by federal formula.     \r\n\r\n"

The will for reunification and faith of the Korean nation, firmly consolidated by the joint declaration, are the source of strength to pave the way for the victory of reunification and patriotism. The destiny of the nation and the future of the reunification movement rest on defending and implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic requirement of independent reunification to invariably hold fast to the great proposition \"by the concerted efforts of the nation\" clarified by the declaration in achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reconciliation and unity mean national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe whole nation should unite in the idea of patriotism, placing the common interests of the nation ahead of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an editorial says that the whole Korean nation in the north, south and overseas will surely build an independent, powerful and prosperous reunified country by stepping up the grand march for independent national reunification under the uplifted banner of the historic joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

What it seeks in escalating the war is to strike by force of arms those countries in the areas of strategic vantage and topple anti-imperialist and independent governments and establish the U.S.-led new world order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the U.S. is a rogue state which does not bother to do such reckless acts of harassing the global peace and security and straining the international situation to the extreme to meet its strategic interests  now that the U.S. designated the DPRK as the target of its preemptive attack, no one can vouch when it will open fire against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is that the U.S. insistence on preemptive attack will never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will keep itself in full combat posture to cope with the U.S. possible preemptive attack. If the U.S. infringes upon its national sovereignty even a bit, the DPRK will mete out deserved retaliation to it.     \r\n\r\n"
