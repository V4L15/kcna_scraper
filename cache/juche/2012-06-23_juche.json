Lurking behind this is a sinister intention to calm down the mounting anti-U.S. sentiment and carry out their shaking strategy for dominating Mideast under the pretext of a fresh \"threat from Iran.\"   \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-U.S. sentiment is daily mounting in Mideast countries upon which it pins so big hope. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is working hard to divert the accusing finger pointed to it into Iran exercising a big influence in Mideast. That is why the U.S. began spreading the fiction about \"threat from Iran\" in a sinister bid to convert the anti-U.S. sentiment into an anti-Iran sentiment and put the whole of Mideast under its control, availing itself of the sentiment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also the calculation of the U.S. to justify its moves to build a missile shield in Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves frantically stepped up by the U.S. under the pretext of coping with Iran's \"threat of long-range ballistic missile\" have come under strong fire in different countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story about fresh \"threat from Iran\" was concocted by the U.S. to serve the purpose of justifying them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But this old-fashioned propaganda of the U.S. is not workable in this bright world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said story is aimed, to all intents and purposes, at building missile shields in Europe and Mideast under the pretext of \"threat from Iran\" and thus maintain its military edge there. It is the real scenario of the U.S. to create conditions for forming a worldwide missile network by citing the \"threat from Iran\" in an effort to reinforce its hegemonic position as the \"world's only superpower\"."
