Taesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the zoo in front of a big painting showing a panoramic view of the zoo, he went round aquarium, tiger, bear and horse sheds and other places for a long while. Learning in detail about the reconstruction and operation of the zoo, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the appearance of the zoo has radically changed in a few years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the constructers for having built a splendid structure and sent thanks to them, noting that the zoo reconstructed on an expansion basis was successfully designed in a peculiar manner and the best quality was ensured in its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He appreciated the efforts made by Kim Sun Ok, head of the workteam for the tiger shed, who has faithfully worked as an animal breeder for more than four decades, and officials and other workers of the zoo, noting that they have done a lot of work, indeed, at the honorable post for the people's happiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for managing and operating the zoo, stressing that it is the pride of the people in the DPRK to have a large modern zoo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is very important to spruce up the zoo well and improve its operation as it is not only a precious treasure of the country to be handed down to the generations to come but is of great significance in the cultural and emotional life of working people and school youth and children and their upbringing and education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to build the zoo better under a long-term plan it is necessary to increase the species of animals and consolidate its material and technical foundation to serve its purpose, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important for the zoo to solve the feed problem and establish a veterinary and anti-epidemic system as it breeds a lot of animals of diverse species, he noted, underscoring the need to take thorough-going measures for providing feed suited to the diversity of species of animals and, at the same time, build modern veterinary hospitals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also stressed the need to refurnish the inside and outside of the animal sheds in such a way as to make them convenient to visitors and build facilities sufficient for their rest so that an increasing number of working people and school youth and children may visit the zoo to enjoy a cultural and emotional life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are in the zoo many rare animals including gift animals sent by different countries of the world and it is, therefore, necessary to pay deep attention to the preservation and breeding of them, he said, calling on the zoo to put the breeding and management on a scientific basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the employees of the zoo would successfully perform their honorable mission and duty as servants for people in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Department Directors of the WPK Central Committee Jang Song Thaek and Kim Yang Gon, First Vice-Minister of Foreign Affairs Kang Sok Ju, First Vice Department Directors of the WPK Central Committee Ri Je Gang and Ri Jae Il, Chairman of the Radio and TV Broadcasting Committee of the DPRK Cha Sung Su, and other senior officials and KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su and other commanding officers of the KPA."

The state, therefore, is fully responsible for guaranteeing the rights of all citizens to the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the benevolent socialist system, the Korean people are leading a worthwhile and happy life as masters of the country and society and creditably fulfilling the responsibility and role as masters. All of them are participating in the exercise of power and state administration with equal rights and leading a worthwhile political life, affiliated to certain political organizations. They are given ample opportunity of learning and keeping themselves in good health thanks to free education and free medical care systems and various popular policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The independent and creative life the Korean people enjoy is a dignified worthwhile and happy life unimaginable in the capitalist society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the above-said \"resolution\" cooked up with Japan and the EU as main players is a product of the sinister political plot to stifle socialism in the DPRK as the \"resolution\" totally disregarded its reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Japan and some countries of the EU that spearheaded the fabrication of the \"resolution,\" they are not entitled to say anything about someone's \"human rights performance\" in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is because these countries committed worst human rights abuses in history by perpetrating wars of aggression and genocide against other countries for centuries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than Japan and member nations of the EU that dispatched their troops to the Iraqi war started by the U.S. in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Iraqi war is state-sponsored terrorism and the most hideous human rights abuse as human rights were seriously violated by ultra-modern means of war and mediaeval methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unceasing xenophobia, discrimination against minorities and all sorts of crimes and infringement upon rights of people by law enforcement organs, etc., rampant in the Western countries are also hideous human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the light of the historical facts and what is happening in their own countries, they have neither moral right nor legal right to talk about someone's \"human rights issues.\" It is the tragedy and disgrace for humankind to see such worst human right abusers utter words about human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they wish to talk about human rights issues at the UN so much, they had better begin taking issues with the human rights abuses committed by them in the past and being perpetrated by them in different parts of the world at present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not for the sake of people of other countries that the Western forces are vociferating about \"human rights issues.\" In doing so, they seek a sinister aim to cover up their crime-woven history in which they savagely trampled down upon people's right to existence and other vital rights for centuries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"human rights racket\" of the West is aimed to meet its own interests and nothing but a move to westernize the whole world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The West is behaving as if it were \"a human rights judge\" whose role is characterized by politicization and double-dealing standards in handling human rights issues, arrogant admonition and undisguised interference in others' internal affairs.

Korea Demanded\r\n Pyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- The Korean Jurists Institute on Sunday released a white paper disclosing the treacherous and anti-reunification nature of \"the National Security Law.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper cited facts that the NSL has served as a hurdle in the way of achieving national reconciliation, unity and reunification of the country and a check-bar blocking the progress of south Korean society as it is nothing but a tool for maintaining the U.S. imperialists' colonial rule and ensuring \"the security\" of the successive sycophantic and traitorous regimes over the last six decades since it was promulgated and enforced on December 1, 1948 in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the background against which the NSL, an unprecedented evil law, was cooked up and revised retrogressively, the white paper said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NSL, which has undergone a retrogressive revision to have four chapters and 25 articles and supplementary rules year after year, is the most draconic law under the south Korean \"legal system\" aimed at blocking the democratization of society and the reunification of the country and antagonizing the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NSL has legal premises to block national reconciliation, unity and reunification of the country by regarding fellow countrymen with hostility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the NSL does not recognize the party concerned with reunification it totally denies dialogue and negotiations for reunification and bars compatriots from having any discussion and contact and achieving national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a law against democracy and human rights as it is aimed at suppressing the righteous struggle of the south Korean people for social democracy and the reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present June 15 era of reunification demands a total repeal of the NSL, a hurdle in the way of achieving inter-Korean reconciliation, cooperation and the reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should face up to the trend of the times and repeal the NSL at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is using the NSL, a fascist law which should have already been thrown into the dumping ground of history, as an all-powerful means for putting an end to the June 15 era of reunification and ensuring \"the security of its power.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Jurists Institute brands these suppressive actions as traitorous and anti-reunification acts and human rights abuses and bitterly denounces them on behalf of all the jurists of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the Lee Myung Bak group persist in invoking the NSL, going against the unanimous demands of the Koreans at home and abroad and the June 15 era of reunification, it will stand more thoroughly isolated and more bitterly rebuffed by all Koreans and world people and will have to pay a dear price for its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime's more desperate use of the NSL would only precipitate its self-destruction."
