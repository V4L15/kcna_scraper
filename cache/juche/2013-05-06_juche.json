            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Various Construction Projects \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, inspected various projects being undertaken by the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t The first leg of his inspection was the construction site of the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the gatepost of the Victorious Fatherland Liberation War Memorial Tower under construction, he noted with satisfaction that a combination of white granite and red-brown stone to make it appear in contrast helps preserve its nature well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the main building of the museum. At the main lobby where the statue of President Kim Il Sung will stand, he was pleased to note that the remodeling of the ceiling of the vestibule makes it look refreshed and imposing, its depth ensured.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He dropped in at the Hall \"Taejon\". He said that soldiers built pillars and a corridor connecting the two buildings on both sides of River Pothong in a peculiar manner so that they look the same edifice and constructed the hall in such manner that one can hardly find its former appearance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the exhibition of weapons seen by Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il and those of merit and the exhibition of enemy weapons, built behind subsidiary group sculptures, he set forth tasks for lowering their roofs and remodeling them to match the environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing the museum again and again, he said that the longer he looks at it, the more spectacular it appears, and expressed great satisfaction over the fact and it has been successfully built to meet the requirements of architectural beauty and formative art.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced concrete tasks and ways to speed up the construction of the museum and ensure its quality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his inspection was the Munsu Wading Pool under construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the soldier-builders for having done a lot of work in a brief span of time, overcoming obstacles and difficulties in a revolutionary soldier spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned about the construction force and equipment and the supply of building materials, underscoring the need to push forward the project as planned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that deep attention should be paid to the construction of the wading pool conducive to providing school youth and children and other people with conditions for pleasant sporting and cultural rest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told the commanding officers to report about the progress made in the project everyday, calling on them to build it wonderfully as a cultural recreation ground for people so that it may stand impeccable even in a distant future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the soldier-builders would complete without fail the project by October 10, the founding anniversary of the WPK, bearing in mind the intention of the Supreme Commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he visited the Mirim Riding Club under construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He saw the general map of the club and the miniatures of its indoor training ground. Recalling that he sent information about riding schools in different countries and a lot of reference books to build the club on a world level, he criticized the officials for failing neither to use them as reference nor study them and building it in a manner completely different from the design he had instructed to send to a designing organ of the KPA among those reported to him by various designing institutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In order to build the club well, it is necessary to rearrange the main course and, at the same time, separately construct the building of a riding school, service building, indoor riding training ground and stalls and measures should also be taken to solve the traffic problem satisfactorily, he pointed out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to plant many trees around the club to match natural environment and build an artificial mountain and stroll roads in the vast area in the middle of the main course to provide the visitors with ample conditions for rest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Choe Ryong Hae, director of the KPA General Political Bureau, and Hwang Pyong So and Ma Won Chun, vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."
