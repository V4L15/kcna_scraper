One example is the compilation of a \"biographical dictionary of pro-Japanese  elements\" pushed ahead by many intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the \"people's government\", a group of pro-Japanese elements of modern brand, is at pains to invite the Japanese 'Emperor,' a symbol of militarist Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation. \r\n\r\n"

If the Japanese reactionaries, defying repeated warnings of Korea,  run wild to achieve their wild design for reinvasion, taking advantage of an \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula, it will only lead them to self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The only way out for Japan is to drop their daydream of reinvasion, properly liquidate its crime-woven past and turn over a new leaf, declares the commentary. \r\n\r\n"
