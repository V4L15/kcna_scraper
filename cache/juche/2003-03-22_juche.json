            "content": "KCNA dismisses large-scale U.S. war maneuvers as alarming development \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The large-scale joint military exercises being staged by the U.S. and the South Korean warhawks have created such a tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a nuclear war may break out there any moment.\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the DPRK targeted saber-rattling is being staged in real earnest, timed to coincide with the U.S. attack on Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the U.S. win-win strategy, a key link in the whole chain of its strategy to dominate the world by holding an upper hand in strength, is being put into practice on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a growing danger of the Foal Eagle and Rsoi joint military exercises as the U.S. hurled unusually huge combat forces equipped with sophisticated weapons into the exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey involve hundreds of thousands of troops and various types of modern combat hardware enough to wage a war.  The U.S. has already transferred 24 B-52 and B-1 fighter-bombers to the west pacific region, deployed 6 F-117 stealth fighters, which were in an airforce base in New Mexico state, in South Korea on March 13 and, at the same time, mobilized a wing of F-15 fighters, a backbone of its air force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most serious is that it brought super-size carrier Carl Vinson dubbed \"a Golden Eagle\" with 80 latest deck-planes on board to a South Korean port on March 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dispatch of the carrier, the third largest in the U.S. navy, to the Foal Eagle and Rsoi to play a major role there lays bare its operational intention to carry out the largest-ever joint military exercises and threaten and stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the South Korean belligerent forces have ceaselessly staged war exercises against the DPRK. But it is the first time for them to stage one-month-long war exercises by mobilizing such huge troops and modern operational equipment as this time throughout South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While staging exercises in the sky and sea and on the land, the U.S. concentrates its efforts on carrying out its aerial strategy in particular. This means that it is going to mount a preemptive attack on nuclear facilities in the DPRK and take it as an opportunity of escalating the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far put an international pressure on the DPRK to scrap its \"nuclear weapons program\", claiming that the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" poses a threat to the world. As this did not work on the DPRK, it is now going to settle it by military means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has exerted sustained sincere efforts to peacefully solve the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations. But the U.S., defying those efforts and turning down the DPRK's proposal for the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty, went the lengths of staging the largest-ever war exercises intended to fix the zero hour of its preemptive attack on it, driving the military situation in Korea to the brink of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality patently shows what just measures the DPRK has taken to increase the self-defensive capacity strong enough to decisively repel any formidable enemy's aggression under the banner of the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having this self-defensive capacity, the DPRK is invincible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and the people's army of the DPRK are taking every possible measure to foil the U.S. moves to provoke a war while augmenting its self-defensive capacity in every way. They are fully ready to wipe out the aggressors to the last man at a single stroke.    \r\n\r\n"

This drives the situation to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Your side has slung mud at the north side hundreds of times only for the last one month since toward the end of February and this campaign is getting more serious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but be an act of perfidy as your side broke the promise made between the two sides after the adoption of the joint declaration to refrain from slandering each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side can not but take a serious view of this disturbing development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side's soldiers in the frontal line area are greatly angered by the resumption of mud-slinging at the north side, unprecedented in its degree and content, soon after the emergence of the new rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our view that the anti-north smear campaign is prompted by a sinister intention to bedevil the favourably developing north-south relations and bring them back to those in the period of confrontation and mistrust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We strongly demand your side stand to reason and stop at once the smear campaign and clear the frontal line areas of propaganda means, source of confrontation and conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If your side does not take an immediate and practical measure to stop the campaign, your side will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing grave consequences.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' anti-DPRK confrontation moves \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- A reckless confrontation campaign against the DPRK was launched in South Korea, timed to coincide with the U.S. start of a war of an aggression against Iraq.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland released a statement today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is staging together with the United States large-scale joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder this situation, the South Korean authorities called a \"national security council\" meeting to take  \"diverse measures\" against the DPRK which has nothing to do with the Iraqi war. And they issued an order of placing the whole of South Korea on high alert dubbed \"defense readiness condition 2\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the first time that DRC 2 was declared throughout South Korea. This order the like of which can be issued only on the eve of a war calls for a ban on servicemen's holidays and staying-out, all the servicemen's return to their units, general mobilization of compliment, supply of live bullets and exercise of right of operational command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the U.S. imperialists started a war of aggression against iIaq this time, the South Korean authorities issued such an order as DRC 2, claiming that possibility of the north's provocation cannot be ruled out and the vigilance against the north should not be slackened. This is an undisguised challenge and intolerable hostility toward the north, a partner of dialogue and cooperation, and the compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they are truly concerned about the danger of war prevailing on the Korean Peninsula with the Iraqi war as an occasion, they should be vigilant against the dangerous military movements of the U.S. and the South Korean military warhawks who are driving the situation of the country to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, the United States is now seeking to ignite a war against the DPRK, together with the South Korean belligerent forces, while massively shipping latest nuclear offensive equipment into the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities, under the manipulation of the U.S., kicked up an anti-north racket with the Iraqi war as a momentum at a time when the north-targeted war exercises are going on in full scale throughout South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are very dangerous and disturbing developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that the U.S. scenario to provoke a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula has entered a reckless phase of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The very party which should cooperate with fellow countrymen to avert a new war in face of the U.S. dangerous moves to provoke a war is leading the situation to the brink of war, faulting the fellow countrymen for no reason. This is little short of adding fuel to the flames of war kindled by outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves against the nation and peace are very dangerous as they are intended to ditch the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and bedevil the favorably developing inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but express deep concern about the irrevocable adverse impact such reckless saber-rattling going on in South Korea will have on peace on the Korean Peninsula and inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities will be held wholly responsible for having hamstrung the inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation and laid obstacles in the way of achieving peace and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, together with all other fellow countrymen, will never remain a mere on-looker to the serious developments in South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on army-based policy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a lengthy editorial article captioned \"army-based idea is an invincible banner for the cause of independence in our era.\"\r\n The army-based idea of Kim Jong Il, a recognized trend of the times, serves as a guiding principle of the revolution in our era as it indicates the road of struggle for independence and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first part of the article says that the army-based idea is a great guiding principle of the revolution in the 21st century reflecting the present requirements of the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for independence against subjugation and for socialism against capitalism was waged more fiercely in the 90s of the 20th century on the world arena than ever before and the DPRK served as an epitome of its history and the hardest-fought battle field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il created a new army-based political mode and fully systematized the army-based idea and theory in the course of leading the Korean revolution and the cause of independence against imperialism to victory in the closing years of the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based idea means, in a word, the idea of giving priority to the military affairs in all matters and the line and strategy and tactics of putting the army before the working class as it calls for projecting the army as the pillar and the main agent of the revolution and relying on it. This is the revolutionary idea in the era of a fierce anti-imperialist struggle when imperialism has become extremely reactionary and has been militarized and the revolutionary theory at a new higher stage of development of human society as all the countries and all the nations are working hard to build an independent powerful state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second part of the article notes that the army-based idea is the most scientific and revolutionary idea based on a new viewpoint and stand on the position and role of the revolutionary army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based idea is based on the new understanding that an army is the most powerful political force in the development of social history and revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is the cause which is pioneered, advanced and accomplished with arms. The WPK has maintained its unshakable stand that no concession should be allowed in attaching priority to the military affairs despite any difficulties and military power should be increased without fail at any price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience of the Korean revolution proves that it is the main orientation of the socialist politics to attach importance to the army and strengthen it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the stand consistently maintained by the WPK in the revolution and construction that a military affair is the most important one and national defence should be given priority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prevailing in our society are the traits of attaching importance to military affairs, loving the army and earnestly learning from it. The whole country has turned into an impregnable fortress which no enemy dares attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has firmly maintained the stand of projecting the people's army as the core and an example in consolidating the driving force of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army has a special role to play, a role that cannot be performed by any other social group, and the anti-imperialist military front serves as a main front of the revolution on which hinges the rise or fall of the country, the nation and socialism in the revolution in our times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army is the most revolutionary, militant and powerful ranks of the revolution in our society today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article in its third part points out that the army-centred idea is a banner for achieving national prosperity as it indicates a true way of building an invincible powerful nation as required by the 21st century: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory of building a powerful nation elucidates the army-based truth that any country's power is based on its military capability and the dignity and might of a nation are guaranteed by a strong army. It indicates a fundamental way of achieving all-round progress in economy, culture and all other fields on the principle of attaching priority to military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the powerful nation with high dignity and prestige which no one dares provoke, a prosperous country which makes all-round progress in all fields including politics, economy, the military and culture that the Korean people are now striving to build. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based idea and theory of the WPK clarify that the cause of building a powerful nation could be accomplished only in the country which enjoys the leadership of the party and where the state power is in the hands of its people and the army remains strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will not step back even an inch from the road of the army-based revolution chosen by  themselves in a do-or-die spirit, loyal to Kim Jong Il, but absolutely follow the army-based idea, resolutely uphold the army-centred policy and thoroughly implement the army-based revolutionary line and thus creditably accomplish the socialist cause of Juche, it stresses.    \r\n\r\n"
