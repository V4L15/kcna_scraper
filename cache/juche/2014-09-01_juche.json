They are legitimate national educational institutions run by Chongryon with the approval of the government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They received children of Koreans in Japan for the purposes of helping children get national awareness and acquire qualifications required by a modern society and of bringing up talents who will contribute to the development of the international community including Japan. As is the case with all other foreign schools in Japan Korean schools have strictly abided by norms and regulations in the contents of teaching and operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should fully ensure conditions and environment for education of Korean schools even in the sense of repenting of the crimes of aggression committed by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Japanese reactionaries have inflicted financial burdens on Koreans in Japan in a bid to create psychological stress and, at the same time, worked hard to dampen national self-esteem and pride among Korean students in Japan who are at the stage where their outlook on the world is in the process of forming. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They seduced Korean children to go to Japanese schools, saying that they would get aid if they go to Japanese schools in a bid to take them from the fold of Chongryon and prevent the rising generation from learning Korean language and history and thus deprive Koreans in Japan of their national identity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was by no means fortuitous that at the recent meeting delegates of different countries strongly denounced Japan's measure as an expression of racial discrimination in the light of human rights. They questioned what is the reason for discriminating against Korean schools while rendering financial aid to all other schools similar to Korean schools and is it for the simple political reason that the Korean schools are associated with Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chongryon can never be subject to suppression by the Japanese reactionaries and Korean children in Japan have the right to be schooled with the same treatment as the Japanese children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now underway between the DPRK and Japan are multi-faceted talks for the improvement of relations to meet the requirements of the times and the desire of the two peoples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now confidence-building is more urgent than ever to build the relations of friendship between the two countries. But the Japanese authorities have openly disclosed their intention to destroy Chongryon, a legitimate overseas Koreans' organization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and ponder over the consequences to be entailed by its criminal acts against the Koreans."

Much upset by this, the puppet forces let a spokesman for the Ministry of Unification make poor excuses such as \"regret\" and \"twisted assertion.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Monday terms it a clumsy farce to falsify the truth about their obstructions that deprived the cheerleading squad of the opportunity to participate in the Games and shift the blame for it onto the DPRK.

The south Korean authorities made clumsy excuses for hushing up the north's notification of its decision not to send the cheerleading squad, talking about \"verbal mention\" and \"unofficial notice.\" They behaved so because they were afraid of people of broad strata in south Korea angered by the situation created by their anti-reunification racket and their behavior of deliberately taking no action to put it under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK cheerleading squad's loss of the opportunity to participate in the Games is entirely attributable to the south Korean puppet forces' wrong attitude. With no rhetoric they can excuse themselves for this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the south Korean authorities did against the cheerleading squad is recorded in history as another unpardonable crime committed by them against the nation desirous of national reconciliation and unity and the improved inter-Korean relations.
