They opposed the reunification of Korea, pursued an absolutely pro-South Korean policy and encouraged the South Korean authorities in efforts to unleash fratricidal war. In the international arena, they slandered the DPRK and tried to isolate it.\r\n   Improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations entirely depends on whether the Japanese authorities renounce their hostile policy toward the DPRK or not.\r\n   Normalization of DPRK-Japan ties is, in essence, establishment of good-neighbourly relations between the two countries on the basis of Japan's atonement for its disgraceful past.\r\n   Japan occupied Korea and enforced unprecedentedly truculent colonial rule for more than 40 years.\r\n   For Japan to atone for its past crimes is an unavoidable moral obligation before history and international law.\r\n   Japan has not honestly admitted, apologized and compensated for the past crimes, though it is more than half a century since its defeat in the war.\r\n   On the contrary, Japan is making crafty moves to bury into obscurity its past crimes.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must approach postwar settlement from a sincere position and attitude.\r\n  \r\n"
