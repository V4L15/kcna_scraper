Kazianis, room chief for defense studies of the Center for the National Interest and researcher for national security of the Potomac Foundation, warned that attack aimed at removing the regime in north Korea will invite an irrevocable disaster. He asserted that military invasion of north Korea is a crazy act, adding north Korea, which is well aware of foolishness of Saddam Hussein who allowed the deployment of the world's most powerful war forces just at its doorstep, would not miss an opportunity but mount an attack by mobilizing all possible forces under its possession in case there is a sign of deployment of armed forces. He also said that if the U.S. is true in its decision to \"overthrow\" the regime in north Korea, there can be no reason for north Korea to tolerate, stressing that what should be taken into consideration is that north Korea has maintained its social system for over six decades to counter possible invasion by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Researcher of Defense Priorities Bonnie Kristian in a commentary titled \"No, let's not invade north Korea\" said that the plan for a preemptive attack on north Korea will bring diverse disaster as it is a big blunder rather than a wise alternative. The commentary said that north Korea will decide on a powerful nuclear strike the moment it senses an imminent attack by the U.S., adding that it will be very stressful for the Trump administration to try to find out a solution to the issue of north Korea but military option will entail much greater danger let alone interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the U.S. Council of Foreign Relations when interviewed by media, warned that the Trump administration is at crossroads of crucial choice of whether to co-exist with north Korea possessed of capabilities of attacking the U.S. or disable nuclear and missile capabilities of north Korea by use of military force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot but be wise advices to the Trump administration's hard-line stand toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present U.S. administration is repeating senseless policy of nuclear blackmail which would bring only defeat, from the outset of its office, far from drawing a lesson from the failed north Korea policy of the preceding regimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has gone foolish to plan a preemptive attack while pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war by staging joint military drills with the south Korean puppet forces with the involvement of nuclear strategic assets like carrier task force, nuclear submarines, B-1B, B-52, B-2 strategic bomber triad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop the foolish act of pricking its eyes with its own fingers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing can undermine the strategic position of the DPRK that has reached the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. started dangerous nuclear war drills again, the DPRK has no option but to counter it with the toughest measures for bolstering the nuclear force as it had already declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If even a single shell is fired into the territory in which the sovereignty of the DPRK is exercised, the bases of aggression and provocation will be reduced to such debris that no living thing can be found.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should properly understand that its slightest misjudgment about the DPRK will lead it to final doom."

            "content": "EE.UU. debe tomar opcion correcta: comentario de ACNC\r\nPyongyang, 13 de marzo (ACNC) -- En estos dias, la administracion norteamericana divulga el rumor de que esta examinando el proyecto de ataque preventivo contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun los articulos recien publicados por VOA, CNN, Wall Street Journal y otros medios estadounidenses, la Casa Blanca esta revisando ahora la estrategia sobre la RPDC desde el ataque preventivo hasta el \"cambio del poder\". Pronostican ademas que es posible que ocurra el choque armado en la Peninsula Coreana dentro de uno o dos meses proximos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, los especialistas en asuntos coreanos evaluan unanimemente el posible ataque militar de EE.UU. contra la RPDC como locura que causara desastres irreparables.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHarry J. Kazianis, jefe de la seccion de estudios de defensa del Centro de Interes Nacional e investigador de asuntos de la seguridad nacional de la Fundacion Potomac, comento como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ataque para eliminar el poder norcoreano causara el desastre irreparable. Es una locura la invasion armada contra el Norte de Corea. Este pais conoce muy bien la estupidez de Saddam Hussein, quien permitio el despliegue delante de su casa de las fuerzas armadas mas poderosas del mundo, por eso, ya en la etapa inicial de emplazamiento, iniciara el ataque, sin perder la oportunidad, con todas sus fuerzas armadas existentes. Si EE.UU. hubiera decidido \"derrocar\" el poder norcoreano, eso seria un acto insoportable para el Norte de Corea. Hay que tener en cuenta que el Norte de Corea ya defendio su poder durante mas de 60 anos frente a la invasion norteamericana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBonnie Kristian, investigador de Defense Priorities, organo estadounidense de investigacion de las politicas de defensa nacional, senalo en su comentario intitulado \"No agresion al Norte de Corea\" como lo siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl plan de ataque preventivo contra el Norte de Corea no es la opcion sensata sino el error fatal que traera varias desgracias. Ya en el momento en que se da cuenta de la inminencia del ataque de EE.UU., el Norte de Corea decidira el ataque nuclear demoledor. Buscar la solucion del problema del Norte de Corea es un rompecabezas para la administracion Trump, pero el metodo militar no aportara beneficios sino causara el peligro mucho mas grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presidente del Consejo de Relaciones Exteriores, en una entrevista de prensa sostenida recientemente, advirtio que la administracion Trump se encuentra en el dilema fatal de coexistir con el Norte de Corea capaz de atacar a EE.UU. o destruir su capacidad de misiles nucleares mediante el uso de fuerzas armadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon consejos acertados sobre la politica intransigente de la administracion Trump al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin sacar lecciones del fracaso de las politicas sobre Corea de los poderes anteriores, la actual administracion repite la politica de chantaje nuclear que no tiene ninguna posibilidad de triunfar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl movilizar en los ejercicios militares conjuntos con el Sur de Corea todas sus propiedades estrategicas nucleares como portaaviones y submarinos y los 3 tipos de bombardero B-1B, B-52 y B-2, lleva la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al borde de guerra nuclear planeando estupidamente el ataque preventivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe convendria a EE.UU. dejar desde ahora la tonteria de lanzarse al fuego con gasolina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie podra romper la posicion estrategica de la RPDC en el plano cimero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa que EE.UU. inicio de nuevo el peligroso simulacro nuclear en la cara de la RPDC, esta se ve obligada a tomar contramedidas superintransigentes para aumentar sus fuerzas nucleares como ya lo ha declarado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeran devastados los bastiones de agresion y provocacion si un solo obus cae en la zona jurisdiccional de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debera tener presente que su menor equivocacion sobre la RPDC le conducira al arruinamiento definitivo."
