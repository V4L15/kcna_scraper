Korea aboard Fighter\r\n Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA Tuesday as regards the fact that the U.S. ambassador to south Korea took a F-16 under the U.S. 7th Air Force to fly the sky over south Korea on July 12:\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a bullying act that can be done only by a deranged man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that he who is outwardly a diplomat took the fighter unbecoming for his duty goes to clearly prove that all the U.S. diplomats are real war servants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the moment when the U.S. ever more undisguised hostile moves and nuclear threats against the DPRK are bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula, it is a very meaningful thing that the U.S. ambassador to south Korea who personally has a hand in shaping the U.S. DPRK policy and implementing it flew above south Korea aboard fighter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that such a crazy act was timed to coincide with the U.S. official decision to deploy THAAD in south Korea in the wake of the introduction of nuclear submarines and a formation of B-52Hs and other strategic assets into south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ill-boding moves of the U.S. being observed one after another with the joint military exercises Ulji Freedom Guardian for aggression to be staged in upcoming August indicate its intention to press for the unprecedented acts on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are closely following these moves of the U.S. and will take stronger self-defensive nuclear countermeasures for defending the country's sovereignty and the nation's right to existence from the U.S. daily-increasing nuclear war threats."

However, the adoption of the presidential statement is the reckless action of seriously distorting the reality and following the U.S. extreme hostile policy toward the DPRK, Choe said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some regional countries still have wrong views that the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence is the root cause of escalating tensions on the peninsula and the problem can be solved only when the DPRK exercises \"self-restraint.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Guaranteeing peace on the peninsula is a vital and pressing issue for the DPRK as it is directing all efforts to economic development for building a powerful socialist country. However, such heinous hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK as malignantly hurting even the dignity of its supreme leadership compels it to take a series of multi-phase measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrent. The DPRK will as ever take physical measures to protect its sovereignty and vital rights on a routine basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe called on Asian countries to face up to the essence of the present situation and do things helpful to ensuring peace and stability on the peninsula, neither reading others' faces nor dancing to the tune of someone, at the ASEAN regional ministerial conference to be held in Laos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Diplomatic envoys of Asian countries expressed deep concern over the situation on the peninsula being pushed to the uncontrollable phase owing to the U.S. moves to bolster up its strategic assets and heinous hostile policy toward the DPRK and shared the view that sticking to the fair stand as regards the Korean peninsula issue would be helpful to its settlement."

This clearly proves that he is a heinous war maniac far surpassing the successive colonial governors who had found their way to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the puppet media expressed shock at it, calling it the first of its kind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems Lippert staged the flight farce out of his calculation to \"demonstrate\" strong \"commitment to security\" before the Park Geun Hye puppet group which is taken aback by the signal growth of the might of the DPRK and to give a shot in the arm of the group but this is gross miscalculation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strategic bombers of the U.S. forces professing \"God of war\" took to flight after they had found their way to south Korea by stealth, fearing the powerful defence capabilities of the DPRK and its ensuing control of territorial air. Lippert's act reminds one of a lame guy dancing under moonlight and a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1950s war merchant Dulles was reported to have picked up a golden-bell flower in a trench south of the 38th Parallel in a bid to instigate the Syngman Rhee puppet forces to ignite a war. But this led to the bitter result of the first-ever defeat in American history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t World community commented: \"The final war to be waged by the DPRK against the U.S. and other hostile forces will not be confined to the boundary of the Korean peninsula as it was in the past. Not only the Korean peninsula but the vast waters and regions in the Pacific where the U.S. forces and their bases are stationed will turn into war theatres and even the U.S. mainland across the ocean will become the center of battlefield.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Lippert had paid heed to these voices, he would not have gone so foolish as to bring the dark clouds of a war to the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year Lippert, whose face was all over with blood as he failed to stop a knife attack by an ordinary south Korean man, now entered the range of merciless strike by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK which are waiting for a moment for mounting annihilating blows. So wretched are the fate of Lippert himself and the U.S. which hurled him into it."

They suffered the shame of taking to flight after having a hard time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when the whole of south Korea has turned into a mayhem over the issue of THAAD deployment, neighboring countries are becoming increasingly critical of it as they are exposed to an ever more undisguised military threat of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the Park Geun Hye group, the chief architect of the crisis, is ordering its yes men to \"stop the unnecessary dispute over THAAD\" and round off its deployment as quickly as possible, spouting sheer sophism that \"it is of defensive nature to cope with the north's nuclear and missile threat\" and \"it is an inevitable step for security and existence of the people.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye regime's decision to allow THAAD deployment is the worst act of treachery as it offers the U.S. an excuse to perpetuate the illegal presence of its forces which has lasted for 70 odd years and the split of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the first day of her office Park has zealously fawned up the U.S., welcoming its introduction of nukes and missiles into south Korea which have brought constant danger of war to the Korean peninsula.

Consequently, south Koreans cannot but fall victim to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is, indeed, a disgrace and a source of trouble for the nation as she is making no scruple of offering land to outsiders as a war servant at a time when many countries are involved in a hot race for defending their sovereignty and national interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She will never be able to escape the severest punishment by the nation."

Korea's Decision on THAAD Deployment\r\n Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- The France-DPRK Friendship Association posted an article on its website on July 14 bashing the decision of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces on deploying THAAD in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said the decision was made by the U.S. obsessed by the ambition to maintain military supremacy in the Asia-Pacific and establish domination over it and by its followers, south Korean authorities.  The article went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The THAAD which is to be controlled by the U.S. in south Korea is allegedly to be put in service from next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This means it will be deployed in south Korea before the \"presidential election\" next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, Park Geun Hye representatiing the south Korean conservative ruling forces with fat chance in the election is hurrying the deployment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her self-opinionated mode of rule and frivolous streak are hardly different from those of her father who drenched south Korea with blood of its people through his military fascist dictatorship."

Pero, la perversa politica hostil anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos que calumnia brutalmente hasta la maxima dignidad de la RPDC le obliga a esta a fortalecer de manera escalonada y sucesiva su disuasivo nuclear. En lo adelante tambien, la RPDC tomara normalmente las medidas fisicas para defender su soberania y derecho a la existencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos paises asiaticos deben ver correctamente la esencia de la situacion actual y no deben observar la actitud de otros ni bailar al son de que les tocan otros, sino hacer los trabajos utiles al aseguramiento de paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana en la reunion ministerial del Foro de la Asociacion de Naciones del Sudeste Asiatico que tendra lugar en Laos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos participantes expresaron la profunda preocupacion de que la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se acerca a la fase incontrolable debido al incremento de bienes estrategicos de EE.UU y su perversa politica hostil a la RPDC. Y manifestaron la simpatia por el hecho de que solo el mantenimiento de la posicion imparcial ayudara la solucion del problema de la Peninsula Coreana."
