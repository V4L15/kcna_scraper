            "content": "ATCC apoya iniciativa de firma de convenio de paz\r\nPyongyang, 4 de febrero (ATCC) -- La Republica Popular Democratica de Corea expuso la disposicion de concertar el convenio de paz a los paises responsables del Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, lo cual disfruta de activo apoyo y aprobacion de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t  La paz es muy importante para el pueblo coreano que durante mas de medio siglo vive en medio del peligro permanente de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestra propuesta deviene el proyecto mas adecuado y realista, capaz de abrir la nueva coyuntura tanto para preparar la garantia real del alivio de tension en la Peninsula Coreana como para poner fin a la intervencion extranjera y solucionar el problema de la reunificacion en el principio de la autodeterminacion nacional y es el remedio mas racional que conviene a la observacion de la paz de Asia y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, algunas fuerzas ponen obstaculos en la realizacion de esta propuesta calificandola de la \"prematura\" e insistiendo en que \"la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea debe retornar primero a las conversaciones a 6 bandas\". En una palabra, demandan tratar primero el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta absurda teoria no pasa de ser un intento de quienes quieren debilitar la realidad y la racionalidad de la propuesta de la firma del convenio de paz y obstaculizar la realizacion de la paz, la estabilidad y la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La discusion del problema del establecimiento del sistema de paz es muy urgente para realizar \"armoniosamente\" los articulos de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre, entre otros, la desnuclearizacion, la normalizacion de las relaciones, la remuneracion de energia y el establecimiento del sistema de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La insistencia en que el establecimiento del sistema de paz es el problema a ser discutido despues de ser resuelto el problema nuclear es la teoria invertida y significa el intento de evitar la solucion del problema.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Terminaron infructiferas las conversaciones destinadas a promover la desnuclearizacion antes de discutir el sistema de paz, aunque fueron efectuadas durante varios anos pasados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto demuestra fehacientemente que la labor iniciada sin confianza no puede esperar un buen resultado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nunca podra ser solucionado tal problema sin la confianza entre las partes interesadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Romper el circulo vicioso de desconfianza e impulsar la desnuclearizacion mediante la creacion de la confianza, he aqui el proposito de nuestra propuesta sobre la firma del convenio de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, es precisamente el tiempo que sustituir el Acuerdo de Armisticio por el convenio de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Solo cuando sea concertada cuanto antes el segundo que haga las veces del primero, es posible  convertir las agudas relaciones de beligerancia entre la RPDC y EE.UU. en las de paz y de confianza y lograr la duradera paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El inicio pronto de las negociaciones por la concertacion del convenio de paz es muy adecuado y apropiado tanto a la luz de la demanda de la situacion tensa dada en la Peninsula Coreana como en vista de la oportunidad de este ano del 60o aniversario del estallido de la guerra coreana y la corriente de la actual situacion internacional en desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si se firma el convenio de paz, se creara la confianza entre la RPDC y EE.UU., se eliminaran las relaciones hostiles, con lo cual la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana se impulsara con mas vigor."
