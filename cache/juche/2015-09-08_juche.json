Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President and leader Kim Jong Il set forth the idea of building an independent and sovereign state and the line for building a thriving nation reflecting the requirements of the times and the aspiration of the people and built on this land a country independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in national defence, weathering all sorts of trials with steel-like will and distinguished leadership ability, and thus set an example in building the socialist power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They made sure that the DPRK government regarded believing in the people as in Heaven as its basic idea of nation-building and fully applied the slogan \"We serve the people!\" to the state activities and all the lines, policies and activities were thoroughly implemented to protect the independent rights and interests of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They made ceaseless long journeys of patriotic devotion to lay a strong economic foundation so that the Korean people may enjoy happiness and wellbeing generation after generation, and brought about great changes in the drive for building an economic power and improving the people's living standard. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the whole period of leading the revolution they, pioneers and leaders of the Songun revolution, turned the DPRK into an invincible military power on the revolutionary principle that arms guarantees the victory of the revolutionary cause and prosperity of the country and nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They regarded the reunification of the country as the supreme task of the nation and greatest patriotic cause and worked heart and soul to hand down a reunified country to posterity. They steadily raised the prestige and influence of the DPRK in the international arena and developed foreign relations, making undying contributions to accomplishing the cause of global independence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the leadership of the party the DPRK is dynamically advancing for the final victory in the drive for building a thriving nation, the reporter noted, calling for building a paradise for the people, the best power in the world, on this land as early as possible and stepping up the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to bring about a great change in the north-south relations and pave a wide avenue to independent reunification, he said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government of the DPRK will as ever make every effort to preserve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and achieve global independence and boost the friendly and cooperative relations with those countries which are friendly towards it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's flag, which has fluttered as a symbol of victory and dignity of the motherland, will always flutter in the sky of the century as a signpost of the great Paektusan nation."
