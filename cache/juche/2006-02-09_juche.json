Korean Authorities' Projected War Exercises under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the minister of Defence of south Korea at a regular press conference blustered that it would go ahead as planned with all the exercises scheduled for this year as well as the joint military exercises with the U.S. due in upcoming March, talking about \"training\" and strong army\" at a time when the hard-won north-south military authorities' talks are at hand. \r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday terms this an anti-national and anti-reunification outburst intended to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war in collusion with outsiders and thus bedevil the north-south relations and overturn the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the joint military exercises the south Korean warmongers had staged in south Korea with the U.S. imperialist aggression troops since the 1970s were without exception preliminary wars and test nuclear wars to invade the DPRK from A to Z in view of their nature, scale and programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are threatening to hold the war exercises to invade the north with outsiders this year too, with the inter-Korean military authorities' talks at hand. This is a challenge to the dialogue partner and a mockery of it.\r\n Dialogue can never go together with war exercises. The south Korean authorities' announcement of their plan to stage those war exercises against the north goes to prove that \"dialogue\", \"reconciliation,\" \"building of military confidence\" and \"detente\" much touted by them are nothing but rhetoric to deceive the public opinion.\r\n It is an intolerable anti-national and anti-reunification criminal act for them to join the outsiders in their war maneuvers aimed at seriously threatening the destiny of the nation even in the June 15 era of reunification when the idea of \"By our nation itself\" dominates the movement for independent reunification and the national cooperation has become the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clarify before the entire nation whether they stand for reconciliation and cooperation or for confrontation and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They indiscriminately vandalized or looted valuable cultural treasures of Korea in a bid to stamp out the time-honored history and advantages of the Korean nation and root out its soul.\r\n They deprived the Koreans of even their written and spoken languages and their names and tried to remove national custom peculiar to the Koreans and looted huge natural treasures and products of Korea lock, stock and barrel. \r\n The Japanese imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Koreans as they inflicted incurable wounds on the Koreans, the article says, stressing that all the crimes the Japanese imperialists committed in the past are still fresh in the memory of the Koreans, who are firmly determined to certainly force Japan to pay for those crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are putting spurs to the development and introduction of F-15K fighters, early warning planes, tanks, armored vehicles, large landing craft, submarines and other war equipment, talking about \"independent capability to fight a war\" and \"deterrent to counter the north\". It is also a very disturbing development that the military is readjusting and reorganizing its forces' overall operation commanding system. By backing the U.S.-proposed \"strategic flexibility\" and \"PSI\" of its forces in south Korea, in particular, the south Korean authorities are hamstringing the efforts to warm up the inter-Korean relations and sparking a dangerous situation that may lead to an armed conflict any moment in and around the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither peace nor the peaceful reunification of Korea is thinkable without a resolute struggle against the moves for aggression and war on the peninsula. Peace can be won only through a sustained nationwide struggle to protect peace from aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

For this reason its public nature has been recognized for the last several decades and it has been exempted from the payment of some taxes including the property tax. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, an ultra-right wing organization of the city brought this case of tax exemption to the court of the city, asserting that it was an illegal measure. \r\n Last year the court turned down the case at the first hearing, claiming that the hall was of public nature and its tax exemption was not against the law in view of its users, its facilities and their management and its service, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Fukuoka High Court at a trial on an appeal held on Feb. 2 overturned the judgment made at the first trial by ruling that the hall's tax exemption be canceled. \r\n It is the first time the Japanese judicial authorities ruled that the tax exemption of the facility related to Chongryon was illegal, denying its public nature.\r\n The Information Office of the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon dismissed the judgment made by the high court as an unjust one as it stokes discrimination against Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
