Yet, it is kicking up the racket of sanctions, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. This behavior is throwing more difficulties and hurdles in the way of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan is not in a position to talk about the DPRK's unconditional return to the six-party talks. \r\n It is well known that Japan has long actively supported and cooperated with the U.S. in its hostile policy toward the DPRK with bitterness toward it. The Japanese reactionaries are busy echoing the U.S. groundless accusations against the DPRK.  They have blindly defended and supported their American master when he took the measure to apply sanctions against the DPRK. It is the height of folly for such philistines to talk about someone's unconditional return to the six-party talks. This is a revelation of the bad habit of those who are hell-bent on serving the U.S.\r\n No matter how vociferously they may call for the DPRK's return to the six-party talks, while tightening sanctions against it, no one will lend an ear to it.\r\n The Japanese ultra-right conservatives' evermore frantic anti-DPRK racket pursuant to the U.S. policy would bring them nothing good.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The movement among other things calls on all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to give full play to their national self-esteem in order to decisively terminate the U.S. intervention and domination, a stumbling block lying in the way of national reunification, and treacherous acts of the separatists in league with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for peace against war is an embodiment of the principle of peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a movement for removing the dark clouds of war thickly hanging over Korea and defending peace. It is a just patriotic movement as it calls upon all Koreans to turn out as one in the struggle to resolutely protect peace and security on the Korean Peninsula from the U.S. imperialists' war moves against the DPRK and drive the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, the root cause of war, out of south Korea.\r\n The patriotic movement for great national unity reflects the principle of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a movement in which the above-said principle is applied to the cause of national reunification. It calls upon all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to unite for independent reunification irrespective of ideology, system, grouping and affiliation. It also calls for strengthening solidarity and alliance among pro-reunification movement organizations. It serves as a powerful means of action whereby to smash the wild design and challenges of the pro-American conservatives with the might of united anti-conservative forces and bring a final doom to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity is quite just and is displaying its tremendous vitality thanks to the full support and approval of the entire nation as it has reflected the three principles of national reunification, a great reunification program common to the nation, and serves as a means for implementing them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he initiated to construct a children's palace with funds donated by industrialists and businessmen and selected the best place in the heart of Pyongyang as its site.\r\n The President had always paid primary attention to bringing up the children well. He saw to it that the issue of pencil for pupils was put on the agenda of the First Session of the Provisional People's Committee of North Korea and that meetings of the Political Committee of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea were convened to discuss issues of providing children and students of the country with cotton-padded clothes free of charge and of making preparations for a new academic year.\r\n A branch school was established for a pupil in a remote area and commuter trains and buses have been operated only for several students.
