            "content": "U.S. Criminal Smear Campaign against DPRK Disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) -- The criminal smear propaganda campaign persistently conducted by the U.S. is a mean method it has constantly used to invade and topple other countries and put them under its control, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long used broadcasting as a means for invading other countries and realizing its ambition to dominate the world, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. vicious psychological offensive to spread corrupt bourgeois ideology and culture and way of life in other countries and destabilize them has become all the more pronounced as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has frantically conducted psychological warfare against the DPRK. It started broadcasting in Korean language from early 1997 and spent two million U.S. dollars in fiscal year 1998 alone to increase the hours of broadcasting targeting the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. smear broadcasting operation targeting the DPRK has reached extremity in its viciousness and meanness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, the U.S. decided to increase the amount of funds for broadcasting service specializing in propaganda targeting the DPRK and the hours of broadcasting. As for the \"Voice of Free Asia\" it decided to add middle wave broadcasting to short wave one. The U.S. intensified smear broadcasting operation amid increased support for the \"Voice of Free Asia\" and VOA is part of its vicious moves to tarnish the image of the DPRK in the international arena and pull down the socialist system in the DPRK centred on the popular masses. In another development, the U.S. has craftily worked hard to introduce transistor radios, CDs of unsavory contents and other publications through various channels into the DPRK in a bid to cause ideological and political vacillation, disintegration and degeneration among the people in the DPRK and social disorder and sort of change there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken, however. The people in the DPRK are stronger than anybody else in the working-class awareness and revolutionary spirit and are closely united in terms of ideology and will. The socialist system in the DPRK is firm politically and ideologically. No force can break the Korean people's faith in socialism and their single-minded unity and the Korean socialist system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
