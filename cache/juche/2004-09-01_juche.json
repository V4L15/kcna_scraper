            "content": "DPRK Compelled to Take Every Possible Measure for Self-Defence \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces are now repeating their hackneyed fiction of \"threat from the north\" in a bid to cover up their ambition to invade the DPRK. They have gone the lengths of impudently asserting that even the reduction of U.S. troops in south Korea as part of \"redeployment of U.S. forces\" would not result in weakening \"the deterrent against north Korea\" and any misjudgment would prove a serious blunder.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary carried in this regard observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the U.S. imperialists in the redeployment of their forces is to put their strategy of preemptive attack into practice. The ulterior motive of the U.S. is to disarm the DPRK behind the smokescreen of \"reduction and redeployment\" of its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. asserts that it has no intention to invade the DPRK, while paying lip-service to a \"peaceful and diplomatic solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula.\" But there is no change in its policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. It has sent an aircraft carrier flotilla to the waters around the Korean peninsula and keeps shipping sophisticated war hardware into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A clear proof of this is the facts that Bush openly said the U.S. was demanding north Korea lay down its arms and John Bolton, U.S. under-secretary of State, uttered that north Korea could expect improved relations with the U.S. only when it settles not only the issue of nuclear weapons but issues of biological and chemical weapons, ballistic missile, human rights, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks is not a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue but a preemptive attack against the DPRK. The U.S. imperialists' frantic arms build-up discloses the true aim sought by them in refusing to commit themselves to drop their hostile policy toward the DPRK while clamoring for a \"peaceful solution to the nuclear issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. pursues only confrontation and war instead of dialogue an d peace, the DPRK is left with no option but to take every necessary measure for self-defence. The commentary urges the United States to immediately stop such reckless arms build-up.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The women of the two countries should pool efforts to usher in a new era of reconciliation and friendship between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sumiko Shimizu, head of the Japanese women's \"Peace Line\" visiting group who is representative of the Japanese Women's Society for Solidarity with the Korean Women, in her speech said that the Korean people are dynamically advancing to defend the sovereignty of the country and achieve peaceful reunification by their concerted efforts while striving to implement the June 15 joint declaration. The Japanese women will positively support and encourage the Korean people in their just struggle to achieve the country's reunification, she stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She noted that the Bush regime has escalated the tensions in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia, forcing the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program and revealing its attempt to mount a nuclear preemptive attack on it after designating the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution adopted there said that the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration is a step forward in realizing the hope for peace in Northeast Asia. It clarified a 5-point resolve carrying the will to achieve peace and stability in Northeast Asia through solidarity between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolve calls for lifting the voices demanding an earlier normalization of the DPRK-Japan relations, properly educating the younger generation in history and struggling against all sorts of national discrimination. It also deals with issues arising in positively supporting and encouraging the just cause of the Korean people and conducting a dynamic campaign to attain the common purpose.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
