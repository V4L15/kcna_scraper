            "content": "\"Inspection\" of underground facility is interference in DPRK's internal affairs \r\n   Pyongyang, November 9 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK made public a statement today in connection with the fact that a DPRK-U.S. negotiation on DPRK's underground facility will be held in Pyongyang from November 16.\r\n   Recalling that before the opening of the negotiation some people spread rumors that the DPRK should allow the \"inspection\" of an underground facility now under construction and that if it refuses, the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework itself would face a crisis, spokesman said:\r\n   This is nothing but a foolish attempt to put public pressure upon the DPRK to accept their unjustifiable demands.\r\n   Their insistence on \"inspection\" of our underground facility means to search all our internal things, which is an insult to the DPRK that has sincerely implemented the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and a wanton interference in our internal affairs.\r\n   We have already repeatedly told the U.S. side that the object about which the U.S. side threw doubts is a civilian underground facility. Generously enough, we went so far as to say that if they persist in inspecting the underground facility, we could show it. But we have made it clear that if it proved not to be a \"nuclear facility\", the U.S. side should compensate for vilifying us and impairing our prestige.\r\n   If the U.S. side is willing to inspect the object at any cost, therefore, it may make proper compensation and inspect the object as we demand. We cannot understand why it is spreading groundless rumours, even mobilising a third country.\r\n   We make it clear once again that we will not tolerate any interventionist moves which infringe upon our sovereignty but resolutely reject such a brigandish demand as house search.\r\n   It is our stand that if the U.S. side wants to break the agreed framework over the issue of confirming an underground facility, it may as well do so.\r\n   Although we have sincerely implemented the agreed framework, a serious imbalance was created in implementing the framework owing to the insincere stance and attitude of the U.S. side.  Moreover, we have gotten no great benefit from the framework.\r\n   If the U.S. side breaks the framework, our uneasiness caused by it will disappear of its own accord.\r\n   They had better keep mum instead of laying obstacles in the way of negotiation arranged with much difficulty, spreading rumours for their sinister purposes. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is aimed at testing whether any obstacle may occur in executing war in case the United States moves its commanding centre to Japan with less danger in the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   In essence, it is designed to supplement and perfect the commanding system of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance.\r\n   Judging from them, all the war games are a preliminary war, a nuclear test war to make a surprise preemptive strike at the DPRK.\r\n   Worse still, they were staged behind the curtain of the four-party talks for the peace of the Korean peninsula.\r\n   This proves once again that \"peace on the Korean peninsula\" and \"peaceful reunification\" on the lips of the U.S. warmongers and the South Korean authorities are nothing but a sheer lie and there is no change in their criminal design to stifle the DPRK with strength.\r\n   The U.S. design to stifle the DPRK with strength is nothing but a daydream. \r\n   The U.S. military quarters and the South Korean authorities had better not act rashly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
