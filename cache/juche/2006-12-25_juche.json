            "content": "National Meeting Held to Mark Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Assumption of Supreme Commandership of KPA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture Saturday to mark the 15th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership of the Korean People's Army.\r\n Present there were senior party, army and state officials, chairpersons of the friendly parties and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n KPA Vice-Marshal Kim Yong Chun, member of the DPRK National Defence Commission and chief of the KPA General Staff, made a report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership of the revolutionary armed forces 15 years ago marked a great auspicious event of the nation as it provided a sure guarantee for carving out the destiny of our party, the homeland and the people and an epoch-making event that opened a bright prospect of winning sure victory in the Korean revolution and the building of revolutionary armed forces despite grim tempest of history, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since he began his Songun revolutionary leadership early in the 1960s Kim Jong Il has wisely led the cause of army building, having a firm grip on the WPK's idea of attaching importance to the army and the military affairs, thus bringing about a historic turn in building Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With deep insight into the new situation the Korean revolution faced at home and abroad due to the imperialist reactionary forces' frantic anti-socialist offensive, he established the Songun politics as a major socialist political mode in all fields and successfully solved the issue of forming a main force of the revolution on the principle of placing the army ahead of the working class as required by the era and the developing revolution, thereby putting the Songun revolutionary cause of Juche on a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the situation where the U.S. imperialists have become ever more undisguised in their threat of a preemptive nuclear attack and sanctions and pressure, the army and people of the DPRK have made utmost efforts to bolster the national defence capacity to defend the sovereignty and the right to existence of the country and the nation and thanks to this persevering struggle the DPRK succeeded in developing nukes and emerged a full-fledged nuclear weapons state after going through the most just and fair processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its successful nuclear test was a historic event that strikingly demonstrated the strong power and creative potential of Juche Korea advancing under the great banner of Songun. It was a shining fruition of the unshakable faith and will of the army and people of the DPRK to unfailingly achieve the ideal of independence and prosperity without allowing their national dignity and destiny to be infringed upon by any other country in the world plagued with tragic events due to the prevalence of the law of jungle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the tasks facing the army and people, the reporter underscored the need to defend Kim Jong Il politico-ideologically and at the cost of their lives in any adversity, thoroughly establish the trait of attaching importance to the army in the whole society and continue channeling primary efforts into developing the national defence industry, the material foundation of the military capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for exerting increased state efforts for the socialist economic construction to revitalize national economy and improve the standard of the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reiterating that it is the sacred duty the Korean people assumed before the times and history to end the tragic national division and reunify the country, the reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula still remains unpredictable due to the U.S. unchanged hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has blocked the implementation of the September 19 joint statement and put the six-party talks to a deadlock for more than a year by applying unreasonable sanctions against the DPRK. At the resumed talks it persistently schemed to force the DPRK to disarm itself unilaterally while categorically rejecting the prompt lift of the sanctions and insisting that the DPRK abandon its nuclear program first &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its followers including Japan have persistently kicked up anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket and tightened sanctions against it in a reckless bid to impair the dignity and prestige of the DPRK and strangle it economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is closely watching with a high degree of vigilance the U.S. busy employing all sorts of tricks to wrest unilateral concession and disarmament from the DPRK, using carrot and stick and escalating sanctions under the signboard of \"dialogue.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sanctions and pressure will never work on the DPRK. If the hostile forces continue escalating sanctions and pressure against the DPRK, it will resolutely react to them with stronger countermeasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK want peace but they are not afraid of war. They will never allow anyone to infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of their country even a bit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the especially noteworthy exploit in the history of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country liberated by President Kim Il Sung with arms is now shining as a socialist power under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has placed the single-minded unity of our revolutionary ranks with the KPA as its core and mainstay on a higher stage. This is the great exploit as it brought rosy future for victory of the socialist cause. The single-minded unity now serves as an emblem of Songun Korea and the source of all victories of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He encouraged the army and people to usher in a new era of building a great prosperous powerful nation, a new history of great changes. This exploit will remain forever in the history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation the Korean army and people are faced with heavy yet honorable tasks to open up a new heyday of national prosperity under the great banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people should dynamically advance along the road of Songun revolution, bearing deep in mind high national pride and honor of being led by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should trust in and follow only Kim Jong Il in any adversity with rock-firm faith that he represents their destiny and future and their country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should consistently glorify the proud history and tradition of the Songun revolution in which they have devotedly defended the respected supreme commander, acting as fortress and shield. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to thoroughly apply the Songun politics and the line of Songun revolution of the Workers' Party of Korea and further increase the country's self-defensive military capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All of them should be ardent adherents to the Songun idea and resolute defender and implementer of the idea and push forward all the work including the building of the party, state and armed forces through the political mode of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should display ardent patriotic enthusiasm so as to make a new leap in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson stresses that the victory of the Songun revolution is in store as long as Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu, stands in the van of the Korean revolutionary armed forces and the army and people are closely united around him as one in mind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Militarists' Criminal Acts under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- The reactionaries of the land of Japs have frantically incited militarism in the Japanese society since they set it as their general goal for this year to completely scrap the \"pacifist constitution\" and adopt instead a new war constitution and revise the \"Law on Self-Defence Forces (SDF)\" in a bid to secure a legal mechanism for realizing their wild ambition for overseas aggression. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political development in Japan this year goes to prove that the desperate moves of the Japanese militarist forces to realize their ambition for overseas expansion at any cost have assumed more dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The militarist propaganda offensive has become evermore pronounced in the Japanese society this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries more frequently visited the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" defying strong rebuff and criticism at home and abroad. Lurking behind this was a sinister intention to implant in the minds of the Japanese, school youth and children, in particular, pride of the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression, the spirit of exacting revenge for their defeat and the wild ambition to realize their domination over Asia which they failed to do so in the past and thus lay an ideological and moral foundation for attaining their militarist goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the Japanese reactionaries have busied themselves with the moves to create legal conditions for successful advance of the SDF overseas and its overseas military operations and increase its combat capability, while steadily tightening the military nexus between Japan and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is that they have boosted their collusion and tie-up with the U.S. imperialists in the moves to establish the missile defence system (MD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves this year are characterized by the fact that they have shifted to buckling down to establishing in real earnest the Japan-U.S. joint missile defence system with Japan as a base from escalating their nexus with the U.S. in the field of missile defence, avoiding the attention of the international community under the signboard of \"joint research.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the Japanese reactionaries to establish the MD presuppose a preemptive missile attack on other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year they have relaxed the \"three principles of arms export\" and bolstered the SDF in an effort to increase its capability for overseas military operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their attempt to soften the \"three principles of arms export\" was prompted by their wicked intention to get rid of one more brake on their moves to turn Japan into a military power and realize the nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have also worked hard to boost the SDF's capability for preemptive attack this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director general of the Defense Agency and other high-ranking military and political officials of Japan did not bother to bluster that Japan should be capable of mounting preemptive attacks on other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the Japanese Diet finally adopted the law on upgrading the Defense Agency to the ministry. This is a very dangerous legal action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy in the militarist moves of the Japanese reactionaries this year is that they have stepped up the moves to cook up a war constitution to replace the \"pacifist constitution\" which has existed for decades in Japan in name only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries singled out the DPRK as the primary target of their overseas aggression. Accordingly, they have become evermore frantic in their moves to stage a comeback to Korea this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, they have made desperate efforts to impair the international prestige of the dignified DPRK. The ultra-right conservative forces of the land of Japs have made much fuss, publishing and distributing even pamphlets on the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have conducted such disgusting diplomacy as inviting panjandrums of other countries to their country to join in their anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have been hell bent on the \"sanctions\" against the DPRK and the moves for \"preemptive attack\" on it this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Toeing its American master's policy, the Japanese government decided to apply \"financial sanctions\" against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's sanctions against the DPRK have reached an extreme phase as evidenced by total embargo on its ships including Mangyongbong-92. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of the island country have justified their moves to convert it into a military power and the moves for reinvasion with a hue and cry over the \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal nature and gravity of Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK have found a striking manifestation in its brutal suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a legitimate organization of overseas citizens of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole land of Japan has been swept by a whirlwind of unprecedented crackdown upon Chongryon and Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the Japanese reactionaries' moves for militarization and overseas aggression assumed more grave and dangerous nature this year than any other years.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
