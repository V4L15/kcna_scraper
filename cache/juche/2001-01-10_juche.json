It taught a serious historical lesson that though those involved in the most hideous crimes related to sexual slavery could escape from a legal punishment temporarily by playing a sleight of hand, they are bound to face a fair judgement by humankind even after their deaths unless they are settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tribunal ruled that the Japanese government should make a state apology and compensation for its crimes. This once again proved the truth that the unethical crimes committed against other countries and nations can never be concealed no matter how much water flows under the bridge and how many generations are replaced and they are bound to be settled through generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south Korean prosecutors groups worked out and published a joint indictment in which they clarified the social and historical background against which crimes related to \"Comfort Women for the Army\" were committed by the former Japanese government and army against Korean women, evidence enough to declare the former Japanese government and military bosses including emperor Hirohito guilty, important information and a legal ground to force the present Japanese government to own state responsibility and issues to be solved by it to fulfil its responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article strongly urged the Japanese authorities not to forget the lesson of history or depart from requirements and truth of the international law but face up to the trend of the times and make an apology and compensation for the crimes committed against the Korean people, sincerely repentant of them.    \r\n\r\n"
