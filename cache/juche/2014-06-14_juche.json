Paektu tiger-like soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the need for commanding officers to take the lead in raising a hot wind of drills, he said that an officer who is not a brave fighter cannot train his soldiers as good fighters and an officer from whom one cannot feel the smell of gunpowder cannot lead his unit in the charge under a hail of bullets and shells during a decisive battle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the commanding officers and men of the unit to build a-match-for-a-hundred combat capability with utmost effort, saving every second and minute from the firm stand that there can be no satisfaction in rounding off the combat preparations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning in detail about the supply service at the unit, he indicated the tasks to be fulfilled by it to further improve the living of its service personnel in conformity with its specific conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA."

This is a fact well known by the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  However, they call the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence a \"threat\" and go desperate in their moves to build MD. This is just like a guilty party filing the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that \"nuclear and missile threats from the north\" oft-touted by the U.S. and the puppet forces are aimed to build U.S. MD in south Korea by shipping THAAD and the like into it and thus finally round off the preparations for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deployment of THAAD will definitely turn south Korea into a nuclear outpost of the U.S., stoking military tension and the danger of a nuclear war in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group should clearly understand that the deployment of THAAD will be a suicidal act of bringing a nuclear disaster to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never remain an on-looker to the U.S. and the puppet forces' moves to deploy THAAD and build MD but resolutely counter them by bolstering the nuclear deterrence in every way to defend the security of the nation and the regional peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement expressed the expectation and belief that the world people, organizations and international organizations valuing justice and peace will become more assertive in their voices of denouncing the U.S. and the puppet forces' MD moves."

After all, any contact and dialogue, exchange and cooperation between both sides were completely intercepted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present Park Geun Hye \"government\" in south Korea, too, follows in the track of the preceding \"government\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During her \"presidential election campaign\", Park advertised that she would \"recognize\" the north-south joint declarations. But as soon as she took the power, she revealed her true colors as a confrontation maniac, saying that she would resolutely counter the north's \"provocation\" with south Korea-U.S. cooperation. In actuality, the Park group has got hell-bent on the confrontation with the DPRK, staging with the U.S. in south Korea Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, Ulji Freedom Guardian and other war games for aggression on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group attempted to systemically and totally destroy the achievements made in the June 15 era of reunification and baffled the talks between authorities of the north and the south, arranged with much efforts. They went the lengths of opening to the public the minutes of the north-south summit and removed articles related to the October 4 declaration from the \"second principal plan for the development of south-north relations\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now they drive the north-south relations to the worst confrontation and war crisis through such persistent anti-DPRK moves as continued war exercises with foreign forces, scattering of propaganda leaflets, slandering by conservative media and cruel piracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts go to prove that it is impossible to expect the smooth implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the nation's reconciliation and unity as long as the separatist forces disliking detente of the Korean peninsula and improved north-south relations are not removed from the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans should unite close in the idea of By Our Nation Itself to smash every move of the separatist forces. This is the only way for preserving the June 15 era of reunification and achieving the independent reunification and peace and prosperity of the country."

Since he got a job in the south Korean paper Choongang Ilbo in 1975, he has run the whole gamut of odd remarks in a bid to lay his base in the political and media circles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun was strongly censured by the south Korean people for his reckless remarks that the Korean nation was \"lazy and it lacked independence.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also let loose such sophism that Japan \"transferred technology\" to Korea during its colonial rule over the latter and that \"Korea was fortunate to have Japan as a neighbor.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being such human scum, Mun tried hard to \"justify\" before religionists the Japanese imperialist's colonial rule over Korea and its division, talking about \"the will of the God.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks were so ridiculous that the floor leader of the Democratic Alliance for New Politics on June 12 deplored that he could hardly understand whether Mun is a candidate for the prime minister or an official of the government-general in Korea during the rule of the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why not only progressive forces of various strata including patriotic religionists in south Korea but even newly elected lawmakers from the \"Saenuri party\" are demanding Mun give up his candidacy of his own accord as he lacked a clear outlook on history acceptable to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans will never pardon the above-said acts to justify the tragedy of national sufferings and division."

            "content": "CPME rechaza establecimiento de sistema antimisiles en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 14 de junio (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que se ha revelado el intento de los titeres surcoreanos de introducir el misil interceptor estadounidense THAAD en el suelo surcoreano e incorporarse al sistema antimisiles de EE.UU., el Comite Pannacional de Medidas Emergentes (CPME) contra los Ejercicios de Guerra Nuclear anti-Norte hizo publica el dia 14 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho recien revelado deviene una aventurera provocacion militar y crimen para asestar el golpe nuclear preventivo contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y desatar la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos dicen que el emplazamiento de THAAD en el suelo surcoreano es para hacer frente a la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea (RPDC).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa es conocido por todo el mundo que EE.UU. vino ejerciendo la amenaza nuclear sobre la RPDC para atropellarla. Por eso, la segunda se vio obligada a disponer del disuasivo nuclear para la autodefensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos se enfrascan en el establecimiento del sistema antimisiles cuestionando como \"amenaza\" el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos revelados esta vez evidencian que uno de los importantes objetivos de la insistencia de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea en la \"amenaza nuclear y de misiles del Norte de Corea\" es establecer el sistema antimisiles norteamericano mediante la introduccion de las armas como THAAD y completar los preparativos de guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe ser desplegado el THAAD, el suelo surcoreano se convertira mas en la base avanzada nuclear de EE.UU. y llegaran al extremo la tension militar y el peligro de guerra nuclear en la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos deben tener presente que la ubicacion del THAAD les conducira a la autodestruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo estaremos con brazos cruzados ante el emplazamiento de THAAD y el establecimiento del sistema antimisiles en el suelo surcoreano sino responderemos rotundamente con el fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear para defender la seguridad de la nacion y la paz de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, la nota expresa la esperanza y la conviccion de que los pueblos y entidades de varios paises del mundo amantes de la justicia y la paz y las organizaciones internacionales alzaran mas las voces de denuncia contra el intento de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos de establecer el sistema de defensa antimisil."
