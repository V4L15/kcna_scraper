Vehemently denouncing the Japanese reactionaries for persistently pursuing anachronistic militarist moves, far from trying to redeem its inglorious past crimes, the statement continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should drop its wrong attitude and stand toward the issue of settling its past crimes and opt for redressing them as early as possible on the basis of the justice of international law and from the ethical and moral point of view.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should drop its militarist ambition and stop at once its foolish distortion of history and militarist moves and opt for building genuine confidence with the people in Asia and other parts of the world.\r\n The statement urged Japan to stop politically-motivated suppression of Koreans in Japan and discrimination against them and promptly take a measure to guarantee them their dignity and rights.\r\n\r\n"

Right after the U.S. ignited the Afghan and Iraqi wars under the signboard of \"anti-terrorism\", they paved the way for SDF's overseas operation under the signboard of \"providing logistic support\" to the U.S. troops. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has thus emerged a dangerous aggression force before the international community.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is set to escalate the SDF's overseas dispatch under the cloak of the UN.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has been crafty in abusing the name of the UN for the purpose of realizing its ambition for overseas aggression. It escalated the SDF's overseas dispatch under the pretext of \"cooperation in UN peace-keeping activities\" whenever the UN took measures for ensuring regional peace. This lays bare the crafty and militaristic nature peculiar to Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has zealously pushed forward the moves to legalize the SDF's overseas military activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January the Japanese reactionaries upgraded the Defence Agency to the Ministry of Defence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Militaristic hysteria is running high in Japan and it has become evermore undisguised in its moves to retrogressively revise the \"pacifist constitution.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by Japan through these moves is to replace the \"pacifist constitution\" by a war constitution in a bid to round off the wartime system and provide a legal guarantee for its policy of military overseas expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have a sinister plot to retrogressively rewrite Article 9, the core of the constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are getting more frantic in their moves to turn Japan into a military giant by tightening its military nexus with the U.S., keeping pace with their stepped-up moves for the retrogressive constitutional revision.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with this, they are set to drastically reorganize the SDF.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better face up to the reality and stop running riot.\r\n\r\n"
