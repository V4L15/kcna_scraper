Its mission is to carry out a special task for making a preemptive strike at the nuclear and missile bases of the DPRK after infiltrating into it all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is just the aggressor and provocateur harassing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia to bring dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the \"threat from nukes and missiles from the north\" much touted by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime has only brought to light their scenario to attain such a sinister design as to finally round off their preparations for a nuclear war by bringing means for a nuclear preemptive strike to south Korea and make such strikes at the DPRK and its neighboring countries any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the Russian Foreign Ministry asserted that the resumption of the six-party talks and diplomatic settlement are possible only through the defusing of the tense military and political situation on the Korean peninsula and in its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can never evade its responsibility for scuppering the opportunity for denuclearization on the Korean peninsula and escalating tension there."
