Paektu as returning fire for fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at this hour all the strike means of the DPRK are fully ready to send all targets, big and small, intruding into its waters into the bottom of the sea any time as the probability of hit is fully guaranteed with those targets accurately sighted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the DPRK's patience leads to the eruption of the resentment of justice and its repeated warnings go over to resolute actions, the south Korean authorities will be held wholly responsible for all this before history and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK never makes an empty talk.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is thanks to the might of the army-people unity around the leader. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists depend on money and nuclear weapons but the Korean people believe in the strength of the unity and build socialism with its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons and people in the DPRK are single-mindedly united in the course of building socialism despite imperialists' constant threat of aggression and pressure. Giving top priority to bolstering the military capability, they have created a brilliant history of sharing their destinies in perfect unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great unity of the army and people has been displayed to the full. They have achieved the perfect oneness in thinking and fighting trait and all people have striven to learn from the idea and spirit of the People's Army. This resulted in building powerful national strength and provided a sure guarantee for resolutely smashing the U.S. imperialists' threat of a nuclear war. The nation's defense capability will grow stronger and the dignity and honor of the country and nation will be firmly defended as long as there is the fine tradition of army-people unity which was created in the period of the anti-Japanese war and which prevails in all the fields of socialist construction in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The leader, party and people form a harmonious whole in the DPRK. It is noble morality and ethics in the society to think of the interests of comrades and the collective before any others despite whatever difficulties and devote oneself to the society. The Juche character and national identity are given full play in all fabrics of social life. It is a noble ideological and moral trait of the people in our era to donate even their blood and flesh to the comrades without hesitation and devote their sweat and energies to the work for the society and collective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The practical experience of the Korean revolution proves that when the army and people consolidate the single-minded unity around the headquarters of the revolution can they decisively foil the imperialists' moves against socialism in the political, economic, military, cultural and all other fields and advance the cause of socialism to victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Unjust Decision of Tokyo District Court Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tokyo, June 19 (KNS-KCNA) -- Nam Sung U, vice-chairman of the Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), issued a statement on June 19 in which he denounced the unjust decision on provisional execution made by the Tokyo District Court, not recognizing the efforts exerted by Chongryon for debt redemption to the resolution and collection corporation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has sincerely approached reconciliation negotiations with the resolution and collection corporation and done its utmost to find a solution to the issue since it confirmed the debt it was obliged to redeem in February 2003, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution and collection corporation raised a proposal which Chongryon found absolutely impossible to implement, ignoring its efforts and trust, thus making it difficult to conduct the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reason behind this was that the corporation pursued the aim of disposing of the Hall of the Central Headquarters of Chongryon itself in stead of collecting bonds, its original duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such extremely abnormal situation under which the issue of bonds redemption has been politically motivated and the above-said corporation is set to dispose of the hall is a product of the Abe regime's hostile policy toward Chongryon and chauvinism toward Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prime Minister Abe himself is repeating remarks branding Chongryon as a \"criminal organization\" for no reason. It is against this backdrop that Japan is using the corporation's issue of bonds redemption for noisy propaganda against the DPRK and Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement strongly demanded the Japanese authorities stop at once the unreasonable politically-motivated suppression of Chongryon and action of criminalizing its legitimate activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "EE.UU. quiere derrocar a Siria, revela Rodong Sinmun\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 21 de junio (ATCC) -- En estos tiempos, se torna muy tensa la situacion de Libano por el enfrentamiento entre el ejercito gubernamental y las fuerzas armadas extremistas de Palestina. Al respecto, la banda de Bush inculpa a Siria de apoyar a las segundas, que en su opinion, estan vinculadas con \"Al Qaeda\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A traves de un comentario individual, el diario Rodong Sinmun revela este jueves que la reciente campana de presion a Siria, lanzada por Estados Unidos pretextando la situacion de Libano, tiene por su objetivo acorralar a la primera en la arena internacional al hacer creer que es un \"Estado que apoya al terrorismo\" y derrocar luego su regimen estatal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Desde hace mucho tiempo, el imperio maniobro desesperadamente para derrumbar a ese pais antiimperialista e independiente considerandolo como una piedra en su zapato, recuerda el comentarista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Agrega que aprovechando esta oportunidad, EE.UU. quiere separar completamente a Libano de las influencias de Siria al debilitar en todo lo posible las fuerzas partidarias de esta y aplacar a las fuerzas internacionales simpatizantes de la misma al vincularla a toda costa con el \"terrorismo\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La opinion publica alarma que el empeoramiento de la situacion de Libano y la consiguiente campana anti-Siria de EE.UU. son la senal de una nueva guerra en esta region, indica el rotativo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por eso, los paises arabes, en particular, Siria, redoblan su vigilancia ante tales recrudescentes maniobras gringas contra este ultimo pais, subraya Rodong Sinmun y concluye que EE.UU. nunca podra justificar sus maniobras contra Siria ni liberarse de su responsabilidad por la critica situacion de Libano.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
