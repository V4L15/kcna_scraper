It was, at the same time, an unforgettable year in which the army and people of the DPRK displayed the noble sense of moral obligation and the great traits of single-minded unity at the highest level by deeply mourning the death of leader Kim Jong Il and missing him very much after his untimely and sorrowful demise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Yong Rim went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the gross industrial output value grew 2 percent and the electricity produced at hydraulic power stations, iron ore, electrolytic zinc, power generators, fertilizers, magnesia clinker, etc. showed a remarkable growth over the previous year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The modern Taedonggang Combined Fruit Processing Factory was built and lots of foodstuff factories, textile mills and daily necessities factories were technologically updated and the modernization of local industrial factories was pushed forward in provinces, cities and counties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second-phase Kwaksan Tideland Project was completed and many projects for irrigation set-ups were carried out and modern stock-breeding and fruit production bases technologically updated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of the Huichon Power Station was completed in a matter of three years and a lot of power station projects were wound up. Key coal mines were adjusted and reinforced to consolidate the country's fuel and power bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the metal industrial field, the Juche iron production system was further improved and the technological updating of major production processes at iron and steel works made brisk headway. Nonferrous metal production bases including Tanchon area was modernized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Raw materials bases for light industry were adjusted and reinforced. The Hungnam Fertilizer Complex, the February 8 Vinalon Complex and the Namhung Youth Chemical Complex were technologically updated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The modernization of key factories in the fields of machine-building and electronic industries was pushed forward. The fuel pump branch plant of the Huichon Precision Machine Plant was updated at a cutting-edge level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Theatre, high-rise apartment buildings and other edifices have been constructed in the Mansudae area in Pyongyang. Amazing streets and villages suitable for features of socialism have appeared in different parts of the country and Tanchon Port was successfully built.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year the Cabinet will concentrate all efforts on light industry and agriculture and lay a solid foundation for building an economic power in warm response to the flames of industrial revolution in the new century and the flames kindled in South Hamgyong Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most important target of the struggle set by the WPK for this year to bring about a signal improvement in the people's standard of living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The light industrial field should operate the light industrial factories, local industrial factories and daily necessities production bases at full capacity and increase the production of varieties of quality consumer goods which are liked by the people and cater to their tastes and supply them to the people, while directing utmost efforts to making modern light industrial bases pay off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the agricultural field, the per hectare grain yield should be remarkably raised on all farms as required by the WPK's policy on bringing about a drastic boost in agricultural production and as required by the Juche-farming methods and a cyclic production system be established to boost production at modern stock-breeding bases and fruit production bases so as to make the people benefit from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the chemical industrial field, the production should be kept going at a high rate at the factories and enterprises which had been technologically updated in recent years to ensure a satisfactory supply of chemical fertilizers and agricultural chemicals. The production of chemical fiber and synthetic resin should be raised to drastically increase the proportion of locally available raw materials for light industry, and production be boosted at factories and enterprises in Tanchon area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The production of electricity, coal and iron and steel should be increased to the maximum and the strain on railway transport be eased. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While making primary efforts for construction related to the people's living, the major construction projects and the work to turn Pyongyang into world-class city and build provincial seats and other cities in a peculiar way should be stepped up in a planned way. At the same time, the work for protecting land and preserving environment and the city management should be significantly improved to face-lift the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Exports production bases should be built under a long-term plan and the development of economic and trade zones and joint venture and contracts be vigorously undertaken and the technological cooperation in economy with other countries be boosted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Centers for training talents and schools at all levels should be built well, educational contents and methods be improved to meet the requirements of the developing situation and the advantages of the socialist public health system be given full play in the public health field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the field of literature and arts, more revolutionary and appealing works which reflect the spirit of the times should be created. In the sports field, a hot sports wind should prevail throughout the country to put sports technique on a higher level and fully demonstrate the nation's dignity and spirit at international games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Utmost efforts shall be directed to ensuring the combat preparations of the People's Army and providing a material guarantee for the development of national defence industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called on the officials in the field of economic guidance to conduct all the work in a creative and revolutionary manner, share weal and woe with the masses in the stirring practice and work hard to meet their interests and provide the best conveniences to them."

People's Assembly, made a report on the revision and supplementation of the Socialist Constitution of the DPRK at the fifth Session of the 12th Supreme People's Assembly on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Three years have passed since leader Kim Jong Il was re-elected as chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK at the first Session of the 12th SPA and a new section dealing with the chairmanship of the NDC was added to the Socialist Constitution and it was stipulated there that the NDC chairman is the supreme leader of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last December the DPRK suffered such great loss as the passing of Kim Jong Il, the father of the nation whom the people trusted and followed as Heaven, and the Korean revolution entered into a crucial historic turning point in carrying forward and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the dear respected Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was thanks to Kim Jong Un, identical to Kim Jong Il in idea, leadership, personality and virtues that the grief-stricken army and people of the DPRK could turn their greatest sorrow of the nation into redoubled strength and courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are now faced with a scared task to hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the eternal leader of the party and revolution and glorify his revolutionary exploits for all ages under the leadership of       Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was a peerless patriot and guardian of socialist Korea who put the dignity and national power of the DPRK on the highest level, weathering stern trials under the banner of Songun. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the noble moral obligation of the party members, service personnel and people who are soldiers and disciples of Kim Jong Il to hold him in high esteem as the eternal leader of the party and revolution and glorify his revolutionary exploits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the most urgent task facing the state at present to revise and supplement the Socialist Constitution as unanimously desired by the service personnel and people throughout the country to provide a legal guarantee for glorifying the exploits Kim Jong Il performed in the nation-building for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I would like to courteously bring up the proposal for revising and supplementing the Socialist Constitution of the DPRK for discussion at the current SPA session according to Articles 91 and 95 of the Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The above-said proposal mainly revised and supplemented the preface and the part dealing with the state machinery, preserving the system of the composition, basic contents and revolutionary principles of the Socialist Constitution provided by President Kim Il Sung and developed in depth by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contents of the Socialist Constitution newly revised and supplemented are as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the preface of the Constitution codified the undying feats performed by Kim Jong Il in the nation-building.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intensively stipulated in the preface are the undying feats performed in the nation-building by Kim Il Sung, the founder of the DPRK and father of socialist Korea, and Kim Jong Il who built the DPRK into an invincible power and their distinguished personalities as the great men and reflected there are the iron faith and will of the army and people of the DPRK to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, holding Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK and Kim Jong Il as the eternal chairman of the NDC of the  DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the part dealing with the state machinery was revised and supplemented.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intention of the WPK to revise and supplement this part is to make sure that the title of the NDC chairman goes only by the august name of Kim Jong Il so that the revolutionary cause of Juche may be accomplished by holding him in high esteem as the eternal chairman of the NDC of the DPRK as he put the dignity and the national power of the DPRK on the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Proceeding from this, the proposal newly defined the post of the first chairman of the NDC of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The institution of the new post of the first chairman of the NDC is a very important issue of clarifying who is the supreme leader of the DPRK who will lead the struggle for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche and providing a legal and institutional guarantee for steadfastly ensuring the unitary leadership of the leader over the overall state affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present system of the NDC is an original and scientific one established by Kim Jong Il to increase the function of national defence to the maximum as required by the Songun era and ensure the unitary leadership of the leader over the overall state affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the proposal stipulated that the post of the first chairman of the NDC shall be instituted on the principle of inheriting 100 percent the revolutionary essence of the NDC system established by Kim Jong Il and the first chairman of the NDC shall lead the overall state affairs including internal and external affairs as the supreme leader of the state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proposal revised the title of Section 2 of Chapter 6 and Articles 91, 95 and 100-105, 107, 109, 116, 147 and 156 of the Constitution in line with the institution of the new post of first chairman of the NDC."

Popular Suprema de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, que tuvo lugar el dia 13, el diputado Choe Yong Rim, primer ministro del Consejo de Ministros, presento el informe sobre el balance del trabajo del Consejo de Ministros en el ano pasado y las tareas para el ano en curso. \n\t\t\t\t\t 2011 fue un ano de trascendencia historica en que se registraron nuevos cambios en la construccion de un Estado prospero bajo la energica guia del Dirigente Kim Jong Il sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun, comenzo el premier y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En ese ano inolvidable, perdimos tan inesperada y lamentablemente al Dirigente Kim Jong Il y nuestros militares y civiles realizaron actos de condolencias dando testimonios de la gran anoranza a nuestro fallecido lider, la noble obligacion moral y la unidad monolitica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ano pasado, se ha aumentado a 102 por ciento en comparacion con el ano 2010 el producto bruto industrial y crecio considerablemente la produccion de hidroelectricidad, minerales de hierro, zinc electrolitico, generadores, abonos, clinker de magnesia, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se construyo el Combinado de Procesamiento de Frutas Taedonggang y se llevo a cabo la modernizacion tecnologica de muchas fabricas de alimentos, las textiles y las de articulos de uso diario y de las fabricas de industria local de las provincias, ciudades y distritos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Quedaron terminadas la roturacion de segunda etapa de las marismas Kwaksan, la obra de numerosos establecimientos de riego y la modernizacion de las bases ganaderas y fruticolas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La Central Hidroelectrica de Huichon fue inaugurada a los 3 anos desde el inicio de la construccion, ademas de otras plantas hidroelectricas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se realizaron el ordenamiento y el reforzamiento de importantes minas de carbon, gracias a lo cual se ampliaron las bases productivas de combustibles y energias del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la rama de industria metalurgica, perfeccionaron el sistema de produccion del Hierro Juche, impulsaron la renovacion tecnica de los importantes procesos productivos de las fundiciones de hierro y acerias y modernizaron las bases de produccion de metales no ferrosos como las de la zona de Tanchon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se realizo la renovacion tecnica en el Complejo de Abonos de Hungnam, el Complejo de Vinalon 8 de Febrero y el Complejo Quimico Juventud de Namhung, de modo que se afianzaran las bases de suministro de materias primas de la industria ligera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se ha reconstruido en el nivel sofisticado la fabrica filial de bombas de combustible de la Fabrica de Maquinas de Precision de Huichon e impulsado energicamente la modernizacion de las importantes fabricas de industrias mecanica y electronica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la zona de Mansudae de esta capital, se levantaron el Teatro del Pueblo, los rascacielos y otras creaciones monumentales, aparecieron por doquier del pais las avenidas y aldeas convertidas en un paraiso socialista y termino con exito la obra del Puerto de Tanchon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Este ano, el Consejo de Ministros se concentrara en la industria ligera y la agricultura y asentara la firme base de potencia economica avivando las llamas de la revolucion industrial del nuevo siglo, las de Hamnam (provincia de Hamgyong del Sur).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Registrar los acontecimientos relevantes en el mejoramiento de la vida del pueblo es la mas importante meta del Partido del Trabajo de Corea para este ano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la rama de industria ligera, se debe prestar mayor atencion a la operacion eficiente de las modernas bases de industria ligera y poner en pleno funcionamiento las otras y las de industria local y las bases de produccion de articulos de primera necesidad para que produzcan mucho mas productos de consumo, que convengan al gusto del pueblo y tengan la aceptacion popular, y los suministren a los habitantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La rama de agricultura debe elevar el rendimiento por hectarea de cereales de acuerdo con los metodos de cultivo jucheanos y la orientacion del partido de producir una revolucion en la agricultura y aumentar la produccion en las modernas bases ganaderas y las fruticolas mediante el establecimiento del sistema de produccion circular para que los habitantes se beneficien realmente de ellas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el sector de industria quimica deben producir y suministrar suficientemente los abonos quimicos y productos agroquimicos mediante la normalizacion en alto nivel de la produccion en las fabricas y empresas reconstruidas en los ultimos anos, elevar decisivamente el porcentaje de materias primas nacionales aumentando la produccion de fibras quimicas y resinas sinteticas e incrementar la produccion de las fabricas y empresas de la zona de Tanchon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hay que aumentar al maximo la produccion de la electricidad, el carbon y los materiales de hierro y acero y resolver el problema de congestion del transporte ferroviario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se debe prestar la atencion primordial a la construccion para mejorar las condiciones de vida del pueblo y promover de manera planificada las labores para acondicionar Pyongyang como una ciudad de talla mundial y construir originalmente las otras ciudades incluso las capitales provinciales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al mismo tiempo, es preciso mejorar decisivamente la proteccion territorial y medioambiental y el urbanismo para renovar la fisonomia del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Resulta imperioso acondicionar con vistas al futuro las bases de produccion de articulos de exportacion, activar el desarrollo de las zonas economicas y comerciales y aumentar el numero de empresas asociadas y mixtas y fomentar la cooperacion economica y tecnica con otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se debe acondicionar bien los planteles docentes de formacion de cerebros y las escuelas a todos niveles, mejorar el contenido y los metodos de educacion y poner de pleno manifiesto la superioridad del sistema de salud publica socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En el campo de literatura y arte, deben crear mucho mas obras de caracter revolucionario que reflejen el espiritu de la epoca actual, y en el dominio deportivo, deben levantar la oleada deportiva en todo el pais para elevar el nivel tecnico de la rama y exaltar en las competencias internacionales la dignidad y el impetu de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se dara prioridad al fortalecimiento de la combatividad del ejercito popular y al suministro de materiales necesarios al desarrollo de la industria de defensa nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los funcionarios dirigentes de la economia deben realizar todos los trabajos de manera creativa y revolucionaria, compartir en los mismos centros de trabajo las buenas y las malas con las masas trabajadoras y laborar infatigablemente por asegurarles al maximo sus intereses y confort."
