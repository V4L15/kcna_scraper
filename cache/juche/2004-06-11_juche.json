He urged all the servicepersons to glorify the days of their worthwhile military service with feats to become heroes of the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He acquainted himself with how \"day for soldiers\" is observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the \"day for soldiers\" briskly observed at all units is displaying ever-growing vitality, he added this noble trait can be found only in the People's Army in which superiors and inferiors are united close on the basis of kindred feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave servicepersons of the unit an automatic rifle as a gift and had a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
