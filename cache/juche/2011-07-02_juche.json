They are taking part in the fourth second-term contest of art group members of the military families.\n\t\t\t\t\t Colorful numbers included narrative and song \"Our Unforgettable Leader\", chorus \"We Are the Happiest in the World\", monodrama \"Wishes\", agitation poetic drama \"We Are in Stand-off\" and chorus \"Glory to Our Great Party\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The performers sang highly of their worthwhile life full of pride, self-esteem, optimism and joy as women revolutionaries, staunch supporters of the party's Songun leadership. They also strikingly demonstrated the iron faith and will and the indomitable spirit of the military families to devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche in the same trench with their husbands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The performance given by the second buglers of the Songun era was highly acclaimed by the audience as it would harden the army and people's spirit to devotedly defend the leader and the country and their towering hatred against confrontational maniacs as well as their pledge to take thousand-fold revenge against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the performance General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK Kim Jong Il warmly acknowledged the cheering performers and audience and congratulated the performers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the art group members of the military families gave the performance which not only truthfully reflected their worthwhile life but is perfect in ideological and artistic values giving answers to important problems arising in the struggle and life of the people in the Songun era. He extended his special thanks to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The performance given by the art group members of military families of KPA Units 963 and 10215 sensibly reflected the WPK's policies to give good answers to important socio-political problems in the present times, he said, proposing to award a special prize.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Monodrama \"Wishes\" and all other numbers given by art group members of the military families of KPA Unit 963 touched the heartstrings of the audience and gave deep impression as the creators and the art group members conducted their creating activities while breathing the same air with the times and finding themselves among the stirring life, he said. He highly appreciated playwright Kim Kwon Il and art group member Paek Ryon Hui for their special merits in the creation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Admirable indeed are the spiritual world and fighting and living traits of the military families living in a militant way full of confidence and optimism about the future, he said, calling on the society to learn from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contest clearly manifested once again the validity and vitality of the WPK's literature and art policy on popularizing the arts and the advantage of the new culture created in the Songun era, he said, setting forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines in conducting more dynamic popular cultural and performing activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the performance together with him were leading officials of the party and the armed forces including Kim Jong Un, Ri Yong Ho, Kim Ki Nam, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Gak, U Tong Chuk, Kim Chang Sop and Ri Myong Su, Members of the Central Military Commission of the WPK Kim Kyong Ok, Kim Won Hong, Kim Yong Chol and Yun Jong Rin, and Department Director of the NDC Hyon Chol Hae."

Nevertheless, the puppet forces are keen to build international tourist resorts there. It is needless to say that through these projects they seek to conceal their preparations for a war with a guise of tourism and get the \"northern limit line\" and their dominium over the waters off the five islands publicly recognized. Also lurking behind their projects is a sinister aim to bring tourists there to use them as \"human shields\" in a bid to escape the Korean People's Army's retaliation against their military provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There remains only such physical settlement as exchange of fire between the north and the south due to the group of traitors' hideous provocations.
