            "content": "U.S. Cold War way of thinking and action slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency on Wednesday released a commentary entitled \"Cold War way of thinking and action will bring U.S. to nowhere.\"\r\n The commentary said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement to revive the Cold War contrary to the requirements of the times and history is being intensified in the United States where an ill-omened outburst declaring the Cold War between the east and the west was officially made for the first time in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves are motivated by the noteworthy set-up of the Bush administration that emerged after the advent of the new century, and its belligerent foreign policy plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush was reported to have referred to this plan at a swearing-in ceremony as the 43rd U.S. President as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enemy of freedom, the enemy of the U.S., should never be mistaken. We will continue to engage the world because this is required by history and that is our option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that the U.S. will continue to pursue as in the past the policy of high-handedly interfering in internal affairs of all other countries and putting pressure upon them for its hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first proposal made by the hawkish group of the Cold War-minded Bush administration to put into practice the plan calls for a hardline policy intended to isolate and stifle anti-imperialist independent countries, especially the DPRK which does not allow any U.S. highhanded practice and intervention but defends its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What further irritated the U.S. hardliners was the publication of the historic north-south joint declaration on the Korean peninsula and the subsequent positive developments there favorable for the independent reunification of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They consider the Korean peninsula as a strategic vantage point in the Asia-Pacific region for which they have given eye-teeth in a bid to expand the sphere of the U.S. political and military influence because of its huge economic potentials and geopolitical importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants peace and stability of the world, it should unconditionally pull its troops out of South Korea. This is a prerequisite to the reunification of the Korean peninsula, peace and stability and sustained economic development in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground for the U.S. to refuse to do so now that the Cold War ended and the historic phase has been brought about for peace and reunification on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the hawkish group of the Bush administration is trying to derail the peace process and aggravate the situation on the Korean peninsula in a bid to invent a new pretext for the permanent U.S. military occupation and domination over South Korea and trigger off a war on the peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the main purpose of the U.S. hardliners to resume the Cold War while spreading the rumour about \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their another aim is to establish the \"National Missile Defence\" system at any cost and thus render other nations' nuclear and missile deterrent defunct, realize the U.S. strategy for world supremacy and bring huge profits to its munition monopolies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's moves to establish \"NMD\" are aimed to restart the Cold War by sparking a new global arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is needless to say that given the present stockpiling of nuclear and strategic weapons in the world, such moves of the U.S. will upset the world military strategic balance and stability and push other nations vitally interested in it to a large-scale arms race worldwide. \r\n The demise of the Cold War deprived the U.S. of any justification to designate nuclear weapons states as strategic enemies or objects posing \"threat.\"  So, it is citing the DPRK as a state posing \"a threat\" in a bid to sow seeds of distrust and dissension among nations and thus meet its strategic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is still vociferating about \"tough counteraction\" to stifle a sovereign state, pursuant to the \"strong-arm policy,\" the outdated policy of the Cold War.   This, however, will not work on anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not indebted to the U.S. nor it is a country which will yield to the U.S. arrogant demand based on \"strength\" and give up its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are ready for either war or dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration is well advised to realize, though belatedly, that it will be the only and right choice for the global peace and for the U.S. itself to renounce the Cold War way of thinking and action and make a switchover in its hostile policy towards the DPRK in keeping with the demand of the new century.    \r\n\r\n"
