But Japan, under the pressure of the united states, broke its promise to sell them to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the DPRK decided to build its indigenous furnaces and finally succeeded in completing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years it also successfully built even a satellite with its indigenous technology and launched it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience of the DPRK proves that any country having its native cadres is quite capable of frustrating imperialists' policy of blockade and successfully building a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that training native cadres is an urgent task whose fulfilment brooks not a moment's delay and a worthwhile work to glorify the dignity and honor of the nation, the article refers to the tasks to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end it is important for the non-aligned and other developing countries to establish an integral system of training native cadres and train able cadres in the fields of politics, economy, military affairs, etc. and improve the content of education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary for them to help and teach each other, swapping their successes and experience and exchanging visits of native technical personnel.    \r\n\r\n"
