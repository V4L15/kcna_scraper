            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Slams U.S. CIA Director's Remarks\r\nPyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) gave the following answer to question put by KCNA on July 25, over the fact that the director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) dared to talk about \"removal of the supreme leadership\" of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 20, the U.S. CIA Director Pompeo mentioned impertinently, at a security forum hosted by a civilian organization, about the \"removal of the supreme leadership\" of the DPRK, saying that what is most dangerous about the north Korean nuclear issue is the character who holds the control over the nuclear weapons and that the intelligence community and the Department of Defense are figuring out the way to separate the weapons from someone who might well have intent to use them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although his reckless remarks are just balderdash of a guy who has become so angrily desperate due to the ever-increasing nuclear strike capability of the DPRK, they have gone over the line, and it has now become clear that the ultimate aim of the Trump administration's hostile policy towards the DPRK is the \"regime change\" in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That the person who is supposed to be in charge of all foreign intelligence in the U.S., harbors an illusion that it could separate our army and people from our supreme leadership is an expression of his illiteracy about the DPRK and an explicit illustration of incompetence of the U.S. intelligence community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive U.S. administrations could not but fail in the DPRK-U.S. confrontation. That is also attributable to the \"merits\" of such stupid intelligence community of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our army and people have never thought about their destiny and future separated from their supreme leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first and foremost mission of our revolutionary armed forces with the nuclear force as their backbone is to defend the leader at the cost of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK legally stipulates that if the supreme dignity of the DPRK is threatened, it must preemptively annihilate those countries and entities that are directly or indirectly involved in it, by mobilizing all kinds of strike means including the nuclear ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will find out and smash all those who intend to do something against our supreme leadership, wherever they are. This is an immutable and indomitable will of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We once again felt deep in our hearts from the reckless remarks of the CIA director how just it was that we have achieved the great historic cause of completing the nuclear force by overcoming all difficulties and trials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. dare to show even the slightest sign of attempt to remove our supreme leadership, we will strike a merciless blow at the heart of the U.S. with our powerful nuclear hammer, honed and hardened over time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The likes of Pompeo will bitterly experience the catastrophic and miserable consequences caused by having dared to shake their little fists at the supreme leadership, our eternal sun and everything of life for our nation."

It was one of those ships which the U.S. imperialists mobilized for the \"Hungnam withdrawal operation\" when they were put to rout as the People's Army made re-advance during the last Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces plan to bring the heap of scrap iron, on the verge of being disposed of as scrapped material in the U.S., to Koje Island, calling it \"symbol of south Korea-U.S. alliance\", and are now trumpeting about building a memorial park meant to \"remind the visitors of the miracle of Hungnam withdrawal and meaning of peace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Blasting off the ship would not be enough to give vent to the wrath and grudge born by the Korean nation. Yet, the senseless traitors without an iota of blood and soul of the nation are going to buy it at the expense of billions of won and incite submission to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such act of serving the U.S., which imposed untold holocaust and disaster on the Korean nation, as \"benefactor\" is an intolerable insult and mockery of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the \"Hungnam withdrawal operation\", it was recorded as the one in which the U.S. troops took to flight after leaving not only their combat and technical hardware but also their fellows who became terribly frozen after sustaining the bitterest defeat in its history of wars of aggression by the Lake Jangjin at the end of 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The GIs appeased thousands of DPRK citizens into boarding the ship, because they needed \"human shields\" for saving their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists were never \"savior\" nor \"apostle of peace\" in view of the heinous murderous crimes they committed in the southern half of Korea during the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peaceable citizens were mercilessly massacred at the order of firing into all evacuees, all those in white clothes. The U.S. imperialists killed 147,000 people in Seoul only from September 1950 to February 1951 just before retreat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who were massacred in south Korea during the war number more than 1.24 million.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A French paper commented that \"biggest monstrous act in the 20th century was committed in Korea by GIs\", over the fact that the U.S. imperialist ogres skinned heads of patriots and kept them as \"souvenirs\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean pro-U.S. stooges eulogize the monsters with such rhetoric as \"noble sacrifice\" and \"supreme humanitarian operation\" and even plan to bring the ship stained with blood of the Korean nation and educate south Koreans in sycophancy and submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the shame on the nation that the puppet forces are beautifying the gangsters as \"saviors\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop the treacherous act at once, clearly understanding that they will be cursed and censured as traitors to the nation generation after generation, should they introduce the ship."

Para colmo, tratan de impartir la educacion en la sumision a grandes potencias introduciendo hasta el carguero norteamericano manchado de la sangre de coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben cancelar su plan de traer el barco \"Rein Victory\" al darse cuenta de que si hacen eso, seran estigmatizadas por toda la nacion y las generaciones venideras como vendepatrias de peor calana."
