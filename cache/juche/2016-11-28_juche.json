He went round various places of the palace including the room for math group, the room for automobile group, gymnasium, the room for narration group, the room for mass political activities, the room for IT group, the room for fine art group, the room for national musical instrument group and theatre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching with smile on his face schoolchildren's various hobby group activities, he praised them for being good at tractor practice and editing multi-media, successfully playing various musical instruments, singing and drawing well and playing with balls well, he told them to work hard so as to become competent builders of socialist Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Party's duty and mission to realize the noble intention of the great leaders who said that there is nothing to spare for children, he told the officials to spruce up the palace in such a manner as to be the one to be proud of before the world. He showed for the palace such profound care to go down in history and gave important instructions which would serve as guidelines for managing and operating the palace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When members of each hobby group vied with each other to run into his arms, shouting with emotion \"Fatherly Marshal! We have longed to see you,\" he kindly responded to them by saying \"I have come to you as I wished to see you so much.\" Then he took them in his arms and had a photo taken with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that there may be some schoolchildren and teaching staff who might feel regretful for missing the happy event of photographing, he spared precious time to wait till all officials, teachers and members of the hobby groups have gathered. Then he had a photo session with all of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also visited the Camp for Visitors to the Samjiyon Revolutionary Battle Sites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to the history of the camp.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that historic relics and mementoes on display alone clearly tell what deep attention the great leaders paid to helping officials, party members and other working people deeply grasp the revolutionary traditions of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round various places such as the camping houses for university students and members of the Children Union to learn in detail about the reconstruction and operation of the camp.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Calling upon the officials and employees of the camp to creditably fulfill their mission and thus make a positive contribution to helping the visitors know well about the history of the resistance struggle waged by Kim Il Sung despite all sorts of hardships and deeply grasp the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu, eternal foundation of the WPK, he promised to make sure that the Party would directly provide means necessary for educating visitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the skiers of the Sajabong Sports Team in training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is good to make the school youth and children ski a lot in the snowy areas such as Ryanggang Province, he said, adding that skiing is a very good exercise for physical training and redoubling courage and bravery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks for turning Samjiyon County into a grand open-air museum for educating people in the revolutionary traditions, exemplary unit in potato farming and an icon which fully realized the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture and indicated specific ways for carrying out them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him was Choe Ryong Hae, member of the Presidium of the Political Bureau of the C.C., the WPK, vice-chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and vice-chairman of the C.C., the WPK, and Kim Yong Su, department director of the C.C., the WPK."
