            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Works Greatly Instrumental in Developing Youth Movement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- It is more than a decade since leader Kim Jong Il sent a historic letter \"Young Men and Women, Be the Vanguard Unfailingly Loyal to the Party and the Leader\" to the young people throughout the country and the officials of the youth league on the occasion of the first Youth Day, August 26, Juche 80 (1991).\r\n The work underscores the importance and significance of instituting Youth Day and reviews a glorious path covered by the Korean youth movement. It clarifies tasks and ways for educating the youth as reliable successors to the revolutionary cause of Juche on the basis of the brilliant tradition of the Juche-oriented youth movement established by President Kim Il Sung. The work has served as important guidelines and an immortal banner for the development of the movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever since he began leading the revolution and construction, Kim Jong Il has authored a lot of works related to the youth movement such as \"On Improving the Work of the Youth League to Meet the Requirements of the Developing Situation\", \"Let Us Cultivate the Revolutionary Spirit of Paektu among the Rising Generation\" and \"Let Us Equip the Young People With the Spirit of Uninterrupted Revolution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The works deal with the character and duty of the league, the issues of arming the youth with the revolutionary spirit of Mt.Paektu, intensifying the education in the revolutionary traditions among them and helping them perform their role as vanguard and shock brigade on all fronts of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are work \"The Present Times and the Tasks Facing Young People\" calling on the youth to explore the path to be followed by the times, achieve social progress and struggle for accomplishing the cause of independence against imperialism and other works entitled \"Let Us Prepare the Young People Thoroughly as Reliable Successors to the Revolutionary Cause of Juche\", \"Let Us Develop Our Youth Movement to a New, Higher Level\" and \"On Channeling Efforts into Work with Youth\" published under the tragic situation where socialism collapsed in various countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days of the \"Arduous March\", forced march Kim Jong Il indicated the direction and ways of leading the youth to play a frontranker's role in defending and glorifying the socialist cause and granted the youth league the honor of going with the august name of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's famous works \"On Mission and Tasks of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League\" and \"Let Us Exalt the Brilliance of Comrade Kim Il Sung's Idea on the Youth Movement and the Achievements Made under His Leadership\" clearly reflect the noble intention of the leader to steadily strengthen and develop the youth league as the youth organization of the President.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

It is their calculation that they can seize strategic vantage points on the margins of the Euro-Asian continent ranging from Northeast Asia to Central Asia, Mid-east and Western Europe and bring China and Russia inside the sphere of its complete military siege if they stifle the DPRK by force and put the whole of Korea under their control. This is the reason why the U.S. is tapping all its military potentials to escalate its war moves to seize the DPRK with increased frenzy. \r\n In case a war breaks out in Korea the U.S. bellicose forces intend to wage a blitz warfare by a preemptive nuclear attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed dialogue and arms reduction are nothing but a trick to cover up the true nature of its policy to invade the DPRK, mislead the world public opinion and calm down mounting anti-Americanism. It does not stand for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula but seeks to stifle the DPRK by force. The dialogue much touted by it is nothing but a cry for a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has true willingness to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and ensure peace on the Korean peninsula it should pull back its aggression troops from south Korea and its vicinity and stop its reckless military actions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Castigated \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson Thursday comes out with a commentary denouncing the \"Ulji Focus Lens-04\" joint military maneuvers now under way in south Korea.\r\n Noting that the current joint war rehearsal launched by the U.S. by instigating the south Korean authorities is, to all intents and purposes, an adventurous saber-rattling to invade the north and a dangerous play with fire threatening peace and security on the Korean peninsula, the news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the United States, though loudmouthed in public about \"peace\" and \"negotiation\", in practice, seeks distrust and confrontation, not peace, and pursues the provocation of a new war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are choosing to increase the fund for their arms buildup program, while letting out a spate of words about \"cutdown and relocation\" of their forces in south Korea. They have driven up the cost of the program from the original $11 billion to $13 billion and are making uninterrupted shipment of all latest types of military hardware into south Korea. They have worked out the second Korean war scenario codenamed \"operation plan 5027-04\" and are working to put it into practice. The \"Ulji Focus Lens-04\" joint war game is no more than a preliminary war against the north, which is designed to test the effectiveness and feasibility of the operation plan through a computer-aided mock drill simulating a real war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an ill-boding military move that the Metropolitan Defense Command of the south Korean army launched the \"Hwarang\" exercise including a \"drill to cope with chemical and biological terrorism\" involving civilians, government officials and the army, timing to coincide with the start of the \"Ulji Focus Lens-04\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the wild designs of the U.S. imperialist bellicose forces to invade the north stand no change of realization.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Underlining the position and role played by the Korean youth on the three fronts, the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely the fruition of the wise guidance of leader  Kim Jong Il that the Korean youth are demonstrating their might as the most viable militant ranks in building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation  Setting forth the youth problem already long ago as a strategic issue for the victorious advance of the revolution, he has all along maintained the idea and line of attaching importance to the youth. It is the unshakable stand consistently maintained by him to carry the revolutionary cause of Juche to accomplishment with a tight hold on the youth as well as on the party and the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Notably, in the historical days of recording the sacred Songun revolution, he has combined the idea of attaching importance to the arms with that of attaching importance to the youth and wisely led the young soldiers to make a breakthrough in the revolution and construction well in the fore of the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high pride of the party and the people of the DPRK to have such trustworthy young men and women who are displaying their grand might as viable militant ranks in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The young soldiers and all other youths will rally ever closer around Kim Jong Il and glorify the honor of being the young vanguard in building a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
