            "content": "KCNA Commentary Dismisses S. Korean Authorities' Gibberish about Security\r\n Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- South Korean puppet Chief Executive Park Geun Hye and Chief of the Security Office of Chongwadae Kim Kwan Jin are becoming evermore undisguised in their provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t At a meeting of chief secretaries of Chongwadae Park instructed Kim to \"make sure that there is no security vacuum\", trumpeting about the \"threat and provocation from the north\". Echoing her words, Kim jabbered that he would \"tighten the national security\" and \"devote himself to laying a foundation for peaceful unification\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but ugly looking kiss between the anti-reunification conservative elders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, at the same time, no more than sophism let loose by the arch criminals escalating the tension on the Korean peninsula and psychopaths seized with \"security\" phobia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trumpeting about \"security\" is a trite-method employed by the puppet conservative group of south Korea to strain the situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first order made by Kim right after taking his office as puppet minister of Defense was to infuse the outlook on security into the minds of the service members.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park also uttered the word \"security\" whenever an opportunity presented itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She cried out for \"maintaining perfect security posture to cope with the north's provocation against the south as the former intensifies its propaganda offensive\" on January 18 during her foreign trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In May, too, she held an emergency meeting as regards what she called the north's shelling at which she called for \"tightening the security posture.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Under that pretext the U.S. and south Korean forces staged war drills for aggression and stepped up the arms buildup, escalating the tension on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entering this year, they staged in south Korea the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills, the largest-ever in the world, with huge U.S. nuclear war hardware and aggressor forces involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It pushed the situation to the brink of a war by staging large-scale joint landing drills aimed at \"occupying Pyongyang\" and Max Thunder, the joint air combat drills targeting the whole of the DPRK, to push the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, for whom is the \"security\" touted by the puppet regime necessary?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its \"security\" motto precisely means confrontation and a prelude to the war against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At an annual \"security\" consultative meeting the U.S. and the puppet group worked out and officially decided on the scenarios for preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK including the \"tailored deterrent strategy.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group has cooked up anti-reunification documents and scenarios for the confrontation of the social systems under the signboard of \"security\" as evidenced by the fact that it called for \"leading the north to changes\" through \"balanced promotion of security and exchange and cooperation\" in its \"second principal plan for the development of north-south relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is again under the pretext of the \"threat to security\" that the puppet group has pushed ahead with its move to extend the transfer of wartime operation control to help the U.S. occupy south Korea for an indefinite period and the construction of U.S. military bases including the Jeju naval base is pressed forward in real earnest. This is the reality of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation goes to clearly prove that it is none other than the U.S. and the puppet group that bring the danger of a nuclear war and disturb peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical and ridiculous that the puppet group is talking a lot about \"security\", citing \"provocation from the north\" and \"its threat\" though it turned south Korea into the largest nuclear outpost in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and Kim's oft-repeated \"security\" and \"unification\" are, in the final analysis, little short of an open declaration that they would stand in confrontation with the DPRK to the last and would not rule out even a war against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Security can never be achieved through confrontation and it will bring nothing but a war."

Korea Nuclear War Confab against DPRK \r\n Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- It was reported that warmongers of the U.S. and south Korea recently examined Kill Chain and \"south Korea-made ballistic missile interceptor system\" under the pretext of \"nuclear and missile threats from the north\" at their \"first high-level meeting\" for the extension of transfer of wartime operation control (OPECON).\n\t\t\t\t\t Kill Chain is a weapon system for mounting a preemptive attack on a rival when the \"sign of its attack\" is detected while \"south Korea-made ballistic missile interceptor system\" is designed to \"identify, detect and strike\" the nuclear and missiles from the north at an early stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Saturday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said action taken by them indicates that their moves to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK have gone beyond the red line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was quite natural for the DPRK to have manufactured latest military hardware for self-defence and steadily bolstered it up with much effort under the situation where the U.S. forces present in south Korea have threatened the DPRK with nuclear weapons and the south Korean puppet forces have pushed the situation to the brink of war, pursuant to their policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are making much fuss over the \"nuclear and missile threats from the north,\" shelving their crimes. This reminds one of a guilty party filing the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should they dare start a war against the DPRK, its army and people will show them what a real war is like by mobilizing all the military capabilities for self-defence built for the past several decades under the banner of Songun. This is their unshakable will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies are doomed to be forlorn wandering spirits if they persist in their moves to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK, warns the commentary."
