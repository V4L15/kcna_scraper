            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Blasts UNSC's Press Statement Critical of Its Launch of Short-range Missiles\r\nPyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- The UN Security Council at its informal consultative meeting held on July 17 staged a farce of publishing a press statement terming the DPRK's launch of even short-range missiles a \"violation of its resolutions.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t The Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a statement on Saturday said all the military measures taken by the Korean People's Army including tactical rocket firing are an exercise of the right to self-defence to protect the sovereignty of the country and the security of the nation from the U.S. nuclear threats and moves for aggression from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year the DPRK made a series of positive peace proposals ranging from the crucial proposal of its National Defence Commission and its special proposal to the statement of its government and has taken practical measures pursuant to them, the statement noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, staged Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises in succession together with the south Korean puppet forces and kicked off the largest-ever combined aerial drill in the wake of the large-scale joint landing exercises since 1993.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC persistently overlooked the U.S. madcap war maneuvers for aggression and nuclear threat and took issue with the inevitable option taken by the DPRK to cope with them and censured it. This is absolutely intolerable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the UNSC is to perform its mission for ensuring global peace and security, it should call into question the offensive, threatening and provocative joint military exercises of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How the UNSC approaches the said exercises will be a yardstick to assess its impartiality and judge whether it can contribute to global peace and security both in name and in reality or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the UNSC serves the purpose of the U.S. hostile moves against the DPRK, bereft of its impartiality, the DPRK is left with no option but to bolster up its muscle to protect itself by its own efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how fair-minded and just one may be, one is bound to fall victim to big powers if one is weak, and it is possible to protect  genuine peace only when one builds its muscle strong enough to deter any force from provoking one. This is the lesson and truth taught by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The further the U.S. escalates its nuclear threat and blackmail, the greater efforts the DPRK will channel into bolstering up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence. As long as the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces persist in their joint military exercises for aggression, the DPRK's counter-actions will be put on an annual and regular basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any conflict which may take place in the course of the Korean People's Army's tactical rocket firing and other intensified retaliatory drills to cope with the U.S ceaseless war maneuvers in south Korea and its vicinity may spill over to a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case an unpredictable situation is created on the Korean peninsula, the U.S. and the UNSC which instigated and patronized it will be wholly responsible for the development as it compelled the DPRK to take such inevitable option."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Slammed for Scuttling North-South Working-level Talks\r\nPyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- The head of the north side's delegation to the north-south working-level talks for discussing the participation of the DPRK's players group and cheerleading squad in the 17th Asian Games issued a statement on Saturday in connection with the fact that the talks which opened at Panmunjom on July 17 broke down due to the base moves of the south Korean authorities.   The statement accused the south side of resorting to a shameless smear campaign by falsifying facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t The head of the delegation expressed indignation at the south Korean authorities who are misleading public opinion in a bid to evade the blame for bringing the talks to a rupture and once again made a detailed account of the whole course of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to him, the morning talks took place in a very amicable atmosphere due to the cooperative attitude of both sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north side tried to enter the venue of the talks as they were scheduled to resume at 2:00 p.m. but the south side asked it to wait for a moment as it did not receive an instruction from Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, the afternoon talks resumed 2 hours and 15 minutes later. Delegates to the south side looked so flushed that they were beyond imagination. No sooner had they sat down, without saying sorry for making their counterpart wait for such a long time, than all of them including the chief delegate vied with each other to take issue with the proposal of the north side for no reason, talking about \"international practice\" and \"rules of games\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Overturning what they had said in the morning, the south side took issue with all contents of the proposal and behaved in a provocative manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side hurled unbearable mud at the north side, talking about paying one's own expenses, after raising the issue of expenses which the north side has never mentioned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north side called the south side to account for its wrong attitude and urged it to sincerely approach the discussion of the issue while explaining again the proposal of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south side turned the venue of the talks into a scene of argument as its members vied with each other to shout hoarse. No one could recognize who was the chief delegate and delegate, an attempt to let Chongwadae hear what was going on there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it hard to continue the talks, the north side strongly denounced the south side for its behavior to scuttle them and repeatedly and sternly warned of its reckless behavior. But the delegates of the south side became more provocative, bereft of any etiquette.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the long run, the afternoon talks were suspended in less than half an hour, without taking up the issue. The talks thus broke down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The head of the north side's delegation went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All what happened makes it clear that after the morning talks the delegates of the south side received an instruction from Chongwadae that they should stick to their position, not responding to the proposal of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working-level talks fully revealed that \"confidence\" and the like touted by the south Korean authorities are nothing but sheer lies and they have no iota of idea of having dialogue and improving the relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole course of the talks proved that the south Korean authorities are not pleased with the participation of the DPRK's players group and cheerleading squad in the Asian Games and are working hard to prevent the DPRK from taking part in the games by insulting it and getting on  the nerves of it at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side talked about \"international practice\" and the like but it is none other than the south Korean authorities who violated the international practice and rules.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Are there international practice and rules of games restricting the scope of players group and cheerleading squad. Do they bar any country's players from holding their national flags as they please and define the size of national flags?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If international practice is followed, it is enough for the DPRK to notify the south side of the intention of its players group to participate in the games as other countries do and there is no need for the north and the south to sit together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side is trying to shift the blame for the scuttled talks onto the DPRK while insulting it after raising the issue of expenses which it has never mentioned. This fully revealed the disposition of a mean dealer who knows only money and counts everything with money and vulgarity of depraved guys and traitors who count the noble spirit of national concord and even the inviolable sports and cultural activities with the help of an abacus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities can never evade the blame for deliberately bringing the talks to a breakdown. They should discard narrow-minded prejudice toward fellow countrymen and the old way of thinking and conception in the era of confrontation and behave in line with the people's mindset, the aspiration of the nation and the trend of the times, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the DPRK's players group and cheerleading squad will take part in the 17th Asian Games in the future or not entirely depends on the attitude of the south Korean authorities as already declared by it."

El imperio es el provocador y fautor que amenaza la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito de la RPDC realiza normalmente el entrenamiento de lanzamiento de cohete para hacer frente a la permanente amenaza de agresion de EE.UU., lo que es una medida autodefensiva tan justa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRechazar tajantemente a la banda agresora es inconmovible voluntad del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa paz de la Peninsula Coreana es garantizada por el fidedigno poderio militar de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. con sus peligrosos ejercicios de guerra de agresion a la RPDC, exacerba la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana e impide la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas.
