            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Start of Work at C.C., WPK Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture Monday to mark the 43rd anniversary of Kim Jong Il's start of work at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's guidance over the Workers' Party of Korea provided a sure guarantee for carrying forward and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. And this made it possible for the WPK to bring about great changes and progress in the revolution and construction while making a new history of revolutionary party building in the era of independence under the care of the great leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is a great leader of revolution as he has developed the WPK into a powerful guiding political organization for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche, making a new history of building a revolutionary party in the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He advanced the original idea on party building and wisely led the work to carry it into reality. As a result, the WPK brought about a decisive turn in the work of establishing its monolithic ideological system and could enter the historic phase of development in which the leader's cause of party building is being accelerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole course of his leadership over the WPK is an immortal course in which the glorious history and tradition of the Korean revolution pioneered with arms have been reliably inherited and the WPK has been strengthened into a powerful guiding force of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 40 odd years of his leadership over the party are a history of creation and changes during which he has led the cause of revolution, the socialist cause of the WPK, to victory, opening up a new era of signal changes and heroic feats in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary armed forces have grown to be an invincible Paektusan revolutionary army, steadfast in ideology and faith and fully prepared in aspect of military technique, in the course of gigantic struggle to realize the WPK's cause of the Songun revolution in an overall way. And the DPRK has been turned into a military power that reliably defends the sovereignty and interests of the nation with self-reliant defense might capable of defeating any formidable imperialist enemy at one stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his experienced and tested leadership over the Songun revolution, the WPK is bringing about a new epochal phase in the cause of national reunification, with the responsibility for the destiny and future of the country and the nation. It is also arousing the international support and solidarity with the Korean revolution while further raising the external dignity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were senior party, army and state officials, chairpersons of friendly parties, officials of party, armed forces and power bodies, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons, officials of scientific, educational, cultural and art, public health and media organs and organs at all levels in the city of Pyongyang, labor innovators and working people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a dangerous military move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the U.S. warlike forces have a dangerous intention to accelerate the modernization of missiles in a bid to bring other countries under its military control and mount preemptive missile attacks on them when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to accelerate modernization of missiles and build the MD in Eastern Europe and East Asia in a bid to militarily contain big powers including China and hold military supremacy in these regions and, furthermore, realize its wild ambition to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While pushing ahead with its moves to establish MD in Eastern European countries and, at the same time, developing and modernizing different types of missiles, the U.S. seeks to plug even Australia into it as it drew Japan into it in the Asia-Pacific region. This is a dangerous move to spark a new arms race and escalate the military tension in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its moves to build a U.S.-led unipolar world. The U.S. moves to update missiles and establish MD are an important link in the chains of the efforts to realize its dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. is chiefly to blame for disturbing world peace and stability and accelerating arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It would be well advised to give up its reckless design to maintain military supremacy and mount preemptive missile attacks on other countries, urges the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But thanks to the Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea it is demonstrating its dignity as a nation with tremendous military power which no foreign enemy on earth dare provoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the Songun politics has been proved by the struggle for national reunification and prosperity common to the nation, a struggle to establish national sovereignty throughout Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This great Songun politics of the WPK ushered in the June 15 era of reunification, putting an end to the history of confrontation between the north and the south that has lasted for over half a century and bringing all the Koreans with hope for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Protected by the Songun politics which has foiled the outside forces' moves for aggression and war and guaranteed the peace and security of the country, the Koreans have dynamically advanced, proudly creating a new history of the movement for independent reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics of the WPK is the most patriotic and greatest politics in the world as it helps firmly protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and glorify them and successfully pave the way for the reunification and prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of Songun held aloft by the WPK will as ever fully demonstrate its great vitality as an all-powerful treasured sword for carving out the destiny of the nation, the banner of victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
