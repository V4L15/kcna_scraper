The U.S. imperialists' introduction of over 10 F-117 Stealth bombers to south Korea and their development of missiles capable of underground penetration are aimed at starting a new war on the Korean peninsula. It is as clear as noonday that the outbreak of another war in Korea would cause such massacre of civilians as what happened in Rogun-ri and Phohang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will launch a nationwide struggle against the U.S. to force it to pay for the blood shed by the innocent Koreans thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should apologize to the Korean nation for the monstrous crimes committed so far and immediately withdraw their forces from south Korea as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Mun Ik Hwan, to participate in the above-said functions. Such action was an anachronistic anti-reunification behavior reminiscent of the rash action taken against those south Koreans who wished to mourn the death of the President in 1994 and an unethical action of ignoring even the ancestral good manners and customs and elemental human morality, the statement noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government should immediately allow the Pyongyang visit by the non-governmental delegation, though belatedly. And the forces for the reunification movement should carry on their struggle till its visit has been realized and thus force the government to completely change its attitude toward the non-governmental exchanges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next year is a significant year which will mark the fifth anniversary of the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the statement said, calling upon all the people to draw a lesson from the incident and make every possible effort to put the non-governmental exchanges on a new higher stage.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
