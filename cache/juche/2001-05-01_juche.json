            "content": "KCNA refutes Japan's anti-DPRK diatribe \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 1 (KCNA) -- It has been a chronic evil habit of Japan to cover up its criminal nature with plots and trickery.\r\n Recently, the Japanese government sent families of \"those kidnapped\" to the U.N. commission on human rights to beg for relief and floated the trite fiction that it discovered evidence showing possible \"infiltration of North Korean agents into the coast of Japan.\" Not satisfied with these burlesques, it went the length of attacking the DPRK even in its \"diplomatic blue paper for 2000.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a carefully pre-arranged political gambling aimed to paint an assailant as a \"victim\" and lay a springboard from which to reinvade Korea. In other words, Japan seeks to speed up its moves to become a military power through the tightened Japan-U.S. military alliance while working to exercise the right of collective self-defence and perfecting the \"laws on emergency\" targeted at the second Korean war under the pretext of non-existent \"kidnapping\" issue and \"infiltration of North Korean agents.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has escalated its moves to become a military power, revising little by little the \"peace constitution\" which calls for abiding by the \"principle of war renouncement and total defence\" through the adoption of laws related to the \"Japan-U.S. cooperative defence guidelines.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to become a military power and its militarization are already close to the process of declaring them as a policy, going beyond the phase of discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of militarism is being rapidly disseminated in the Japanese society and militarism has begun to prevail in it, as evidenced by official visits to the Yasukuni Shrine by right-wing political figures, the retrogressive revision of history textbooks, negation of history and Japan's evasion of its responsibility to liquidate its past, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's militarization and emergence as a military power will certainly lead it to overseas expansion. This is an established fact proven by what it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese politicians are well advised not to persist in their moves to exercise the right of collective self-defence and perfect the \"laws on emergency,\" which will drive Japan itself to destruction, but properly liquidate its past.    \r\n\r\n"

Washington has massively deployed offensive weapons such as nuclear weapons and missiles in and around South Korea, posing a great threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rumor of \"threat\" from the DPRK spread by the U.S. hawks is aimed to justify the above-said policy and ignite the second Korean war, while watching for a chance to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's mode of counter-measure to meet with a stick the U.S. shaking its fist and return an artillary fire for its rifle fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists unleash a new war of aggression in Korea at any cost, not a single soldier of their aggressor forces will go back alive and their territory will not be safe, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard liners are well advised to drop their hard line policy towards the DPRK, clearly mindful that it will bring them to nowhere, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n"

It is unthinkable without experienced guidance of leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has imbued the workers and other people with transparent anti-imperialist class consciousness and brought them up as staunch vanguard fighters who fight against imperialism to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, who live in the spirit of Mt. Paektu implanted by him and fight with the same grit and will as his, will as ever make a history of certain victory in the struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon the workers and other people of Korea to work harder to build a powerful socialist nation and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche rallied close around Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"
