            "content": "DPRK Is Fully Ready for Dialogue and War: FM Spokesman\r\nPyongyang, February 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a statement Monday denounced the U.S. and south Korea for starting the provocative Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises defying repeated warnings of the DPRK and neighboring countries. The big exercises for aggression against the DPRK are escalating the tensions in and around the Korean Peninsula beyond a danger line, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\tInvolved in the drills are U.S. troops present in south Korea and huge reinforcements from the U.S. mainland and the Pacific region along with offensive means. South Korea has already been put on a wartime posture, fanning up hysteria for war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe warmongering drills have been scheduled at a time when the hard-won DPRK-U.S. talks were under way reflecting the unanimous desire of the Korean people and countries around Korea for the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula. Herein lie the brigandish arrogance and sinister attempt of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter publishing a new defense strategy in January which envisaged giving priority to Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. has extensively increased the number and intensity of the joint military exercises in south Korea. This clearly proves that the main target of the new strategy is the DPRK and countries around it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. strategic attempt is not only to stifle the DPRK but to put its neighboring countries under military siege and contain them in a bid to realize its wild ambition for world domination which faced serious challenge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt seems that the U.S. thinks it can exploit the DPRK for carrying out its strategy for reinforcing military forces in Northeast Asia under the pretext of the situation of the Korean Peninsula. This is an insult to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reckless war drills targeting the army and people of the DPRK, who are in the mourning period, amount to a grave provocation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWar has never been notified in advance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has long kept to the road of Songun in anticipation of the situation as now. It would be a mistake if one tries to rattle or test the DPRK by force. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK is fully ready for both dialogue and war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. would be well advised to be aware that it would be left with no space for holding military exercises on the Korean Peninsula if it provokes the DPRK in an unlawful manner."

Society in south Korea is where material life has become deformed and spiritual and cultural life impoverished and political life reactionary under the strong influence of imperialist corrupt ideas and culture of the capitalist society which can be maintained only when the sound conscience of people is benumbed. Underwits in those societies can hardly understand the essence of the society in the DPRK and the noble spiritual world of the youth.  It is the height of folly for them to talk about the young people and other people in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPitiable, indeed, is the Lee group which provided a back room to hatch plots, counting on such fools."

atencion a la vida de los militares recorriendo el cuartel, la sala de educacion y otros lugares de la compania adscrita al batallon no.1.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, el Comandante Supremo inspecciono el puesto de mando avanzado de la unidad 688 del EPC, donde analizo el estado de ubicacion de las fuerzas y equipos reforzados de la unidad de defensa de la isla Yonphyong del ejercito titere surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConocio detalladamente de la topografia y objetos terrestres y del estado de instalacion de las fuerzas y de guardia avanzada de la unidad mirando hacia el territorio surcoreano, de donde viene el nubarron de guerra debido a los ejercicios militares \"Key Resolve\", \"Foal Eagle\" y otros preparativos de nueva guerra agresiva de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presento las tareas programaticas que sirven de una guia en fortalecer por todos los medios la combatividad de la unidad y fortificar toda la zona de defensa como una muralla de acero frente a las maniobras provocativas de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiguio inspeccionado el batallon adscrito a la unidad 493 del EPC en el frente avanzado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comandante Supremo subio al puesto de observacion del batallon de artilleria de costa adscrito a la unidad, donde entendio del estado de guardia avanzada observando la isla Paekryong a corta distancia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPregunto si no hay cambio en la situacion del enemigo y como fueron instalados los equipos tacticos y fuerzas de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo la necesidad de elevar mas en el futuro la densidad de fuego y rectificar y enmendar de continuo el proyecto sobre la asignacion de la mision de fuego y la utilizacion de equipos conforme a la demanda de la guerra contemporanea y el cambiante estado de disposicion de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDirigio los ejercicios de manejo de canones de los soldados de la primera posicion de la segunda compania del batallon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea inspecciono el batallon adscrito a la unidad 641 del EPC en la primera linea de frente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDio como recuerdos los binoculos, fusil automatico y ametralladora a los militares del batallon y se fotografio con ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresto atencion profunda a la labor y la vida de los militares recorriendo la sala de educacion, dormitorio, comedor y otras instalaciones culturales e intendencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo que dicha zona es la zona candente donde puede estallarse la guerra en cualesquier momento por las imprudentes provocaciones agresivas de los enemigos y destaco que el batallon asestara un fuerte golpe de represalia a los enemigos si estos se atreven a agredir aunque sea 0.001mm del mar de la patria donde se ejerce la soberania de la RPDC al mantener el estado de la maxima alerta de acuerdo con la situacion muy delicada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl comandante Supremo Kim Jong Un fue acompanado por los generales de ejercito del EPC, Kim Myong Guk, Kim Won Hong y Pak Jae Gyong, el subjefe de departamento del Comite Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, Hwang Pyong So, el coronel general del EPC Kim Chun Sam y los miembros de mando de operaciones de la Comandancia Suprema del EPC."
