This is the worthwhile work to fully demonstrate the greatness of the politics of the Worker's Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All our victories are decisively guaranteed by the strict embodiment of Kim Jong Il's politics, the army-first politics that is an eternal political mode of revolution in our era and all-mighty treasured sword for socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should rise as one in the work to carry out the tasks laid down in the joint editorial. It is the honorable work to display to the world the might of single-hearted unity of our people closely rallied around Kim Jong Il and bring about a decisive progress in the building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The red flag of socialism continues to be fluttering after the 20th century and great prosperity and powerful development of our country and nation are reliably ensured under the guidance of Kim Jong Il, the great leader of the 21st century, it stresses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that officials of all the national economic institutions should successfully carry out the militant tasks laid down in the joint editorial so as to glorify this year as a year of new advance in building an economically powerful nation in the 21st century. \r\n\r\n"

But this is a proof of the validity and vitality of the idea of the foreign policy of the DPRK -- independence, peace and friendship -- and its world-wide magnetic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK and the government of the DPRK have consistently upheld this idea from a firm independent stand irrespective of any change in situation and made every possible effort for its materialization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will remain true to that idea in the 21st century, too, and boost the friendly and cooperative relations and good-neighbor relations with different countries, guided by it. \r\n\r\n"

This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. imperialists' baton does not work in the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the U.S. is making bravado as a military superpower, it is not as strong as it claims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia and China are directly opposed to the U.S. moves for unipolarization and the member states of the European Union are working for the European integration in the efforts to be free from U.S. domination, the article noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is an increasing sign of the downfall of imperialism going against the trend of the times in the U.S. and other countries of the capitalist world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are becoming more desperate in their efforts to save themselves from ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But with no remedy can capitalism and imperialism get rid of the abyss of ruin into which they were thrown by the times and history. \r\n\r\n"
