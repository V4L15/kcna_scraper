The DPRK, therefore, can never allow the administration to put up such pre-conditions. Raising such pre-conditions is, in essence, aimed to totally disarm the DPRK. No pre-conditions are acceptable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish, indeed, for the administration to think it can impose such pre-condition upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not interested in such conditional dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. authorities are well advised to clearly understand this and take a proper approach towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
