The military tension on the Korean Peninsula is greater than that three decades back. A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee observed this in a statement issued Thursday, 30 years since the U.S. imperialists orchestrated the incident.\r\n It said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. war hysteria has reached an extremely dangerous phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It formally adopted a preemptive attack on the DPRK as its \"national security strategy.\" The U.S. has become more undisguised in its attempt to invade the DPRK, taking issue with it over its deterrent for self-defense, and desperate in imposing sanctions upon the DPRK under unreasonable pretexts.  The U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are rounding off their preparations for a war against the DPRK at a final phase under the signboards of \"transfer of bases\" and \"troop relocation\". Their nuclear war exercises have already gone beyond the danger line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula can never be free from the danger of war nor can the Koreans escape a nuclear war holocaust as long as the U.S. pursues its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its military presence in south Korea goes on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop at once its hostile policy and immediately stop its moves to invade the DPRK, clearly understanding the latter's deterrent for self-defence which no force can ever match and withdraw all its forces and war hardware from south Korea as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is realistic and natural as it is a revelation of their unshakable will to defend peace of the country and security of the nation from outsiders' aggression and war moves and from the moves of the pro-American bellicose forces following them and invariably advance along the road of independent reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and achieve its peaceful reunification, it is urgent to oppose the aggression and war moves and remove the danger of war, the article points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are now recklessly scheming to stifle the DPRK which is dynamically advancing toward socialism under the uplifted banner of independence against imperialism. They are resorting to all sorts of machinations to lay an \"international siege\" to the DPRK, while speeding up arms buildup and staging madcap war exercises to invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such adventurous anti-DPRK moves are driving the military tension of the Korean Peninsula to the point of explosion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imminent situation requires the Koreans to intensify national cooperation for peace and security of the country. It is because ensuring peace on this land is not a matter related to security of either the north or the south but a matter related to the whole Korean Peninsula and the destiny of the Korean nation. It is clear that if a war breaks out in the peninsula due to the reckless military provocation of the U.S. imperialists, their nukes will bring nuclear holocaust to all Koreans in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the pro-American bellicose forces in south Korea are chiming in with the U.S. war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts clearly show that it is necessary for all the fellow countrymen to wage a more vigorous struggle against the aggression and war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the flunkeyism of the pro-American bellicose forces in south Korea in order to defend peace from war on the Korean Peninsula and reunify it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is responsible for defending peace and preventing war on the peninsula where war and peace are in acute confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should more staunchly and invariably go along the road of struggle judged and chosen by themselves for peace and security of the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. thinks it is necessary to contain the armed forces of Hamas and Hezbollah militarily in a bid to contain Iran, a target of its strategic attack. That is why the U.S. fanned up Israel's aggression on Lebanon despite strong protest and denunciation by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is trying to secure a pretext for its invasion of Iran by encouraging Israel's aggression on Lebanon. Iran is supporting the anti-Israel struggle of the Palestinian and Lebanese resistance forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already made preparations to launch a war against Iran.

            "content": "KCNA Slams Japan's Hostile Policy toward DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 17 (KCNA) -- Japan's hostile campaign against the DPRK has gone beyond the danger line recently.\r\n The Japan Liberal Democratic Party is working hard to pass the \"bill on special measure for implementing the regulation on the specified financial transactions\" through the Diet after deciding on its \"outlines\". Meanwhile, the government is tightening the financial sanctions including control on the remittance to the DPRK and going busy laying a \"siege\" to the DPRK through an \"alliance\" with forces hostile to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, radical politicians who do not hesitate to bluster that they would not rule out the possibility of preemptive attack on the DPRK are emerging powerful candidates for next term prime ministership in Japan. This is a true picture of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become all the more undisguised in their campaign against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japan Ministry of Public Management, not content with canceling or downplaying the measure to exempt facilities related to Chongryon in 24 cities from paying fixed property taxes this year, investigated 140 autonomous bodies across the country which has Chongryon-related facilities and forced all of them to reexamine the measure of tax exemption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already banned the entry of \"Mangyongbong-92\" and cases of violence against Korean students numbered more than 60 recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has long pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK but the relations of hostility between the two countries have never reached such point of explosion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is Japan's hysteric way of thinking concerning the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is frantically applying sanctions against the DPRK and suppressing Chongryon, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, in a bid to spark off a chaotic situation in the region and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is accustomed to meeting its own interests at the sacrifice of others to hold supremacy. Its ulterior intention is to get the following political gains: to divert the attention of the international community elsewhere and shirk off its responsibility for the redemption of its past which it has dodged though the last century was replaced by the new century, court the U.S. favor by executing its hostile policy toward the DPRK more faithfully than others and help reactionaries get more votes for the next term prime ministership by inciting nationalist sentiment at home and stoking bitterness towards the DPRK among Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This objective prompted them to bedevil the DPRK-Japan relations and push them to those in the period of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's settlement of its past wrongs, a product of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule in the last century, still remains an outstanding issue between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for Japan to regain its political and moral face is to draw a lesson taught by the bitter history in the last century and make honest compensation to those countries which fell victim to its aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan intensified the suppression of Koreans in Japan, direct victims of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule in the past, and their descendents whenever the situation grew tenser on the Korean Peninsula. This is little different from the way militarist Japan enforced its harsh colonial rule in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's cry for sanctions against the DPRK and suppressive campaign only bring its weakness into bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country can win the confidence of the international community as it wishes and no gimmick can ever alter history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to reflect on its wrongs and apologize for them before slandering and keeping watchful eyes on its neighboring countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Songun idea of the Workers' Party of Korea originated from the two pistols left by his father and the programme and rules of the Down-with-Imperialism Union founded by him, they added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a unique way of making revolution clarified by the Songun idea to consider the founding of the revolutionary army and increasing its capacity as a priority issue and carry out all the strategic tasks of the revolution based on its capability, they said, adding that the line of armed struggle laid down in the Kalun meeting served as a line of Songun revolution as it paved a new path for accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Kim Il Sung started the Songun revolutionary leadership by founding the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Unit on April 25, Juche 21 (1932), they noted that he defeated two formidable imperialist enemies by the unique Songun leadership mode, led the Korean revolution to victory and thus made the revolutionary cause of Juche shine as a glorious Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il, proceeding from the peculiar conditions of the Korean revolution, perfected the Songun idea as an ever-victorious revolutionary idea for achieving a decisive victory in the anti-imperialist class struggle and accomplishing the cause of socialism, they pointed out, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He started his Songun revolutionary leadership by providing historic field guidance to the Guard Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Tank Division 105 of the Korean People's Army in August, Juche 49 (1960) and formulated the Songun politics as a basic political mode under socialism in the middle of the 1990s with a firm determination to bolster up the People's Army and tide over difficulties in reliance upon its might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers explained that he formulated the President's Songun idea as a Songun revolutionary principle and Songun political theory through his energetic ideological and theoretical activities, thus making the idea serve as great guidelines in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among those present there were Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Jin, minister of Education, and officials concerned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
