His army-based revolutionary line is an all-powerful treasured sword that guarantees the sovereignty and dignity of the nation and the building of a powerful nation in Korea, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A seminar was also held by the Bulgarian group for the study of the Juche idea on March 12. The chief of the group said at the seminar that the recent international situation proves how just Kim Jong Il's army-based policy is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that Korea, the vanguard of the world movement for socialism and communism, will shatter the U.S. wild ambition for world domination in the 21st century, too, as it frustrated the U.S. imperialists' ambition for world hegemony in the 1950s.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. attack on the north will precisely be a declaration of war against the people in the south. As there is neither front nor rear in a modern war and a nuclear holocaust does not know the boundary between the south and the north, the nation will be exterminated altogether if a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will, together with all the people, more dynamically conduct the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. If the Bush administration takes the road of unleashing a war at the end, we will make this land stained with the blood shed by the murdered civilians a burial place of corpses of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces with the united efforts of the whole nation.    \r\n\r\n"

This is because it is a dangerous move which may disturb the world strategic stability and spark a new arms race. That is why the world is unanimous in censuring the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the U.S. felt an urgent need to invent a pretext to soothe the world protest and denunciation. So the U.S. is clamouring about \"threat of missiles\" from the DPRK, a long bankrupt fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile plan for self-defense can in no way be a threat to those countries which are not hostile toward it. \r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary urges the U.S. to ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and immediately stop its anachronistic moves.     \r\n\r\n"
