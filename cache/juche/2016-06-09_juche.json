is urgent for achieving the independent reunification of the country is to fundamentally improve the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to respect the agreements common to

This was a solemn declaration of the final victory in the struggle for the independent reunification expected to come before long.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the crucial time for all Koreans to turn out as one and dynamically advance to pull down the barrier of hostility and confrontation and bring earlier the bright day of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At this crucial and historic juncture the DPRK government, political parties and organizations ardently appeal to all Koreans as follows, prompted by the single desire to bring earlier the new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity by thoroughly carrying out the policies for national reunification advanced at the 7th Congress of the WPK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, let all compatriots dynamically pave the way for reunification, holding higher the banner of national independence!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National independence is the eternal lifeline of the movement for national reunification and a firm guarantee for victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no problem insolvable and no obstacle insurmountable if the Koreans join hands and pool their wisdom and efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National independence means patriotism and reunification but dependence on outsiders country-selling and division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, let us usher in a great heyday in the cause of great national unity for the country's reunification!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the struggle for national reunification is one of great national unity and the great national unity entirely means the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the real intention of the ideal of great national unity clarified by the peerless patriot that we will join hands and work for reunification and patriotism with anyone without hesitation if he or she has national conscience even though he or she had covered the road of anti-reunification in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let's devote ourselves to the cause of achieving national reunification and great national unity irrespective of ideology and ism by directly linking one's destiny with that of the nation!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, let all compatriots turn out and convert the land of Korea into a cradle of peace and security and paradise completely free from a war!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let all compatriots pool efforts and come out in the nation-wide anti-U.S. sacred war for driving all the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, source of aggression and war, out of south Korea, if one wishes to lead a stable life in peace!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Genuine peace is guaranteed by arms and the most powerful self-defensive war deterrent represents justice which beats injustice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everybody should properly understand the benefits the DPRK's treasured nuclear sword for self-defence brings to the nation, and lay bare the confrontational and belligerent nature of those who term it \"threat\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fourthly, let's make the world see the shining appearance of a power reunified by federal formula accepted and supported by the whole nation!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The federal formula which was confirmed by the heads of the north and the south before the nation and is being accepted and supported by all compatriots is the nation's unique way of reunification as it is most reasonable, fair and aboveboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let all fellow countrymen in the north, the south and abroad wholeheartedly support the reunification by federal formula, irrespective of ideology and social system, and wage a positive struggle for achieving it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fifthly, let us resolutely break with the past woven with hostility and antagonism, confrontation and conflict and pave a new way for improving the inter-Korean relations!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations have reached the worst phase of suffocating and that of total freeze owing to the extreme confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group are chiefly to blame for this as they reacted to the DPRK's sincere efforts and proposals for improving the inter-Korean relations at the lowest ebb by recklessly hurting the dignity of its supreme leadership and reeling off sophism about \"collapse of its social system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the peerlessly great man called the south Korean authorities partner for reunification with his rare and courageous decision not to ask about any past wrongdoing but hew out any rugged thorny path to find a solution to the issue of the nation, the issue of reunification, and put forward once again the reasonable way for improving the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that it is the wisest attitude for saving their destiny for them not to fail to respond to the offer made by the DPRK to advance together as partner for reunification at this juncture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We propose opening a nation-wide grand meeting for reunification on the occasion of the 71st anniversary of Korea's liberation, prompted by the ardent desire to bring about an epochal turn in weathering the present difficulties, improving the inter-Korean relations and accomplishing the cause of national reunification by the concerted efforts of all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We ardently call upon all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad once again to turn out as one in the sacred struggle to fling the gate of the reunified power open, their hearts burning with patriotic enthusiasm full of firm faith and optimism about the final victory in the struggle for national reunification."

These became a laughing stock of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring African countries this time, too, Park cried out for \"consistent reaction of the international community\" while terming the nuclear development of the DPRK \"a serious threat to the world peace\". Her trip was clearly aimed at escalating confrontation with the DPRK as she disclosed her despicable intention to slander the fellow countrymen in utter disregard of to whom she was talking and how they are responding to her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she did during her junket to Africa touched off indignation and rage of all the Koreans as she stooped to any infamy to serve the purpose of garnering support for her policy for confrontation with the DPRK from outsiders and doing harm to her fellow countrymen through conspiracy with outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sophism and vituperation of Park are just the symptom of confrontational maniac on the deathbed totally bereft of normal thinking and judging faculties. They are just hysteric fit to cover up the sacred mission and peace-loving nature of the nuclear weapons of the DPRK and to keep afloat the cooperation in the efforts to escalate confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She hurled mud at the DPRK's line for simultaneous development of the two fronts and its measure for bolstering capabilities for self-defence and worked hard to build up international public opinion over the non-existent \"threat.\" By doing so she sought to justify her long bankrupt policy for confrontation with the DPRK and do harm to and stifle the fellow countrymen at any cost with the help of outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrence is neither a means for negotiations nor a bargaining chip for getting something.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our nuclear weapons are a treasured sword for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world, and are also treasure common to the nation which guarantees the nation's reconciliation and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the DPRK to bolster deterrence for self-defence in every way with the nuclear weapons as a backbone to cope with the open threat of war from the aggressors and provokers, and no one is entitled to slander this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To deny the DPRK's line on simultaneous development of the two fronts and its measure for bolstering capabilities for self-defence is a denial of the political system in the DPRK and an insult to its dignity and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolhardy for Park to dare try to do harm to the DPRK through mendicant diplomacy by frequently visiting outsiders. No matter how frequently she stages rackets for isolating and stifling the DPRK in collusion with outsiders, they will only bring her curse and denunciation from the nation and shame in the world eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park had better drop the unrealizable ambition for forcing \"the north to scrap nuclear weapons\" and properly face up to the world and behave herself."

Y la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras es la traicion a la patria y la division nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. !Abramos la era dorada de la causa de gran unidad nacional por la reunificacion de la patria!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia de la lucha por la reunificacion de la patria es la de gran unidad nacional que significa la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomar la mano y hacer esfuerzos conjuntos por la reunificacion con todos los que tienen la minima conciencia nacional, aunque en el tiempo pasado se opusieron a la reunificacion, esto es el noble ideal de gran unidad nacional presentado por el Mariscal Kim Jong Un, patriota sin igual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Hagamos esfuerzos abnegados por la causa de reunificacion y de gran unidad nacional vinculando sus propios destinos con el de la nacion y por encima de las diferencias de las ideologias, ideales y doctrinas!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. !Transformemos el territorio patrio como paraiso y nido de la paz y seguridad libre de la guerra!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Todos los coreanos, que desean una vida pacifica y estable, levantemonos en la sagrada guerra antiyanqui pannacional por expulsar completamente con las fuerzas unidas a las tropas agresoras imperialistas norteamericanas de la Peninsula Coreana, foco de la agresion y la guerra!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La paz verdadera se garantiza por el fusil y la justicia que vence la injusticia reside en el mas poderoso disuasivo de guerra de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todos deben conocer correctamente los beneficios que nuestras armas nucleares autodefensivas ofrecen a la nacion y revelar agudamente la naturaleza conflictiva y belicista de los que lo califican de \"amenaza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  4. !Demostremos a todo el mundo el aspecto majestuoso de la potencia reunificada a modo del sistema federal apoyado y aprobado por toda la nacion!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El sistema federal confirmado por los maximos dirigentes del Norte y el Sur ante la nacion y apoyado y aprobado por todos los coreanos, es el mas racional, imparcial y unico modo de reunificacion de nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  !Todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y el ultramar apoyemos absolutamente la reunificacion a modo del sistema federal por encima de las diferencias de las ideas y regimenes  y luchemos con dinamismo por lograrlo!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  5. !Abramos nueva salida para la mejora de las relaciones Norte-Sur despidiendo decididamente del pasado manchado por la hostilidad, el antagonismo, la confrontacion y el choque!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora las relaciones intercoreanas se hallan en el peor estado de sofocacion y agonia debido a la confrontacion que llega al extremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La responsabilidad de dicha situacion recae enteramente sobre la banda conservadora surcoreana que respondio con el imprudente insulto a la maxima dignidad y la sofisteria del \"derrumbe del regimen\" a todos los esfuerzos sinceros y las propuestas de buena fe que hicimos por cambiar a favor las relaciones N-S que se empeoran.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero nuestro gran hombre sin par llamo a las autoridades surcoreanas como acompanante de la reunificacion y volvio a presentar el remedio racional para la mejora de las relaciones N-S con la extraordinaria decision y gran audacia de tolerar cualquier pasado y abrir el paso aunque sea dificil para resolver el problema nacional y el de reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las autoridades surcoreanas deben conocer exactamente que tomar nuestra mano tendida para avanzar juntos como acompanantes de la reunificacion deviene el mas sabio medio para salvar su destino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Proponemos abrir la gran reunion de reunificacion pannacional con motivo del 71o aniversario de la liberacion de la patria a partir del ardiente deseo de superar las dificultades actuales y registrar un cambio trascendental en las relaciones N-S y el cumplimiento de la causa de la reunificacion de la patria con el proposito y las fuerzas unidas de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Volvemos a exhortar calurosamente a todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y el ultramar a levantarse unanimemente en la sagrada lucha por abrir de par en par las puertas de potencia reunificada con la firme confianza y el optimismo en la victoria final de la causa nacional y con el entusiasmo patriotico."

            "content": "Disuasivo nuclear de RPDC no puede ser pretexto de agresion y guerra, declara ministro de FAP\r\nPyongyang, 9 de junio (ACNC) -- El general de ejercito de las fuerzas terrestres del Ejercito Popular de Corea Pak Yong Sik, ministro de las Fuerzas Armadas Populares del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, hizo publica el dia 9 una declaracion. \n\t\t\t\t\tHace pocos dias, tuvo lugar en Singapur la \"reunion de seguridad de Asia de 2016\", anuncia la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi fuera un foro para asegurar la seguridad de Asia, se debian discutido y tomado en el las medidas realistas por el respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los ministros de Defensa de EE.UU., Japon y el Sur de Corea efectuaron aparte un complot, ocasion en la cual insistieron en la necesidad de \"practicar estrictamente la sancion anti-Norte\" y \"estrechar la cooperacion\" diciendo que la cuarta prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de misil de la RPDC devienen la \"violacion\" a la \"resolucion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y a la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la larga, disparatearon que no iniciaran el dialogo con imprudencia antes de que la RPDC aclare la \"voluntad de renunciar las armas nucleares\" y que fortaleceran la cooperacion militar frente a la \"amenaza del Norte\" incluso el aumento de \"compartimiento de las informaciones militares anti-Norte\" desde el inicio de los ejercicios de alerta de misil que se desarrollaran en el mes proximo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeviene el climax del cinismo el que hasta en la reunion de seguridad internacional inducen en error la opinion publica calificando de \"amenaza\" las prestigiosas fuerzas armadas nucleares de autodefensa y las fuerzas estrategicas de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el unico pais criminal nuclear y mayor poseedor de armas nucleares en el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon es el Estado militarista que persigue la conversion de su pais en la potencia militar y el armamento nuclear abandonando hasta la \"constitucion pacifista\" y los \"tres principios de desnuclearizacion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el amparo de los amos norteamericano y japones, los titeres surcoreanos se entregaron al enfrentamiento fratricida realizando hasta el lanzamiento de misil Hyonmu de 800 km de alcance que puede atacar toda la extension norcoreana. E insatisfechos con esto, abogan ahora por el \"armamento nuclear frente a las armas nucleares del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa presente cita tripartita anuncio sin escrupulos la artimana de intensificar nuevas acciones hostiles anti-RPDC bajo el pretexto de la \"amenaza\" nuclear y de misil de este pais socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy ridiculo que los responsables de la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana justifiquen el intento de agresion imputando la culpabilidad a otro. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta oportunidad, reafirmamos que nuestro disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa es el remedio todopoderoso para hacer frente a las maniobras de agresion anti-RPDC de las fuerzas hostiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra advertencia no es una palabra vacia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia ensena que las fuerzas hostiles anti-RPDC, sin excepcion alguna, no podran evitar el arruinamiento."
