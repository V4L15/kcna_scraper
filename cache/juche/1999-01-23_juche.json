During the period, the United States has developed and manufactured about 700,000 nuclear warheads.\r\n   U.S. nuclear weapons are deployed in every part of the world, the U.S. nuclear aircraft carriers and nuclear-powered submarines are constantly moving in oceans and are openly anchoring at such a country as Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This proves that it is none other than the United States that should restrain the proliferation of the nuclear weapons for human peace and the security of this planet.\r\n   Such being the case, does the United States have the qualification and face to talk about \"restraint\" against somebody? \r\n\r\n"
