            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM Calls for Peace on Korean Peninsula\r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t 59 years have passed since the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA) was signed but the war has not been terminated technically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, AA was a transitional step which specified that negotiations should be held at a political level within three months with an aim to have all foreign forces withdrawn from the Korean Peninsula and ensure a durable peace there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. deliberately opted to keep the truce long. In November 1953 it defined it as the final goal to realize the \"pro-American unification\" of the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. also adopted the \"National Security Council Resolution 170\" to make south Korea its \"military ally\" while keeping the armistice system until the goal is attained. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to it, the U.S. disrupted the Geneva meeting for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, massively shipped into south Korea modern weapons including nuclear weapons in violation of AA and has consistently staged war maneuvers under various codenames. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has persistently avoided the conclusion of a peace agreement and kept the state of belligerency on the Korean Peninsula. This is the most typical expression of its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has systematically scrapped major provisions of AA, steadily increased military and nuclear threats to the DPRK and in the long run compelled it to have access to nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unstable truce between the DPRK and the United States has persisted on the Korean Peninsula for 59 years. This is a very abnormal situation unprecedented in the world history of wars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second Korean war has been headed off in the Korean Peninsula in which the two sides stand in the most acute military stand-off. It would have been unthinkable without the DPRK's Songun politics and effective war deterrent based on self-defensive nuclear forces. Those countries without nuclear deterrent were brought down without exception in face of military intervention of hostile forces aimed at toppling social systems. This is a stark reality in the present century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never abandon nuclear deterrent first as long as the U.S., the biggest nuclear weapons state in the world, remains hostile toward the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the U.S. sincerely implemented any one of its commitments to AA, the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly session on having the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea and the DPRK-U.S. agreements in which it promised not to antagonize the DPRK, a durable peace would have settled on the Korean Peninsula and the situation would not have reached the brink of a nuclear war as today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to settle the problems through dialogue and negotiations but all the dialogues cannot but be \"ones for the sake of dialogue\" unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy. This is the review of the nearly 60-year-long history of armistice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should not just claim that it does not have any hostile intention to the DPRK in words but prove it in such practical actions as making a bold decision to replace AA with a peace agreement without any excuse or precondition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To abandon the hostile policy cannot be a \"present\" or bargaining in any case. The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK must be rolled back first unconditionally as it is unreasonable and anachronistic. Only when one party does not antagonize the other party and when they sit face to face on an equal footing, will it be possible to have dialogue in the true sense of the word and settle all problems of mutual concern.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One way of solving the problem is to sign a peace agreement with the U.S. and another one is to root out the cause of war from the Korean Peninsula for a durable peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ball is in the court of the U.S."

            "content": "History of War Victory Everlasting: KCNA Report\r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- KCNA Wednesday released a report \"History of great victory in war against U.S. imperialism is everlasting\". It deals with great feats Generalissimo Kim Il Sung performed in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t The report is summarized as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Brilliant victory of great Juche idea, Songun idea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung solved all problems arising in winning the victory in the war on the principle of Juche with his rare ideological and theoretical wisdom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In \"Let Us Wipe Out the Invaders by a Decisive Counter-offensive\", a speech he made at the emergency meeting of the DPRK Cabinet on June 25, 1950, the day when the war broke out, and in a radio speech to all the Korean people on June 26, he said that the Korean War is an offspring of the U.S. foreign policy for aggression aimed at world hegemony and that the DPRK's war against it is the just Fatherland Liberation War for the freedom and independence of the country and democracy both in name and reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He elucidated the strategic idea of the Workers' Party of Korea for the victory in the war on the basis of the position and role of the popular masses in the revolutionary war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his radio speeches to all the Korean people on June 26 and September 9, 1950 he put forward the idea of patriotism and unity, calling for turning the war into an all-people war. He also set forth the idea of definitely ensuring the politico-ideological, strategic and tactical superiority of the army in the whole course of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In different works and speeches he gave a profound exposition of the politico-ideological, strategic and tactical superiority and might of the Korean People's Army which any imperialist army or any army of reactionary exploiting class cannot have, their decisive role in the revolutionary war and the tasks and ways to fully display them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In some important speeches he called for meeting the material need of the front with the efforts of the Korean people to suit the characteristics of the modern war, the actual conditions of the country and their patriotic enthusiasm and made clear the principled demand and ways.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based idea of properly combining operations of large and small units, and regular warfare and guerilla warfare and successfully carrying on mountain warfare and nocturnal warfare takes an important place in his strategic idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory in the three-year Fatherland Liberation War was the victory of the Juche idea and Songun idea attaching importance to human being and loving the people over the imperialists' idea of aggression for reducing the Korean people to slaves again, and their misanthropy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Victory of Brilliant Wisdom and Outstanding Strategy, Tactics and War Methods\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young DPRK, five years since its liberation and two years since it had a regular army, and the people defeated the U.S., the boss of imperialism in the world which boasted of its history of aggression spanning a hundred and scores of years and its numerical and technical superiority. They owed the victory to the outstanding military wisdom, strategy and tactics and war methods of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Three days after the start of the war the 105 Tank Division rushed to Seoul and the DPRK flag fluttered on the \"Capital Building\" of the puppet forces. The operation for liberating Seoul shook the U.S. colonial ruling system to its roots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Brave seamen of the DPRK sank 17 000-ton cruiser \"Baltimore\" which had been called \"a moving island\" and destroyed a 12 000-ton cruiser with only four torpedo boats in the waters off Jumunjin in accordance with the Juche-based war methods indicated by the President. This was specially recorded in the world history of sea battles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military miracles like the shining victory in the operation for liberating Taejon, typical of modern encircling warfare, successive siege and annihilation operations in different areas, attack on the \"Pusan base\" of the enemy and creation of \"crisis in Taegu\" were all closely related to the wise leadership of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the first stage of the war the Korean People's Army annihilated main forces of the south Korean puppet army, dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces and liberated over 90 percent of south Korea and more than 92 percent of its population. These tremendous achievements were a manifestation of the greatness and vitality of the Juche-based military idea and war methods and outstanding commanding art.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every war method set forth by the President in that period was fresh and unique one suited to specific topography and conditions of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The entire army and all people in the DPRK awarded the title of DPRK Marshal to Supreme Commander Kim Il Sung on February 7, 1953 out of their boundless reverence for him who performed undying feats in the Fatherland Liberation War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Victory of Mental Power of Leader, Army and People\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory in the Fatherland Liberation War is a result of the revolutionary faith and prodigious grit of President Kim Il Sung and the mental power of the army and the people closely united around the leader. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is always a way out of any adversity and one should defeat the enemy and win no matter how often he or she may have to die -- this is the President's pluck and will encouraging the Korean army and people to display indomitable mental power and patriotism in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people fought the war with a strong will to always follow and devotedly defend the supreme command, protect the cradle of their genuine life and happiness from the enemy in a do-or-die spirit and defend every inch of the country at the cost of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1930s the President, a young general on this side of his twenties, proclaimed a war against the brigandish Japanese imperialists and defeated them through two decades of the hard-fought revolutionary war. He also defeated the world reactionary allied forces including formidable U.S. imperialists in the 1950s. Already in his forties he enjoyed deep reverence and trust from the world people as a brilliant commander who defeated two imperialisms and as a symbol of victory in the anti-imperialist struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Generalissimo Kim Jong Il, carrying forward the great tradition of patriotism, creditably defended the socialist country and the revolution in the war without gunfire for decades and provided precious foundations for the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean army and people, advancing toward a final victory, closely united around Marshal Kim Jong Un, another peerlessly great man, will steadily carry forward the history and tradition of the war victory."

He went the lengths of making a mockery of the families of the abductees, saying that he would not get enraged though the abductees north Korea claims dead come back alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is aim in insisting on the return of the abductees who have already died.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This politically-motivated fraud is aimed to win popularity by portraying the dead persons as alive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Matsubara said he would make positive efforts for the settlement of the \"abduction issue\" ahead of the tenth anniversary since former Prime Minister Koizumi's visit to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Matsubara's remarks cannot be interpreted otherwise than an intention not to settle the \"abduction issue\" because the dead persons cannot come back to life. This is another new challenge to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the \"abduction issue\" is concerned, it had already been settled thanks to the DPRK's magnanimity and sincere efforts, so it does not exist any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has already been informed of the death of abductees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK sent back the abductees and their families and articles left by the dead, as well as data on verifying the settlement of abduction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Japanese reactionaries are raising the abduction issue while portraying the dead as alive, in defiance of the DPRK's sincere efforts. Only those steeped in confrontation with the DPRK such as Matsubara can spread lies and commit sordid acts without hesitation in order to improve their images. No matter what lies they spread over the \"abduction issue\", they will only make those who lend an ear to them more pitiful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Days are gone when they used to use the \"abduction issue\" as a lever for satisfying their political greed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The opinion poll conducted by the Japanese government on July 19 showed that persons including youth are becoming less and less concerned about the \"abduction issue\". This tells that many Japanese have seen through the deceptive nature of the \"abduction issue\" and are paying no heed to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese politicians should roll back the old-fashioned hostile policy toward the DPRK and swim with the trend of the times. This will be a right choice for winning political popularity."

Korea Conspiracy\r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- The hideous politically-motivated state-sponsored terrorist plot hatched by the south Korean puppet regime was recently detected and disclosed in the DPRK. This was not an accidental case but an inevitable product of the conspiracy between outsiders and their stooges who sought to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a bylined article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime's hideous terrorist act was perpetrated, pursuant to its unchanged policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group of traitors is an arch criminal who plunged the inter-Korean relations to the lowest ebb with its unprecedented confrontational policy against the DPRK. The sinister intention sought by the group through the policy is to deny the reconciliation, unity and reunification between the north and the south and do harm to the dignified social system in the DPRK. The south Korean regime, steeped in confrontation of social systems, drove the inter-Korean relations to the worst crisis while running amuck to hurt the DPRK in collusion with its U.S. and Japan masters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The massive arms buildup and war drills by south Korean warmongers are a clear manifestation of the regime's attempt to invade the DPRK and an open military threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent hideous state-sponsored terrorist act is indicative of the U.S. method of provoking a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., buoyed by wild ambition for aggression, does not want to see peace on the Korean Peninsula. It has long dreamed of putting whole of Asia under its control by occupying Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior aim of the U.S. to pave a broad way for making interference and effecting the strategy of aggression by instigating the puppet regime to further escalate confrontation and military conflicts between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation shows that downing the Lee Myung Bak regime and checking the pro-U.S. conservative forces' attempt to stay in power are directly linked with such important issues as preventing the danger of a new war in the Peninsula and saving the nation's destiny, not just simple replacement of \"government\"."

He went the lengths of underlining the need to implement the DPRK-U.S. agreement as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun in a bylined commentary Wednesday says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, Japan is not entitled to meddle in the issue of denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the issue of dialogue for it.

This means openly stepping up nuclear armament and space militarization under the pretext of \"ensuring the state security\". To hush up public criticism of this, they are talking loudly of \"additional provocation\", nonexistent in the DPRK.

Victoria fulminante de la gran idea Juche, la del Songun\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Presidente Kim Il Sung resolvio en el principio de la idea Juche todos los asuntos determinantes de la victoria en guerra dando pruebas de su extraordinaria perspicacia ideo-teorica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El 25 de junio de 1950, dia de estallido de la guerra coreana, pronuncio un discurso titulado \"Aniquilemos a los agresores armados mediante la contraofensiva decisiva\" en la reunion extraordinaria del Consejo de Ministros de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y al dia siguiente, hizo otro discurso por radio dirigido a todo el pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En esas ocasiones, aclaro que la guerra coreana es producto directo de la agresiva politica exterior de EE.UU. para la hegemonia mundial y deviene para el pueblo de la RPDC la justa Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria para defender la libertad, la independencia y la democracia de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trazo la idea estrategica del Partido por la victoria a base de la posicion y el papel que juegan el hombre y las masas populares en la guerra revolucionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En sus discursos radiales transmitidos a todo el pueblo el 26 de junio y el 9 de septiembre de 1950, presento la idea de patriotismo y unidad consistente en librar la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria como la de todo el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En todo el curso de la guerra, planteo el pensamiento de mantener con firmeza la superioridad ideo-politica y estrategico-tactica del ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A traves de sus obras y discursos, el Presidente Kim Il Sung dio profundas explicaciones sobre la superioridad ideo-politica y estrategico-tactica del Ejercito Popular de Corea, que no puede tener ningun ejercito imperialista ni el de la clase explotadora reaccionaria, y su poderio y el papel que juega ella en el cumplimiento de la guerra revolucionaria, y enseno las tareas y remedios para ponerla de manifiesto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En otros discursos importantes, presento la idea de cubrir en el principio de autoconfianza las demandas materiales del frente conforme a las caracteristicas de guerra moderna, la situacion del pais y al entusiasmo patriotico del pueblo coreano. Igualmente, dilucido especificamente las demandas de principio y remedios para poner en practica esa idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ocupa una posicion importante en las ideas estrategicas del Presidente Kim Il Sung la de combinar correctamente las batallas de grandes unidades y las de pequenos destacamentos, los combates regulares y los guerrilleros y los en zonas montanosas y los nocturnos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La victoria en la trienal Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria fue la de la idea Juche, la del Songun, caracterizada por el aprecio al hombre y el amor al pueblo, frente a la idea agresiva y misantropica del imperialismo que pretendio colonizar nuevamente al pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tII victoria de perspicacia genial, destacada estrategia y tactica y metodo de combate\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La joven Republica y el pueblo, que datan de los 5 anos desde su fundacion y de 2 anos apenas desde cuando se fundo el ejercito regular, vencio a Estados Unidos, cabecilla del imperialismo mundial, que se jactaba de la historia de agresion de ciento y tantos anos, la superioridad numerica y tecnologica, lo que se debe enteramente a la genial perspicacia militar, la destacada estrategia y tactica y metodo de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La embestida de Seul de la Division de Tanques 105 y la izada de la bandera de la RPDC en la Capitolio y otros logros alcanzados durante los 3 dias desde el inicio de la guerra y la operacion de liberacion de Seul azotaron de raiz el sistema de dominacion colonial de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun el metodo de combate iluminado por el Presidente Kim Il Sung, en el mar frente a Jumunjin con solo 4 torpederos los valientes marineros del EPC hundieron el crucero pesado del imperialismo norteamericano \"Baltimore\" y destruyeron el otro ligero, realizando gran hazana registrable con letra dorada en la historia de guerra naval del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es imposible pensar al margen de la sabia direccion del Presidente en la brillante victoria de la operacion de libracion de Taejon donde se creo el gran ejemplo de la guerra de cerca moderno, los sucesivos combates de aniquilamiento por asedio por doquier, la operacion de ataque a la \"base de Pusan\" de los enemigos, la creacion de la \"crisis de Taegu\" y otros prodigios militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A principios de la guerra los uniformados del EPC eliminaron los principales colectivos del ejercito titere surcoreano y dieron golpes demoledores a las tropas agresoras yanquis, mientras liberaron mas de 90 % de las regiones surcoreanas y mas de 92 por ciento de la poblacion surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los considerables exitos en el combate en la primera etapa de la guerra demostraron la idea militar y metodo de combate autoctonos, el destacado arte de mando y la grandeza y la vitalidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los metodos de combate presentados en este periodo son los nuevos y originales adecuados a la destallada topografia y situacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todo el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea otorgaron el 7 de febrero de 1953 el titulo del mariscal al Comandante Supremo del EPC Kim Il Sung quien acumulo imborrables hazanas en la historia de la Guerra de la Liberacion de la Patria en reflejo de infinita veneracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIII Victoria de dirigente y fuerza espiritual del ejercito y el pueblo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La victoria en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria fue la de la conviccion revolucionaria y la audacia sin par del Presidente Kim Il Sung y la fuerza espiritual del ejercito y el pueblo unido monoliticamente en torno al lider.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La audacia valiente y firme voluntad del Presidente sirvieron de la fuente principal de la indoblegable fuerza espiritual y de una fuerza motriz del espiritu patriotico que demostraron el ejercito y el pueblo coreanos en los dias de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La firme voluntad de defender a costa de la vida a la Comandancia Suprema y la decision de aniquilar a los enemigos que intentaban quitar la vida verdadera y la cuna de felicidad, estos fueron la indoblegable fuerza espiritual del ejercito y el pueblo coreanos que defendieron la patria con su sangre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Presidente quien como general juvenil de unos 20 anos declaro la guerra antijaponesa contra el imperialismo japones y lo derroto desplegando la guerra revolucionaria de mas de 20 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Y en la decada de los 50 del siglo pasado vencio a la alianza combinada de los reaccionarios del mundo encabezada por el imperialismo yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como resultado, ya a los 40 anos el Presidente recibio la veneracion infinita y la confianza del mundo como genial sin precedente quien derroto a los imperialistas y simbolo de victoria en la lucha antiimperialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El Generalisimo Kim Jong Il al continuar la brillante tradicion del patriotismo, defendio firmemente durante decenas de anos en la guerra revolucionaria sin tiroteos la patria socialista y la revolucion y preparo la base preciosa para la culminacion de la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y el pueblo coreanos que avanzan hacia la victoria final uniendose monoliticamente en torno al Mariscal Kim Jong Un, llevaran adelante la historia y la tradicion de victoria en la guerra."
