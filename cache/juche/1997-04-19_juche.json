When the spring comes,  students' struggle  in south Korea would grow fiercer and its leading role is played by \"Hanchongryon.\"\r\n   If one-million strong \"Hanchongryon\" joins in the anti-\"government\" struggle of  workers and other people of different sectors in south Korea calling for a probe into the truth behind the Hanbo loan scandal and for the repeal of the evil laws, the Kim Young Sam \"government\" will never get off scotfree.\r\n   That is why the Kim Young Sam group have sought to arrest the leading members of \"Hanchongryon\" before students' struggle goes into high gear and to foil the struggle of the independent and democratic forces.\r\n   But they are mistaken. The more they intensify their suppression of \"Hanchongryon\", the stronger the patriotic students' anti-Kim Young Sam sentiments will grow and the earlier the downfall of his regime will be accelerated. \r\n\r\n"
