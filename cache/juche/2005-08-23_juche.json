The chairman fully supported Songun politics of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a mockery of the peoples of the countries which suffered so much at its hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but a poor excuse of Japan to insist that it is inappropriate to compare it with Germany, the same war criminal and defeated country, over the issue of postwar settlement and it had already settled its crime-woven past as an issue between states.\r\n It is not a simple humanitarian issue but a sensitive international political pending issue and a historical task, the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay for Japan, to apologize and compensate for the human, moral and material damage it inflicted upon the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persistently tries to go without settling its past, it will never escape international isolation and destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is necessary to eternally glorify these exploits as an eternal foundation of the WPK and the Korean revolution and the most precious national treasure. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in an editorial. \r\n The editorial goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the great leader who has made the long history of his revolutionary leadership an epic of steady victory by pursuing original Songun politics. The last one decade occupies a most brilliant page in the glorious 40-odd year-long revolutionary history of his Songun leadership. \r\n Never has there been such a period in which astonishing victories and changes have taken place in all fields of the revolution and construction as the last one decade during which his Songun politics has been in force in all domains. Under the banner of Songun the DPRK has consolidated the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks in every way and firmly built up its military deterrent while providing a solid material foundation for building a great prosperous powerful nation. Modern production bases have been built in different parts of the country to meet requirements of the new century. The land of the country has been realigned as befitting the land of socialist Korea, a signal turn has taken place in the seed improvement and potato farming and many monumental edifices of eternal value have appeared.  He has firmly protected the destiny of the country, the nation and socialism despite the most difficult situation and the grimmest trial and brought about epoch-making   changes unprecedented in the history of the nation spanning thousands of years, thereby providing a solid foundation for eternal prosperity of Kim Il Sung's Korea and happiness for all generations to come. The Korean people will never forget these immortal exploits no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Included in his Songun revolutionary leadership exploits are all the ideological, theoretical, strategic and tactical guidelines that should be held fast to in the revolution and construction and the tradition of heroic struggle and a wealth of experience in which he has brought about epoch-making miracles and changes by turning adversity into a favorable situation, misfortune into a blessing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said exploits serve as an eternal lifeline of the country and revolution and treasure that the Korean nation should hand over to posterity and make them shine for all ages. The editorial calls for steadily developing in depth the work to glorify his feats in all fields in order to bring about a new surge in the drive to build a great prosperous powerful nation and accomplish the cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The cause of national reunification is one of all Koreans which can be achieved only when they join efforts and unite close as it is a work for the common interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cooperation for reunification and patriotism is one of the basic ways of implementing the joint declaration, a milestone of independent reunification.\r\n Realizing the above-said form of cooperation in implementing the joint declaration means all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas, the driving force for national reunification, pool their efforts and wisdom and achieve unity and solidarity for the common interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cooperation serves as an engine for strengthening the driving force for national reunification and remarkably increasing its role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of the country is a cause of national independence and it can be achieved only by the driving force of the Korean nation. This is an issue related to the destiny of the Koreans as it is an issue of rejoining their ties severed by foreign forces and establishing national sovereignty throughout Korea.  The issue related to the destiny of the nation should be left to the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to settle it by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned form of cooperation also serves as an effective means for tapping and using the potentials of the nation to the utmost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reunification is aimed at establishing national sovereignty throughout Korea and achieving the common progress and prosperity of the nation so that all Koreans can live in happiness in a reunified land. It is, therefore, quite natural and possible for all Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to solidarize, unite and cooperate with each other under the banner of reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve national reconciliation and unity, it is important to develop visits, contacts and wide-ranging dialogue among Koreans in the north and the south and overseas. The cooperation for reunification and patriotism can be achieved through visits, contacts and dialogue among Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unavoidable due obligation for any member of the divided Korean nation to find true worth of living on the road of reunification and patriotism.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they organized a committee for the reform and even made up the new Korean spelling system.\r\n In his historic work �gOn the Reform of Letters�h in December Juche 36(1947), the President, with a profound analysis of the obtaining situation, noted that the letter reform was a very important issue related to the future of the nation and that the Korean nation was a homogeneous one, which had lived in the same territory with the same language and letters from olden times. And he said that if the letters were reformed in the north only with the country divided into two owing to the occupation of south Korea by the U.S. imperialists after the liberation, the people in the north and the south could not read each other's publications and letters and the nation would remain divided in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During a conversation with Ri Kuk Ro, head of the Korean Linguistic Association, in the spring of 1949, he stated that the letter reform was a job to be done only after national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his famous work �gOn Compiling Korean Grammar Textbook Well�h in May 1950, he criticized the serious faults of the Korean grammar textbook (written in 1949) and indicated the direction and way for rewriting the textbook, saying that the part on the unscientific and anti-national six-letter alphabet should be deleted. In July 1954 he said that the \"proposal for simplifying Korean alphabet\" using 10 consonants at the end of syllables made in south Korea under the manipulation of the U.S. imperialists lacked science and logic and that the Korean spelling system should be based on the morphological principle without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When meeting a reverend from south Korea at the end of 1980s, the President made very important remarks concerning the compilation of a dictionary for the unified development of the national language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks served as a definite guarantee for linguistic uniformity in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The compilation of �gLarge Korean Dictionary�h is being carried on as an important work to implement the behest of President Kim Il Sung and to realize the noble idea of leader Kim Jong Il on achieving great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
