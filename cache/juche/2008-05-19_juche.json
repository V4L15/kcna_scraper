Such anti-reunification reckless moves are laying a grave barrier to the development of inter-Korean relations and the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should bitterly condemn this group, who is running amuck to obstruct the way of independent reunification and peace and prosperity while negating the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, and resolutely smash its anti-reunification moves. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
