But the opposition camps are mounting attacks over the \"Presidential Election\" funds.    \r\n   His decision also came from the thought that if the \"New Korea Party\" loses the forthcoming \"Presidential Elections\" the opposition party that seizes \"power\" will surely retaliate over the issue of the \"Presidential Election\" fund and that even if the \"NKP\" wins the \"Election,\" the next- term regime will not ensure his safety.\r\n   It is clear that Kim Young Sam will be imprisoned after the tenure of his office. Posters reading \"ex-'presidents' Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo are waiting for Kim Young Sam and his son in jail\" are seen everywhere and the people increasingly demand Kim's resignation.\r\n   In this situation he made up his mind to escape abroad before the expiration of his term and is thinking over when and how he will do so, the radio said. \r\n\r\n"

He commanded the unit to carry out the operation.    \r\n   He, who considered the attack on Pochonbo, a strategic point of the Japanese imperialists, to be a key to the successful advance into the homeland, issued an order of attack to the unit at 10 p.m. June 4, 1937.\r\n   As soon as he fired a signal, the police substation, which was the citadel of repression and atrocities was attacked, and  the forest conservation office, the subcounty office, the post office, the fire hall and other administrative centres of the enemy were engulfed in flames.\r\n   People gathered on the street and enthusiastically welcomed President Kim Il Sung, the great sun of the nation, shouting hurrah.\r\n   The President addressed a historic speech to the cheering compatriots under the title \"Let us fight on staunchly for the liberation of the fatherland\", inspiring the colonized nation with the hope for the victory in the revolution and encouraging the compatriots to the sacred struggle for national liberation.\r\n   In the sixth volume of the anti-Japanese revolution, the first part of his reminiscences \"With the Century\", he wrote:\r\n   \"The battle met the requirements of guerrilla warfare at the highest level. The selection of the objective, the timing and method to attack, especially surprise attack, the combination of brisk propaganda and powerful agitation through incendiary action -- all the processes of the operations were perfectly coordinated.\"\r\n   He also wrote: \"Korea, a lesser nation that had once exposed the crimes committed by Japan and begged for independence at an international peace conference, suddenly revealed itself to possess a revolutionary fighting force capable of dealing merciless blows at the army of Japan (which boasted of being one of the five world powers), a force that swiftly broke through the 'iron wall' built by the Japanese imperialists and dealt a crushing blow of punishment at the aggressors.\"\r\n   The guerrilla army unit's successive victory in the battles on Mt. Kusi and Kansam Hill demonstrated that Korea remained alive and gave the oppressed people the belief that if they fight, they would win.\r\n   The Pochonbo Battle was, indeed, a historic operation which revived the destiny of the nation and the fellow countrymen and dealt a serious political and military blow  at the Jjapanese imperialists. \r\n \r\n"

In particular, he created and successfully applied the Juche-oriented military idea and art.\r\n   He is, indeed, the greatest man who performed undying feats and left the valuable fortune of philosophical, socio- political, and military strategical theories for generations to come.\r\n   There have been many great men in the world but the only and one great strategist is President Kim Il Sung, who had wisely led the advancement of history, surmounting all sorts of ordeals. This is why humankind call with pleasure the 20th century Kim Il Sung's age and will eternally worship and laud him who left deep impressions in history.\r\n   The author also referred to the gifts of Secretary Kim Jong Il, who has made distinguished achievements while conducting ideological and theoretical activities and building the party, state and army for 30 odd years.\r\n   The 21st century will advance more dynamically towards socialism, by Secretary  Kim Jong Il, another great strategist who has taken the steering wheel of history, which was once taken by President Kim Il Sung, the author stressed. \r\n\r\n"
