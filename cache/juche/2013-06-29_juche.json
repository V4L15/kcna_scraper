            "content": "KCNA Commentary Urges U.S. to Have Proper Approach towards Nuclear Issue in Korea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- The U.S. unreasonable policy toward the DPRK is still blocking a solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of Defense in a recent \"strategic report on nuclear operation\" asserted that it can never recognize the validity of north Korea's pursuance of its nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Almost at the same time, the man nominated as assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, at a meeting of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, accused the DPRK of seeking unnecessary military capability to cope with imaginary threat. He cried out for actively promoting \"verifiable\" denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and making positive efforts to check the DPRK's proliferation efforts and threat from its neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an impudent provocation of the U.S. as it makes profound confusion of right and wrong to create impression that the DPRK is to blame for the tensions on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and huge armed forces supporting the policy are the greatest threat to the peace and security of the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the U.S. provocation and threat of a nuclear war against the DPRK are persistent, potential and outrageous as they are several decades old.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which introduced nuclear weapons into the Korean Peninsula for the first time, turned south Korea into the world's biggest nuclear arsenal and staged madcap nuclear war exercises to invade the DPRK for several decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is again the U.S. which undisguisedly revealed its sinister intention to mount a nuclear attack on the DPRK through trumpeting about \"preemptive nuclear attack\", \"nuclear posture review\" and \"extended deterrence.\" It worked out a scenario for nuclear attack, staging war exercises under the simulated conditions of a real war, pursuant to operational plans for carrying out it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the end of the Cold War, the nuclear powers decided to reduce nuclear weapons, but the U.S. has brandished its nuclear stick against the DPRK more desperately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration branded the satellite launch of the DPRK for peaceful purposes recognized by international law as \"long-range missile launch,\" kicking up a nuclear racket against it and making the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula more acute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality eloquently proves how just the DPRK was when it took the action of having access to nuclear deterrent for self-defence to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear policy is consistent whether the U.S. recognizes it or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If peace and stability are to settle on this land, it is necessary to put an end to the U.S. nuclear war moves, first of all. There can be no denuclearization of the peninsula without this process. This is truth proven by the more than half a century long-history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear deterrent is a legitimate exercise of the right to self-defense as it reflects a bitter historical lesson and reality in which its sincere efforts for the denuclearization of the peninsula have been disregarded and the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK has increased day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the peninsula without the defusing of the U.S. threat is meaningless and it can never be realized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is foolishly claiming that it can negotiate with the DPRK when it takes measures for denuclearization, first of all, though it is letting nuclear bombers fly. This behavior cannot but cause a vicious cycle of tensions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop its nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK and halt all forms of provocations including \"sanctions\" before urging it to show its sincere will for denuclearization first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. provocative nuclear racket against the DPRK will only end in destruction and Washington will be its greatest victim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its proper approach towards the nuclear issue on the peninsula would give a solution to the issue."
