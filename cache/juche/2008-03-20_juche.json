This is aimed at destroying Chongryon, impairing the authority and dignity of the DPRK and stoking bitterness toward Chongryon and the DPRK in Japanese society and, at the same time, creating an environment for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK bitterly condemns such campaign for suppression as a terrorist act of wantonly violating the sovereignty of the DPRK and a hideous act of ruthlessly trampling underfoot the vital rights of the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the Japanese reactionaries are contemplating extending the sanctions against the DPRK including the embargo on the ship \"Mangyongbong-92\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceaseless frantic anti-Chongryon and anti-DPRK campaign being stepped up by the present Japanese regime is an indication that they are pursuing the same hostile policy to stifle the DPRK as done by the preceding regimes. They are talking about \"normalized Japan-DPRK relations\" but the reality proves that it is nothing but hypocrisy and the situation is getting all the more serious and complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese government would be well advised to clearly understand the grave and serious nature of the situation, stop at once the suppression of Chongryon and behave itself in the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolutely intolerable are the criminal moves of the Japanese reactionaries to seize the Central Hall of Chongryon, destroy Chongryon and tarnish the dignity and authority of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on \"Unyo-maru\" Incident \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 19 (KCNA) -- The \"Unyo-maru\" incident orchestrated by Japan in 1875 was a prelude to its actions to implement the brigandish policy of aggression towards Korea as it was a criminal armed provocation perpetrated by it against the latter in accordance with its \"diplomacy for conquering Korea\" in which the \"Theory of Conquest of Korea,\" a doctrine that called for putting Korea under Japan's control by force of arms, was treated as a policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cites data to prove the fact that the Japanese aggressors deliberately faked up the above-said incident to invent a pretext for forcing an unequal treaty upon the Korean government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the \"negotiations on reestablishing diplomatic relations between Korea and Japan\" were under way between the two governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan increased its pressure on Korea by demonstrating its military muscle while pressing the Korean government to meet the unacceptable demands at the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Japan failed in its attempt to attain its purpose of invading Korea by way of \"negotiations,\" it illegally intruded its warship \"Unyo\" into Pusan Port in May 1875. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese aggressors worked hard to achieve their aim with ease by pressurizing the Korean government, describing its ship's intrusion into Pusan Port as a \"regular sailing exercise\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  When their scenario proved futile, they intruded into the waters off Kanghwa Island by the above-mentioned warship in September in an attempt to occupy the Chojijin fort. But their attempt was frustrated by the Korean garrison standing guard over the Kanghwa Strait and Chojijin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later the pirates of the warship intruded into Hangsan Island and Yongjong Island, destroying the forts there and setting fire to inhabitants' houses and plundering them of their properties. The Korean garrison dealt blows at the Japanese pirates, driving them out of the islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being hard facts, the Japanese aggressors intruded its expeditionary fleet made up of six warships into Kanghwa Island in January of 1876 under the absurd pretext that \"the Korean side perpetrated hostile acts against Japan.\" On February 27 they threatened the feudal government of Ri Dynasty to accept its demands, forcing it to conclude the aggressive and shacking \"Korea-Japan Defence Provisions\" (\"Kanghwado Treaty\") which had 12 paragraphs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the subsequent period, the Japanese imperialists pressurized the Korean government by force of arms and forced it to conclude various unequal \"treaties,\" thus turning Korea into their colony and imposing untold misfortune and sufferings upon its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several decades have passed since Japan's defeat but the Japanese militarists remain unchanged in their wild ambition to dominate Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese militarists stage a comeback to Korea at any cost, oblivious of the historical lesson,  the Korean people will take a thousand-fold revenge upon them and punish the aggressors in order to have their towering grudge against Japan settled.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He blustered that Japan calls for the \"improvement of the human rights record in north Korea including the settlement of the abduction issue\" and it requests member nations to agree on extending the mechanism of a special rapporteur in charge of the \"human rights situation\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson Wednesday observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe smear campaign launched again by the Japanese reactionaries against the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" indicates that the Fukuda regime is pursuing the same hostile policy toward the DPRK as that done by its predecessors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The row kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries in a bid to hurt the dignity of the DPRK against the backdrop of their intensified suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) is an intolerable grave act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, Japan is not entitled to talk about somebody's \"human rights issue\" as it is the world's worst human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is keen to repeat its crime-woven history, instead of making honest apology and reparation for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' escalated suppression of Chongryon is a clear proof of its harsh hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' anti-DPRK ruckus over its \"human rights issue\" was prompted by their political purposes to tarnish the image of the DPRK in the international arena, secure a pretext for justifying their hostile policy towards the DPRK, prod other countries into putting international pressure upon it and thus evade their responsibility for making reparation for their past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never remain an onlooker to the moves of the Japanese reactionaries to escalate the confrontation with it in a bid to realize their dastardly ulterior design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to behave themselves, thinking twice over the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless campaign for confrontation with the DPRK, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
