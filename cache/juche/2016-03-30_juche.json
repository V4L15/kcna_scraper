This is, in fact, a bluffing of the weak and last-ditch effort of those at the death's door.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is staging such grave military actions as \"beheading operation\" and \"operation for advancing into Pyongyang\" in a bid to totally stifle the independent DPRK. It is, however, failing to judge what catastrophic consequences would be entailed by the saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. possessed A-bombs in the 1950s but was defeated by the DPRK equipped with rifles only. It brought about the beginning of a downhill turn for the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of the DPRK has grown remarkably stronger than what it used to be in the period of the Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is the only country fully ready for an all-out war against the U.S. with the firm will and capability to mercilessly punish it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It succeeded in H-bomb test and miniaturized nuclear weapons and is manufacturing strategic weapons requiring ultra-modern technology by relying on the Juche-oriented defence industry despite hostile forces' unprecedented sanctions and pressure. It is also equipped with latest military hardware such as various type guided missiles with high accuracy, modern tanks, armored cars, multiple rocket launchers, drones and battle ships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army has recently conducted a ballistic rocket launching drill in the way of exploding nuclear warhead in the designated altitude under the simulated conditions of attacking the ports in the enemy-controlled area to which overseas aggression forces would be hurled. This demonstrated its capability enough to destroy even USS Stennis nuclear aircraft carrier task force to pieces in a jiffy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the ultra-modern striking means of the DPRK are accurately targeted on the citadels of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop rash acts, paying heed to the above-said far-sighted public opinion."
