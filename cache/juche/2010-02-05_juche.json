Then he advanced the important tasks that would serve as guidelines in further developing the Juche art.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The audience included Kim Yong Chun, vice-chairman of the NDC and minister of the People's Armed Forces, Kim Jong Gak, member of the NDC and first deputy director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, and other commanding officers of the army, Secretaries Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, Department Directors Kim Kyong Hui, Jang Song Thaek and Kim Yang Gon and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee and Kang Sok Ju, first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among them were also Valery Sukhinin, Russian ambassador to the DPRK, and diplomats of his embassy."

            "content": "American Trespasser Interviewed\r\n Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- As already reported, American national Robert Park was detained for trespassing on the northern border of the DPRK in December last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t He was interviewed by KCNA at his proposal while he was under investigation by the relevant organ of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the interview, he said that he was taken in by the false rumor spread by the West and committed a criminal act in the end. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  I trespassed on the border due to my wrong understanding of the DPRK caused by the false propaganda made by the West to tarnish its image.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The West is massively feeding \"Children of Secret State\", \"Seoul Train\" and other documentary videos with stories about non-existent \"human rights abuses\" and \"mass killings\" in the DPRK and \"unbearable sufferings\" of its Christians and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This false propaganda prompted me, a Christian, to entertain a biased view on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So I didn't know what to do at that time. I just prayed and fasted and that was my initial response, but year by year more news reports, international media reports came and there were more videos saying the same thing, in fact, saying that it was getting worse, and so that's why I started to become more and more distraught. If there are people in concentration camps, if Christians are dying like this, if there is starvation I have to die with them. If I help them I would go to Heaven but if I don't help them I would go to Hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At last I made up my mind to go to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon trespassing on the border, I thought I would be either shot to death by soldiers or thrown behind bars, prompted by Americans' false propaganda about the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the moment I trespassed on the border, the attitude of soldiers toward the trespasser made me change my mind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only service personnel but all those I met in the DPRK treated me in a kind and gentlemanly manner and protected my rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I have never seen such kind and generous people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People have been incredibly kind and generous here to me, very concerned for my physical health as never before in my life. I mean, my family, of course, is concerned about my physical health but people here have been constantly concerned and I'm very thankful for their love.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another shocking fact I experienced during my stay in the DPRK is that the religious freedom is fully ensured in the DPRK, a reality different from what is claimed by the West.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being a devout Christian, I thought such things as praying are unimaginable in the DPRK due to the suppression of religion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I, however, gradually became aware that I was wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everybody neither regarded praying as something unusual nor disturbed it. I was provided with conditions for praying everyday as I wished. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What astonished me more was that a bible was returned to me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fact alone convinced me that the religious freedom is fully ensured in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I came to have stronger belief as I had an opportunity to attend the service in the Pongsu Church in Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I worshipped and there, there was the Jondosa, there, there was a pastor, there was a choir, they knew the hymns, they knew the word of God. That's why I was completely amazed. But I began to weep and weep in the Christian service because I learned that there are churches and Christians such as Pongsu Kyohoe (Church) in different cities and regions all throughout the DPRK. They worship, pray and preach freely the word of the Bible and Christ word. I've learned that in the DPRK people can read and believe whatever they want, whenever they want, wherever they want, that there's complete religious freedom for all people everywhere throughout the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What I have seen and heard in the DPRK convinced me that I misunderstood it. So I seriously repented of the wrong I committed, taken in by the West's false propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I would not have committed such crime if I had known that the DPRK respects the rights of all the people and guarantees their freedom and they enjoy a happy and stable life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I have felt shock, embarrassment, shame. Here I'm in the lands where people respect human rights and, not just respecting human rights, they have actually loved me and showed me more than just human rights. They have shown me grace. I repent and ask for forgiveness to the DPRK for my misunderstanding totally DPRK's reality and my criminal illegal behavior. Had I known the reality of the DPRK, what I've learned here, what I have been shown here, what I've been taught here, what I've been informed here by all the kind people here about the DPRK, I would have never done what I did on the December 25th and I repent and I'm very sorry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by my desire to redeem the crime I committed against the government of the DPRK, I would make every effort to let those who misunderstand the DPRK properly know what I experienced here so they may have a correct understanding of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, as a Christian, expressed his will to earnestly pray so reunification may be achieved and peace settle on the Korean Peninsula as early as possible."

Se puede decir que eso fue precisamente lo que pude intentar primero. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, a medida que pasaba el tiempo, me llegaron mas noticias y programas sobre tal situacion insistiendo en que esta se empeoraba cada dia mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Tales noticias me inquietaban de manera indescriptible. Si muchas personas se murieran de hambre en los campos de concentracion y los cristianos estuvieran tambien en tal situacion, yo deberia morir junto con ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si logro ayudarles, ire al paraiso y en el caso contrario, al infierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues de esta reflexion,  tome por fin la decision de ir a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando cruce la frontera, supuse que seria fusilado o encarcelado acogiendome a la propaganda erronea de EE.UU. sobre Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, cambie de parecer al ver la actitud con que los militares trataron a mi, que era criminal, en el momento de cruzar ilegalmente la frontera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo solo los militares sino tambien todos los que se habian reunido conmigo me trataron con amabilidad respetando mis derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYo nunca he visto antes a los hombres tan generosos como aquellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas personas de aqui me trataron de manera increiblemente amable y generosa. Y se preocuparon por mi salud mas que mis padres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstoy muy agradecido de ese gran afecto por mi.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante mi estancia en la RPDC, he sido testigo presencial de otro hecho impresionante. Es que en Corea es asegurada la libertad de la religion, al contrario de la propaganda del Occidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYo, que soy un cristiano devoto, tenia entendido que en la RPDC no se puede pensar en el rezo siquiera debido a la represion sobre la religion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, me di cuenta poco a poco de que estuve equivocado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie se oponia a mi rezo sin considerarlo extrano ni estropearlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el contrario, me facilitaron las condiciones para que yo pudiera hacer oraciones todos los dias con sosiego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe quede mas sorprendente todavia cuando me devolvieron la Biblia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho basto para que yo tuviera la certeza de que en la RPDC es garantizada totalmente la libertad de la religion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal certeza se hizo mas solida cuando participe en la misa realizada en la Iglesia de Pongsu en la ciudad de Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParticipe en esa misa en que estuvieron presentes el predicador y el pastor. Ademas, vi al coro que conocia el himno religioso. Esto me sorprendio mucho. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este oficio me quede llorando emocionado al saber que en Corea hay las iglesias de la cristiandad como la de Pongsu y los cristianos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe he informado tambien de que en varias zonas de la RPDC se realizan las predicaciones y los cristianos leen la Biblia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSupe que en Corea se asegura plenamente la libertad de la religion y las personas pueden leer y creer todo lo que quieran en cualquier momento y en cualquier lugar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A traves de todos los hechos vistos y oidos,  reconoci que estuve malentendido de Corea y reflexione seriamente de mi crimen cometido siendo enganado por la demagogia del Occidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi hubiera conocido que la RPDC respeta los derechos humanos de los hombres y les ofrece la libertad y que todos ellos llevan una vida feliz y estable, yo no habria cometido tal crimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Realmente, me quede impresionado, perplejo y avergonzado. Los habitantes de aqui me trataron con amor respetando mis derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYo pido sinceras disculpas al gobierno de la RPDC por el acto ilegal en que he incurrido por la mala comprension de la realidad de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi yo hubiera sabido antes todo lo que he oido, visto y conocido aqui y la gentileza de todos los hombres de aqui, nunca habria cometido esa accion ilegal cometida el 25 de diciembre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMe arrepiento sinceramente de mi culpa y pido disculpas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara purgar mi culpa cometida ante el gobierno de la RPDC, me esforzare en todo lo posible por dar a conocer correctamente todo lo que he experimentado a quienes piensan mal de Corea para que ellos tengan la correcta concepcion de esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo cristiano, rezare con afan por hacer que se logre cuanto antes la reunificacion y llegue la paz en la Peninsula Coreana."
