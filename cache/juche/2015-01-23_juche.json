He talked rubbish that the DPRK is taking a violent and threatening stand toward its neighboring countries, it is mulling tipping ballistic missiles with nukes under a military nuclear program for aggression and the international community should not repeat the error made at the negotiations with north Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable insult and provocation to the dignity and social system in the DPRK and the choice made by its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to conceal its true colors as a harasser of Mideast peace the successive rulers of Israel have been apt to talk about the \"missile deal and nuclear cooperation\" between the DPRK and Mideast countries.  Not content with this, Israel recently went the lengths of hurting the DPRK's dignified social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people-centred Korean-style socialist system is the most advantageous system under which the people became masters of everything and it serves them and the DPRK's nuclear weapons are powerful deterrence to protect its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Israeli prime minister uttered is a revelation of his ignorance of the social system in the DPRK and nothing but his base behavior to please the forces hostile to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Israel not only represents dictatorial forces for aggression that trample down the legitimate right of the Palestinian people and indiscriminately kill them but also is a rogue group that poses a nuclear threat and makes terrorist attack on its neighboring countries with lots of nuclear weapons under the U.S. patronage in disregard of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everybody knows about the shamelessness of Israel telling lies and making fabrications and pointing accusing fingers to others to justify its criminal acts and evade the censure and condemnation by the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK warns Israel against refusing to abandon its inveterate bad habit of taking issue with the former quite often in its interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Israel had better roll back, to begin with,  its inhuman and bellicose policy as an arch criminal killing innocent Palestinians and disturber of peace in Mideast before pulling up others."

Korean Authorities Should Not Pay Lip Service to Issue of \"Divided Families\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean authorities asserted that it is the \"national obligation\" and the \"top priority task\" to settle the issue of \"divided families,\" adding that it is necessary to realize the reunion of \"divided families\" if the north-south dialogue is resumed.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive, in particular, urged the north to come out for dialogue with \"open heart\" in order to fundamentally solve the issue of \"divided families.\" She claimed that the north was to blame for the failure to arrange the reunion of \"divided families.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in a statement on Friday terms this acts of misinterpreting the essence of the grave situation where the issue of the inter-Korean relations including the reunion of divided families and relatives from the north and the south remain unsettled, and acts of misleading the public. This is an unbearable mockery and insult to the desire of all Koreans for the improved inter-Korean relations and the nation's unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was due to such hurdles as the \"May 24 steps\" taken by the south Korean authorities that reunification events which had been brisk between the north and the south since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and cooperation undertakings between the north and the south, including joint unearthing of historical relics, academic symposiums, social and cultural exchange and tour of Mt. Kumgang, were suspended overnight and the most urgent humanitarian cooperation undertakings including the reunion of divided families and relatives failed to make progress. All these facts are well known to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are talking a lot about the reunion of \"divided families\" and \"exchange at non-governmental level\" after blocking the north-south exchange and cooperation by themselves. This is self-contradictory sophism and height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how noisily the south Korean authorities may talk about the reunion of \"divided families\" and \"exchange\" after building institutional barriers barring the reunion of divided families and relatives, no one will pay heed to those useless wordplays and hypocritical remarks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even if the reunion of divided families and relatives takes place with \"the May 24 steps\" remaining in force, it will only serve the purpose of propaganda and will not help fundamentally settle the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are truly concerned for the humanitarian issue, they should not only pay lip-service to the issue of \"divided families\" but lift before anything else the steps deliberately taken for confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they have true will to settle the issue of the north-south relations including the reunion of divided families and relatives, they should not play poor tricks to misrepresent the essence of the present situation and mislead the public but show their will in practice from a proper stand on the DPRK's just proposal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will follow what change the south Korean authorities will make in their stance together with all the compatriots."

La cada dia mas abierta campana contra las \"fuerzas pro-Norte\" constituye una declaracion oficial de que no cesaran la represion contra las fuerzas progresistas y pro-reunificacion aunque se abra el dialogo entre ambas partes coreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, lo que debe ser eliminado urgentemente por la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion, no son las supuestas fuerzas \"pro-Norte\" sino la \"tendencia proyanqui\" de las autoridades surcoreanas que obedecen a la demanda gangsteril de toda indole de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede esperar ningun dialogo sincero entre ambas partes coreanas ni la mejora de relaciones N-S sin frenar la intervencion de EE.UU. en los asuntos internos de nuestra nacion y mientras las autoridades surcoreanas mantengan su posicion seguidora a EE.UU. y su naturaleza conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben cesar de inmediato las acciones antinacionales y anti-reunificacion, que niegan y hostilizan a la contraparte de dialogo y desafian a la aspiracion y anhelo de los compatriotas, y tomar una posicion sincera para el mejoramiento de relaciones Norte-Sur."
