            "content": "DPRK's invariable internal and external policies\r\nPyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- Foreign mass media gave wide publicity to the letter sent by Secretary Kim Jong Il to U.S.-resident Korean woman journalist Mun Myong Ja. particularly, they highlighted the letter's dealing with issues of achieving the peaceful reunification of Korea and improving relations between the DPRK and the United States and between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   In the letter, Secretary Kim Jong Il reclarified the principled stand and line of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Government of the DPRK toward these issues.\r\n   The WPK's principled stand and line toward national reunification, the greatest desire of the nation, are invariable and consistent.\r\n   The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country, which were advanced by President Kim Il Sung, are guidelines which must be invariably held fast to in solving the issue of Korea's reunification. Comprehensively expounded there are basic principles of national reunification and ways to put them into practice.\r\n   The three principles of national reunification are the basic charter which clearly indicates how to achieve the reunification.\r\n   Consummated there is the idea that national reunification must be achieved independently by the Korean nation itself free from outside interference, by peaceful means without resorting to arms and on the principle of promoting great national unity transcending differences in ideology and system.\r\n   The proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo is the most reasonable overture for national reunification which is welcomed by the whole nation and which can be accepted by the north and the south. It expounds that under the actual condition of the Korean Peninsula in which different ideas and systems exist in the north and the south owing to the national division by outside forces, national reunification must be achieved through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments without conquering the other side or being conquered by the other. Accordingly, this proposal is the most fair and realistic way which makes it possible to achieve the peaceful reunification in the interests of the north and the south.\r\n   The 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation indicates all problems arising in achieving the great national unity including its general goal and ideological foundation and the principle of unity and its practical way.\r\n   The three principles of national reunification, the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation are three major pillars and charters which must be invariably adhered to by the Korean nation for the reunification of the country.\r\n   Independence, peace and friendship are a noble idea of the consistent foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government. In this idea, we are developing relations with other countries.\r\n   In relations with the United States, too, we maintain this idea and principles of activities.\r\n   The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is of great importance in improving relations between the two countries. It is a milestone with which to solve the pending matters of the Korean Peninsula. Laid down in it are specific ways to improve abnormal relations between the two countries. How the framework is implemented is a touchstone which decides on whether the relations between the two nations will be improved or not.\r\n   We have faithfully and sincerely implemented all the points agreed upon in the framework.\r\n   However, some conservative hardliners of the United States, resorting to an anti-DPRK hostile policy, have put political and military pressure upon the DPRK to stifle it with strength, thus laying hurdles in the way of implementing the framework. These are stumbling-blocks in improving the abnormal DPRK-U.S. relations.\r\n   If the framework is to be implemented smoothly, these stumbling-blocks must be removed.\r\n   The United States must completely throw away the anachronistic concept of confrontation with the DPRK and approach it with friendly feelings and good faith. This is a key to and a starting point of improving the relations between the DPRK and the United States.\r\n   Consistent is the principled stand of our republic to establish good-neighbourhood with Japan.\r\n   We have maintained friendly relations with the Japanese people and kept the door open for dialogue with the Japanese authorities. We have never turned our back on the issue of improving relations with Japan.\r\n   Abnormal relations between the DPRK and Japan have continued because of the Japanese authorities' hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   Regarding the DPRK as a thorn in the flesh, Japan has resorted to a hostile policy toward the DPRK. And it has zealously tried to render the situation on the Korean Peninsula strained, siding with the south Korean puppets.\r\n   The right-wing reactionaries of Japan have hindered the improvement of relations between the DPRK and Japan with outcries over \"emergency on the Korean Peninsula\". They have gone the length of throwing a wet blanket over the humanitarian assistance to the DPRK from the international community.\r\n  This will only create obstacles in the way of improving the DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n   The key to solving issues related to the DPRK's relations with the United States and Japan depends upon what attitude and stand the two nations take toward the issues.\r\n   We will follow the attitude of the two countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Giving a lecture at the hall of Yonghung Private School, he stressed the people should have the spirit of loving the country and the nation.\r\n   He also went to Pyolgyo-Myon, Posong county, which is linked with Sunchon bay on the central southern coast, to inaugurate the KNS Posong branch. As a result, the anti-Japanese revolutionary underground organization was expanded to the southernmost part of the country.\r\n   Meanwhile, he dispatched KNA members to Pusan and Kyongsang provincial areas to set up branches.\r\n   The KNA, whose branches were set up in broad areas from the northernmost part to the southernmost part of the country and overseas, played a big role in inspiring the patriotic people to the anti-Japanese struggle. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
