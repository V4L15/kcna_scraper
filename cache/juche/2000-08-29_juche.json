It put up the revolutionary slogan \"Let us meet the requirements of Juche in ideology, technology and culture  and \"Let the whole party and all the people turn out in the movement while converting it into one of the popular masses themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    In the crucible of the movement people's mode of thinking and work style underwent a radical change, the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses rapidly mounted and many three-revolution standard bearers, unassuming heroes and heroines and unassuming men of meritorious services were produced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a little more than 10 years after the start of the movement, the Tower of the Juche Idea, the arch of triumph, the Changgwang Street, Munsu Street, the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, Changgwang Health Complex and other grand monumental edifices were built to change the appearance of the country beyond recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world-level west sea barrage and  ore pressing plant no. 3 of the Komdok Mine with an annual production capacity of 10 million tons made their appearance and miracles such as the manufacture of a 10,000-ton press were reported one after another to augment the economic power of the country significantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The industrial production in the period of the second seven-year plan (1978-1984) showed an annual growth of 12.2 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The successful implementation of the WPK's policy on intellectualizing all members of society led to the appearance of hundreds of thousands of intellectuals and brought about a radical change in the people's cultural and moral life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK clarified principled issues and ways to further develop the movement through various meetings including the meeting of the three revolution team members held in 1984 and the meeting of the frontrankers in the Three-Revolution Red Flag Movement in 1986. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has brought a new peak to the socialist construction by ensuring that the movement was conducted in close combination with various mass movements including drives to create the \"Speed of the 80s\" and the \"Speed of the 90s\". at least 10,000 units have won the Three-Revolution Red Flag.    \r\n\r\n"
