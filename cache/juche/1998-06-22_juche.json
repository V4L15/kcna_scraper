            "content": "Spokesman for Foreign Ministry on lifting of economic sanctions\r\n  Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Of late the United States, while implying that there may be examination on the lifting of economic sanctions against the DPRK, said that for progress in the matter the DPRK should join in what it calls \"engagement policy\".\r\n   A spokesman for the foreign ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today in this regard.\r\n   He said:\r\n   We take a serious note of its utterances because they clearly show that the U.S. Still intends to continue its hostile policy towards the DPRK through its sustained economic sanctions against the DPRK.\r\n   The easing of sanctions is one of the basic duties that the U.S. is obliged to perform under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement= It has been discusssed as an outstanding issue for nearly four years in the relations between the two countries.\r\n   As already known,  the U.S. must stop pursuing the hostile policy through the lifting of sanctions against the DPRK as the very duty it is obliged to perform in accordance with the framework agreement.\r\n   We, true to the framework agreement, made a political decision of sacrificing our policy of independent nuclear power industry,  stopped running all graphite moderated reactors and their facilities and guaranteed a safe storage of spent fuel to perform our duty sincerely.\r\n   And we have already lifted all curbs in economic and trade relations with the U.S. in early 1995 to discharge our duty in accordance with an article on pulling down the barrier of trade and investment which is stipulated in the framework agreement.\r\n   Proceeding from the stand we have invariably maintained for peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, we made a bold decision of participating in the \"four-way talks\" and already made efforts for peace process.\r\n   The U.S., therefore, has enough justification to lift sanctions against the DPRK from its point of view.\r\n   It, however, has not yet made a political decision to stop pursuing its policy hostile towards the DPRK in response to our bold policy.\r\n   It has lifted token sanctions in travel, communications services and other non-essential areas. It has not allowed trade and investment nor lifted sanctions  awfully necessary for doing away with the hostile relations with the DPRK.\r\n   It advertised that it lifted a series of sanctions. But, it, far from lifting the freeze of our assets, has refused to permit settlement of dollars through U.S. banks. It does not allow u.s. Citizens to use credit cards during their visit to the DPRK.\r\n   Worse still, it has not lifted sanctions for nearly four years, though it is obliged to lift sanctions under the agreement, and is persistently trying to get political concessions from the DPRK  by raising it as preconditions for settlement of outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S., such as progress in the \"four-way talks\" which have a long way to go.\r\n   This makes us suspect that the U.S. intends to give up the implementation of the agreement, though it pays lip-services to the implementation.\r\n   The U.S. continues raising one precondition after another for lifting sanctions against us because it seeks only to see \"change\" of our system and to disarm us.\r\n   Though we value the agreement and regard the lifting of sanctions as necessary, we will never make an offering of our \"policy shift\" and \"disarmament\".\r\n   We who consider independence our lifeblood place the defence of the sovereignty of the country and nation above anything else. Lifting of sanctions is necessary for it as well.\r\n   We repeatedly say the main idea of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement is a stop to the hostile policy.\r\n   If the U.S. lifts sanctions against the DPRK, therefore, it will prove the willingness of the U.S. not to pursue the hostile policy towards the DPRK any longer.\r\n   Herein lies the reason why the DPRK considers the implementation of the agreed framework to be important.\r\n   If the U.S. which is obliged to stop pursuing the hostile policy of sanctions against us under the agreement, tries to get concessions from the DPRK by using it as bait,  we will not be interested in such preconditional lifting of sanctions at all.\r\n   If the U.S. refuses to take positive steps, persistently insisting on its unreasonable stand on the lifting of economic sanctions against the DPRK,  the DPRK will never trust in the U.S., but come to a conclusion that the U.S. has no willingness to implement the agreement.\r\n   This will inevitably encourage us to take the road of  our own choice.\r\n   Whether the U.S. lifts the sanctions fundamentally and substantially will be regarded as a yardstick showing whether it is ready to stop pursuing the hostile policy towards the DPRK and improve the relations with the DPRK and whether it is also ready to implement the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement smoothly.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

He indicated important tasks to strengthen the Juche-based artillery of Korea.\r\n   He went round the company's cultural, educational and logistic facilities and barracks compound.\r\n   He looked at trees planted by soldiers at the company dozens of years ago. He appreciated the patriotic feats of those soldiers and said that the KPA soldiers readily dedicate their life to the sake of the motherland because they are true patriots who love even a tree and grass of the motherland.\r\n   He met with two pairs of twins and other soldiers in the company. He heard them sing songs and spent a pleasant time together with soldiers.\r\n   He gave the company a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle and had a picture taken with the company's soldiers.\r\n   He enjoyed a performance given by the art propaganda squad of the unit on the day of artillerymen.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean chief executive's American tour denounced\r\n Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) made public a statement on June 17 denouncing the flunkeyist and treacherous visit of the present South Korean chief executive to the United States, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.\r\n   Branding his U.S. visit as a nation-ruining trip which drove people to disappointment and despair, the spokesman said:\r\n   The present chief executive begged for more foreign capital at a time when South Korea, an economic colony of the United States, becomes a prey for foreign monopoly capital. This despicable act reminds people of the flunkeyist and treacherous misbehaviour of the successive pro-american stooges of \"Chongwadae\" who served only for the interests of the United States.\r\n   During his stay in the United States, he unhesitatingly begged for the U.S. troops' permanent presence in South Korea on the basis of \"security alliance between South Korea and the united states.\" by doing so, he abused the national issue for political bargain to further deepen dependence upon the United States.\r\n   The NDFSK, together with all the people, will more daringly fight to drive outside forces and the group of pro-American flunkeyists and traitors out of this land, a colony, and build a new independent and democratic society, a reunified and developed country.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Only Japan, however, is refusing to admit its past crimes and  apologize and compensate for them.\r\n   Historically, Japan has resorted to every conceivable means to flee from its responsibility for the settlement of the past wrongdoings. \r\n   If the Japanese authorities are willing to liquidate the past, they must admit the past crimes first of all.\r\n   The further Japan delays the liquidation, the heavier its responsiblity will be.\r\n   The foolish behaviour of Japan, which is neglecting the trend of the time and avoiding the liquidation, will result in further revealing before the world its moral vulgarity based on no sense of elementary obligation.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must give deep thought to the matter.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Painter Sim Sa Jong\r\nPyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Sim Sa Jong (1707-1789) is one of Korea's painters in the 18th century. He was born in an intellectual's family and was fond of drawing since his boyhood. He studied the Korean old paintings, assimilating their merits.\r\n   By his own effort Sim created his own realistic style in drawing, particularly in genres of figures and animals. \r\n   Typical of his products are \"Summer Hut,\" \"Winter,\" \"the Moonlight on the Wicker Gate,\" \"River Fishing in Spring\" and \"Pheasant and Eagle.\"\r\n   The \"Summer Hut\" (117x59.5 cm) shows a wealthy intellectual in a writing posture in a country hut. It reflects the rustic scene and the life of the idle privileged class. In the foreground are seen green trees and a flowing stream. The hut is surrounded by a fence, and near the stairs up the valley two common people with bundles of firewood in their arms are passing by while conversing.\r\n   The rustic drawing evokes the painter's identification with his country. The picture with a compact structure is produced by refined strokes.\r\n   The red desk and the bluish green background make a sharp contrast. The four characters written on the left edge of the paper mean the painter's mockery of the protagonist.\r\n   \"Winter\" also reveals the painter's idiosyncrasy. The tall mountains standing like scrolls and  a straw-thatched house at the foot of a hill focus on the rural life in silent nature. The imposing structure and strong strokes of brush leave a deep impression on the viewers.\r\n   \"River Fishing in Spring\" shows a merry fishing and amusements. The \"Pheasant and Eagle,\" which is well-known to our people is in ink colouring. An eagle staring at his prey on the rock and a pheasant caught with fear are well portrayed. The tension between two animals is accentuated by twigs of trees which seem trembling and the sparrows starting to fly off.\r\n   Sim produced many paintings showing nature in simple, lucid traditional methods.\r\n   The \"Summer Hut\" is preserved in the Korean art gallery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
