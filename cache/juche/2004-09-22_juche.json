            "content": "U.S. Denounced for Hindering Settlement of Nuclear Issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 21 (KCNA) -- The Bush group some time ago wrote down \"complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\" in the U.S. Republican Party platform, thereby getting more outspoken in revealing its intention to resort to coercion and preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n Papers here Tuesday say the Bush group disclosed its pernicious hostile policy to stifle the DPRK when it again came out with its brigandish demand in the Republican Party's platform, openly revealing its intention to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Rodong Sinmun analyst notes that the insistent call of the U.S. for the \"complete, verifiable and irreversible dismantlement of nuclear program\" is a robber-like demand that the assailant imposes upon the victim. Terming it quite unwarrantable, the news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when the U.S. shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea and posed nuclear threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, it is the prerequisite and best way for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue for the U.S. to discontinue its nuclear threat to the DPRK and renounce its hostile policy towards the latter. But the U.S. adamantly refuses to abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK, while persistently seeking to disarm it and stifle it by military force. This fact clearly shows that the U.S. is the very one standing in the way of the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms buildup it is promoting in real earnest under the cloak of \"cutback\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea makes it all the clearer that the U.S. has not given up its scheme to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK and there is not the slightest change in its policy to stifle the latter with nuclear means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group seems to be too much ignorant of the DPRK. There can be no unprincipled compromise and humiliating concession on the part of the DPRK in the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in its commentary declares that the nuclear deterrent of the DPRK is for self-defense from a to z, adding: Therefore, the tougher the U.S. becomes in its military threat to the DPRK and its attempts to stifle it, the more determined the latter gets in reinforcing its self-defensive nuclear deterrent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
