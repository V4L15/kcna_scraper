Paektu as great persons and Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership exploits and photos and books introducing the real picture of Songun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Miriam Pelegrini Feri, president of the Italian Committee for the Study of the Songun Idea for Independence and Sovereignty, said that the Democratic People's Republic of Korea has firmly defended its socialist system and positively developed the national economy despite the imperialists' all forms of attack and accusation thanks to the Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is the most just political mode for firmly defending the sovereignty of the country from the imperialists' aggression and guaranteeing the economic development and prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all members of the committee to make an active contribution to defending Korean-style socialism, take an active part in seminars on the Juche idea and the Songun idea and widely disseminate them among broad sections of people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The young people should join the People's Army to glorify their youthful days with arms and fully discharge their mission in the fields of agriculture, power, coal and metal industries and railway transport, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stressed the need for the youths to successfully build the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station and other grand monumental edifices and solve scientific and technical problems arising in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and the need for students to prepare themselves to be competent scientific and technical personnel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting adopted an appeal to the five million-strong young vanguard across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called upon the young people to become fiery fighters in devotedly safeguarding the leader and staunch revolutionary fighters who are thoroughly equipped with the Juche idea and the Songun idea of the Workers' Party of Korea and have acquired the revolutionary soldier spirit as their lifeblood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The young people, it said, should become performers of feats and young heroes in the vigorous struggle to build an economic power in the 21st century through a high-pitched drive for effecting a great Songun revolutionary surge just as the Korean people brought about the great Chollima upswing after the war to advance toward a socialist power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, officials concerned and youth and students in the city of Pyongyang.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That is to say, the Japanese reactionaries seek to use the signboard of \"defence\" for pulling  the wool over the eyes of the Asian countries and the rest of the world that remain cautious against their moves for overseas aggression and stepping up their moves to turn Japan into a military power and their preparations for a preemptive attack. \r\n Given the outcries made by them that Japan would not rule out even a \"preemptive attack\" to cope with the \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK and it may fight a war with north Korea, the decision made by Tokyo recently cannot but be a serious development which can never be overlooked.\r\n Should the Japanese militarist forces again rush headlong into overseas aggression with the backing of a big country, failing to draw a lesson from the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in the last century, they will meet final destruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the moves of the anti-reunification conservative forces are allowed, national unity and the cause of independent reunification will make no progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new day of independent reunification will be brought earlier in the process of the patriotic movement for great national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
