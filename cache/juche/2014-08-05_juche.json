This factory is a posthumous one.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that this factory alone clearly shows how many seeds Kim Jong Il sowed for the building of a rich and powerful country, he said  in an excited tone that everybody should never forget the devoted efforts made by Kim Jong Il for the country and its people for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the analysis room, general production control room, lubricant work team, grease work team and other places of the factory to learn in detail about technical specifications of production processes and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated the factory as the one in which all production processes were put on an automatic, IT and unmanned basis and the digitalized one which fully established a computerized coordinated production system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pleased that the factory is turning out with indigenous efforts and technology the products for which it relied on import in the past period, he instructed it to wage a dynamic drive for boosting the production of quality lubricant and grease required by all types of vehicles and providing them to various fields of the national economy in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the quality of goods produced by the factory is as good as the imported ones, he called for steadily improving the technical specifications of the lubricant and grease so that they may have international competitiveness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave precious instructions for managing and operating the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is something to be proud of to have the modern Chonji Lubricant Factory of world level, he said again it was really pity that he failed to show Kim Jong Il this factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He showed such loving care for Kye Chol Ryong, manager of the factory, and its officials as expressing thanks to them on the spot in the name of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea for having worked hard to implement the party policies, always bearing them deep in mind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing expectation and conviction that the workers of the factory would glorify in practice the behests of Kim Jong Il by rapidly boosting the production, he had a photo session with its employees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ri Jae Il and Han Kwang Sang."
