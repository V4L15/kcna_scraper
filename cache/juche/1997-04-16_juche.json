And he was informed of the situation by the unit's commander.\r\n   He said the task of the unit which defends Height 1211, a vantage point in the east of the front, is very important.\r\n   He then went round the  old battle sites on Height 1211, including the pits used by the people's army soldiers during the war.\r\n  He said the undying feats of the heroic soldiers who unhesitatingly dedicated their youth and lives to security of  the Workers' Party of Korea, the leader and the generous system will remain long with the thriving socialist homeland.\r\n   He went on to say that the noble self-sacrificing spirit and indomitable revolutionary spirit displayed by the defenders of Height 1211, including the hero Ri Su Bok who blocked the enemy's gun muzzle with his chest and opened up the route of charge for his unit, still remain in the hearts of all the people's army soldiers and that no force on earth can match  the KPA soldiers who are ready to dedicate their lives to the country and people.\r\n   He then went round a bed room, a dining hall, a store, a hothouse and other logistic facilities. He noted with  high appreciation that the commanding officers with warm love for their soldiers provided excellent living  conditions to the soldiers.   He urged the officers to take warm care of them as their real parents would, as the soldiers are valuable revolutionary comrades and the treasure of the country.\r\n   He attended a class education seminar of soldiers.\r\n   He called for  steadily strengthening class education and other politico-ideological education of the soldiers.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il then called on the soldiers of a nearby company named after Ri Su Bok.   He went round the armory, bedroom and other places of the company.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction with the growth of all the soldiers into a-match-for-a hundred combatants.\r\n   He then visited Mt. Jihye on the forefront, which President Kim Il Sung climbed up on September 23, 1951, to put forward  wise operational policies for the defence of Height 1211.\r\n   After going round the historic site, Secretary Kim Jong Il said the president worked hard all his life for the freedom and welfare of the people, experiencing all kinds of troubles. He added that the president's  undying feats will shine forever along with the prosperous country.\r\n   Together with senior officials, he paid tribute to the President  on his 85th birth anniversary in humble reverence before a monument.\r\n   He gave the unit machineguns, automatic rifles and binoculars as gifts  and posed for photographs with soldiers. \r\n\r\n"
