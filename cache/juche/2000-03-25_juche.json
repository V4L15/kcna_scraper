In the speech he underlined the position and importance of the party agitation and clearly laid down the mission and tasks of the agitators. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Central Committee of the WPK in its congratulatory message to the participants highly praised the agitators for their great successes made in the mass political work by implementing the party's Juche-based policy on agitation and put forward concrete tasks to be fulfilled by them in carrying out the cause of building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A report was made by Choe Chun Hwang, first vice department director of the WPK Central Committee, at the meeting to be followed by speeches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter and speakers reviewed with pride the great achievements made in agitation in the past thanks to the great leader Kim Jong Il's outstanding idea of agitation, his unique agitation policy and wise leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They referred to ways of implementing the tasks before the agitators to energetically rouse the working people from all walks of life to the second grand Chollima advance and thus glorify the year 2000 as a year of a leaping advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They called for holding fast to the line of  giving importance to ideology, the military and science and technology and concentrating agitation on its implementation. \r\n\r\n"

This is an open criminal act of ignoring the DPRK government with hostility, which touches off the national indignation and resentment of all the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union vehemently denounces the Japanese reactionaries' playing with \"local suffrage\" as a gross encroachment upon the democratic national rights and interests of Korean citizens in Japan and a base plot to undermine Chongryon (the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan), a  dignified overseas citizens' organisation of the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

This order clearly stipulates that the newly designated waterways and navigation zones shall not be waters of the U.S. forces side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our proclamation of the \"order of navigating to and from five islands\" is an expression of our peace-loving and magnanimous stand on preventing conflicts at the west sea and a new war and affording convenience in islanders' life, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"Northern Limit Line\" was unilaterally drawn by the U.S. and the South Korean authorities in violation of the Armistice Agreement and the international law. This constitutes a grave infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that the declaration of this order serves as an initiative to prevent the recurrence of military conflicts between the two sides in any case and defuse the tensions in these waters under the situation where the U.S. forces side refuses to seek a negotiated settlement of the issue, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and the South Korean ruling quarters should desist from insisting on the \"Northern Limit Line\" any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our revolutionary armed forces solemnly declared they would strongly retaliate against them without warnings if they grossly breach the \"order of navigating to and from the five islands.\" Should the warmongers at home and abroad dare challenge our efforts to prevent clashes at the west sea and preserve peace and security there, the revolutionary armed forces of Korea will throw them into the deep sea to be buried there. \r\n\r\n"
