            "content": "U.S. Indicted for Environmental Pollution in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute issued a white paper Monday indicting the U.S. imperialist aggression forces\r\nfor their environmental pollution during their 60  year-long occupation of south Korea in connection with the recent disclosure of part of the environmental pollution by the U.S. forces in their military bases that has lashed the whole Korean nation into fury.\r\n The white paper said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are a total of 850 U.S. military bases in the world but south Korea is the only region which has offered so vast area to all branches of the three services of the U.S. forces densely deployed there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are 101 military bases of all kinds in south Korea which cover at least 73.2 million phyong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Residential areas except for land, forestry, factories and business centers there cover a little over 100 million phyong. But a vast area almost equal to those residential areas is occupied by at least 37,000 U.S. soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 450,000 hectares of arable land are occupied by barracks of U.S. forces in south Korea and tens of millions of phyong by the firing ranges for the exclusive use of U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to measure the area of the land usurped by the U.S. military bases but with nothing can the occupation forces compensate for the land so severely destroyed and damaged by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces stationed in the U.S. military base district in Ryongsan which occupies an area of 820,000 phyong in the central part of Seoul discharged without warning all sorts of contaminated oil and cancer-causing substance whose pungent odor can be smelt even in the place 1 km away from it, thus polluting 491,000 phyong out of 820,000 phyong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Camp Long in Wonju City, South Kangwon Province, U.S. airforce base in Osan City, Kyonggi Province and Camp House of the U.S. second division in Phaju City in the same province and most of the areas occupied by the U.S. military bases are seriously polluted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anti-north war exercises conducted by the U.S. forces almost every day in south Korea cause unlimited environmental pollution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. madcap war exercises left Mt. Thaebaek range, backbone of the great Mt. Paektu range, in the state of breakdown as 2 million phyong of it have been dug out. And a big rock island in waters off Maehyang-ri, Hwasong City, Kyonggi Province was lowered 15 meters due to mock nuke dropping exercises conducted by the U.S. forces without letup.\r\n At least 90 U.S. fighter bombers fly into a drill ground in Maehyang-ri in a day from U.S. airforce bases in Kunsan, Osan, Suwon, Taegu and other areas for mock nuke dropping exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deafening noise by these planes caused 80 per cent of the inhabitants in Maehyang-ri to suffer from hearing disorder, dizziness, dyspepsia, nervousness, stillbirth and all sorts of other diseases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inhabitants in areas around U.S. airforce base in Osan, Kyonggi Province also suffer from mental disorder, heart trouble and hallucination due to noise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent \"negotiations\" held between the U.S. and the south Korean authorities over the issue of relocation of the U.S. forces in south Korea the U.S. forces side, pretending to be generous, said that they would \"return\" to south Korea by 2011 28 base districts which have so far been under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also said they were ready to return 780,000 phyong out of 820,000 of their base in Ryongsan, Seoul, by 2008. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They, however, requested south Korea to offer 3.49 million phyong in Phyongthaek and Osan areas instead, more than four times the land occupied by their base at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of U.S. military bases in south Korea is an issue related to more than 37,000 U.S. troops present there but an issue related to the fate of more than 48 million south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation can lead a genuine life only in the land free from outsiders, the paper said, calling on all Koreans to force the U.S. forces to withdraw from south Korea to the last man under the banner of three forms of cooperation--cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism--and hand down a reunified land to posterity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They called for an immediate stop to the debate on the \"strategic flexibility\" which runs counter to the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said the remarks of U.S. Assistant Secretary of Defense Rawless that the super brigade would be deployed in south Korea, the first of such step in the world, were intended to reinforce the U.S. forces stationed in south Korea and force the introduction of U.S. weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling attention to the scheme of the Defense Ministry to make a unilateral survey for the expansion of a U.S. military base from February 21, ignoring the will of the residents of Phyongthaek, they called for a relentless fight against the expansion of the U.S. military base.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Harsh Resident General Policy Disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article discloses the harsh resident-general policy enforced by the Japanese imperialists and terms the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\" cooked up by them illegal and invalid.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After cooking up the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" in a brigandish manner, the Japanese imperialists proclaimed a \"system of setting up a residency-general and local executive bodies directly under it\" by what they called \"imperial order\" No. 267 on Dec. 20, 1905. They began enforcing the resident-general policy over Korea in real earnest from Feb.1 next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resident-general was little short of a de facto \"governor-general\" empowered to control all fabrics of social and political life such as politics, economy, military and culture as a supreme ruler who exercised his authority over legislature, judicature and the executive, and the prerogative of command over the army and all other affairs in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hirobumi Ito was appointed as a resident-general at that time. He exercised unlimited real power as he had the right to rule Korea and the prerogative of command over the Japanese imperialist aggression troops stationed in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While pursuing the resident-general policy, the Japanese imperialists desperately worked to politically subjugate Korea in reliance upon their huge aggressor forces. One of the typical examples of this was the fact that they replaced the cabinet of Pak Je Sun, who had played a dirty role in fabricating the subordinate \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" as a pro-Japanese lackey, by the one of Ri Wan Yong, who was also pro-Japanese stooge, in May 1907 in a bid to isolate the royal palace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was stipulated in the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" that the diplomatic right of Korea would be transferred to Japan but the former was, in fact, deprived even of the right to administer internal affairs by the force of the resident-general policy. And it was legalized according to Japan's new plan for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\" like the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\" was an illegal document as it lacked any legal validity. All treaties and laws in force at that time had no signature of Kojong, the supreme executive in the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty, among other things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In face of strong opposition of Emperor Kojong the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\" was unilaterally concluded by the Japanese imperialists. In consequence it is recorded in history as a false document lacking any legal validity as it had only the stamp of Ri Wan Yong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists enforced the harsh resident-general policy and colnial rule over Korea by the force of such illegal treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should admit the crimes related to the resident-general policy and the false treaty committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and apologize to the Korean people for the misfortune, pain and disasters they brought to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
