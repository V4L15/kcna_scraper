Korea, U.S., Japan\r\nPyongyang, May 7 (KCNA) -- Recently the south Korean puppet forces move to intensify military nexus with Japan while working hard to conclude a south Korea-Japan agreement for the protection of military information under the manipulation of the U.S. They are doing so under the pretext of the nuclear and missile \"threats\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t During Obama's junket to south Korea Park Geun Hye had a confab with him at which they agreed on the importance of information sharing among the U.S., Japan and south Korea. There was also a discussion on the exchanges of military information at recent high-level military talks among the three parties in Washington.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On April 28 a south Korean \"government\" official expressed the formal stand that \"there can be a technical discussion with countries concerned for the conclusion of an agreement on sharing military information among south Korea, U.S. and Japan after the similar discussion within 'government'\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the agreement on the protection of military information with Japan had been pushed forward during the Lee Myung Bak regime but was failed in July, 2012 in the face of strong rebuff from the south Korean public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from drawing a lesson from it, Park Geun Hye seeks to realize the exchanges of military information between south Korea and Japan by such a crafty way as signing a memorandum of understanding for the exchanges of military information among the U.S., Japan and south Korea without getting an approval from the \"National Assembly\" and going through the procedures of opening it to public by taking advantage of the chaotic political and economic situation in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the agreement on the protection of military information with Japan is an act of treachery as it accelerates Japan's militarization and paves the way for its reinvasion of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also a crime against the DPRK and an extremely dangerous move for a war as it is aimed to push ahead with the creation of military alliance among the three parties and render tenser the situation on the Korean peninsula and in the rest of Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By taking advantage of the exchanges of military information among the three parties, the U.S. seeks to knock into shape the triangular military alliance and dominate the whole of Korea and the rest of Northeast Asia.

Traitor Park Geun Hye is mulling doing harm to her fellow countrymen in the north with the help of outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sharing of information among the U.S., Japan and south Korea and completion of the triangular military alliance are a military adventure that brings the dark clouds of a fresh Cold War era, new world war to hang over Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula as it is tantamount to the creation of \"NATO\" of Asian version, pursuant to the U.S. Asia strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Outwardly, the evil woman pretends to cause a friction with Japan over the issues of Tok Islets and interpretation of history but behind the scene she stoops to any infamy to do harm to her fellow countrymen by trying to conclude a country-selling agreement, a war agreement under the manipulation of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to achieve neither detente on the Korean peninsula nor the security and peace of the nation as long as the Park Geun Hye group is allowed to stay in office as she is obsessed with dependence on outsiders and confrontation with her fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should clearly understand the serious consequences to be entailed by the military tie-up among the U.S., Japan and south Korea and rise up in a courageous struggle to resolutely reject and foil it."

However, she is slyly moving to conclude at any cost the \"agreement for protecting military information\" with Japan once abandoned by traitor Lee Myung Bak. In a nutshell, Park is clinging to such a cynical ploy as the conclusion of the MOU which requires neither an approval by the \"National Assembly\" nor procedures of opening it to public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Needless to say, it is just the U.S. which is encouraging the Park group to the military nexus with Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. schemes to use the Japanese reactionaries and the south Korean puppet forces as shock brigades for its war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As south Korea has not yet concluded an agreement of military alliance with Japan, the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance has not yet been knocked into shape.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the U.S. has instigated south Korea to conclude the \"agreement for protecting military information\" with Japan before forming an alliance with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once south Korea concludes the agreement with Japan, the former can easily make military alliance with the latter, which would lead to the creation of the tripartite military alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will not overlook the military nexus being intensified among the U.S., Japan and south Korea as it would entail serious consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will take strong counter-measures in succession for self-defence, invariably holding aloft the banner of Songun."

It caused such great chaos that many around the scene of the crime ran about to seek shelters. A similar crime took place in November, 2009, too in this military base, leaving 13 dead and 32 others wounded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the gun-related crime which occurred in Kansas on April 14, Obama shouted hoarse that such case should not be allowed to occur again as it makes people worry about their safety. But gun-related crimes are like a malignant tumor hard to cure as they are rampant in the society as a trend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to ceaseless gun-related crimes, people are exposed to constant threat to their safety. They are not free from uneasiness and horror. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the U.S. 69.3 percent of murders and 41 percent of robberies are gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of guns possessed by individual inhabitants reaches about O.3 billion and over 100 000 people are suffering from gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In New York in 2013 alone, there occurred 1 093 gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is plagued with all social evils and awash with guns. So, gun-related crimes take place frequently regardless of time, place and age.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shooting sprees occur at campuses of universities and high schools, department stores and even churches. Due to these crimes, those who are not particularly related to criminals fall victim to them with their grudge unsettled and many people meet grievous deaths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even soldiers and policemen who should be responsible for the lives and security of people are involved in these gun-related crimes. For instance, a policeman shot a man living in a tent to death in March last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As society is awash with guns, even children brandish guns, causing a series of gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A 2 year-old boy fired a loaded gun at his 11-year old sister on her breast by accident in the bedroom of his parents at a house in Philadelphia City on April 6. A little boy in a city of Georgia State also accidentally shot her 10-year old sister to death on April 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. tops the world list of gun-related crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that social uneasiness is growing day by day among Americans due to various crimes including gun-related crimes."
