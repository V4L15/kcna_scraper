The author, basing himself on the analysis and arrangement of Phaldojiriji (geographical book of eight provinces), Sejongsilrokjiriji (geographical book attached to the True Records of King Sejong) and other geographical books which had been published earlier, consummated  the achievements in the geographical studies of Korea, thus developing them onto a new, higher phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book deals with the political, economic, military and other fields of the country--Seoul and local administrative districts from province to hyon (sub-county), historical and geographical changes, topographies of mountains and rivers, seas and islands, defence setups, traffic, communication and transport networks, farm land, irrigation facilities, distances between neighbors, local special products, beauty spots, figures, customs, religions, culture and historic relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also contains departmental geographies, geographical changes of the successive dynasties from Ancient Korea (early 30th century B.C.-108 B.C.) to Koryo (918-1392) and detailed and graphic data that the author collected through survey and measurement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taedongjiji, a precious documentary relic, not only clearly shows the highly developed geographical development of the Korean nation but also is helpful to researches into various fields.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Now that Israel is condemned by the international community as a harasser of the Mid-east peace and a cancer-like entity, what Olmert uttered is nothing but nonsense talked by the guy who does not know where he stands and is ignorant of the trend of the situation. Japan is in such poor shape as to negotiate with such good-for-nothings over the \"threat\" from someone and \"cooperation in increasing pressure.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately Japan works to deter the six-party talks from making any progress, it will only do harm to itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chance does not always present itself for Japan. No one can vouch that Japan will always remain a partner in the process of settling the issue surrounding the Korean Peninsula as it is persistently pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
