However, their visits produced no desired pruition.\r\n   This fact indicates how poorly the united states, which claims that strength is everything, is supported worldwide.\r\n   U.S. strength-is-almighty champions are recklessly trying to demonstrate their strength on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   However, the People's Army and people of Korea will never pardon them for their reckless acts. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n"

The statement urged them to abolish the �gNational Security Law�h and dissolve the �gAgency for National Security Planning�h unconditionally and stop war exercises against the DPRK at once.\r\n   The Tanzania-DPRK Friendship Association and the Tanzanian National Coordinating Committee of the Juche Idea Study Groups also made public a joint statement to extend full support and firm solidarity to the struggle of the Korean people to reunify the country according to the three principles of national reunification, the Ten-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo.\r\n   Genaro Ledesma Izquieta, Chairman of the People's Front of Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, said in his statement that political parties and organisations of South Korea should positively respond to the just proposal of the DPRK.

The IMF forces the puppets to increase the foreign capital of civil financial institutions to 10 billion dlrs and  foreigners' investment to 100 percent from 30 percent, close more than 10 of 30 general banking companies and adjust those enterprises whose capital is lacking. The demand is tempted by its ulterior intention to keep a firm hold on the artery of the South Korean economy and intensify its financial domination over it.\r\n   The IMF also presses South Korea to reform financial structure as part of adjustment of economic structure and pursue an austerity policy.\r\n   It forces the puppets to make both ends meet by collecting more taxes from the people and allocate less funds to education, culture and health services.\r\n   It demands that the ban on unreasonable layoff be lifted, though South Korean businesses have observed it in a perfunctory way.\r\n   Lurking behind the brigandish demand is an attempt to annex South Korean enterprises on a large scale, dismiss more workers from the companies already placed under its control and thus make fabulous profits.\r\n   With the full implementation of the humiliating �gmemorandum of understanding�h the puppets concluded with the IMF  the South Korean economy is being further deteriorated and South Korean socio-political crisis and confusion are going from bad to worse.  �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
