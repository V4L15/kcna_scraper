            "content": "U.S. Mean Economic Sanctions and Blockade against Other Countries under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- U.S. arrogant economic sanctions and blockade are leverages for undisguised interference in other countries and a means for strangling them. The U.S. has become toughest and most desperate in its mean sanctions and blockade against the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n The article cites facts to prove that the U.S. has long applied economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. sanctions and blockade to isolate, suffocate and subjugate the DPRK have reached the height of the grave, aggressive and tough nature in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose Bush administration has desperately worked to lay an international siege to the DPRK, peddling \"the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May last year, the U.S. set out a \"security action program for the prevention of the spread of weapons\" aimed to carry out the operation to intercept and search the DPRK ships sailing in open seas and is pressurizing 11 countries to put it into practice,. The U.S. plans to stage five multi-national military exercises this year in a bid to lay an international siege to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' blockade operation against the DPRK is designed to increase the economic difficulties to the DPRK in a bid to take an initiative in settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and, furthermore, bring it under their control by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to lay an international siege to the DPRK is a grave infringement upon its sovereignty as it is in gross violation of international law and the norms governing the relations among countries. The U.S. actions to blockade the seas and airspace of the DPRK are a crude violation of the paragraph of the Korean Armistice Agreement banning any form of blockade against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"blockade operation\" against the DPRK is an escalation of its strategy to fight a war against terrorism. Through this operation the U.S. seeks to thoroughly isolate the DPRK and render it economically and militarily incapable and then mount a preemptive attack on it and seize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This method, however, will not work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should give up its wild ambition to isolate and stifle the DPRK and other progressive countries through such mean sanctions and blockade.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
