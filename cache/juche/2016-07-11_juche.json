This clearly proves that the Park regime is a group of traitors without equals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Artillery Bureau of the General Staff of the KPA serves the following strong warning to the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers upon the authorization:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the DPRK will take a physical counter-action to thoroughly control THAAD, aggression means of the U.S. for world domination, from the moment its location and place have been confirmed in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better understand that the more massively it introduces war weapons to south Korea and its vicinity, the closer they will come into the firing range of the KPA and the more miserable end the U.S. will meet without even a moment to make a shrill cry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA possessed of sufficient latest offensive strike means will take more merciless and powerful successive corresponding measures against the U.S. keen to ignite a war by deploying THAAD and will make the warmongers suffer from the nightmare of extreme uneasiness and terror.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the south Korean puppet forces' introduction of THAAD of the U.S. master would precipitate their miserable self-destruction due to the merciless strike of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their attempt to ward off the KPA's strike of justice with THAAD only reveals military ignorance and amounts to mocking and deceiving the public and people's mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has long put not only all the aggressive war means of the enemies but even their attack and logistic bases against the DPRK in the precision sighting strike range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts of the Park Geun Hye group of traitors to keep offering south Korea as its master U.S. nuclear outpost would only result in cutting short its despicable remaining days by itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We once again warn the enemies that it is the steadfast will of the KPA to make merciless retaliatory strikes to reduce south Korea to a sea in flames, debris once an order is issued.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, our revolutionary armed forces will as always bolster up its might in every way on the forefront for safeguarding the peace and security not only on the Korean peninsula but also in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the noble duty of the KPA to guarantee the peace and security of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our powerful Paektusan revolutionary army will never pardon the aggressive war moves of the outrageous U.S. and its henchmen but continue taking bold military measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA will take ceaseless self-defensive steps to punish all injustice in the world threatening justice till the gangster-like U.S. and other hostile forces are wiped out to the last man."

Recently it announced a plan to conduct drills under the simulated conditions of striking major military facilities of the DPRK by transferring 12 F-16s under the 169th flying corps from the U.S. mainland to the Osan Air Force base in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the U.S. seeks to bring dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean peninsula at any cost by staging joint military drills with the south Korean puppet forces in August and its scenario has entered into the phase of its implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., seized with an anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and the daydream of carrying out its strategy for world domination, seeks to turn the peninsula into a theatre of a thermonuclear war and thus implement its aggressive pivot-to Asia-Pacific strategy in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. officially decided to deploy THAAD in south Korea to achieve this objective.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the calculation of the U.S. to retain its military edge in the Asia-Pacific and realize its wild ambition for dominating it while staging aggressive war drills with the DPRK as its primary target and stepping up the arms buildup and the creation of a military bloc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to such U.S. saber-rattling, peace and security on the peninsula and in the region are seriously threatened and the danger of a nuclear war is becoming a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. madcap moves to plunge the peninsula into a nuclear disaster but take stronger countermeasures to defend the sovereignty and dignity of the country and nation and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. provoke a nuclear war on the peninsula, it will inevitably face a baptism of nuclear strike before anybody else."
