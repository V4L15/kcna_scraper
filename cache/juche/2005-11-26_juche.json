We also urge the south Korean government to comprehensively reexamine its passive and defensive stand on which it has only emphasized the peculiarity of the south-north relations and give spurs to creating an international environment.\r\n Meanwhile, an editor of Minjok Thongsin, made public a commentary titled \"No human rights without sovereignty\" on Nov. 19 at which he denounced those forces for hailing the adoption of the \"resolution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He observed that they seemed not to know properly about some members of the international community which unconditionally said \"yes\" to what was sponsored by the U.S., Britain and other powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These forces are no more than imbeciles who do not know even the fact that the U.S., Britain and other powers are the countries which deprived other countries of their sovereignty and colonized them and have preached human rights and democracy for their peoples and international community, the commentary noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more deplorable is the fact that some media in south Korea whose position is no better than that under a colonial rule are talking about \"human rights issue\" in the north and treacherous political forces such as the \"Grand National Party\" accused the government for people, which abstained from voting for the \"resolution,\" of being a leftist. Such traitorous and sycophantic forces do not understand the stark fact that they will also die when a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula and it is none other than the U.S. that abuses human rights, in actuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the way of protecting human rights and world peace to condemn those countries which have threatened other countries by force and violated their sovereignty and stand against the arbitrary practices of a handful of big powers including the U.S. This is, at the same time, the only way of combating terrorism.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Right-Wing Conservative Forces Have No Future\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 25 (KCNA) -- The \"Grand National Party\", a general headquarters of flunkeys and traitors and anti-reunification conservative forces, is desperately working to bring back the era of inter-Korean confrontation and the reactionary offensive of the right-wing conservative forces is escalating. It was against this backdrop that the \"National League of New Right\", a new organization of the right-wing conservative forces, was knocked into shape recently to group all types of fascist remnants including renegades of the \"student movement\" and conservative hack writers.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday observes in a signed article: This is no more than a foolish fit of those who have no future. Only destruction awaits those who are engrossed in the treacherous moves, swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The anti-reunification conservative forces in south Korea are the reactionaries of history as they stand in the way of the people's struggle  to achieve independence and reunification, turning their faces away from the changed times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is still betraying the fellow countrymen, swimming against the trend of the times, not away from the old way of thinking dating back to the era of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It adopted flunkeyism towards the U.S. as its policy and is blindly toeing the U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military domination over south Korea is a stumbling block lying in the way of achieving its progress and development and intensifying the movement for national reunification. However, the GNP is throwing a higher hurdle in the way of the south Koreans' movement for achieving independence by pursuing such flunkeyism towards the U.S. and toeing its line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors is making desperate efforts to stand against the fellow countrymen, while kowtowing and yielding to outside forces.\r\n With no desperation can the reactionaries stop the advance of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The end of the \"civilian government\" in south Korea resulted in ousting the conservative forces from power who had been engrossed in flunkeyism towards the U.S. and treachery, staying in power for several decades under the active patronage of the U.S. since its troops' occupation of south Korea. This was the result of the dynamic struggle waged by the south Korean people to put an end to the outdated politics characterized by flunkeyism and anti-reunification acts and bring about a new politics of democracy and independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification conservative forces including the GNP are making desperate efforts to block the advance of progressive and pro-reform forces and bring back by-gone days. However, their fate will not be different from their present miserable one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of history can never escape a final doom as they are forsaken by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
