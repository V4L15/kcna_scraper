The U.S. Seventh Air Force Command in S. Korea has already been put in a \"semi-war state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article says that these moves indicate that the U.S. air force is taking the lead in implementing the U.S. imperialists' strategy to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to indiscriminately destroy the \"enemy\" military bases and communications control facilities, manpower and strategic targets through its large-scale intensive preemptive air strikes and three-dimensional attacks in a bid to attain its goal of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are set to realize their \"strategic air force scenario\" on the Korean Peninsula, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aerial war exercises being staged by them in and around South Korea are part of important leverages to implement their air force strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January this year alone they mobilized a total of more than 1,600 planes in the aerial war exercises in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A huge U.S. air force is involved in the U.S.-led Foal Eagle joint military exercise now under way in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the will and a mode of counter-action of the army and the people of the DPRK to react to \"military punishment\" with strong retaliation and cope with an all-out war with an all-out war. No force on earth can overpower their strength and break their will. The U.S. imperialists should stop their reckless adventures to test them.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. clarified its intention more than once before the international community to seek a peaceful negotiated solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. direct talks for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula will do the u.s. good, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue, it should drop its absurd assertions and immediately opt for the direct talks with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
