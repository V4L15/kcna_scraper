Losses of lives and properties caused by the army and the police before and after the June 25 war are serious in the areas investigated by the committee and the number of victims reported to the committee from localities is on the increase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The special committee requested the \"administration\" to institute \"a special law on dealing with the murder of civilians\" in an effort to sternly punish those responsible for the damage done to the lives and properties of guiltless people and establish a system of compensation to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But before a step was taken, the may 16 military coup d'etat took place and the stenographic records, the report and the list of victims had been left in the underground archives, not being transferred to the repository keeping records of the \"national assembly.\"     \r\n\r\n"

The DPRK will decisively react to the U.S. arms buildup targeted against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
