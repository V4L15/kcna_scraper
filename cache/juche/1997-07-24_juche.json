As for this, reuters reported that Japanese troops 25,000 strong took part in the Korean War already in July 1950 and a telepress reporter in February 1951 exposed that Japan committed over 140,000 young people to the Korean front.\r\n   In order to cover up the participation of Japan in the Korean War the Japanese troops put in U.S. military uniform and were attached to American units to partake in removing mines, piloting in and transporting military supplies.\r\n   Over 50 Japanese warships and some 30,000 Japanese joined in the U.S. troops' landing operation in Inchon.\r\n   Japanese airmen carried military supplies by \"B 26\" and \"B 17\" of the U.S. imperialists and played a storming party of the U.S. Air Force.\r\n   Japanese troops helped the U.S. imperialists in the germ warfare in the field.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries left the whole land to the mercy of the U.S. imperialists as logistic and munition bases, backing the U.S. war action.\r\n   This is proved by the facts that 84 percent of the U.S. military automobiles damaged in the Korean War, 68 percent of guns and 70 percent of artillery weapons were repaired and 612 military bases and establishments set up and used in Japan.\r\n   The weapons, medical supplies and provisions produced in Japan for the U.S. troops during the three-year Korean War amount to 2.5 billion dollars.\r\n   The then commander of the U.S. forces in the far east ridgway said that if it were not for repair of vehicles and reproduction of weapons in Japan, the U.S. troops could hardly sustain the Korean incident for three months. \r\n\r\n"
