Their moves will put Asia or the world as a whole on alert, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This analysis discloses part of the Japanese reactionaries' design for nuclear arming which is getting more undisguised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As known to everyone, Japan has attempted at nuclear arming from long ago. In the 1990s it revealed its intention to press ahead with the nuclear arming at a final stage, ballyhooing about the changed international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, it is now openly stockpiling plutonium  allegedly to \"cope with possible dangerous situation\" such as \"nuclear suspicion\" and \"missile development\" by the DPRK, thus going against the world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is by no means fortuitous that Japan announced its fast breeder reactor Monju \"would go into full operation in 2000 and secure about 100 tons of plutonium till 2010 and 400 tons in the coming 30 years.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today it has nuclear technology and means of delivery as well as a large quantity of plutonium in stock, which is enough to produce many nukes all at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its nuclear arming has already reached the danger point, increasing worldwide apprehension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the past Japan, the only victim to nuclear disaster in the world, chanted an \"anti-nuke\" slogan more loudly than any other countries, peddling the \"three non-nuclear principles.\" But now it has turned out to be a deceptive trick to cover up Japan's militarist design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that Japan is picking on the DPRK to justify its nuclear design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its argument about \"threat from North Korea\" is a prelude to reinvasion of Korea, which will be immediately a curtain-raiser to aggression on Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan refuses to draw a lesson from its crushing defeat in the past aggression on the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its design to dominate Asia with a nuclear club will be smashed by a merciless retaliation. \r\n\r\n"

Following the country's liberation (August 1945) he set up an aviation faculty at the Pyongyang institute, a center for training cadres for the building of the regular armed forces. He sent there officials of the aviation association of Korea reared by himself right after liberation and excellent youth of worker and peasant origin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With these pilots and technical personages as a core he founded a regular flying corps for the first time in Korea on August 20, Juche 36 (1947). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the fatherland liberation war (June 1950-july 1953) the men and officers of the air force made a great contribution to the victory of war by offsetting \"technical and numerical advantages\" of the U.S. imperialist aggression air force with politico-ideological and tactical ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The gallant Korean pilots defended the sky of their country with their blood in the spirit of becoming human bombs. There are many instances of this. DPRK hero Ri Mun Sun shot down \"B-29\" which the U.S. imperialists advertised as a \"fortress in the air.\" Hero Kim Ki Ok brought down several enemy planes in the air over Taejon,  thus contributing to the operation for liberating Taejon. Heroes Han Kye Man and Kim Jong Hul piloted their planes in flames to dive into a group of enemy warships, thus sinking them in waters off Inchon.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA air force has reliably defended the territorial air of the DPRK in the post-war peaceful construction period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The men and officers of the air force shot down the pirate planes of the U.S. imperialists \"RB-47\" and \"EC-121\" when they were on espionage missions after intruding into the inviolable air of the DPRK, the socialist homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA air force enjoys its greatest success in its development by having the respected leader Kim Jong Il as the Supreme Commander of the revolutionary armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He gave on-site guidance to air force units hundreds of times to perfect Juche-based air force tactics and improve its equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the airmen of the DPRK are grown to be a-match-for-a hundred fighters fully capable of carrying  out any air operations and battles. \r\n\r\n"
