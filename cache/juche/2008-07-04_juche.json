            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Several Units in Kanggye City \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to several units in Kanggye City. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Kanggye Post Office, a revolutionary site. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n This is the significant place where President Kim Il Sung sent a telegram reading \"Safe arrival at Kanggye\" to his parents in Badaogou on March 20, 1923 during the 250-mile journey for learning he was making from Badaogou to Mangyongdae at the age of 11. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round the historic buildings standing as they were and historic relics, being briefed on them by a lecturer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Jagang Provincial Institute of Forest Science and an experimental nursery of the Jagang Provincial Industrial Forest Office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He acquainted himself in detail with scientific researches and cultivation of saplings, making the rounds of the exterior and interior of the institute and nursery including an arboretum, a tissue culture room and an experimental nursery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated the merits the scientists, technicians and workers of the institute and the nursery have performed by doing something great for the prosperity and development of the country, noting that they have cultivated a lot of saplings of good species suited to the climatic and soil conditions of Jagang Province by solving scientific and technological problems on their own through their full play to wisdom and energies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n He said that afforestation is of weighty importance in increasing the nation's forest resources and making the land beautiful and put forward the tasks to be carried out by the institute and the nursery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very important work to develop the forestry in the province with many mountains, he said, underlining the need for the province to make a comprehensive and effective use of mountains to meet the demand for forest products needed for production and construction with its own forest resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the Kanggye Foodstuff Factory. He dropped in at the room devoted to the history of the factory to hear about history of its development. He learned in detail about the technical equipment and production at the factory, going round its production processes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Watching various kinds of tasty and nutritious foodstuffs being churned out from the streamlined process, he said that officials and workers in Kanggye City have built a modern foodstuff factory with all production processes which meet the scientific and technological requirements, a factory of which they should be proud, in the wake of modernizing the essential foodstuff factory. He highly praised them for their feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n He stressed that when factories carry out the technological updating substantially, take thorough measures for the supply of raw materials and operate themselves on the principle of profitability the way the Kanggye Foodstuff Factory does, it is possible to rapidly improve the people's diet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He put forward the tasks to be fulfilled by the factory, underscoring the need for the factory to spruce up itself as a model and keep the production going at a high rate so as to positively contribute to the livelihood of the citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also visited the Kanggye Unha Clothing Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the issue of clothing is an important matter in settling the issues of clothing, food and housing, he expressed the expectation and belief that the workers of the factory would bring about a great turn in the production of consumer goods by more dynamically effecting a signal surge in the light industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He provided field guidance to the Kanggye Chicken Giblets Soup Restaurant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The production of a lot of meat, eggs and milk products at the stock-breeding centres including the chicken farms, duck farms and goat farms built in the city has brought about a radical change in the diet of the citizens, he said, wishing the people in the province a more bountiful and happier life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went up the balcony of the restaurant and commanded a bird's-eye view of the city, recollecting unforgettable days of the \"Arduous March,\" the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the province turned all the cities and villages into a land of bliss by their own efforts by working hard in a do-or-die spirit in firm unity under the uplifted red flag of the revolution in so difficult period when the country was undergoing the most rigorous ordeals due to the moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle it, he noted, adding that the province which proved in practice the validity of the ideology, system and cause of the DPRK remains a beacon of hope powerfully encouraging the people to carve out a rosy future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the province, the creators of the Kanggye spirit and brave pioneers of the new era, are performing world-startling miracles and feats day by day with the same spirit and stamina as they did in the past, he noted, stressing that this is a striking demonstration of the inexhaustible mental power of the Korean people rallied close around the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the expectation and belief that the officials, party members and other working people in the province including Kanggye City would continue to admirably play the vanguard role in an all-out charge to build a great prosperous powerful nation by giving fuller play to the Kanggye spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, and Pak Nam Gi, department director of the same.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
