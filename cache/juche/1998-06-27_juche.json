Korea urged to stop straining situation of Korean peninsula\r\n Pyongyang, June 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland today released a statement accusing the South Korean authorities of kicking up another anti-north row over \"intrusion of a submarine.\"\r\n   The statement says in part:\r\n   We already reported that our small submarine was wrecked after drifting about with a mishap to machinery in a training in the East Sea of Korea off Kosong.\r\n   The South Korean authorities, however, have groundlessly described the accident as \"intrusion.\" on June 26, they made public a \"statement\" of the \"Defence Minister\" and \"results of investigation\" blaming the north for \"anti-south operation,\" \"intrusion\" and \"provocation.\"\r\n   When our small submarine was discovered in sea waters of South Korea, the South Korean authorities should have informed us of it and rescued the boat.\r\n   We cannot understand why the South Korean authorities did not rescue the 70 ton-class boat in time but played for time for three days, on the pretext of \"towing\" and the like. We also wonder how the crewmen died. \r\n   The South Korean authorities should be held responsible for the death of the crewmen because they did not save them in time. They should make an understandable  explanation. \r\n   They should immediately stop trying to render the situation on the Korean peninsula strained again and should  send the corpses of the crewmen and submarine to our side at once.\r\n   We will follow the future attitude of the South Korean authorities.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

What remains unchanged after the war is none other than the wild ambition of the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean puppets to invade the north.\r\n   The ambition for northward invasion is becoming more intense among the present South Korean rulers who put up a deceptive signboard of \"people.\"\r\n   The South Korean puppets, in league with outside forces, have reinforced the armed forces on a large scale and ceaselessly staged war exercises against the fellow countrymen in the north, bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to a dangerous brink of war.\r\n   What they seeks in making unreasonable remarks about \"threats of provocation\" and \"design for communization\" is to justify their preparations for war.\r\n   Only catastrophic consequences will go to the puppets who are behaving violently like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger.    \r\n\r\n"

It was no more than a dangerous confab for another Korean War.\r\n   Japan and the South Korean puppets said they would establish sustained military tieup for peace on the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. Their utterances are a sheer lie.\r\n   Peace is wrecked and a danger of war still remains in Korea and the rest of Asia. from the historic viewpoint it is attributable to the Japanese militarists' ambition for overseas expansion and their moves for a military power. The moves have reached a more reckless stage with the U.S.-Japan-South Korea tripartite military alliance being tightened in accordance with the U.S. world strategy.\r\n   Recently the director  of the cabinet legislative office told a meeting of the house of councillors of Japan that Japan has a legal right to possess nuclear weapons and may use them for the purpose of defence as well. His utterances caused a big stir in the international community.\r\n   Japan is now running wild as a shock brigade for the U.S. aggression on Asia. It is tightening military tieup with the South Korean puppets for realising its wild ambition.\r\n   It was said at the recent confab that it is necessary to increase the transparency in military field to do away with apprehensions about Japan's moves for a military power and prevent a reunified Korea from posing a military threat to Japan. The shameless rigmarole is a naked mockery of and an open challenge to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and other Asian countries.\r\n   This rigmarole fully betrays the true colors of foolish and brazen-faced Japan and South Korean puppets who are trying to use the \"transparency in military field\" as an excuse to justify Japan's moves for a military power through the tightened military tieup with the puppets as well as the permanent presence of the U.S. Forces in South Korea and Japan.\r\n   Japan and the South Korean puppets should stop acting rashly.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
