Korean Judicial Authorities' Fascist Action under Fire  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the south Korean judicial authorities imposed heavy punishment upon those related to the \"case of Single-minded Association.\" This action was fascist tyranny against the DPRK and reunification as it is aimed at blocking national reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Papers today observe this in signed commentaries carried in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case cooked up in October last year was a sheer fabrication as it lacked clear evidence and those related to the case completely denied the charge, Rodong Sinmun notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case is nothing but a charade orchestrated on the basis of a scenario worked out in a secret chamber of the Intelligence Service. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that those related to the case testified at the hearing that what they did was just the discussion they had on the issue of the reunification movement with the DPRK and the name of the \"Single-minded Association\" was the first words they heard while they were interrogated at the \"Intelligence Service.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive south Korean regimes fabricated big \"spyring cases\" to chill the warm desire of the people for reunification whenever the movement for achieving reunification through alliance with the north mounted in south Korea. But the reunification movement advanced and the truth behind the false cases was clearly probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces of the south Korean security authorities are clinging to dastardly methods to achieve their ulterior aim, but their cheap farce will get them nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary terms the recent action taken by the south Korean judicial authorities to punish people on false charge of espionage after fabricating the groundless case by linking them to the DPRK a deliberate and premeditated plot to deter the inter-Korean ties from warming up and bring back the era of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very crafty and wicked plot to create illusion about them by appeasing and deceiving their opponents in a bid to benumb their anti-imperialist spirit and completely disarm them ideologically and morally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said approach may bring consequences as dangerous as open aggression by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should not interpret the above-said approach as a sort of change in the aggressive nature of the imperialists. The carrot approach of the imperialists which is bound to be accompanied by appeasement tactics and smiling diplomacy is designed to do harm to their opponents at a slow pace till they prove ineffective in face of their moves for domination and end up collapsing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the aim sought by the imperialists in the above-said approach to create illusion about them and thus put other countries under the yoke of domination and subjugation and gratify their interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists, while acting an \"apostle of peace\" by abusing the wish of humankind for a peaceful free world, are craftily working to confuse the spirit of people and cause them to harbor illusion about imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are intensifying economic domination and subjugation of other countries by such levers as \"aid\", \"cooperation\" and \"loan\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is eloquently proved by the reality of those countries which have been put under the yoke of political subjugation after receiving the \"aid\" and \"loan\" offered by the imperialists as a \"kind gesture.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be disastrous consequences for those countries which abandon their revolutionary principle and meet the imperialists' demand, taken in by glossy words uttered by them as part of their appeasement policy. Worse still, their wrong behavior may lead to the loss of their sovereignty. All countries should, therefore, be vigilant against the imperialists' carrot approach and should not be tempted by it under any circumstances.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
