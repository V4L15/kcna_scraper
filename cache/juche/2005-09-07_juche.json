            "content": "DPRK Will Never Waive Its Right to Peaceful Nuclear Activity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Koreans regard the independent right of the country and their interests as their life and soul and it is their characteristic feature to protect them to the last. So nobody should expect the DPRK to waive its right to peaceful nuclear activity.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a commentary. \r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the first-phase of the 4th six-party talks, the U.S. was adamant in insisting that the DPRK totally give up all its nuclear activities including the use of nuclear energy for a peaceful purpose, to say nothing of its nuclear weapons program. That was unilateral and high-handed demand on which the latter can neither make any compromise nor accept. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A complete removal of the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK and its drop of hostile policy aimed at stifling the latter would automatically lead to lifting its measures taken to bolster the nuclear deterrence for self-defence. The DPRK's nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose is one of key economic sectors which should be further developed as economy makes progress and the material and cultural demand of the people increases.\r\n The nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose is an exercise of a legitimate right enshrined in international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia, China, Japan, the U.S. and south Korea, parties to the six-party talks except for the DPRK, massively produce and use nuclear energies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. is faulting the DPRK's nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose though it is an exercise of its sovereign right and permitted by international law and leaves no stone unturned to stop it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is neither a war criminal state nor a defeated state and has not done anything harmful to others. For what reason should it abandon its right to peaceful nuclear activity? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK had built the nuclear power facilities for decades tightening its belts.\r\n It is unimaginable for the DPRK to dismantle its independent nuclear power industry built with so much effort, yielding to outsiders' pressure, without getting any proposal for compensating for the loss of nuclear energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever make ceaseless  peaceful nuclear activity for the economic construction and the improvement of the standard of people's living.\r\n Consistent is the DPRK's stand to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue and denuclearize the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. tries to have its unreasonable demand met by coercion from the stand of strength in defiance of the principle of impartiality, the situation will only get further complicated, much less any successful progress at  the six-party talks.\r\n The U.S. should acknowledge the DPRK's legitimate right to nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose and take an option to find a fair settlement of the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Reinvasion Scheme under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries decided on the policy of including the appropriation for researches into introduction of unmanned reconnaissance planes in the 2006 fiscal year budget estimation and launched the new-type Aegis ship Atago. Commenting on this Minju Joson Tuesday observes:\r\n This indicates that Japan has pushed forward to a considerable extent the preparations for overseas aggression, the reinvasion of Korea in particular.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries openly blare that the unmanned reconnaissance planes are aimed to \"collect information about north Korea\" in a high altitude flight within the air defense identification sphere. This means that Japan is making preparations for neutralizing the DPRK's capacity of retaliatory strike and securing the capability of a preemptive attack on it, pursuant to the U.S. drive at the establishment of a missile defense system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such view is made more plausible by the fact that sea-launched interceptor missiles are soon to be mounted on the new-type Aegis ship which Japan has built to deploy at Maizuru base close to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has so far zealously capitalized on the U.S. Asia strategy to invade the DPRK and has stepped up in real earnest its conversion into a military power and completion of the preparations for reinvasion, citing the DPRK as a pretext.\r\n It is the intention of the Japanese reactionaries to build up public opinion worldwide about the fictitious \"threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to find a justification of the conversion of Japan into a military power and, at the same time, disarm the DPRK and neutralize its self-defensive armed forces and thus realize the dream of reinvasion of Korea without difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can they cover up their sinister intention, although they are putting up the slogans of combating \"threat of aggression\" and \"threat of attack\" from the DPRK to conceal the reactionary nature of their moves to make Japan a military power.\r\n They would be well advised to see and judge the matter from a realistic point of view and behave with reason instead of wasting time and efforts over the utterly infeasible matter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "End to U.S. Military Presence in S. Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The United States should renounce its policy of military presence in south Korea and pull back its aggression troops from it as desired by the Korean nation whose will is to see foreign forces for aggression pulled back from south Korea, regain the national dignity and sovereignty and achieve the historic cause of national reunification, says Rodong Sinmun in a signed article Tuesday 60 years since the U.S. military occupation of south Korea.\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military occupation of south Korea was tantamount to brigandish aggression as it was illegally perpetrated against the independent will of the Korean nation and in defiance of its legitimate right. It was, at the same time, an intolerable crime as it has inflicted the misfortune and pain resulting from the national division upon the Korean nation and blocked the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hurled its forces into south Korea on Sept. 8, 1945 under the pretext of \"disarming the Japanese troops.\" It should have had totally withdrawn its forces in the subsequent days when the disarmament of the Japanese imperialists came to an end and the former Soviet Union was pulling its forces out of the DPRK. But the U.S. took the Japanese imperialists' defeat as a golden opportunity of realizing its ambition for the invasion of Korea and occupied south Korea by force as it pleased.\r\n The occupation of south Korea by the U.S. forces was an illegal act as it was in contravention of the Cairo and Potsdam Declarations that called for independence and sovereignty of Korea, the Korean Armistice Agreement and even the UN resolution. The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea had lost any justification long ago as the Cold War came to an end and the Soviet Union ceased to exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea was, at the same time, a crime against humanity as it artificially divided the homogenous nation rare to be found in the world, bringing unspeakable misfortune and disaster to it. This occupation has desperately hampered the Korean nation's movement for reunification by fostering north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military presence in south Korea has been a major factor of driving the situation in Korea to constant tension and threatening the destiny of the nation.\r\n The U.S. forces have been a main source of a war on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. provoked the war of aggression in the 1950s and has frantically kicked up such dangerous war rackets targeted against the north as the \"Pueblo\" incident, the \"EC-121\" plane incident, the Panmunjom incident and Team Spirit and Ulji Focus Lens joint military exercises in a bid to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past six-decade long history of the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea is woven with crimes against the Korean nation. No occupation forces in the world have trifled the destiny of a country and a nation and so cruelly and ruthlessly inflicted misfortune and pain upon its people as the U.S. forces present in south Korea have done.\r\n Terming the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea an anachronistic leftover of the old era, the article urges the U.S. to pull back its forces from south Korea as early as possible, shake off the ill fame as the architect of Korea's division and a disturber of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula and thus escape the catastrophic disaster to be entailed by its continued presence in south Korea and its moves to invade the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As if it were not enough with this, they cruelly killed those women in a bid to cover up their atrocity, hideous massacre unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, the then south Korean rulers shut their eyes to the shuddering crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists to get a petty amount of money. This was an intolerable insult to the Korean nation and a hideous act of treachery as it was little short of double murder of hundreds of thousands of Korean women who died with bitter grudge after their chastity was violated by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n Hideous crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean nation in the past can never be erased off, the statement said, stressing that the Koreans will certainly force Japan to apologize and compensate for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists who inflicted untold misfortune and pain upon them during the unprecedentedly harsh and monstrous colonial rule.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
