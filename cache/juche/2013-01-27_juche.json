It is a scenario of the imperialist forces for aggression to gravely encroach upon the sovereignty and supreme interests of the DPRK and drive the situation on the peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension by terming the DPRK's launch of satellite for peaceful purposes a \"violation of UN resolutions\" and adopting the new \"resolution on sanctions\" against it. They, in the long run, seek to ignite a war for aggression against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group worked with bloodshot eyes to fake up the brigandish UN \"resolution on sanctions.\" This is a height of its moves for unleashing a war of aggression against the DPRK. For the past five years of office the group has been keen on the moves against the DPRK, being backed by foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group, in the closing days of its office, is scheming to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK at any cost. Very dangerous is the reckless racket kicked up by the Lee group to ignite the war with the help of foreign forces while taking the lead in expanding \"sanctions\" on the DPRK under the pretext of its satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA touch-and-go situation in which a war may break out any time is being created on the Korean Peninsula and dark clouds of a nuclear war are hanging over there.

It is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with fagot.
