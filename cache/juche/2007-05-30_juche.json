The U.S. ambassador to Japan, too, who was present there, strongly hinted to the Japanese side that the U.S.-Japan alliance may get worse if Japan doesn't intercept such missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this fact, Minju Joson says in a signed commentary today: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seemed at the meeting to ask for Japan's help for fear of possible \"missile attack\" of the DPRK on it. But lurking behind it was a sinister intention of the U.S. to incite Japan to the exercise of the \"right of collective self-defence\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a strategic calculation of the U.S. that it should make an effective use of Japan's military potentials and geographical advantage in order to attain the military supremacy over East Asia, contain the influence of big powers situated in this region and establish the exclusive domination over the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the time comes when Japan fairly exercises its \"right of collective self-defence\" as demanded by the U.S., it would be very dangerous developments in view of peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's exercise of the \"right of collective self-defence\" precisely means its reinvasion.\r\n It is as clear as noonday that Japan, free in military action by dint of exercise of the \"right\", will not hesitate to unleash a war of aggression on Asia for its strategic interests and vested rights as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess that the U.S. will be no exception of the targets of Japan's attack, if the temperament of the latter, who would act like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger when it feels stronger, is taken into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The irresponsible behavior of the U.S. inciting Japan to the militaristic overseas expansion is as good as a crime of wrecking global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by Japan's moves for militarization and overseas expansion and drop its wrong policy towards Japan at an earliest possible date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With this taken into account, his distortion of history is of very grave and dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His denial of the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" is a militaristic folly aimed at achieving a sinister political purpose against history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those crimes are extra-large crimes against humanity committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara with eyes and ears and cognitional ability must be aware of the crimes in reducing women to sex slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army. Yet he has the cheek to openly assert that \"the Japanese army never recruited 'comfort women'\". This is a total denial of the Japanese imperialists' crimes of sexual slavery without precedent in history and a shameless distortion of history. His jargon is a mockery of the victims to the forcible drafting of \"comfort women\" and a malicious challenge to the world public sentiments demanding the settlement of the hideous crimes by Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History is like a mirror. It cannot be distorted or erased. The history of the crimes committed by Japan can never be covered up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservative forces must stop distorting history, deeply bearing in mind that they will invite only international isolation and destruction, if they persist in such act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

El embajador estadounidense en Japon, participante en dicha reunion, advirtio seriamente a la parte japonesa que si esta no lo hace, se deterioraria la alianza bilateral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque aparentemente EE.UU. esta pidiendo la ayuda a Japon por lo que le preocupa el presunto \"ataque de misiles\" del Norte de Corea contra su territorio, detras de esta farsa se halla un siniestro intento de azuzar al pais isleno a ejercer el \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Senala asi el rotativo Minju Joson en un comentario individual de este martes y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para tomar la supremacia militar en el continente de Asia oriental, contrarrestar la influencia de las potencias regionales y establecer la esfera de su dominio exclusivo sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico, EE.UU. persigue la estrategia de aprovechar de modo eficiente la potencialidad militar y las ventajas geograficas de Japon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si el pais isleno llega a ejercer de pleno el \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" como lo demanda EE.UU., la paz y la seguridad de Asia y el resto del mundo se veran gravemente amenazadas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El ejercicio de ese \"derecho\" significa nueva agresion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es muy obvio que el pais isleno, que ya logro la ilimitada libertad de sus actividades militares pretextando ejercer ese \"derecho\", no reparara en provocar, como lo hizo en el pasado, una guerra de agresion al continente asiatico para defender sus intereses estrategicos y ganar concesiones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Si se toma en cuenta el temperamento de Japon, que se arremete contra cualesquier rivales mas potentes ufanandose de su escasa capacidad, es probable que el propio EE.UU. tambien haya sido incluido en la lista de blancos del primero. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El proceder irresponsable de EE.UU., que instiga a Japon a la expansion militarista a ultramar, es un crimen que perturba la paz y la seguridad del mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El imperio debe reflexionar de las nefastas consecuencias, que emanen de la militarizacion y el expansionismo de Japon a ultramar, y abandonar cuanto antes su erronea politica sobre este pais.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
