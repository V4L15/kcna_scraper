Meanwhile, they are drastically increasing the hours of flight and frequency of operations of high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes and intensifying espionage against the DPRK in the West Sea of Korea and in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line by setting in motion anti-artillery radars, drones and other reconnaissance means.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Friday in a bylined commentary says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows what a dangerous phase their moves to ignite a war against the DPRK have reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their description of the saber-rattling as the \"last drill under 'OPLAN 5027'\" is just hypocrisy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they seek is to make the public convince that they would not unleash a war against the DPRK so as to slacken its vigilance. And then by availing themselves of this opportunity, they are going to start a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are working hard to do harm to the DPRK by force of arms. But it is just illusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If even a single bullet is dropped in any area where the DPRK's sovereignty is exercised, it will give the fullest play to the war deterrent it has built up so far and show the provocateurs the real power of arms and war and achieve the historic cause of national reunification. This is the steadfast will of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The time is approaching fast when the war provocateurs will meet the shower of fire for their provocation."

Tanques 105 \"Seul\" Ryu Kyong Su del EPC lo cual significo la declaracion solemne de la continuacion de la causa revolucionaria del Songun, senalo el informante y continuo: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante medio siglo desde que comenzara su direccion sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun en acato al noble proposito del Presidente Kim Il Sung, el Dirigente realizo las hazanas inmortales ante la epoca y la revolucion, la patria y la humanidad superando al frente las severas dificultades de la historia con su destacada idea y extraordinaria direccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando la revolucion coreana atravesaba las peores pruebas, formulo la politica de Songun como principal modo politico del socialismo con su larga prevision y extraordinaria clarividencia y la practico generalmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOriento el trabajo y las actividades del partido a materializar la linea de la revolucion del Songun e hizo establecer en toda la sociedad el clima de dar importancia a las fuerzas armadas y asuntos militares y el sistema de aparatos estatales al estilo coreano con el Comite de Defensa Nacional como su eje.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto fue acontecimiento especial que preparo la garantia politica e institucional de la implementacion de la politica de Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConvirtio el Ejercito Popular de Corea en las invencibles fuerzas armadas revolucionarias y elevo la posicion de la patria a la de potencia militar de talla mundial y digno poseedor de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Gracias a tal orientacion del Dirigente, el EPC pudo crecer como ejercito de flor y nata dispuesto a defender a costa de la vida al lider y la industria de defensa nacional de Corea se desarrollo como la capaz de fabricar cualquier arma sofisticada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al preparar las filas del EPC como colectivo de camaradas que comparten el destino con el Comandante Supremo y unificar la idea y el modo de lucha de los militares y civiles, consolido la cohesion de las filas de la revolucion como la unidad monolitica entre el lider, el partido, el ejercito y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todo el ejercito se lograron con exito la unidad entre los oficiales y soldados y la combinacion de los asuntos militares y los politicos mientras en toda la sociedad se fomenta la union entre militares y civiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unidad monolitica fortalecida en tales circunstancias es el patrimonio y orgullo mas grandes del pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa en el periodo de la Marcha penosa, la forzada, el Dirigente Kim Jong Il presento el magno proyecto de construir un Estado prospero e hizo que el EPC jugara el papel de vanguardia en los importantes sectores de la construccion socialista y todo el pueblo aprendiera el espiritu revolucionario de los militares, de modo que se levantara en todo el pais la ola de grandes innovaciones y saltos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el camino de su direccion en el terreno caracterizada por el amor por la patria y el pueblo, se registraron sucesivamente los acontecimientos sin precedentes en la historia de cinco milenios de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVuela en el espacio el satelite artificial, funciona un gran numero de las maquinas hechas con la

socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa orientacion del Dirigente sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun y su politica de igual nombre permitieron el nacimiento de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, documentos que encarnan el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, dieron la nueva coyuntura en el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria, defendieron firmemente la paz y la seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo y promovieron energicamente la causa de independencia de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la autoctona causa revolucionaria del Songun avanza firmemente gracias al Mariscal     Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tApoyando con fidelidad la guia del Songun del Mariscal, debemos levantar en suelo patrio un Estado prospero socialista y lograr la reunificacion independiente de la patria y la victoria de la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militantes del PTC, los oficiales y soldados del EPC y habitantes deben tener al Mariscal como centro de unidad y direccion, defenderlo a costa de la vida en lo politico e ideologico y en cualesquier circunstancias adversas y unirse monoliticamente en torno a el.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias se mantienen en la disposicion de combate decisivo en sus trincheras frente a las imprudentes maniobras de EE.UU. y los belicistas titeres surcoreanos para desatar la guerra de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos lanzan un solo obus a nuestro territorio jurisdiccional, todos nuestros militares y civiles, que recibieron ya la orden del Comandante Supremo, no perderan esa oportunidad de oro, pasaran inmediatamente al contraataque demoledor y lo ampliaran a la sagrada guerra por la reunificacion de la patria."
