It should, therefore, dismantle nukes in a verifiable and irreversible manner. But the \"advanced countries\" kept mum about the U.S. nuclear-related crimes at the summit. By faking up such a document the U.S. and other countries sought to put pressure upon the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program first through \"forced inspection\" in a bid to stifle it as they did in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paragraphs of the \"document\" dealing with the issue of the DPRK only provide with the DPRK ample justification to increase its defensive nuclear deterrent force with powerful catalyst. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For a fair solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. the countries concerned should demand the U.S. drop at once its hostile policy toward the DPRK proceeding from a correct standpoint and attitude  The DPRK does not have any interest in other option but this nor expects it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to claim that it alone has the \"political vision\" and \"standards\" to discern between right and wrong and can do everything and other countries should meekly follow its will. Such U.S.-style superpower logic and unilateralism will never work on the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\nThe valuable ideological and theoretical boon provided by Kim Jong Il serves as guidelines for all fields of the revolution and construction. This provides a decisive guarantee for victoriously advancing the Juche revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has given lucid answers to all the issues arising in all fields ranging from philosophy and political economy to literature and art and from the party, state and army building to the issue of accomplishing the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism is most advantageous as political, economic, cultural and all other fabrics of social life under it are efflorescing and the DPRK is vigorously advancing along the orbit of independence. This true picture clearly testifies to the fact that its revolution is sure to triumph at all times thanks to this great ideological and theoretical boon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition and experience gained by him in leading the work in all fields and at all units provide a reliable foundation for bringing about surges in the revolution and construction without let-up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has wisely led the overall party, state and army affairs since he started working at the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and performed valuable exploits, established a good tradition and accumulated a wealth of experience for effecting a steady surge in the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shining exploits, experience and valuable tradition provided by Kim Jong Il while directly leading the work in different domains in the 1970s in particular, demonstrated their tremendous vitality in the practice of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il made a new history of building a great prosperous powerful nation with the might of Songun, giving a sure guarantee for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military power for self defense of the DPRK has been increased in every way despite the U.S. imperialists' recent continued moves to isolate and stifle it and a breakthrough was made towards building a great prosperous powerful nation. This stirring reality fully demonstrates the might of Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A turning phase brought about in the efforts to accomplish the Korean people's cause of national reunification and the unprecedentedly high international prestige of the DPRK represent a shining victory of Kim Jong Il's Songun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Assails Japan's New Laws for Militarization and Overseas Invasion\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- Seven laws related to emergency and a bill banning the portcall of specified foreign ships were adopted at the session of the House of Councilors of Japan on June 14.\r\n This merits serious attention as it is a provocative act of destabilizing peace and stability of Asia and seriously infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservative forces adopted three laws related to emergency last year including the law for coping with armed attack. The recent adoption of the seven laws finally brought to completion the adjustment of the laws related to emergency aimed at providing a legal and institutional guarantee for their revival of militarism and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By adopting the seven laws the Japanese right-wing conservative forces have strengthened Japan's military alliance with the U.S. and paved a wide avenue for overseas aggression. This has reduced to a dead document the \"Peace Constitution\" which bans Japan's exercise of the right to collective self-defence and the right of belligerency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservatives have become more undisguised recently in their moves to institute a new constitution aimed at the revival of militarism and overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact that the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan included \"the institution of the new constitution\" in the draft amendment to be made to its \"programme\" on the occasion of its 50th founding anniversary which will fall on November 2005 and set forth the constitutional revision as its supreme task. They call for deleting paragraph 2 of article 9, a core article of the \"Peace Constitution\", which bans Japan's possession of armed forces, defining the \"Self-Defence Forces\" as an army and claiming the right to self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, for the Japanese aggression forces the \"Peace Constitution\" has been a stumbling block in their way of legislating on the militarization of the state system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the right-wing conservatives of Japan have so far rendered the constitution defunct little by little and have already declared the areas around the Korean peninsula as the theatre of their operation under the pretext of coping with emergency in its surrounding areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that they have chosen the DPRK as the target of their constitutional revision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The final adoption of the law banning the portcall of specified foreign ships is aimed to strangle the DPRK economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the Japanese right-wing conservative forces justify their unsavory acts of going against the positive trend towards the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan noticeable in the wake of the talks between the top leaders of the two countries on May 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing conservatives of Japan should not run wild, well aware that Japan's revival of militarism and overseas expansion will only lead it to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
