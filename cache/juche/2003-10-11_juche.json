            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Blasts Japan's Anti-DPRK Campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- The much fuss kicked up by the Japanese authorities over the \"abduction issue,\" an issue that had already been solved, to internationalize it is aimed to incite confrontation with the DPRK and hostility toward it and thus win popularity at home and tarnish the image of the DPRK at any cost abroad and attain their sinister political purpose, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement issued on Oct. 9.\r\n The \"abduction issue\" was an abnormal incident caused by individuals against the backdrop of the anti-Japanese sentiment that grew extremely bitter among the Koreans due to the hostile policy pursued by the successive Japanese authorities, the statement said, and continued: The DPRK gave all necessary explanations about the background against which the abduction issue was caused to those officials concerned of the Japanese government when they visited Pyongyang toward the end of September last year and handed them copies of as many necessary genuine documents as possible proceeding from humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities unilaterally broke the promise they made to the DPRK to return Japanese who went to Japan for home-visit and settle the issue of the repatriation of their families. They made profound confusion of the right and the wrong in a bid to create the impression that the DPRK blocked their reunion in violation of humanitarianism, after detaining them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with this, the Japanese authorities solicited for help, peddling the \"abduction issue\" here and there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRecently they referred it to the UN to kick up a row over it and are now talking about a \"package solution\", deliberately linking it to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have so far asserted that the solution to the \"abduction issue\" is a top priority related to the lives and security of the Japanese. There is no reason for them to refuse to accept the DPRK's demand if this is true. The prospect of the solution of the issue entirely depends on the attitude of the Japanese authorities.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
