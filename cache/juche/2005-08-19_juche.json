One might say it was meaningful for Japan, indeed, as it was the first anniversary every tenth year in the new century. It was the most important and historic occasion for Japan to totally break with its disgraceful past history and inglorious history of 60 years after the war and build a future with good conscience as it was the only fascist state in the East and remained a pronoun of the grudge of the Asian people in the last century.\r\n That was why the Asian countries and the international community so closely followed the behaviors of Japanese politicians around the day and paid so deep attention to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japanese right-wing politicians visited the shrine that day. This is little short of declaring to the world once again that militarism is the very course to be taken by Japan in the 21st century, too. It is undisguised political and ideological violence that could be perpetrated only by rare political gangsters against the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the history of the shrine began in 1869 Japan has used it as leverage for instilling extremely aggressive idea into Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Second World War and postwar period the reactionary nature of the shrine was brought to bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive politicians of Japan have visited the shrine without exception in a desperate bid to foster frantic worship of militarism and warlike sentiment among people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the Japanese right-wing forces conducted a campaign of letting 200,000 Japanese visit the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" in the run-up to August 15. So, on that very day Cabinet ministers and Dietmen from ruling and opposition parties took the lead in paying such visits to the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this backdrop of veering the Japanese society to the extremely conservative Right as evidenced by the crowded visits to the Shrine on August 15 that politicians have turned into gangsters and mafias and the militarization of Japan has reached an uncontrollable phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation is turning more serious as dozens of politicians swarmed to the shrine to fan up militarism in Japan now busy with the diplomacy to get permanent membership of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behavior of the Japanese reactionaries can not be interpreted otherwise than an attempt to reduce even the UN and other international fora to platforms for their undisguised political gangsterism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Militarism can not go with peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the Asian people upon whom Japan imposed immeasurable pain and misfortune in the last century and people in other parts of the world to heighten their vigilance against militarist Japan and come out against its pitch for permanent membership of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" lead to the revival of militarism to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never shake itself of an ill-fame of being called \"narrow-minded island country\" going away from the international community unless its politicians break with militarism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n In the work Kim Jong Il said that patriotism is associated with loyalty to President Kim Il Sung and loyalty to the Party and the leader means most ardent patriotism. He added that one should not respond to the call of the country and the people in words only but through practical action and \"Look at my worksite, my machine and my products if you wish to understand what I think\" should be a slogan to be shouted by the patriots in our era from the bottom of their hearts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last two decades since the publication of this work the servicepersons and people have worked uninterrupted miracles and innovations in the revolution and construction, bearing deep in mind the truth of patriotism taught by Kim Jong Il and achieved great victory in defending socialism and made a breakthrough towards building a great prosperous powerful nation under his Songun leadership.\r\n The Korean revolution remains more glorious as it is a patriotic struggle that has been guided by Juche up to this date since its very start. Thanks to the banner of Juche, the Korean people could win brilliant victory in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the Fatherland Liberation War and achieve great successes in the socialist revolution and construction. Our country has demonstrated its might as a political and military power and invincible socialist bulwark because the whole country is pervaded with the Juche-oriented faith, which calls for meeting the requirements of Juche in ideology, technology and culture and living our own way, under the leadership of the Party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our country is demonstrating its might as an invincible power with tremendous self-reliant deterrent thanks to the Songun idea of Kim Jong Il. This reality goes to prove what great patriotism the Songun idea of Juche is.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "End to U.S. Hostile Policy towards DPRK Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- An end should be put to the presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea and to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Thursday urges this in a signed article. \r\n The Koreans have undergone the tragedy of national division against their will for the last six decades since the end of the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists because the U.S. adopted it as its policy to keep Korea divided after occupying south Korea by force of arms, the article notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cites concrete facts to prove that the U.S. has worked hard to perpetuate the division of Korea ever since the very day of its military occupation of south Korea and dampened the desire of the Koreans in the north and the south of Korea for reunification whenever it grew stronger in the postwar period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has systematically escalated its moves for a war against the DPRK not only in the period of the Cold War but in the post-Cold War period. After their coming to power in the new century the new U.S. conservative forces designated the DPRK as \"the principal enemy\" and listed it as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a target of their preemptive nuclear attack and have since stepped up their preparations for a war of aggression against it. They have frantically pursued the policy to stifle the DPRK with nuclear weapons after scrapping the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-stepped up development of new-type minor nukes capable of striking underground military facilities in the DPRK goes to prove that the U.S. warlike forces are set to provoke a nuclear war in Korea at any cost. The anti-DPRK nuclear racket desperately kicked up by the U.S. in recent years is nothing but an attempt to invent a pretext for launching a war against the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits particular attention in the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK is that Washington laid bare its attempt to bring down the system in it. In the past century the U.S. regarded it as a policy towards the DPRK to perpetuate the division of Korea but now it adopted it as its Korea policy to \"unify Korea by absorbing the north through the overthrow of its system\" and is keen on its moves to stifle the DPRK. \r\n Neither peace and reunification of Korea nor peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world are thinkable as long as the U.S. troops stay in south Korea. The reunification of Korea precisely means the guarantee of durable peace and stability in Northeast Asia and will give impetus to the economic growth and prosperity in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop hamstringing the will and efforts of the Koreans to hasten the reunification of the country through the three forms of cooperation -- cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism -- under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and make a policy switchover to help them achieve the reunification of Korea. The article urges the U.S. to terminate its military presence in south Korea and roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK as early as possible.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
