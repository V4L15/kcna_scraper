Paektu in northern part of Korea where leader Kim Jong Il's native home is located, to mark February 16, his birthday, next year.\r\n Predrag Churchich, chairman of the Yugoslavia-Korea Friendship Association, in a statement said that it is quite natural in view of Kim Jong Il's great feats and his absolute position in the international communist movement and labour movement to hold the \"grand meeting to congratulate the sun of the 21st century\" in the area of the secret camp on Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Georgi Stoyanov, chairman of the Bulgaria-Korea Friendship Association, in his statement said that the world progressives boundlessly revere Kim Jong Il who is wisely leading the party, state and army of the DPRK, and expressed support to the appeal which called for holding the grand meeting.    \r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, it is evading it this or that way, blaming it on external factors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is a maladroit trick, that only shows the servile attitude of Japan in diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can Japan wriggle free from its responsibility for making apology and compensation to the Korean people for its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be well advised to stop the officious anti-DPRK isolation and suffocation campaign and make a bold decision to sincerely redress the past.    \r\n\r\n"

They have asserted that the bush administration is foiling the process of inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation only for the interests of the U.S. and that it is intentionally aggravating the situation, fearful that the affirmative development of the inter-Korean relations will require the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks in aggravating the situation is to gratify its wild ambition for aggression at the sacrifice of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n"

Its leadership and idea of giving importance to youth serve as a basic source which creates models of the times for solving the youth problem in the DPRK and enables the youth to be a great force who will undertake the cause of Juche, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan of the party \"Love Youth \" is pulsating with the WPK's firm will to grow the youth to be sons and daughters loyal to the party and accomplish the cause of Juche under any difficulties and ordeals. Our youth are the death-defying vanguard who believe only in their leader and devotedly defend the headquarters of revolution and a shock brigade who uphold the party's intention and plan with sincerity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are also the most powerful unit and pacesetters of communist traits who make the whole society full of the revolutionary zeal and stamina and beautiful deeds with examples of noble spirit and virtue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As there are our youth who have grown to be a vanguard of the party and reliable pillars of socialism thanks to the great idea of giving importance to youth, the WPK is strong and Korea's socialism is unshakable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean youth are firmly determined to become the fortress and shield that will defend leader Kim Jong Il in the advance of socialism under the red flag in the 21st century and inventors and creators of miracles in the struggle for national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unchangeable faith and will of the Korean youth that they will demonstrate the honor of being the party's youth vanguard in the course of devotedly defending the leader and upholding his idea and leadership with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Let us become youth heroes and heroines in the course of advancing socialism under the red flag in Kim Jong Il's century. This is the slogan upheld by the youth in the advance of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as there are youth who have prepared themselves to be party's young vanguard under Kim Jong Il's great politics of giving importance to youth, a powerful country of Juche will surely be built on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a set resolution and will of the WPK to hasten the advance in the new century true to the idea of giving importance to youth.    \r\n\r\n"
