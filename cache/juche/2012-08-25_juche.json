            "content": "Kim Jong Un Clarifies WPK's Firm Will to Build Reunified Thriving Nation, Tightly Holding Arms of Songun \r\n Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un made a speech at the banquet given in celebration of August 25, the anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's start of the Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said August 25 marks the 52nd anniversary of great Generalissimo Kim Jong Il's start of the Songun revolutionary leadership, adding that Kim Jong Il, totally dedicating himself with his patriotic will, holding high the banner of Songun all his life, built up an invincible military power and provided the might of the great unity between the army and people to be envied by the whole world and thus placed the dignity of the country and its people on the highest level in the history of the nation. These exploits will remain shining forever, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, reflecting the unanimous desire of all the service personnel of the KPA and people, paid highest tribute and extended eternal glory to Kim Jong Il, who dedicated himself to Songun journeys for patriotic devotion to the country and its people, burning his heart with warmth and love for them all his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"I am pleased to be amongst you comrades-in-arms in the eastern sector of the front on this significant day at a time when the enemies are busy with provocative drills for a war of aggression under our nose,\" he said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"August 25, along with April 25, is a historic day to go down in the history of the building of our revolutionary armed forces and the history of our country. The might of the KPA proud of being a powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu with tremendous capability and the dignity of our country, a world-class military power and a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, would be unthinkable without this day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm determination and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to defend the security of the country and the gains of revolution and build a reunified thriving nation on this land, tightly holding the arms of Songun provided by Generalissimo Kim Jong Il with so much effort, making journeys for the Songun revolutionary leadership all his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet army are staging large-scale war drills for aggression targeted against us even with forces of their allies involved, posing a grave threat to our security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During my inspection of units on the forefront in the southwestern sector of the front I already issued an order to the KPA to keep itself highly alerted against the reckless moves of the enemies and follow them with high vigilance. If the enemies fire even a single shell on our inviolable territory and territorial waters, the KPA should deal prompt deadly blows at them and the whole army should turn out as one and lead the battle to an all-out counter-offensive for accomplishing the great cause of national reunification. I issued this order to the whole army and examined the operational plan for implementing it and finally signed it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tã€€The courageous officers and men of the KPA, upon receiving this order, occupied their battle positions to cope with the reckless moves of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces and are now waiting for a final order for charge for a life-and death-battle against the enemies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  There is a limit to our patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  'Counter a provocation with a prompt counterattack and a war of aggression with a great, just war for national reunification!' This is our principled stand and steadfast will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  We will not remain an onlooker to the enemies' frantic moves for aggression but make every possible effort to protect the destiny of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the truth proved by history that no force on earth can overpower the people who are all out for the cause of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If another war breaks out on this land due to the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces' intolerable actions, though we does not want it, the war will only bring a shameless doom to them and our great nation will greet a new bright day of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only victory and glory will be in store for us advancing under the uplifted immortal banners bearing portraits of the great Comrade Kim Il Sung and Comrade Kim Jong Il with broad smile on their face.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing myself of this meaningful opportunity, I would like to renew once again the firm resolution to steadfastly and invariably keep to the path of Songun traversed by Comrade Kim Jong Il, arms in arms and shoulder to shoulder with you, for our country and revolution.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A rosy future is in store for the Korean people, he said, calling for holding more tightly the arms of revolution to protect their happiness and safety and the dignity of the power of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un proposed a toast to the final victory of the revolutionary causes of Juche and Songun pioneered by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and led by them successfully, to the health of the commanders and commanding officers of combined units and all servicepersons present and to the victorious advance of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu."

Since then the name of youth has been considered as a pronoun of the immortal feats, heroic struggle and great pride of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK in the history of the Juche revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il made sure that the name of youth shined with the highest dignity and honor in the history of the WPK and the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He saw to it that the day when the YCLK was founded was marked as Youth Day and he personally handed over the torch of the revolution to the youth at a rally celebrating the 50th anniversary of the WPK held at Kim Il Sung Square. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that the birth of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League was proclaimed at the conference of the League of Socialist Working Youth of Korea held in January 1996 and personally awarded the flag of the youth league bearing the image of the President to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President called the youth the vanguard of the revolution for the first time in history. True to his intention, Kim Jong Il granted to the youth league the greatest title of reliable political reserve of the WPK and reserve combat unit and detached force of the supreme commander. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean youth had the honor of receiving the precious titles such as human bullets and bombs devotedly defending the leader and the country, eternal companions of the party, staunch protectors, able builders and reliable defenders of socialism, flowers of the country and the nation and the most vital unit of society in the course of glorifying the noble titles given by the peerless Songun commander. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung Youth Honor Prize and Kim Jong Il Youth Honor Prize, top prizes for the Korean youth, were instituted in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people have grown up to be patriotic and loyal fighters and performers of feats to beautifully record the name of youth in the history of the country in the course of glorifying Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's idea of attaching importance to the youth and their leadership exploits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung Youth Honor Prize has been awarded to nearly 900 organizations of the youth league and more than 10 000 young people over the last four decades.
