Reunification is for the prosperity of the nation and both peace on this land and inter-Korean cooperation are aimed at achieving national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whoever opts for cooperating with foreign forces, depending on them while turning his back on his compatriots and disregarding the driving force of the nation, is bound to be forsaken by it and fated to face a stern judgement of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish act than trying to settle the issue of the destiny of the nation by depending on the aggressive and hegemonic foreign forces, which brought sufferings resulting from division and disasters of war to the Korean nation and are still keen to impose disasters of a nuclear war upon it, and putting them above the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to firmly maintain the stand of giving importance to the nation it is necessary to decisively reject outside forces' domination and interference and abide by the principle of national independence. It is essential to protect the security and interests of the nation and strictly abide by the principles of giving priority to the nation and defending it, not caving in to the unreasonable pressure and threat and blackmail of the foreign forces who have blatantly interfered in the issues of inter-Korean relations and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should invariably remain true to the spirit of \"By our nation itself\", the idea of independence common to the nation and the banner of the June 15 era of reunification, and fully embody it, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
