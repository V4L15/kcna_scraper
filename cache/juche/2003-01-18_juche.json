            "content": "U.S. is chiefly to blame for worst situation in Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun yesterday carried an article entitled \"The U.S. is Chiefly to Blame for the Worst Situation on the Korean Peninsula.\"\r\n The article said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the DPRK Government in a statement solemnly declared its complete ithdrawal from the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the U.S., the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Japan and other countries and dishonest forces expressed \"concern,\" asserting that it should be \"reconsidered\" and it would \"put the nuclear non-proliferation system in danger\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to withdraw from the NPT as a self-defence step taken after careful consideration to cope with the grave situation where its supreme interests are most seriously threatened by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A close scrutiny made into how this situation was created, the background against which the nuclear issue surfaced and its nature from a historical point of view and on the basis of facts clearly explains the U.S. is the author of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula as the U.S. has posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK for scores of years by massively deploying and stockpiling nukes in and around South Korea, pursuant to its hostile policy toward Pyongyang in line with its strategy to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists tried several times to use an a-bomb against the DPRK already during the last Korean War and began introducing many nuclear weapons into South Korea after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified its official stand to oppose the U.S. shipment of nuclear weapons into South Korea at the 12th session of its Supreme People's Assembly held in 1956. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In April 1959, the DPRK Government warned the U.S. imperialists against turning South Korea into a nuclear base and put forward a proposal to create a nuclear-free peace zone in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have staged ceaseless war exercises of different forms such as \"Team Spirit\", \"Ulji Focus Lens\" and \"Foal Eagle\" by mobilizing nuclear forces in South Korea and in its vicinity to threaten the DPRK with nuclear weapons and increase the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the united states that compelled the DPRK to withdraw from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF) the U.S. was committed to provide light water reactors to the DPRK by 2003 in return for the DPRK's freezing of its graphite-moderated reactors and related facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though it is already 9 years since the DPRK froze its nuclear facilities, only site preparation was made in the LWR project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the AF both sides were committed to work for fully normalizing the political and economic relations, but the U.S. has persistently enforced its hostile policy and economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AF also called on the U.S. to give formal assurances against its use or threat of nuclear weapons to the DPRK, but the U.S. has increased its nuclear threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stopped the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK from December last year, the only commitment that had been implemented under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the situation where a vacuum is created in the power production due to the U.S. stop of its supply of heavy oil to the DPRK, the latter lifted the freeze on its nuclear facilities, a measure taken as part of the simultaneous actions on the part of the two sides on the premise that the U.S. would annually  supply 500,000 tons of heavy oil to the DPRK under the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, and resumed the operation and construction of facilities to generate electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has increased its nuclear threat to the DPRK by staging nuclear war exercises one after another in and around South Korea after massively deploying nuclear weapons there in violation of the letter and spirit of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Bush officially declared its policy of confrontation with North Korea in what he called a \"statement on the North Korea policy\". Early last year the Bush bellicose forces listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and later a target of its nuclear strikes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stepped up the preparations to develop and deploy a new type of nuclear weapon to be used for destroying underground facilities of the DPRK in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula and ordered the U.S. air force in South Korea to load large warheads which can go down deep into the ground and blow up targets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After flying into Pyongyang, a special envoy of the U.S. President demanded the DPRK clear the U.S. of its \"security concern,\" absurdly clamoring about the DPRK's \"enriched uranium program\". He also threatened and blackmailed the DPRK, saying that if the DPRK does not accept the U.S. unilateral demand first, there will be no progress in the DPRK-Japan and inter-Korean relations, to say nothing of the dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK told the special envoy who was taking such an extremely menacing and high-handed attitude that it is entitled to have something more powerful than a nuclear weapon to cope with the U.S. escalated offensive to stifle it with nukes. this was an entirely legitimate exercise of its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, no sooner had the special envoy gone back to the U.S. than it escalated the moves to internationally pressurize and isolate the DPRK while spreading the rumor that the DPRK \"admitted its nuclear program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. raised the unreasonable and brigandish demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program before dialogue, far from honestly responding to the DPRK's constructive proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the DPRK reacted to this with a tougher stand, the U.S. bellicose circles called for a \"military retaliation,\" clamouring about a \"nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula\" and \"victory in wars against Iraq and North Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. instigated the IAEA to adopt an unreasonable resolution against the DPRK. \r\n At the beck and call of the U.S., the IAEA issued an ultimatum threatening sanctions, treating the DPRK as a \"criminal\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts clearly indicate who is chiefly to blame for the present grave situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, recently the U.S., in conspiracy with the IAEA, kicked up a row, blustering that the \"nuclear issue\" of the DPRK should be put before the UN and sanctions be imposed upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the DPRK withdrew from the NPT, its nuclear activity at the present stage will be limited to such peaceful purposes as electricity production.    \r\n     \r\n"

It will invite a very dangerous international arms race and make the boundary line between nuclear weapons and conventional weapons vague. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the official announcement of its withdrawal from the ABM treaty last year, the bush administration is free to establish the missile defence system, a replica of \"star wars\", from the year 2004.

This is, however, a wrong understanding of the U.S. black-hearted intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Kelly said is, in essence, nothing different from the U.S. unilateral assertion that \"North Korea should scrap its nuclear program before dialogue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants peace on the Korean Peninsula and the settlement of the nuclear issue, it should conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK and formally declare the abandonment of its hostile policy toward the latter at the negotiating table. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the U.S. does so, it is possible to clear the U.S. of its worries and ensure peace and stability in Northeast Asia because Washington is chiefly to blame for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK withdrew from the NPT and restarted its nuclear facilities entirely because of the U.S. gross violation of the NPT and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, Kelly is chiefly accountable for dreaming up the fiction of the DPRK's \"development of nuclear weapons\" in a premeditated manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Kelly listened to the DPRK's serious warning during his visit to the DPRK as a special envoy of the U.S. President in early October last, he should have prudently approached it and admitted that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK was anachronistic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Kelly played first fiddle to hatching a sinister plot to publicize the DPRK's warning as its \"admission of nuclear weapons development\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is now talking about \"multi-faceted dialogue\" and \"energy aid,\" insisting on the absurd demand that the DPRK \"scrap its nuclear program before dialogue.\" This is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush administration has nothing to regret over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula before the international community, there is no reason for it to fail to come out to negotiations with the DPRK to settle bilateral pending issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully ready for both dialogue and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear in mind that all the issues can be settled satisfactorily at the dialogue with the DPRK only when the former has a sincere attitude based on good faith.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
