This is an outright challenge to the whole Korean nation who wants the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and the peace-loving people in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States will surely have to pay dearly for such military challenge as seriously straining the overall situation in the Asia-pacific region, to say nothing of the Korean peninsula, and harassing peace and stability.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry articles 56 years since the U.S. military occupation of South Korea.\r\n The papers say that history of the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea is a crime-woven history in which they divided Korea into two parts and inflicted the scourge of the 3-year war upon the Korean nation and a history of aggression and interference in which the U.S. has persisted in blocking the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, engrossed in armed provocations intended to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their presence in South Korea poses a serious threat to peace and security not only in the Korean peninsula but in northeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific region, they note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces stationed in South Korea serve as front-line forces that militarily back the U.S. policy of aggression on the DPRK and carry out its scenario for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can predict when a war will be started by the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression on the Korean peninsula as the DPRK and the United States are still technically at war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea is a fundamental guarantee for preventing another war and ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula. It is the most urgent issue in realizing reconciliation and cooperation and ensuring peace and security on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither ground nor pretext for the U.S. forces to stay in South Korea as the agreement on non-aggression was adopted and took effect between the north and the south of Korea, the agreed framework calling for joint efforts for peace and security was adopted between the DPRK and the United States and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration was published to independently solve the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An article of Minju Joson urges the united states to give up its tough hostile policy towards the DPRK and take the earliest possible step for the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea if it truly wants the peaceful solution to the Korean problem and peace and security in Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n"
