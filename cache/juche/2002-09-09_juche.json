Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The guiding idea of the DPRK is the Juche idea founded by President Kim Il Sung and its state charter is the Kim Il Sung constitution in which his idea of state-building and feats are consummated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the \"arduous march\" Kim Jong Il strengthened the position and authority of the National Defence Commission in the state structure of the DPRK and pursued the unique army-based political mode. \r\n Far-reaching is his plan to build the country into a prosperous and powerful nation in the near future and his determination is steadfast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should see all the issues from a new stand and on a new height and improve the work to meet the requirements for the building of a powerful nation and swim with the trend of the development in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will in the future, too, consistently abide by the three charters of national reunification and implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration to the letter, thus reunifying the country by the Korean nation itself without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will externally adhere to the independent stand and strive to check and frustrate the imperialists' moves for aggression and war and defend peace in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world. We will also expand and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with all countries that respect the DPRK's sovereignty.    \r\n   \r\n"
