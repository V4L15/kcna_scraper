Korean Authorities' Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights\" Campaign\r\n Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) --  The south Korean ruling forces are mulling setting up in south Korea the UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\" tasked to conduct an anti-DPRK smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye claimed that the settlement of \"the north's human rights issue\" should be topped in laying \"foundations for the era of unification\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Coteries of the ruling \"Saenuri Party\" in south Korea made public a \"joint statement\" in demand of the establishment of the UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\". Meanwhile, 17 conservative and reactionary organizations including the \"Citizens' Solidarity for Human Rights in North\" and wicked conservative media are also calling for setting up the \"office\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an awful act contrary to the common sense for those living in tundra of human rights to talk about the \"human rights issue\". And it is no more than a political cartoon for them to call for setting up the \"office\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, the puppet south Korean regime co-sponsored a \"resolution on human rights in north Korea\" at the UN Human Rights Council to slander the fellow countrymen. Its reckless scheme to set up the \"office\" in south Korea shows that they made it an established fact to bring the north-south relations to a total bankruptcy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the sincere effort made by the DPRK for the improved bilateral relations, an atmosphere of reconciliation had prevailed on the Korean Peninsula until some time ago. But, the situation on the peninsula is getting tense again, entirely due to the confrontation policy of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean forces have created a touch-and-go situation on the peninsula by staging Foal Eagle and Max Thunder joint military exercises.  And they were hell-bent on the moves for confrontation with the fellow countrymen in breach of the agreement adopted by the north and the south to stop slandering each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the scheme for setting up UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\" clearly shows that the south Korean authorities' attempt to isolate and stifle the DPRK, in league with outsiders, has reached extremely dangerous stage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they seek in setting up the \"office\" is to make the DPRK's \"human rights issue\" a topic for world public discussion and then incite the bitterness toward the DPRK and further strengthen the cooperation for anti-DPRK \"human rights\" smear campaign with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean regime's scheme for such illegal plotting body is an extremely reckless and hostile act against the fellow countrymen, which surpasses the preceding regime's anti-DPRK deeds. The preceding regime, keen on the anti-DPRK human rights campaign at the instigation of the U.S., dared not attempt to set up such office in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its hysteric attempt to stage, through the \"office\", actions of slandering the dignity and social system of the DPRK in coordination with foreign forces hostile toward it, is now being censured by all the fellow countrymen as a thrice-cursed confrontational farce pursuant to the U.S. human rights offensive against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not act rashly, mindful that such human rights smear campaign by the hostile forces can never work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are advised to quit the imprudent \"human rights\" campaign aimed to do harm to the sovereignty and social system of the DPRK."
