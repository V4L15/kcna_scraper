Korean Authorities to Think Twice over Politically Motivated Farce\r\n Pyongyang, September 14 (KCNA) -- Recently the south Korean conservatives cooked up what they called plotted rebellion to kick up a whirlwind of suppression of a lawmaker from the Unified Progressive Party (UPP) and others concerned and deliberately linked them to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t Confrontation maniacs are crying out for clarifying any linkage of the UPP with the DPRK, asserting that \"some forces formed an underground revolutionary organization guided by the Juche idea\" and they are \"forces keen to overthrow the social system in cooperation with the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is stunned to see the south Korean regime kicking up a campaign of harsh suppression, slandering the north at a time when there is a positive sign of improving the north-south relations thanks to the DPRK's sincere efforts for national reconciliation and the improvement of the inter-Korean ties and the expectation and attention of public at home and abroad are focused on detente on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another confrontation farce going against the trend of the times towards democracy in south Korean society and north-south dialogue and improved inter-Korean ties and an unpardonable challenge to the DPRK's will to mend the ties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Intelligence Service should be brought to justice for its interference in the \"election.\" It, however, is making much fuss about the plotted rebellion under the wire-pulling of the south Korean authorities. Even prosecution and conservative media patronized by the \"Saenuri Party\" are busy kicking up a row about the disclosure of \"the north-linked force to overthrow the system\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the successive fascist dictators of south Korea fabricated shocking \"spy cases\" and groundlessly linked them with the DPRK to mercilessly suppress the progressive forces calling for independence, democracy and reunification whenever they were driven into a ruling crisis. The brutal suppression of those related to the UPP is little different from the military dictators' crackdown in their methods. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean public protests this repressive campaign, holding that the authorities chose the old method of trumpeting about the theory of coloring and suppression under the pretext of security in a bid to clear the suspicion of the fraudulent \"presidential election\" and no matter how desperately they suppress the people at the point of bayonet as they did in the 1970s, they can never gag the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They can never tide over their political crisis, a product of confrontation and dictatorial rule, with an anachronistic political farce. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fascist confrontation maniacs are seriously mistaken if they calculate they can stifle the pro-reunification patriotic forces, progressive and democratic forces in south Korea and torpedo the process for improving the north-south relations and stem the trend of the times in the vicinity of Korea with such despicable plots. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now all Koreans and international community support the DPRK's sincere efforts for detente on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and watch with vigilance the south Korean puppet authorities' acts of treachery going against them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' behavior paying lip-service to dialogue and slandering their dialogue partner behind the scene and inciting confrontation would only stoke distrust and confrontation between compatriots and adversely affect the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should think twice over the catastrophic consequences of confrontation between fellow countrymen and stop at once all acts getting on the nerves of the dialogue partner. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to draw a serious lesson from the history of the north-south relations."
