            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Landing and Anti-landing Drills of KPA Units\r\nPyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, on Monday guided the landing and anti-landing drills of KPA Large Combined Units 324 and 287 and KPA Navy Combined Unit 597. \n\t\t\t\t\tHe issued an order for drills without any notice and finally examined the landing and anti-landing capabilities of the large combined units of the KPA Ground Force and the KPA Navy combined unit situated in the eastern sector of the front and the east coastal area. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter receiving a report on the plan of the drills, he gave an order to start the drills. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst the drill of striking and wiping out landing enemies in the waters took place. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMultiple launch rocket systems opened fire all at once. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was greatly satisfied with the drill. He said \"It was well done\", adding that the units made intensive firing at the group of enemy warships after setting a correct time for firing on the basis of the full grasp of the enemy's landing plan and when the rate of destroying enemy ships was considered as the highest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe stressed the need to destroy the enemies in waters to the last man through strong firepower so that they might not land in the coast of the territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe ordered the soldiers of the heroic KPA to display their mettle in the great war against the enemies and send all of them to the bottom of the sea as they run wild like wolves threatened with fire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen the landing operation of KPA Navy Unit 597 started. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHigh-speed boats charged into the coast in succession.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching through field glasses combatants occupying enemy positions at a breath, he said they look highly-spirited and if it were an actual battle, the enemies would have no time to come to their senses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe called the women soldiers of the 3rd artillery piece of the 1st Platoon of a battery under KPA Large Combined Unit 324 who had been involved in the artillery firing at the landing enemies to come close to him. He personally designated a firepower position beside him and set a target without any notice before giving an order to destroy it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon receiving the order, members of the women's multiple rocket system rapidly took the firepower position and accurately hit the target. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe shook their hands one by one, praising them as great soldiers and crack shots. They performed their duties well though he had set without any notice a target which was not envisaged in the drill program and assigned to them duty to destroy it, he said. He took them to his arms before having a photo taken with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"How praiseworthy Korean women are and a-match-for-a-hundred members of the women's multiple rocket system can never be compared with nukes\", he noted, earnestly telling them to conduct training better and launch a dynamic campaign to become one-beats- a hundred crack shots at ordinary times and hero artillery women by sending enemy warships to the bottom of the sea in the decisive battles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Hyon Yong Chol, Pak Jong Chon and Rim Kwang Il."

This is little short of senseless rhetoric to shift the responsibility for the present situation on to the DPRK and escalate the atmosphere for slapping the DPRK with sanctions and pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs mentioned earlier, the DPRK's nuclear weapons serve as a just and treasured sword for defending the country's sovereignty and security. This was prompted by a historical lesson drawn from the confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the invariable policy of the U.S. to seize the peninsula, an important political and military and geographical vantage point in the Asia-Pacific region and realize its ambition for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor this purpose, the U.S. has regarded the DPRK, that has stood on the forefront for peace against imperialism and for socialism, as a thorn in its flesh for nearly seven decades since it illegally occupied south Korea in September 1945, and persistently committed moves to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMost conspicuous in the U.S. moves in carrying out its policy toward the DPRK is that it considered nuclear weapons as a basic means for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has so far invariably relied on nuclear weapons in shaping its policy toward the DPRK whether it opted for confrontation or dialogue with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. constant nuclear blackmail and war policy forced the DPRK to draw a final conclusion that it has to access powerful nuclear deterrent, physical means for defending the country's sovereignty and the nation's supreme interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's nuclear armed forces serve as a means for a just war for terminating the U.S. persistent hostile policy toward the DPRK and removing the danger of a nuclear war forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's option will remain unchanged as long as the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward it and the strongholds of aggression targeting it exist on earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is ridiculous for the U.S. to talk about approval and recognition over the DPRK's nuclear possession which was the exercise of its sovereignty and a measure for self-defence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat's more, it has gone so mean as to describe those measures as a thing in return for economic aid and a bargaining chip for dialogue, prompted by its money-is-everything way of thinking. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should clearly understand that sophism and allurement can neither undermine the truth of the DPRK's possession of nukes for self-defense nor discuss unilateral abandonment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. desperate employment of poor tricks will only disclose its policy toward the DPRK caught in the crossfire and the plight of present U.S. administration which is driven to the wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has no intent to have dialogue with the U.S. which is pursuing the policy of nuclear blackmail but will follow the road of Songun, its option, without any vacillation."

Its criminal acts turned the Korean Peninsula into the biggest hotspot in the world and a theater where a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. in collusion with hostile forces made up of riff-raffs has posed serious threats to the DPRK's sovereignty through the persistent and vicious military blackmail and economic blockade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces were the actual nuclear war rehearsals that activated nuclear strike means including B-52 capable of carrying nuclear warheads and nuclear-armed submarine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a brazen-faced violation and encroachment on AA and all the north-south agreements and an unpardonable provocation and infringement on the DPRK's sovereignty and supreme interests.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe unprecedentedly acute and serious state of political and military emergency prevailing on the Korean Peninsula urged the DPRK to terminate at an early date the geopolitical disaster, neither a war nor peace, which has lasted century after century on this land, and take a bold decision to guarantee the national sovereignty and regional stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe decision to nullify AA was a countermeasure for self-defense taken by the DPRK as it felt no need to be bound to the agreement which exists in form only owing to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is illogical for the hostile forces including the U.S. to build up the public opinion critical of the DPRK's \"violation\" over its toughest countermeasure while asserting that \"AA can not be unilaterally dissolved as it was agreed and signed with mutual agreement\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAA is not one that requires bilateral agreement to be rendered invalid and it will be naturally nullified if one side does not abide by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAA has long been invalid due to the systematic scrapping of it by the U.S. and the unreasonable behavior of the UN Security Council that backed the U.S. moves for the last six decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen AA was concluded on July 27, 1953, at the end of the 500 odd-day heated talks, the attention and expectation of all the Korean people and peace-loving people of the world focused on its paragraph 60.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe implementation of paragraph 60 was a key issue in realizing the country's reunification and contributing to the Asian and global peace as it called for withdrawing all foreign troops from Korea, removing the root cause of a war and solving the Korean problem peacefully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the U.S. signed the \"mutual defense treaty\" with south Korea according to its already worked-out scenario on August 8, 1953, when the ink on the deal was barely dry, and legalized its military presence in south Korea. Therefore, it nullified paragraph 60 on the removal of all foreign armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParagraph 13 d of AA banned the introduction of operational planes, armed vehicles, weapons and munitions from outside Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. unilaterally declared the abrogation of paragraph 13 d of AA on June 21, 1957 and systemically introduced huge modern military hardware and over 1,000 nuclear weapons of different kinds into south Korea. As a result, south Korea has turned into the biggest nuclear outpost and nuclear arsenal in the Far East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. deliberately repealed or violated the paragraphs of AA that stand in the way of its preparations for a new war in Korea and destroyed all the mechanisms overseeing the implementation of AA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. serious breach of AA rendered defunct sentences related to the Military Armistice Commission i.e. from points 19 to 35 of paragraph 2 as well as those related to the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission i.e. from points 36 to 50 of the same paragraph.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has made ceaseless military provocations against the DPRK free from any legal and institutional restrictions and binding force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is evidenced by the fact that the cases of violation of AA totaled hundreds of thousands entailing hundreds of meetings of the Military Armistice Commission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAA was able to exist though in form thanks to the DPRK's exercise of utmost self-restraint and patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK advanced lots of proposals for ending the state of armistice and setting up mechanism for ensuring durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. They included the one for concluding a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. (in the 1970s), the one for holding tripartite talks including south Korea in the DPRK-U.S. talks (in the 1980s), the one for setting up new mechanism of ensuring peace (in the 1990s), the one for pushing for the issue of declaring the end of war at the talks of the countries concerned in AA (the Declaration for Development of North-South Relations, Peace and Prosperity on Oct. 4 in 2007) and the one for promptly starting the talks to replace AA with a peace treaty on the 60th anniversary of the start of the Korean war (the statement of the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Jan. 11 in 2010).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., however, ignored and turned down all these proposals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has never abided by AA but pursued a war, not peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was absolutely unacceptable for the DPRK in the light of the supreme interests of the sovereign state to remain bound to the perfunctory document thrown away like a pair of old shoes by the other belligerent party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA war breaks out unexpectedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK was compelled to take a substantial countermeasure of nullifying AA to defend the security of the country and the gains of the revolution and secure the sovereignty of the Korean nation in the face of the U.S. threat of aggression getting more outrageous not restrained by AA."

GIs went on shooting spree against pedestrians in the heart of Seoul during their DPRK-targeted war drills.

Another group of GIs teased women in a lift of an apartment building and on the subway car.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInfuriated by GIs' crimes, people of various circles in south Korea are shouting slogan \"Let's drive the U.S. forces, perpetrators of all sorts of evils and crimes, out of this land as soon as possible\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBrass hats of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea are letting loose such rhetoric as \"apology\" or \"measure\" in a bid to calm down the south Koreans' resistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese atrocities are a vivid manifestation of extreme arrogance of the occupation forces which regard south Korea as their colony and its people for a plaything, brutal nature of the cannibals' group and the shameless way of thinking of the colonial ruler. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLooking back on history, GIs' robbery, murder, rape and violence were daily occurrence for the last several decades since their landing in south Korea.
