He earnestly said that if they produced 10 000 tons of steel additionally it would greatly help the country and called upon them to tide over the difficulties of the revolution, firmly believing each other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his love and trust, the great Chollima era was ushered in this land and the Korean people could adorn the annals of the revolution with heroic epics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers of Kangson rushed ahead at the speed of Chollima, shattering passivism and conservatism. In the course of this, they wrought a miracle of turning out 120,000 tons of steel from the blooming mill with a capacity of 60,000 tons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flame of innovation kindled in Kangson spread all over the country as a torchlight for the grand Chollima march. The furnace-men of the then Kim Chaek Iron Works produced 270,000 tons of pig iron from a furnace with a capacity of 190,000 tons while the automobile-makers manufactured the trial lorry in a matter of 40 days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Constructors of the capital built 20,000 flats with materials, funds and manpower for 7,000 flats and the railway constructors completed Haeju-Hasong railway project, that would take three to four years, in two and a half months. Such great leaps were made on all sectors of the socialist construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the might of the harmonious whole, the Korean people realized in 14 years the industrialization that had taken hundreds of years in other countries and built a powerful socialist country independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the leader-people harmonious whole which is being consolidated by General Secretary Kim Jong Il is the basic guarantee for the DPRK to win victory after victory in the teeth of any trials and difficulties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will demonstrate its dignity as an invincible socialist powerful state in the coming years, too, along with the history of the harmonious whole of the leader and people."
