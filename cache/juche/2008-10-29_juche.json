            "content": "DPRK's Stand on S. Korean Puppets' Anti-DPRK Confrontational Racket Clarified\r\n Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the north side delegation to the north-south military talks gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday as regards the south Korean puppets' confrontational racket against the DPRK going beyond a tolerance limit with each passing day:\n\t\t\t\t\t We clarify our stand that should the south Korean puppet authorities continue scattering leaflets and conducting a smear campaign with sheer fabrications, our army will take a resolute practical action as we have already warned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLong ago we have seen through the sinister aim sought by the south Korean puppet authorities to go on with the anti-DPRK psychological warfare while citing what they called \"peculiarities of the south Korean society\" and \"deeds of non-governmental organizations\" as pretexts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs far as the \"peculiarities of the south Korean society\" are concerned, the puppet authorities have put even the conservative media under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the \"deeds of non-governmental organizations\", they are nothing but premeditated operations conducted by the conservative organizations which the \"National Intelligence Service\" and other institutions of the puppet authorities use as a shock brigade in kicking up an anti-DPRK confrontational racket while directly feeding and clothing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet authorities respond to our repeated warnings with excuses and pretexts, the army of the DPRK will have no option but to go over to practical actions as clarified at the October 2 north-south military working talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs for the \"preemptive strike\" which the puppet warhawks officially announced as a basic mode of strike at the DPRK, we will counter it with more powerful and advanced preemptive strike of our own style as we have already stated before the world. This is our steadfast stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The advanced preemptive strike of our own style is based on a preemptive strike beyond imagination relying on striking means more powerful than a nuclear weapon. It will, therefore, render any early warning system and interceptor system of the puppet warmongers completely ineffective, and the \"preemptive strike\" based on the so-called method of fighting a war centering on Network much touted by them will also prove futile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet authorities had better bear in mind that the advanced preemptive strike of our own style will reduce everything opposed to the nation and reunification to debris, not just setting them on fire, and it will turn out to be a just war of strike to build an independent reunified state on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the south Korean puppet authorities keep approaching the historic inter-Korean declarations and all the north-south agreements based on them, quite contrary to their words, the DPRK will make a crucial decision including the total severance of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPractical actions are more important than their lip-service to \"respect\" for the two declarations adopted between the north and the south and the \"resumption of talks\" for the implementation of the agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK will provide a powerful military guarantee for the crucial decision to be made by our side in case the south Korean puppets persist in their undisguised act of scrapping the historic north-south declarations and military agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK will closely follow the future movement of the puppet authorities."

Minju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary.  \n\t\t\t\t\t Before vociferating about someone's abduction issue, Japan should have honestly admitted and repented of and settled the issue of the forcible drafting of Koreans committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past and the luring and abduction of citizens of the DPRK perpetrated by Japan in recent years, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's call for tightening \"sanctions\" against the DPRK and increasing pressure upon it over the abduction issue is nothing but a rash act which reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as foolish and ridiculous an act as running one's head to a wall for Japan to try to do harm to the DPRK through \"sanctions\" and \"pressure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are sticking to the sanctions even though they know well such action is useless because they do not work on the DPRK at all.
