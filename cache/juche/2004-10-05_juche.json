            "content": "U.S. \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA today as regards the recent passage of the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" through the U.S.\r\nSenate:\r\n Recently, the U.S. Senate passed the act presented by the House of Representatives in July after partly modifying and supplementing it, despite the concern and opposition at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The act is full of anti-DPRK poisonous clauses. It calls for spending out of the U.S. government budget 24 million U.S. dollars for those organizations and individuals taking part in the activities to bring down the system in the DPRK under the pretext of \"improving the human rights situation in north Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the act was clearly revealed by the remarks made by a senator from the Republican Party just before its passage that the downfall of the north Korean government is not far off as was the case with the collapse of the former Soviet Union. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the long run, the act is one more declaration of the hostile Korea policy which fully disclosed the U.S. real intention to slander and insult the DPRK, a dignified sovereign state, and topple the socialist system chosen by its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing strange that the U.S. is hell bent on its hostile Korea policy as it is steeped in the inveterate denial of the DPRK system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. says this and that about the human rights issue of someone, unaware of its position in which it is being censured as the worst violator of human rights. This is a challenge to human conscience. The U.S. is the world's worst violator of human rights as it is killing innocent civilians including children everyday after illegally igniting a war against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is so brazen-faced as to cry out for \"global security\" and talk about \"human rights\" after reducing Iraq to a sea of blood. Nothing is more disgusting than this behaviour.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has already provided strong financial and material support to those organizations hatching plots against the DPRK around it. In the meantime, it is pressurizing some countries to create ample environment for conducting the operation to tarnish the DPRK's international image and bring down its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly testifies to the truth that the DPRK should counter the Bush administration with the corresponding force only as it is totally rejecting the dignified Korean style ideology and system and persistently working to impose the American style view on value and way of living, pursuant to the policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has reached a reckless phase of its efforts to destroy the socialist system in the DPRK, totally denying the co-existence with it, and thus rendered the dialogue and negotiations for solving the nuclear issue meaningless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has deprived the DPRK of any justification to deal with the U.S., to say nothing of the reason for holding the six-party talks for settling the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now left with no option but to put spurs to increasing the deterrent force to counter the U.S. by force to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Desperate efforts on the part of the U.S. to destroy the system in the DPRK will only reinforce the faith of its army and people in socialism and heighten their spirit to shatter the U.S. reckless provocations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Threat of Preemptive Attack on DPRK Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush, speaking recently at the 59th session of the UN General Assembly, vociferated about the validity of the U.S. aggression on Iraq, contending that it helped liberate the Iraqi people from a dictator. He went to the lengths of stating without hesitation that the U.S. would have attacked Iraq even if it had known that the latter had no weapons of mass destruction.\r\n Commenting on this a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday brands his remarks as outcries of a fascist tyrant steeped in war, murder and plunder, which revealed strong-arm and arbitrary practices and unilateralism utterly ignoring the UN Charter and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the world public recognizes, the Iraqi war unleashed by the U.S. was a war of injustice marred by criminal massacre of Iraqis and worst abuses of their human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Extreme social confusion and disorder, never ceasing vicious cycle of terrorism and retaliation, tragedies of bloodshed everywhere, growing unemployment and economic stagnancy--this is the reality of Iraq \"liberated from the dictator\" claimed by Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His rigmarole about \"liberation\" and \"help\" is an insult to the Iraqi people, a challenge to international law and a reversed logic of a murderous robber. His outpouring that the U.S. would have attacked Iraq even though it had known that the latter had no weapons of mass destruction glaringly revealed the aggressive and predatory nature of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which has got more arrogant through its aggression on Iraq is intensifying its military moves around the Korean peninsula, directing the sharp edge of its preemptive strike to the DPRK. The situation is becoming more complicated and the danger of war is growing at the moment when the next round of the six-party talks ended abortive owing to the U.S. The U.S. threat of preemptive attack on the DPRK is being carried into reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reality leaves the DPRK no alternative but to increase its war deterrent in every possible way with high revolutionary vigilance. No one can tell when the U.S. imperialists would make a preemptive attack on the DPRK as they regard it as a key to the implementation of their strategy of aggression on Asia to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. should face things squarely. A preemptive attack is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it dare fire first, not seeing who is its adversary, it will have to pay dearly for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The history of the presence of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea is a history of disasters as it has checked the socio-political development in south Korea and brought all sorts of misfortune and sufferings to the Koreans and a crime-woven history as it has stood in the way of the uniform development of the Korean nation and seriously threatened peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can never pardon the U.S. imperialists because they have drenched the whole of south Korea with the blood shed by them, keeping it under their occupation for about 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their military occupation severed the blood ties of the Korean nation which had lived together for 5,000 years, imposing upon the Korean people bitter sufferings and tragedy resulting from the division upon it in the new century, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. occupation of south Korea, Korea would not have been divided into two parts and but for the U.S. persistent obstructions, the Korean nation would have achieved its reunification long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the U.S. that installed a puppet regime in south Korea, hamstringing the Korean people's efforts to establish a unified government after their country's liberation on August 15, 1945 and ignited a war against the north early in the 50s, dampening the Koreans' desire for peaceful reunification. The U.S. imperialists have worked more desperately to block the movement for the reunification of Korea in the new century when energetic efforts are being made to implement the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Undertakings for north-south reconciliation, exchange and cooperation are faced with frustration and confusion due to the U.S. plots and moves against reunification. The U.S. imperialists have played with the destiny of the Korean nation and imposed sacrifices upon it for nearly six decades in a bid to realize their aggressive ambition. These crimes are unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans in the north and the south and overseas will turn out as one in the nationwide struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggression forces out of south Korea without delay and thus put a definite end to the disgraceful history of keeping aggressor forces in their land, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Haeburu's old capital was occupied by Haemosu. Haemosu marries to Ryu Hwa, a daughter of Ha Paek, without her parents' approval. So she goes into exile in the area south of Mt. Thaebaek. King Kumwa, a son of Haeburu, meets with Ryu Hwa and listens to her story. And he lets her live in a detached palace. She gives birth to a son called Jumong. Princes of Puyo are jealous of him and weave a plot to kill him because he has been brave and crack archer from childhood. Jumong, together with his friends, flees from the area and arrives at the Holbon Stream. Learning that the area has steep mountains and fertile land, he builds a country beside the River Piryu and names it Koguryo. He takes the first letter of the country's name \"Ko\" as his surname. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, stories about the building of Koguryo by Jumong are recorded in various other historical documents. Among them are the book \"Part of King Tongmyong\" by Ri Kyu Bo in 1193, \"Story of Successive Kings\" by Ri Sung Hyu in 1287, \"Samgukyusa\" by Il Yon at the end of the 13th century and Paekje Part of \"Samguksagi\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such historical books as \"Samgukyusa\" and \"Geographical Book of True Records of Sejong\" write King Tongmyong as Emperor Tongmyong and that Koguryo, an empire, instituted and used its own calander and had some states of feudal lords, rejecting foreign domination and interference and exercising sovereignty. All this vividly shows the features of Koguryo as a sovereign state.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an immortal exploit as it helped lay an eternal cornerstone for successfully carrying forward and accomplishing the idea and cause of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has more striking features as an invincible militant party because all its members are rallied close around the headquarters of the revolution with a single idea, intention and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the banner of Songun politics, the Party has been further developed as a mother party which serves the people and strives to meet their interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in the leadership exploits performed by Kim Jong Il in strengthening and developing the WPK into an ever-victorious steel-strong party is that he made sure that its ranks turned into a contingent of Songun revolutionary soldiers replete with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the leadership role of the party was increased in every way to meet the need of the Songun era and wisely steered the work to bring about a new turn in work style and trait of the officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Songun leadership serves as a great revolutionary banner making it possible to glorify the WPK as an eternal party of Kim Il Sung and as an invincible treasured sword for drastically increasing the militancy of the party in defending socialism and building a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
