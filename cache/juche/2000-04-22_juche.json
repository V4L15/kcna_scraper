But this ruse is intended to hide their true design and their criminal moves for a biological and chemical war and create a social environment for stepping up the development and production of those weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Well informed of the efficiency and capability of the biological and chemical weapons, Japan has long prepared this war.

There is nothing impossible when one works in this spirit, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The essence of the spirit is the indomitable fighting spirit of resolutely defending the party, the leader and socialism despite the most regorous trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kanggye spirit created under the most difficult conditions during the \"arduous march\" is pervaded with the spirit of absolutely worshiping the leader and devotedly defending him, the spirit of devotedly implementing his orders without fear of death, the spirit of self-reliance and the spirit of revolutionary optimism. Herein lie the inexhaustible vitality of the Kanggye spirit and the reason why it is regarded as the spirit of the times symbolic of socialist Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For its staunch and noble nature the spirit has demonstrated its great might in carrying out the Korean revolution.  It was because of this spirit that the Korean people neither shrank nor retreated in face of ordeals during the \"arduous march\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This invincible revolutionary spirit has given great encouragement to the workers' party of Korea in pulling through grim ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK saw in the struggle of the workers in Jagang Province the inflexible heroic spirit of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd their struggle further deepened the faith that our revolutionary line is entirely just. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The history in which the Kanggye spirit was created is a history of the noble perfect unity in which the great Kim Jong Il and the Korean people have pulled through the ordeals with one mind and purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kanggye spirit is a full embodiment of the spirit of independence of Kim Jong Il, a crystal of his conviction of certain victory and revolutionary optimism and an invincible revolutionary spirit born of his army-first politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is nothing impossible when one works in this spirit, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To live and struggle in this spirit is essential for consolidating the politico-ideological position of Korean-style socialism as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If we are to firmly defend the ideological position of socialism, we should never abandon this wonderful revolutionary spirit no matter which way the wind may blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Stressing the need to fully display the Kanggye spirit, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A full display of this spirit is a decisive guarantee for emerging ever-victorious in the acute confrontation with imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work to display the Kanggye spirit should be steadily deepened in all fields of the revolution and construction and in all aspects of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Calling for glorifying the Kanggye spirit as the eternal fighting spirit of Kim Il Sung's nation, the article stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A final victory is in store for the Korean people who are living and fighting in this spirit. \r\n\r\n"

There are some points in his remarks which must not be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, Japan is now involved in the inter-governmental full-dress talks with the DPRK which are aimed at establishing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this background that Ishihara did not bother to make very provocative remarks, contemptuously calling the DPRK \"Hokusen\" in Japanese and challenged domestic and foreign denunciation of them with impudent excuses and a torrent of jargons, instead of making an apology for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This can never be tolerated as it is a revelation of Japan's attempt not to admit its past crimes but justify them and an expression of malignant hostility towards the DPRK and its people. What matters is that such a fanatic ultra-nationalist as Ishihara is allowed to hold an official post after emerging on the political arena of Japan and unhesitatingly reel off an endless string of criminal remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is noteworthy that in this regard the chief executive of Japan on April 17 clarified his stand saying that \"he was not in a position to comment on the remarks made by a local government boss.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is under such patronage of the Japanese government authorities that Ishihara continues bandying about such provocative words. That is why this is not Japan's internal issue of little importance but is creating a big furore as a serious political and diplomatic issue directly related to the political future of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan once again turns to militarism and fascism,  it will bring a final destruction to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ishihara is well advised to stop deceiving electors of Japan any more and apologize for his reckless remarks. \r\n\r\n"
