Ro Su Hui visited Pyongyang to express condolences over the great loss to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean group even detained the secretary general of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and sentenced him to three years in prison and three years of suspension of qualification, charging that he helped Ro Su Hui make an \"illegal entry to the country\". He was on a sickbed after being diagnosed as cancer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs well known, Ro Su Hui visited Pyongyang carrying the unanimous respects of south Koreans for leader Kim Jong Il despite cordon and expressed deep condolences at the memorial service marking the 100 days since the demise of the leader. He is a pro-reunification patriot who shared the grief with the compatriots in the north and refreshed his pledge to work for national reconciliation, unity and national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRo Su Hui's Pyongyang visit was an admirable act to express condolences that was prompted by his conscience, faith and moral obligation as a member of the nation over the unexpected loss of the father of the nation who provided the fellow countrymen with the historic north-south joint declarations and opened the bright prospect for national reunification in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors committed harsh violence against Ro and carried him away in a headlock when he crossed the central demarcation line of Panmunjom to return to south Korea amid the concern of the Koreans and the world. The group inflicted all mental and physical pain on him for over 7 months of detention and finally imposed severe punishment on him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe North Headquarters of Pomminryon strongly denounces the suppression of the vice-chairman and the secretary general of Pomminryon South Headquarters as an intolerable mockery to the national unity and the desire for reunification and a challenge to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring five years in office, the Lee group desperately stood in the way of the advance of the June 15 era of independent reunification and plunged the north-south relations full of excitement and jubilation for reconciliation and cooperation into a complete deadlock through the moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and war. Not content with this, the group found fault with the DPRK's legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes and has worked desperately to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSouth Koreans from all walks of life are shuddering at the Lee group's thrice-cursed crimes and are waging stronger actions against its moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe heavy penalties imposed on members of the reunification movement organization including Ro who have staged righteous activities for the national reconciliation, unity and reunification are aimed to create a terror-ridden atmosphere of suppression under the pretext of public security, dampen the mounting spirit for reunification through alliance with the north and escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll Koreans will never pardon the Lee group's unethical crimes against reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe matchless confrontation maniacs can never evade the stern punishment of history and the nation even after they leave office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet authorities have to repeal the ill-famed \"Security Law\" and set free at once Ro Su Hui and other pro-reunification patriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe appeal to organizations and people of various circles of south Korea to turn out in a nationwide action to wipe out the Lee group keen on enforcing a fascist rule and escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, and achieve independence, democracy and reunification."
