It is also a great banner that powerfully encourages the entire nation to realise the cause of reunification, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The five-point policy of the great unity of the entire nation set forth in the work is fair policy acceptable to anyone who loves the country and the nation, he said adding:   The South Korean authorities should replace the policy of confrontation with the DPRK with  a policy of reconciliation with the north and set on the road of reconciliation and unity within the nation from a patriotic-minded stand. \r\n\r\n"

That is why peace-loving countries and people call for stopping air raids at an early date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    A brutal air raid on the Chinese embassy in Yugoslavia by NATO is unprecedented in history.\r\n    Although the U.S.-led NATO continues to intensify air raids, it will not break the will of the Yugoslav people to defend the territorial integrity and sovereignty of the country. \r\n   Answers were given to questions at the press conference.\r\n\r\n"

The Soviet Union, that boasted of a vast territory and powerful military strength, has broken down abruptly as it had not a great man. But, Korea,  not a big country led by the great commander is glorifying itself as a dignified socialist country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Above anything else, he has consistently paid deep attention to the policy of giving priority to the army and trained the army to be an invincible revolutionary one, thus firmly defending the destiny of the country and the nation with military power.   While looking down upon the bluff of the imperialists, he overpowered the enemy with a bomb-like declaration, demonstrating the might of Korea and the greatness of socialism to the world . Indeed, he is a courageous and unrivalled commander.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He, endowed with a gifted leadership of braving any sorts of campaigns and difficulties with continued offensives, has set the co-ordinates of offensive Korea should make this year.   The successful launch of Kwangmyongsong 1, the first satellite of Korea that startled the world, was a grandiose prelude to the advance towards the building of a powerful nation.   Korea is precisely socialism and vice versa, and powerful Korea is powerful socialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs led by Kim Jong Il, who has been building the fortress of socialism into an invincible one of single-hearted unity with magnanimity and obligation befitting commander and love and trust befitting commander, powerful socialism will shine in the prime of youth. \r\n  \r\n"
