            "content": "U.S., Vassal Forces Are Responsible for Escalating Tensions on Korean Peninsula: Institute of Int'l Studies of Korea\r\n Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- Jong Myong Chol, doctor of the Institute of International Studies of Korea, released an article titled \"Blurred eyes of discerning truth will lead to injustice lording it over\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The author in the article dealt with the heated-up controversy in some parts of the world over the responsibility for the situation on the Korean peninsula turning worse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its vassal forces stress that Korea is liable for the situation on the Korean peninsula inching close to a war phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some big powers around Korea are asserting that both the DPRK and the U.S. are to blame for the current aggravated situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the DPRK is strong and firm in its stand that the responsibility for the current tense situation entirely rests with the U.S. and its vassal forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then there arises the need to look with coolness into who is right and who is not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To judge whether these statements are correct; \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, it is necessary to study the historical origin which led the Korean peninsula to the present tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggravation of the tension on the Korean peninsula, the world's biggest hotspot, started along with the demise of the Second World War at the time of which the U.S. and a few other big powers divided this country into two.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was neither a war criminal state nor a war defeated state like Germany and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. built an artificial wall called the military demarcation line along the 38th parallel at its will in violation of the Korean people's desire for new society and new life, and occupied half of the land in an illegal way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It fabricated the puppet regime with its hand-raised stooges and egged them on to military provocation against their fellow countrymen. It even ignited the war of aggression against the north and openly disclosed its intention to use A-bomb against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the postwar period, far from drawing a lesson from its big defeat in the war of aggression, the U.S. introduced tens of thousands of aggression troops and thousands of nuclear weapons into south Korea and has since watched for an every opportunity to invade the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the U.S. has been branded as a chief criminal that pushed the DPRK into having an access to nukes and a bellicose state which has constantly kept the situation on the Korean peninsula at a tense phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, it is imperative to have an insightful look into the present situation on the Korean peninsula with an objective and unbiased eye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail targeting Pyongyang have lasted for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under such situation the Korean people could not but opt for building a nuclear force to defend themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was ultimately the U.S. which forced the DPRK to take a resolute step of examining the proposal for enveloping strike on Guam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite the touch-and-go situation on the peninsula, the U.S. began Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises against the DPRK again together with the puppet military warmongers on Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the DPRK staged huge military exercises regardless of time just at the doorstep of the U.S. with the mobilization of nuclear strategic means, would the U.S. remain with its arms folded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, it is necessary to have a close look at the biased conduct observed on the international arena over the issue of the Korean peninsula on which the world attention is focused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seen on the international arena including UN are such happenings in which the U.S. assertions that the DPRK makes new \"provocation\" through nuclear test and missile launch and threatens the regional security are just parroted as they are and public opinion is built over it and sanctions resolutions are hastily adopted pursuant to the assertion all the while the truth about the afore-mentioned historical origin which led to the tension on the peninsula and the truth about the present situation remain unseen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even some big neighboring countries which used to maintain principle at the UN arena with their own view in the past now lie down flat before the U.S., frightened by its high-handed practices and bluffing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History still remembers fresh what strenuous efforts they made to develop nuclear weapons and what a high price these countries paid, finding themselves unable to stand the U.S. high-handed practices, pressure and contempt any more.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, there were mentioned such words that the cherished desire of \"A-bomb, H-bomb and artificial satellite\" has to be realized even though one's trousers are held mortgage and even just a half out of the country's population numbering hundreds of millions survive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK extended full support and encouragement to the country when it was covering the arduous path beyond all descriptions under such a pressure of the West including the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those big neighboring countries are now doggedly standing in the way of the DPRK in bolstering its nuclear force for self-defence to cope with the U.S. nuclear blackmail and threat. This reminds one of a saying which goes \"Vows made in storms are forgotten in calms\". They are even unhesitatingly joining in the U.S. sanctions and pressure. Wherever can their face, conscience and good faith be found?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unreasonable conducts of big neighboring countries actively pursuing the U.S., while yielding to the UN and U.S. high-handed practices by which they do not hesitate to cook up a criminal document of branding injustice as justice without objectivity and impartiality are quite enough to explain the situation on the Korean peninsula getting tenser and tenser.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever with clear sight capable of discerning the truth can easily judge who is responsible for the tense situation on the peninsula and will be able to discern correctness from falsity out of many assertions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deplorable plight by which it is finding itself plunging into the pitfall it dug itself while getting recklessly keen on the moves for stifling the DPRK speaks volumes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. fail to draw a lesson from it and persist in reckless gambling, it will find itself getting deeper into the abyss of tragic end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those forces currying favor with the U.S. should not regard it as just the fate of the other.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its vassal forces had better face up to the trend of the times and behave with discretion."

de los Asuntos Internacionales de la RPDC publico el dia 24 un articulo titulado \"Si se hace turbia la vision sobre la verdad, prevalecera la injusticia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t En unas partes del mundo se entablan ahora acalorados debates sobre la responsabilidad de la situacion actual de la Peninsula Coreana que va de mal en peor, comienza el autor y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por supuesto, EE.UU. y sus seguidores imputan a la RPDC la responsabilidad de la situacion de esa zona que llega al borde de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Algunas potencias vecinas opinan que tienen la culpa tanto la RPDC como EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la RPDC insiste fuertemente en que la responsabilidad de la delicada situacion actual recae totalmente sobre EE.UU. y sus satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hace falta examinar con serenidad cual criterio es correcto y cual es el injusto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para ello, hay que tomar en cuenta los siguientes puntos:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Primero, es necesario averiguar la causa historica de la tension en la Peninsula Coreana que se hizo tan grave como ahora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El agravamiento de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, zona mas candente del mundo, comenzo desde que EE.UU. y otras potencias dividieron a Corea en dos partes cuando se puso fin a la Segunda Guerra Mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Corea no es un pais criminal ni derrotado en la guerra como Alemania o Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, EE.UU. ocupo ilegalmente la mitad del territorio coreano al inventar la barrera artificial, demarcacion militar fijada a sus caprichos en el paralelo 38, en contra de la aspiracion del pueblo coreano a la nueva sociedad y la nueva vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Luego, fabrico el poder titere formado por sus lacayos surcoreanos y les instigo a las provocaciones militares contra la parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al fin y al cabo, desato la guerra de agresion al Norte (de Corea) junto con los titeres surcoreanos y expuso sin escrupulos su siniestra intencion de usar la bomba atomica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En lugar de sacar las lecciones de su gran derrota en la pasada guerra coreana, introdujo en el tiempo posbelico en suelo surcoreano decenas de miles de efectivos agresores y miles de artefactos nucleares que acechan la oportunidad de agredir de nuevo al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi EE.UU. se gano el estigma de autor que empujo a la RPDC a poseer el arma nuclear y de Estado belicista que llevo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a la coyuntura de tension permanente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, hay que observar atentamente desde la posicion objetiva e imparcial las circunstancias que acontecen ahora en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan venido perdurando durante varias decadas la amenaza y chantaje nucleares de EE.UU. contra Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo tal circunstancia, el pueblo coreano se vio obligado a optar el camino de construccion de fuerzas armadas nucleares para la autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, es EE.UU. el que obligo a la RPDC a tomar medidas intransigentes, inclusive examinar el proyecto del fuego de asedio sobre la isla Guam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana que se dirige a la fase de explosion, el imperio americano realiza desde el dia 21 junto con los belicistas militares surcoreanos el entrenamiento militar \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Estaria acaso EE.UU. con brazos cruzados si la RPDC frecuentara en sus narices tales ejercicios militares de gran dimension movilizando los medios estrategicos nucleares?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, vale la pena observar con ojos bien abiertos los actos injustos que se cometen en la arena internacional en cuanto al problema de la Peninsula Coreana, tema que enfoca la atencion mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando EE.UU. dice que la RPDC vulnera la seguridad regional con sus nuevas \"provocaciones\" tales como la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de misil, la ONU y otros escenarios internacionales repiten literalmente ese criterio y se apresuran a aprobar las resoluciones de sancion, sin hacer referencia alguna a la arriba mencionada causa historica de la tension en la Peninsula Coreana y a las circunstancias actuales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, hasta algunos paises vecinos, que en el pasado exponian dignamente sus posiciones en la ONU manteniendo criterios propios, se arrodillaron ante EE.UU. acobardados ante su despotismo y fanfarroneria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe queda fresco todavia el hecho historico que relata como esos paises iniciaron el desarrollo de arma nuclear sin poder aguantar mas el despotismo, la presion y el maltrato de EE.UU., que les amenazaba con el mismo artefacto, y cuan caro lo han pagado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn pais vecino habia dicho que se debe realizar el gran deseo de tener la \"bomba atomica, la de hidrogeno y el satelite artificial\" aunque tenga que empenar los pantalones y sobreviva la mitad de cientos de millones de su poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando ese pais transitaba ese camino de martirios bajo la tremenda presion del Occidente, incluso EE.UU., la RPDC le ha enviado el apoyo y respaldo enteros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOlvidadizas de ello, las potencias vecinas obstaculizan paso a paso el incremento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de caracter autodefensivo de la RPDC frente al chantaje y amenaza nucleares provenientes de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, se suman sin vacilacion alguna a la sancion y presion de EE.UU. contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la conducta que carece totalmente del decoro, la conciencia y la obligacion moral.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstaria de mas explicar largo que la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se torna mas delicada debido a la conducta injusta de los gigantes vecinos que se rinden y hasta se suman al despotismo de EE.UU. y la ONU que no vacila en fabricar el documento criminal anticoreano faltando a la objetividad y la imparcialidad e invirtiendo lo injusto en lo justo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCualquier hombre, que tenga la vision clara sobre la verdad, podra juzgar donde hay la responsabilidad de empeoramiento de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y cual es el correcto entre diferentes criterios al respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsinua muchas cosas la miserable situacion de EE.UU. que se cayo en la trampa propia al cabo de su inutil campana de aplastamiento anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. continua con el juego al azar sin sacar la leccion de ello, no se le dara otro resultado que caerse mas hondo en el abismo de arruinamiento tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas seguidoras a EE.UU. no deben pensar que eso es el destino ajeno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria bueno para EE.UU. y sus satelites actuar con prudencia justipreciando la corriente de la epoca actual."
