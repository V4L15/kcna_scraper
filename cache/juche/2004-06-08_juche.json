            "content": "U.S. Sub-critical Nuclear Test Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary hits at the criminal sub-critical nuclear test carried out by the United States at the Nevada underground nuclear test site on May 25.\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. made another sub-critical nuclear test, turning a deaf ear to the world-wide denunciation and protest. This is an act of throwing a wet blanket over the desire and efforts of humankind to curb the nuclear arms race and live in a peaceful world and an open challenge to the world peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are bent on nuclear tests while threatening the non-nuclear states under the pretext of \"prevention of terrorism\" and \"deterrence to war\". This is a shameless and high-handed practice to make nuclear attacks on countries out of their favor by developing new nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compels not only non-nuclear states but also nuclear states with relatively small quantities of nuclear weapons to seek measures to counter the nuclear threats and nuclear war moves of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A self-defensive measure stands out with great urgency in case of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the six-way talks, the United States took issue with what it called the DPRK's \"enriched uranium program\" while seeking to make the world admit it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen it failed, with no one heeding it, the U.S. came out with the fiction of \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride\" to label the DPRK \"proliferator of nuclear materials\". And it must not go unnoticed that the U.S. is framing up a new plot to force the DPRK to admit a \"enriched uranium program\" by manipulating the International Atomic Energy Agency, its tool. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current situation urges the DPRK to further increase its nuclear deterrent. The DPRK has the right to increase its nuclear deterrent in face of the U.S. imperialists' strategy of mounting a nuclear preemptive attack and stifling it. This is quite natural under the current situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. had better abandon its nuclear plot against the DPRK, judging the realities with a cool head.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's Legislation on Sanctions against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- The \"bill banning the entry of specified foreign ships into port\" was railroaded by the Liberal Democratic Party, the New Komeito Party and the Japanese Democratic Party through Japan's House of Representatives on June 3, according to a news report.\r\n It is well known that the bill is actually aimed at an economic pressure on the DPRK as it will serve as a law totally banning the entry of the ship \"Mangyongbong 92\" and other DPRK ships into Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservative forces have thus adopted the economic sanctions against the DPRK as a state policy. This is a challenge to the DPRK and a serious infringement upon its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that such bill was passed through the House of Representatives at a time when there has been an atmosphere of positive change in the relations between the two countries since the DPRK-Japan summit meeting on May 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move of the Japanese right-wing conservatives, therefore, can not be interpreted otherwise than a deliberate sinister attempt to spoil the hard-won positive atmosphere, displeased with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the top leaders of the DPRK and Japan at their meeting and talks exchanged wide-range views on overall issues arising in the relations between the two countries including the issues of implementing the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and restoring the bilateral confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The thorough implementation of the declaration is a prerequisite to improving the relations between the two countries and solving the pending issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has done everything it can for its implementation and it is an unshakable stand of the DPRK to remain true to it to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities also expressed the will to implement the declaration. Prime Minister Koizumi, in particular, sent a congratulatory message to the 20th Congress of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan in which he manifested his willingness to exert utmost efforts to normalize the ties between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a positive development in the direction of improving the bilateral relations in the idea of the Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the Japanese right-wing conservatives passed the above-said bill through the Diet swimming against such trend. This action is, therefore, unjustifiable and cannot but be censured by the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that Chief Cabinet Secretary Hosota at a press conference on June 1 said that the policy of the Japanese government is not to invoke the law banning the entry of specified foreign ships into Japan even after its adoption so long as north Korea implements the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remark can be interpreted as a reflection of the Japanese people's desire to support the outcome of their prime minister's Pyongyang visit and see the restoration of the bilateral confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as daylight that the Japanese right-wing conservative forces took this action, prompted by their inveterate bitterness towards the DPRK quite contrary to the desire of the two peoples. Through this they sought a sinister aim to hamstring the efforts to implement the Declaration at all costs and drop a check-bar on the process of improving the relations between the two countries, displeased with the outcome of the DPRK-Japan summit talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those forces are working hard to economically isolate and stifle the DPRK, taking advantage of the moves of the United States to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK through the UN in a bid to stifle it while spreading the fiction of \"its smuggling of uranium hexafluoride\" with the 3rd round of the Six-Party Talks near at hand. This is, however, a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservatives are well advised to face up to the trend of the times and behave themselves, mindful that a wicked man is his own hell.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
