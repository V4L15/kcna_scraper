In short, the U.S. is a conspirator and helper of Israel in its nuclear weaponization. The U.S. pretends not to know the fact that Israel has hundreds of nukes in place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. also shuts its eyes to Japan's wild ambition to go nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn international committee, describing Japan as \"the only non-nuclear weapons state producing plutonium,\" disclosed that there is a factory capable of producing plutonium enough to produce 1,000 nuclear weapons every year by reprocessing spent nuclear fuel in Rokkasho in Aomori Prefecture, Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the U.S. pretends to be ignorant of this fact for the mere reason that it is its junior ally. This clearly suggests that the U.S. loud-mouthed \"world free from nuclear weapons\" is nothing but sheer hypocrisy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. is keen to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and stifle it through the application of the above-said double standards the DPRK is left with no option but to bolster up its nuclear deterrent and take strong counter-measures."

This situation can be settled only through dialogue and negotiation based on the fair stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle to put an end to the history of colonial domination and national division alone can guarantee the life and rights of the Koreans in Japan, he stressed, calling on the Koreans to actively turn out in the work to carve out the future of a reunified country."

Despues, en Francia volvio a decir que presentara la meta para la \"construccion de un mundo exento de las armas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, en una entrevista con el ex premier japones Abe hablo de que aunque se realizara el \"desarme nuclear\", EE.UU. no pondra el obstaculo en el ofrecimiento de paraguas nuclear a los paises aliados\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El imperio dice las palabras contradictorias en el problema nuclear y aplica la norma de accion doble, senala asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual divulgado este martes y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. cuestiona hasta las actividades nucleares legales y pacificas de Corea, Iran y otros  paises que no le agradan, les tilda arbitrariamente de \"delincuentes nucleares\", pero, hace vistas gordas y no dice ni un pio sobre el problema nuclear de los paises y las fuerzas que le obedecen docilmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para ayudar a su aliado Israel en el desarrollo nuclear, EE.UU. envio a este pais a los especialistas en esta rama, le entrego el uranio altamente enriquecido y le vendio numerosas instalaciones para el desarrollo de armas nucleares, lo cual es secreto publicado. En una palabra, el imperio es el complice y cooperante en el armamento nuclear de Israel. Aunque EE.UU. sabe bien que Israel tiene centenares de armas nucleares, esta en muda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por otra parte, el pais norteamericano hace una vista gorga sobre la ambicion nuclear del Japon. Un Comite Internacional insistio en que Japon es el \"unico pais desprovisto de armas nucleares que produce el plutonio\" y revelo que en la Rokkasho del departamento de Aomori, Japon se encuentra una fabrica capaz de producir el plutonio necesario a retratar los combustibles nucleares ya usados y fabricar anualmente mil armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, EE.UU. actua como ciego ante la conducta del Japon que es su aliado inferior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo dicho demuestra bien que la fanfarronada de EE.UU. de construir un \"mundo sin armas nucleares\" no pasa de ser una enganosa llena de hipocresia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Puesto que EE.UU. recurre freneticamente al ataque nuclear anticipado contra la RPDC y las maniobras de aplastarla aplicandole la muy injusta norma de doble rasero, la RPDC fortalecera la fuerza disuasiva nuclear para hacer rotundamente frente al respecto."
