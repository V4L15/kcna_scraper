Korean Pro-U.S. Elements under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- Pro-U.S. ultra-right conservatives of south Korea are now contemplating the erection of a statue of Walker in Taegu allegedly in recognition of his \"exploits\". He was a cruel murderer and special war criminal because he perpetrated monstrous massacres and destruction unprecedented in the world history of wars by ordering to kill all, be they children and the old, as a brasshat of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces during the Korean War.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party of south Korea and other pro-U.S. conservatives are contemplating even the erection of a statue of a foreign aggressor who massacred Koreans in cold blood, a servile attempt to please their American master. This move is the biggest treachery ever known. \r\n Praising a war criminal means defending his war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The action taken by the pro-U.S. conservatives to erect his statue is nothing but a move to call back the departed soul of the brasshat of the U.S. aggression troops in a bid to encourage them in their moves to ignite the second Korean war of aggression and turn this land again into a shambles of war launched by Yankees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The frantic campaign kicked off by the GNP clan for confrontation between the north and the south over what they call \"human rights issue,\" keeping pace with the U.S. anti-DPRK campaign, clearly suggests what these wicked traitors are after. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No traitorous moves desperately escalated by the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP backed by foreign forces can ever stem the violent trend of the June 15 era of reunification towards national reconciliation, unity and reunification, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it is a daydream coming from ignorance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more frantically the U.S. resorts to the shameless \"human rights\" racket, the more the system of the DPRK will be consolidated along the unique line of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the consequences of its reckless \"human rights\" offensive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly proves that the command is no more than a mechanism serving the U.S. \r\n A statement of the league read out at the press conference strongly demanded the immediate disbandment of the command, terming the above-said action a move against the Koreans' movement for reunification to block the advance of the youth and students in the south and the north toward peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The league together with the youth and students headquarters under the joint national committee for implementing the June 15 joint declaration will directly convey a letter of protest to the U.S. 8th Army Command and conduct counter-actions, the statement declared.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
