But the release was nothing but a cleaning work done by it to start confrontation with the U.S. over human rights, not to want dialogue with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the DPRK has more things to talk over human rights than the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. that is finding itself in a tight corner due to the disclosure of brutal tortures practiced by the CIA and the scandals of racial discrimination perpetrated by white policemen. It is again the U.S. and its lackeys who suffered shame while floating wild rumors about youngsters of the DPRK who returned home after being abducted by flesh traffickers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time U.S. Secretary of State Kerry made such disgusting gesture as openly praising a swindler, defector from the north, whom he has used for the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket. This clearly proved that he is going reckless, keen on moves hostile to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Former U.S. Secretary of State Powell was taken in by lies told by the CIA engrossed in gathering intelligence and inventing pretexts through tortures. But today Kerry is behaving like a fool, believing in the lies told by a \"defector from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already sent a video clip disclosing the true colors of the above-said swindler to Kerry through a relevant channel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington's policy aimed to topple the social system of the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" is no more than a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will have to experience the toughest counteraction of the DPRK against its hostile policy towards the DPRK and be held wholly accountable for the derailing of the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula."
