This clearly shows again that the U.S. colonial rule and pro-American flunkeyist act of the conservative forces can no longer work in south Korea and no force on earth can block the will and desire of the people for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean ultra-right wing conservative forces brought about a political coup called \"impeachment against the president\" in south Korea on March 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The flame of the vigorous struggle against the impeachment spread all over south Korea and brought about such an unprecedented miracle as the victory of the pro-reform progressive forces and the defeat of the conservative forces in the \"general election\" of the 17th \"National Assembly\", foiling the farce of the \"impeachment\" fabricated by the U.S. and its followers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plot to set up a pro-American conservative \"government\" in south Korea went bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality shows that the time when the U.S. and pro-American conservative forces hold sway is coming to an end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the oldest in south Korea is the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military occupation and colonial rule over south Korea are the fetter impeding the social progress of south Korea, the root cause of all sorts of the south Korean people's misfortune and sufferings and the main obstacle blocking national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should squarely see the trend of public sentiment in south Korea, behave with discretion, put an end to its domination and interference in south Korea and withdraw its aggression troops from it at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is known as a \"massacre of civilians in Rogun-ri\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The incident, however, had been grossly misrepresented till the disclosure of its truth. But it was brought to daylight by testimonies made by those who narrowly escape from the massacre and former GIs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intention to build the \"monument\" was not prompted by the desire to honour the memory of the dead but by its sinister political aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is designed to put down the mounting actions of south Koreans in demand of the probe into the truth behind the massacre and the U.S. apology and compensation to its victims and calm down the daily growing anti-U.S. sentiment in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But no one would be deceived by its trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a true intention to honestly repent of monstrous massacre of civilians committed by GIs during the Korean war including the massacre in Rogun-ri, it should admit all its mass killings and other crimes, make a sincere apology and compensation to the Korean nation for them and immediately withdraw its forces, the root cause of all crimes, from south Korea as demanded by the south Korean people before talking about the plan to erect the \"memorial monument.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Working Group Meeting of Six-party Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Saturday as regards the close of the working group meeting of the six-party talks:\r\n The working group meeting of the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. took place in Beijing from May 12 to 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting the DPRK side clarified its will to maintain the general goal of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and to freeze its nuclear facilities as the first-phase action and displayed utmost flexibility from a sincere stand to settle the issue at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal of \"reward for freeze\" commanded support and sympathy from the majority of the participants in the meeting for its justice and fairness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. again pressurized the DPRK, not a defeated country, to accept the CVID. It put a brake on the discussion of the issue, repeating its old assertion that it can never make any discussion unless the DPRK does so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. side made an absurd assertion about the \"enriched uranium program\", its own fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the U.S. does not wish to see any progress in the solution of the nuclear issue at the six-party talks before the presidential election slated for late this year in a bid to win it without difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is well aware of the despicable true nature of the Bush group as it disclosed its disposition as an expert in fabricating false information in an effort to justify its war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK resolutely dismissed the U.S. assertions, holding that the information presented by the U.S. at the meeting was nothing but a prelude to inventing a pretext for mounting a military attack on the DPRK when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one supported the U.S. unreasonable stand at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is now getting more skeptical as to whether there would be any need to continue the six-party talks which are no more than armchair talks, asserting that the talks failed to make any progress as the U.S. made no sincere efforts for the settlement of the issue, insisting on its own assertions that the DPRK must scrap its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side intends to conduct dialogue with sustained patience in the future too, proceeding from its consistent stand to denuclearize the Korean peninsula peacefully through the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persistently seeks to waste time, pressurizing the DPRK to change its political system and disarm itself under the signboard of \"peaceful talks\", the DPRK will be left with no option but to use it as a means for building stronger nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, such meaningless delaying tactics employed by the U.S. will do the DPRK nothing bad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
