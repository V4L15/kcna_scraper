It is, indeed, a group of rogues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to defend itself from the group of gangsters keen on inflicting even nuclear holocaust at the end of putting unprecedented political and economic pressure and military threats, the DPRK has bolstered the nuclear force both in quality and quantity after setting it as a national line to go nuclear and has now soared as a nuclear power possessed of powerful nuclear attack capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A stick has to be used against the horde of wolves like the U.S. which comes in fierce attack to eliminate the DPRK while categorically denying the sovereignty of the DPRK and its right to existence. Only then the U.S. will come to its senses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will sooner or later face a shuddering reality in which their bayonet that targeted the life of the people of the DPRK will boomerang on it."

The U.S. and south Korean authorities say that the purpose of sanctions is to make the DPRK \"give up going nuclear\" but its nuclear force is becoming stronger.  The reason that the DPRK is steadily bolstering up national defence is understandable by everyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sinister intention of sanctions of the U.S. and south Korean authorities is to stifle the DPRK. However, it is out of question that sanctions would not work on the DPRK whose people have achieved single-minded unity with the leader. World people know well who shut down the Kaesong Industrial Zone and who opposed dialogue. Contrary to the behavior of the south Korean authorities, there are many people in south Korea who sincerely hope for inter-Korean dialogue and improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everything will go well in the DPRK where the leader and people are united in single mind, in the future, too, and the unyielding Korean people will achieve only victories despite any sanctions and pressure."
