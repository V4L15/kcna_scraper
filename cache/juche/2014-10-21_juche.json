Recently there took place a provocative anti-DPRK leaflet-scattering operation in south Korea chilling the atmosphere for mending the north-south relations, arousing grave concern of the public at home and abroad. Such operation conducted by human scum is a very dangerous one spoiling the hard-won atmosphere for mending the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to radically improve the north-south relations it is necessary to boldly drop the old conception of groundlessly doubting and antagonizing the fellow countrymen in the north and sincerely desire reconciliation and unity in the spirit of By Our Nation Itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an important requirement for taking the stand of By Our Nation Itself to reject flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Koreans should hold aloft the banner of By Our Nation Itself to put an end to the U.S. interference in the matters of the Korean nation and achieve the independent reunification of the country. The reality today, in particular, when  outside forces are becoming evermore undisguised in their moves for domination and interference in the matters related to the inter-Korean relations, calls for more firmly adhering to the independent stand in settling the issues of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Inexhaustible is the united strength of the nation. No formidable outside forces can ever overpower it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Koreans are firmly confident of their own strength, they will have guts to solve all the problems according to their own viewpoint and confidence and stand up against any interference and pressure from outside forces."

This is entirely because the U.S. has persisted in its deep-rooted hostile policy toward the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. approached the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework with a black-hearted intention from the outset and has blocked the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula peacefully, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is staging madcap nuclear war maneuvers against the DPRK in south Korea and its vicinity every year with lots of nuclear weapons involved. This is an open nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has made every possible sincere effort to defuse the ever-growing nuclear threat of the U.S. The DPRK put forth a proposal for building a nuclear-free zone through peaceful dialogue and negotiations and combined it with the method of removing the U.S. nuclear threat by relying on international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, made the situation complicated, persistently circulating a suspicion about nuclear development in the DPRK. It imposed \"special inspection\" on the DPRK and openly posed nuclear threat to it while resuming nuclear war drills. The U.S. used the NPT as a lever for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation will remain unchanged as long as the U.S. persists in its hostile acts against the DPRK, not abandoning its ambition to stifle the social system in the DPRK. This is the lesson and conclusion drawn by the DPRK once again, looking back on the past history at present, 20 years since the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Instead of taking issue with the DPRK over its nuclear deterrence, the U. S. should reflect on its acts of creating the present situation and take a proper attitude, though belatedly. This is the only way of making a breakthrough towards settling the nuclear issue on the peninsula."

What she uttered is nothing but an expression of undisguised repugnancy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, the DPRK can never abandon its nuclear deterrence unless the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its nuclear threat against all Koreans are completely stopped. The DPRK's nukes can never be bartered for anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK never forgets that the south Korean authorities hurled riff-raffs into staging a leaflet-scattering operation against it in the wake of the north-south high-level talks in a bid to chill the atmosphere of the improvement of the north-south relations. It was none other than the south Korean authorities who connived at, manipulated and zealously backed the operations behind the scene, asserting \"they were conducted by a non-governmental organization of its own accord and there was no legal ground to halt them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly show who is making the prospect of dialogue gloomy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot but question whether it is possible to hold the second round of the north-south high-level contact under such deplorable situation as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To the regret of all Koreans, the present situation is quite contrary to the hard-won atmosphere for the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations are now at the crucial crossroads -- whether to repeat the evil cycle of confrontation or to rev up the atmosphere for their improvement and enter a path of fresh development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time to make a policy decision helpful to creating the atmosphere of dialogue and bringing about peaceful environment, not an anachronistic act against a dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly hope for the next round of high-level contact for the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, they should be prudent in talking and deed and move to create an atmosphere for repairing the relations, to begin with."
