            "content": "MINREX de RPDC informa a representantes diplomaticos situacion de Peninsula Coreana \r\nPyongyang, 28 de junio (ACNC) -- El Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea organizo el dia 28 un encuentro de informacion sobre la reciente situacion creada en la Peninsula Coreana para los representantes diplomaticos de los paises asiaticos acreditados en la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ocasion estuvieron presentes los embajadores de Laos, Camboya, Malasia, Indonesia, Iran y la India y los encargados de negocios a.i. de Mongolia, Vietnam y Pakistan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChoe Hui Chol, director general del departamento de Asia y Oceania del MINREX de la RPDC aviso la posicion de principios de la RPDC referente a la reciente situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl se refirio a que en estos dias, EE.UU. publico un plan de \"operacion de preciso ataque aereo\" contra los establecimientos y fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC e introdujo en la Peninsula Coreana y sus contornos el submarino nuclear Mississippi y otras propiedades estrategicas de todo tipo llevando a una circunstancia extremada la situacion de la Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa causa principal de tal tension consiste en el criterio erroneo de EE.UU. y en el caso presente, este imperio tomo la decision muy indeliberada y estrategicamente erronea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que el interes maximo del Estado se ve amenazado a causa del incesante incremento de las fuerzas armadas de EE.UU. y la situacion perdura en estado incontrolable, la RPDC aumentara constantemente la capacidad de ataque preventivo nuclear, desarrollara y emplazara continuamente variadas armas de ataque estrategico enarbolando tambien en el futuro la bandera del desarrollo paralelo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl tener muy presente de que EE.UU. es precisamente el autor que agudiza la tension de la Peninsula Coreana y empuja la RPDC al fortalecimiento incesante del disuasivo fisico, los paises asiaticos deberan ayudar el alivio de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana, dijo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente encuentro sirvio de importante oportunidad en el sentido de que los representantes diplomaticos de los paises asiaticos en la RPDC tengan la comprension mas profunda de que la belicosa y perversa amenaza y chantaje nucleares anti-RPDC de EE.UU. devienen el origen de la tension de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
