Seeing her, the world has witnessed the spirit of Korea  advancing confidently at a canter without hesitation despite difficulties and trials and has given rise to stormy applause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not the first time that Korean athletes appeared like a comet in the international arena and startled the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such striking victories which upset the expectation of veteran sports experts and left a remarkable trace in the world sports development were won by a number of female athletes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kye Sun Hui won the world title in the women's Judo event in the 26th Olympiad in July 1996 in Atlanta, the U.S., to become the main topic of conversation there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was her first participation in international competition. However, she made a sudden counterattack at the end of the game and placed first. She defeated her strong opponent who won 84 international tournaments since the 25th Olympiad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Kwang Suk, too, placed first with 10 marks, full marks, at the uneven bars event of the world gymnastics championships in September, 1991 in Indianapolis, the U.S. at that time she was 14 years old but her performance caused sensation in the gymnastic world. The unique continuous  technical movement which could be performed only by her is now called \"Kim Kwang Suk Movement\" in the gymnastic circle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pak Yong Sun retained double championships by winning the 33rd and 34th World Table Tennis Championships held in Calcutta, India,  in February 1975 and in Britain in April, 1977. She was the \"world's queen of table tennis\" and a flower of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are many other known and unknown female athletes such as Han Phil Hwa, Kim Song Sun, Sin Kum Dan, Pak Jong Ran, Yu Sun Bok and Ri Pun Hui who demonstrated the stamina of Korea in international sports events.    \r\n \r\n"
