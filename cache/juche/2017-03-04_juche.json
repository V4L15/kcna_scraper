Korean Diplomatic Chief Flailed\r\n Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- Puppet Foreign Minister of south Korea Yun Pyong Se is getting evermore crazy in his solicitation diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year he staged what he called \"shuttle diplomacy\" in a bid to generate cooperation in the campaign for stifling his fellow countrymen in the north only to be scorned by the world people. In February he again begged for \"cooperation for stifling the north over its nuclear weapons\" during his overseas trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first slogan he shouted when holding the post of diplomatic chief with the backing of traitor Park some years ago was \"Let's keep pressure on the north through international cooperation\". This reminds us of the fact that begging outsiders for help is Yun's inborn disposition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yun cannot do otherwise as such diplomacy is the only thing he learned in south Korea, a colony of the U.S., while going in cahoots with sycophants and traitors opposed to reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that the above-said solicitation diplomacy only invites derision and denunciation of the international community as it brings to light the despicable colors of confrontational maniacs and psychopaths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has become the beacon of hope and an envy of the world progressives thanks to its transparent idea of independence against imperialism and tremendous national power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No country will have right view of the stupid who sling such mud at their fellow countrymen in the north who speak for independence and justice as \"time bomb\" and \"outright challenge to international order.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and Japan and other masters are now in a position to get help from others to get rid of the striking range, in fear of the daily increasing military might of the DPRK. How detestable and troublesome it will be for them to see meager stooges who go about begging.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said from the olden times that beggary is done alone. Yun loudly begged for help only during foreign trip, in disregard of the mental sufferings of his masters. It is quite natural for him to get pressure, only getting cold shoulder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one is lending an ear to the rubbish talked by the servants who maintain their existence only in reliance on outsiders and the conservatives keen to stifle the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sweeping south Korea at present are candlelight rallies of people from all walks of life to throw overboard the group of traitors like Park Geun Hye and Yun Pyong Se.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their solicitation for cooperation in pressurizing the fellow countrymen would only invite bitterer disgrace, humiliation and miserable end."
