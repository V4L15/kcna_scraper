            "content": "Notice Sent to South Side\r\n Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea on July 11 sent a notice to the south side. It clarified the stand of the north side in connection with the fact that on July 10  the Ministry of Unification of south Korea rejected the working talks for the resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang under an unreasonable pretext, instead of responding to the north side's proposal for north-south working talks for the resumption of the tour from coming August and a north-south Red Cross working contact for discussing the issue of reunion of separated families and their relatives on the occasion of Harvest Moon Day.\n\t\t\t\t\t The notice said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities of the south side, while agreeing with the north-south Red Cross working contact, evaded an answer to the issue of working talks on the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang. They asserted the issue of the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ) is the core issue and it is desirable to focus efforts on discussing and settling it on a priority basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an attitude hard to understand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang is the desire of all compatriots in the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking the view of the south side into consideration, we are willing to put on hold the talks for the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the Red Cross working contact for the purpose of concentrating efforts on the settlement of the issue of the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From this viewpoint, we inform your side that we shelve our recent proposal for talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our view that a successful solution to the issues of the proposed talks and contact hinges on the talks on the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How to settle the issue of the KIZ will have bearing on the overall inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side would be well advised not to misjudge our magnanimity and efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Confidence is not achieved when abiding by the standard of one party. It is hypocritical to talk about confidence, selectively approaching the north-south dialogue in pursuit of political purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are well aware of the real intention of the south side but restrain ourselves with a high degree of patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side should bear in mind if it persists in its arrogant demeanor, making a mockery of goodwill of the other party as it does at present, it will invite a serious misfortune and will have to drink a bitterer cup of setback than the Lee Myung Bak regime."

Korean Intelligence Service\r\n Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Intelligence Service (IS) is being attacked on all sides after it opened to public the minutes of the north-south summit.\n\t\t\t\t\t Increasing louder is the voice calling for the disbandment of the IS for opening to public for its own dirty politically-motivated greed the minutes of the summit at which the issues of the destiny of the nation and the north-south ties were frankly discussed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean opposition parties, all spectrum of people and media are describing the act of opening to public the minutes as a \"scenario worked out by the IS and the Saenuri Party\", saying that \"5-year south-north ties have ended under the Park Geun Hye regime\" and \"south-north ties suffered serious wound, causing the attack in the field of diplomacy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. newspaper the Wall Street Journal commented that the IS pulled the trigger of political stand-off by opening to public the minutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS made an offering of the minutes, a top confidential document, for meeting its own interests, an act putting into the shade the Central Intelligence Agency which earned an ill fame during the \"yusin\" dictatorial period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS that came into existence following the Central Intelligence Agency and the Security Planning Board is a den of breeding plots and a base for escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has kicked up the whirlwind of fascist suppression and confrontation by hatching whole gamut of plots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the mounting spirit against the racket for \"sanctions\" on the DPRK and the DPRK-targeted war exercises that were staged by the U.S. and the puppet south Korean regime, the IS coteries branded those who protested against those moves as \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS is a main architect of the hideous operations that aimed at insulting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. The IS has also been deeply engaged in scattering copies of leaflets slandering the DPRK and abducting and kidnapping its citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What shocked the public is that the precious minutes have been abused by IS and other plot-breeding organizations as a tool for meeting their partisan interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Nam Jae Jun, director of the IS, he has been so intent on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen as to use the minutes as a tool for meeting the partisan interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He described Jeju islanders' uprising as typical armed uprising which the north engineered by mobilizing all factors in order to check the south from bolstering its armed forces and weaken their strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He not only distorted and insulted the uprising, a mass anti-U.S. resistance in which the south Koreans took to the streets against the U.S. imperialists' moves for the division of Korea, but also spread the rumor of the north's involvement, an act of treachery that can be committed only by political crooks hell-bent on breeding plots against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean chief executive seated Nam in the chair of the head of the IS that earned an ill fame for the anti-DPRK smear campaign. The recent disclosure of the minutes of the summit is part of the scheme for escalating the confrontation with the DPRK. Herein lies the gravity of the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to expect democracy of south Korean society nor the improvement of the north-south ties as long as IS is left intact in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The disbandment of the IS is the requirement of the times and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should apologize before the nation for the act of opening to public the minutes and immediately disband the IS, a cancer-like entity that stands in the way of improving the north-south ties."
