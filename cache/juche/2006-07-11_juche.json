On the other hand, it put the plan for a war of aggression on Korea in a concrete form and is frantically staging a test and preliminary war under the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists claim that the RIMPAC-2006 war game is for \"the security of sea routes\" and \"an action against terrorism.\" This, however, is a cunning ruse to cover up its aggressive and dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the RIMPAC, the U.S. has refined in the past the mode of combat action of multi-national forces according to the aggressive military strategy toward Korea. This is evidenced by the fact that south Korea, Japan and other participants in the war gamble look forward to their involvement in NATO's \"world partnership program.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move of the U.S. imperialists did not proceed merely from a scheme to expand NATO. Underlying it is their dangerous intention to drag the NATO forces into a Korean war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the world is worried, a new war on the Korean Peninsula may entail catastrophic consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

By underscoring the need to solve the reunification issue by the concerted efforts of the Koreans responsible for it, the declaration defined national independence as invariable guidelines to be maintained in the reunification movement common to the nation.
