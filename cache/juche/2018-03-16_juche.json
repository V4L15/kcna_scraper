Korean Conservatives\r\nPyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The \"Liberal Korea Party\" and other conservative group of south Korea have been greatly embarrassed to go desperate in their moves to chill the atmosphere of the Korean peninsula in which the tension has made a U-turn toward detente following the proactive measure the DPRK took on its own initiative.\n\t\t\t\t\t Representative of the LKP Hong Jun Phyo is deriding the present phase for dialogue, saying that \"one should not be taken in by the camouflaged peace offensive\" and insulting it as \"south-north peace farce mentioning only nuclear suspension, not nuclear dismantlement\". The floor leader and the spokesman for the same party also appeared at public presentations where they spouted such rubbish that \"the north's intention and sincerity are doubtful\" and \"the principle of sanctions on the north should never be undermined\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the desperate efforts of the worst traitors who are destined to meet a miserable end, after being marginalized from the trend of the history toward national reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The principled stand and the sincere efforts made by the DPRK to write a new history of national reunification to be proud of to the world by the concerted efforts of the nation and to defend peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and the world have been warmly supported and welcomed by all the Koreans and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But only the LKP and other conservative forces of south Korea are working desperately to reverse the favorable climate for reconciliation, unity and peace into the unfavorable one of confrontation, and are spewing out rhetoric, challenging the desire of the nation and the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from apologizing for the hideous crimes of undermining the June 15 era of reunification which was making favorable progress and of pushing the situation to the touch-and-go one, those forces have gone vicious in their moves to check the trend for the improvement of the north-south ties. This disgusting behavior has been spitted at by all Koreans and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the south Korean conservative forces that did not hesitate to commit the traitorous crimes against reunification, describing the valuable June 15 era of reunification as \"lost decade\" and totally denying the north-south joint declarations. It was again the south Korean conservatives who scuttled the north-south authorities talks that were arranged with so much effort by the active step taken by the DPRK in June 2013 by claiming the absurd issue of \"level and ranking\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north-south relations make improvement, it is clear that their crimes of having escalated confrontation, being dead-set to the nation's reconciliation, unity and national reunification in the past, and of having created the danger of a war on the Korean peninsula will be highlighted and they will face stronger denunciation and rejection by the public mindset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is out of this calculation that they are working with bloodshot eyes to nip in the bud the sprouts for national reconciliation and unity with all possible means and methods in order to keep the north-south relations in the stalled state forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces who stoop to any infamy to meet their dirty political ambition are senseless traitors and a group of rabid dogs that have no blood and soul of being part of the Korean nation as they are only keen on escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans and all other Korean people are required to wage more courageous actions to throw overboard the group of conservative traitors, a cancer-like entity in the way for peace and reunification."

Y con su insistencia absurda en el \"nivel\" y \"rango\", llevaron al fracaso las conversaciones de autoridades N-S, preparadas en junio de 2013 gracias a la iniciativa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos saben muy bien que una vez mejorados los vinculos intercoreanos, seran repudiados duramente por la poblacion al ponerse de relieve sus crimenes de haber aumentado el peligro de guerra de la Peninsula Coreana entregandose a la confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos fanaticos de enfrentamiento fratricida son traidores capaces de cualquier cosa para realizar su sucia ambicion politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los connacionales deberan desarrollar con osadia la lucha por sepultar a los vendepatrias conservadores surcoreanos."
