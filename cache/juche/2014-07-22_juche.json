They are nothing but a group of traitors and war servants of outside forces utterly indifferent to the security and interests of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK regard such betes noires as Han Min Gu who grew up on the bread given by outside forces as no more than dregs of society. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should properly understand the strong will of all the service personnel and people of the DPRK to ferret out and wipe out whoever tries to hurt the inviolable social system wherever he or she is in hiding and win the final victory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will make those who challenge the dignified system of the DPRK through their malignant tongue-lashing keenly realize what a true war is like."

Esto es la verdad de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas nucleares de autodefensa resultan el medio mas poderoso para saldar cuenta final con las fuerzas hostiles que recurren al despotismo, las arbitrariedades y la amenaza nuclear, y defender la dignidad y la soberania de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha se ha preservado la paz en la Peninsula Coreana, zona mas candente e inestable, gracias a la RPDC que vino consolidando el disuasivo de autodefensa frente a las cada dia mas siniestras maniobras de guerra de agresion de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi no hubiera el disuasivo autodefensivo de la RPDC, ya se habria desatado la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y la camarilla titere surcoreana se desesperan por eliminar el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC, lo cual evidencia que el disuasivo nuclear es el maximo remedio de defensa para asegurar el ambiente pacifico y las condiciones estables para el desarrollo y la prosperidad del pais y nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles deben tener presente que seran invariables muestras justas medidas de fortalecimiento de la capacidad militar incluso el lanzamiento de cohetes tacticos, la construccion de las fuerzas armadas nucleares y los ejercicios militares."
