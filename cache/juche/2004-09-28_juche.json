A scrutiny into the agreement on the transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan initialed 10 months later suggests that most of the points raised at the outset of the negotiations remained untouched. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not recognize these humiliating and treacherous negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement demanded the \"government\" authorities fully open the humiliating agreement representing the interests of the U.S. only to the people and immediately dismiss those responsible for the negotiations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary says the United States can never evade its responsibility for the abortion of the next round of the six-party talks resulting from its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its dual approach to the nuclear issue.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot remain silent when the Bush group is trying to shift the blame for \"the delay of the opening of the six-party talks\" onto the DPRK while concealing its wrong doings under a thick cover. It is none other than the U.S. which has demolished the very foundation of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose Bush forces are getting overheated in their anti-DPRK hullabaloo, stringing out a long list of abuses against it over \"human rights\", \"drugs\" and \"religion\" while openly seeking to \"overthrow\" and \"change\" its system. No less serious is its application of double standards to the nuclear issue. The recently disclosed cases of secret nuclear experiments in south Korea well show what extremes the U.S. has reached in its biased and dual approach to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While conniving at and allowing, patronizing and defending the secret nuclear activities of south Korea, the U.S. is taking issue with the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK which was caused by it and is raising a persistent and pernicious nuclear racket against the DPRK on the mere reason that the latter differs from it in idea and system. This is patent proof of the partiality and unreasonableness of its prejudice and double standards. This is the basic factor of the abortion of the next round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group should drop its base and foolish artifice to shift its responsibility onto the DPRK. It should also frankly confess before the international community to its involvement in the secret nuclear activities of south Korea, rectify its criminal double standards policy and take practical steps to restore the already demolished basic foundation of the six-party talks. This is what the U.S. should do before anything else.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This reminds one of a guilty party filing a suit first. In�@the meantime high-ranking officials of the U.S. administration set afloat�@wild rumor that the DPRK is employing delaying tactics, linking the talks�@with the U.S. presidential election.\r\n This is nothing but a trite method employed by the Bush administration to�@shift the responsibility for the delay of the six-party talks on to the DPRK�@and tarnish its international image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally recognized that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula�@is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK to all intents and�@purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has posed a constant threat of a nuclear war to the DPRK after�@massively deploying nuclear weapons in south Korea since the 1950s. The Bush�@bellicose group has staged nuclear war exercises to put into practice its�@strategy of preemptive nuclear strike after massively introducing ultra�@modern weapons into south Korea even when the six-party talks for the�@solution to the nuclear issue were underway. This has pushed the military�@situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. would not have surfaced had�@the U.S. renounced its hostile policy toward the DPRK and opted to improve�@relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. turned down the just proposal for \"reward for freeze\"�@advanced by the DPRK at the three rounds of the six-party talks and only�@insisted on its old assertion that the DPRK must accept the CVID, thus�@deliberately laying an obstacle in the way of the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What infuriates the army and people of the DPRK most is that the U.S. has�@turned a blind eye to the secret nuclear activities conducted by its ally�@under its \"nuclear umbrella\" and pressurized the DPRK to accept the CVID. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent disclosure of a series of nuclear-related secret experiments in�@south Korea clearly proves that the double standards applied by the U.S. is�@a stumbling block in the way of solving the nuclear issue and a factor of�@nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known well, the groundwork of the talks collapsed due to the�@deliberate provocation of the U.S. hard-line conservatives and the double�@standards applied by them in dealing with the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable stand of the DPRK that it can no longer discuss the�@issue of resuming the six-party talks and renounce its nuclear deterrent�@force unless the U.S. drops its double standards and hostile policy toward�@the DPRK as regards the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the wild rumor that it links the nuclear issue to the U.S�@presidential election, the DPRK does not care who becomes president in the�@U.S. The DPRK will only pursue an independent policy taking the U.S. Korea�@policy as a yardstick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration had better stop making sheer sophism intended to�@evade the responsibility for having overturned the groundwork of the talks�@and come out to the negotiations with a willingness to renounce its hostile�@policy toward the DPRK and double standards concerning the nuclear issue in�@practice\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The faith of the Korean people is characterized by the firm belief that the path of independence and socialism taken by them is entirely just, their steadfast resolve not to step back even a bit from this road of their own choice and their sincerest desire to hold President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in high esteem without any vacillation under any changed situation and in any adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's faith being fully displayed in the Songun era represents the noble thought based on the absolute trust in Kim Jong Il and their pride and self-esteem of having a great history, traditions and a wealth of experience in struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary traits of the Korean people strong in idea and faith find a vivid manifestation in that they share their will and destiny with their leader on the road of the Songun revolution and display their patriotic enthusiasm to the full in building a rich and powerful nation with pure conscience and sense of obligation. These traits also find their expression in that they are resolutely defending Korean style socialism with transparent spirit of anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither honeyed words nor horror strategy on the part of the U.S. imperialists can ever work on the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are not such type of people who will desert the road of socialism, the path of Juche, in any storm. The U.S. imperialists are resorting to all sorts of despicable moves to bring down the system in the DPRK by destabilizing its society. But nothing can shake the determination and faith of its army and people to defend to the last Korean style socialism, their destiny and lifeline, from a transparent view of anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. imperialists to destroy socialism in the DPRK will only reinforce the determination and will of its army and people to finally settle accounts with the enemy and defend their ideology, system and cause to the last.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, covering a vast territory, created an advanced economy and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its territory extended 2,400 kilometers from east to west and 1,600 kilometers from north to south in the late 5th century and in the early 6th century. It was as large as ten times the whole territories of Paekje, Silla and Kaya. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koguryo could become a powerful country mainly because of its people's strong sense of patriotism and their attaching a great importance to the military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a legend about the building of Koguryo, King Tongmyong, the founder of the country, was called Jumong as he had been very good in archery from his childhood.\r\n At that time, each village had a Kyongdang (school) where unmarried young people learned how to read and write and trained military arts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bravery and military arts were important things in personnel affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koguryo people, with a high sense of pride and brave mettle, had nothing to do with flunkeyism and submission and defended the honor of the nation and the sovereignty of the country with credit for nearly 1,000 years, repulsing the millions of aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For several centuries before and after Christ, the feudal relationship was consolidated and developed and a regular feudal system was set up in Koguryo. It had a great influence on the state and social system of the neighboring countries which appeared later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koguryo achieved a rapid development in the field of culture, too. It became one of the most developed countries in Asia and a civilized state with advanced culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mural paintings of Koguryo on dresses show that the dressing system of Koguryo greatly contributed to the development of the nation's costume. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unique under-floor heating system of the Korean people was further developed in that period and the nation's inherent style of architecture has developed on the basis of the advanced architecture of Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The culture of Koguryo had an influence on neighboring countries, especially on the establishment and development of ancient culture of Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
