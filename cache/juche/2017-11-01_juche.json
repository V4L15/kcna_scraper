            "content": "Korea-Europe Association Spokesperson Blasts NATO Secretary General for His Rubbish\r\nPyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesperson for the Korea-Europe Association Wednesday issued the following press statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t During his recent visit to Japan, the secretary general of NATO absurdly claimed that he was concerned about the north Korean missiles which are capable of reaching most parts of Europe and the western states of the U.S. and that the nuclear and missile programme of north Korea is a threat to Europe and the rest of the world that demands international response. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before leaving for Japan he had an interview with Japanese media at which he said that NATO had the resolve and capability to strike back to protect its member states from the ballistic missiles of north Korea, and that north Korea should be made to pay if it continued to pursue nuclear and missile development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a wicked sophistry of turning things upside down to condemn our possession of nukes as \"a threat to Europe and the rest of the world\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. whereby the U.S. poses nuclear threat to the DPRK while considering it a hostile country and the DPRK stands up to the U.S. to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country and nation; this is the true picture of the situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we have made it clear on several occasions including the UN General Assembly, the DPRK has no intention of using or threatening to use its nuclear weapons against any other countries as long as they do not take part in the U.S. military action against the DPRK. It is ridiculous for the secretary general of NATO, who is all too well aware of the stance of the DPRK, to rhyme with Trump and his remarks about the \"global threat\" like a little parrot. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is obvious that NATO is an organization that relies on the U.S. military, but it is still hard to understand why the secretary general, for the head of the organization he is, would imitate Trump more zealously than any U.S. citizen or official of the U.S. administration that he is not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intention of the secretary general of NATO who denies the essence of the Korean peninsula issue and makes a U.S. stooge of himself cannot be construed otherwise than pursuing a wicked aim of a certain kind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His deliberate promotion of the idea of \"threats of north Korean missiles on Europe\" implies that he is anxious to instigate NATO member states into confrontation with the DPRK and create an atmosphere favorable for NATO's involvement in the war when it breaks out on the Korean peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NATO secretary general should be fully aware that his reckless acts of kowtowing to the U.S. would only bring danger to Europe, and he had better behave with discretion."
