            "content": "Meeting held to commemorate anniversary of Kim Il Sung's work \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- Yesterday marked the 10th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung's famous work \"Let us achieve the great unity of our nation\".\r\n The president had a talk with the leading officials of the committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland and the members of the north side's headquarters of the pan-national alliance for the country's reunification on August 1,Jjuche 80 (1991). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said in the talk that the great national unity is the fundamental precondition for the independent and peaceful reunification and its essential content, providing an ideological basis of the great unity on which to unite guided by patriotism and the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also comprehensively laid down the fundamental principle of great national unity, which calls for placing common national interests above all and subordinating everything to national reunification irrespective of differences in ideas, systems and religious beliefs and tasks and ways for achieving this unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Pyongyang meeting was held at the people's palace of culture on August 1 to commemorate the anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, said in his report that the publication of the president's famous work enabled all the compatriots in the north and the south and abroad to turn out as one in the cause of national reunification under the banner of the great national unity and opened up a new chapter of reconciliation and unity among compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of great unity of the Korean nation is now making most successful progress under the outstanding and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il arranged the significant meeting of the leaders of the north and the south in June last year, which resulted in the adoption of the North-South Joint Declaration. This was the most brilliant feat performed by him on the road of the great national unity and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is not yet ready to recognize the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration supported and welcomed by the whole world though one year has passed since its adoption and hamstringed its implementation in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inter-Korean multi-faceted dialogues are now in a state of abeyance and an atmosphere of the Cold War is prevailing again on the Korean peninsula. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. moves for aggression and intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with talking about the \"missile threat from North Korea\" the Bush administration is ballyhooing about the \"threat\" of the DPRK's conventional weapons.     This is preposterous and a blatant challenge to the DPRK. \r\n The DPRK's missile program is of purely peaceful nature and this threatens nobody.    It is the legitimate sovereign right of the DPRK to push forward the peaceful missile program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In South Korea today confrontation is agitated while fellow countrymen in the north are branded as a \"principal enemy\" and patriotic pro-reunification organizations and figures are thrown into prison for \"benefiting the enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are chilling the nation's efforts for unity and beclouding the prospect of inter-Korean relations and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to such reckless moves as openly distorting the history in a bid to bury their inglorious past forever, he said all the Koreans should come out in a nationwide struggle against Japan's aggression and hostile acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were Kim Yong Sun, secretary of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the central committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, and Ryu Mi Yong, chairperson of the central committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's claim to Tok islet flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- The history society of the DPRK issued an article on July 31 assailing the Japanese reactionaries for their frantic moves to usurp Tok islet, an inviolable territory of Korea.\r\n In the article titled \"Tok islet is an inviolable territory of Korea\" the society once again proved that the islet is an inalienable territory of Korea from the historical point of view. It denounced Japan's moves to invade and plunder Tok islet and termed the Japanese reactionaries' claim to the islet a preposterous demand of those obsessed with zeal for territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cited historical facts to prove that Tok islet is an inalienable part of Korea from the historical point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, Tok islet has been under the jurisdiction of Korea for nearly 1,500 years. Korea was the first to discover the islet and explored and put it under its administration generation after generation. Korea was the first to establish dominium over the islet after declaring it as part of its territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in the 6th century there existed on Ullung island a state called Usan that was built by Korean immigrants and Tok islet was under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Usan became part of Silla in 512 (the 13th year of king Jijung), one of the three kingdoms that existed in Korea in the middle age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to such official history books of state as \"the chranicles of the three states,\" \"History of Koryo\" and  \" Rijosillok (the true records of the Ri dynasty), in the post- Usan period the Tok islet was later renamed Usan islet, Sambong islet in 1476 and Kaji islet in 1794. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been called Tok islet since 1881 and it was under Korea's formal jurisdiction generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Usan islet (Tok islet) was also designated as an islet belonging to Uljin prefecture, Kangwon Province together with Ullung island in old geographical books and historical documents such as \"topography,\" \"geography in true records of Sejong,\" \"revised and enlarged Korean geography\" and \"revised and enlarged documentary note.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly prove that the islet has remained part of the territory of Korea even after the fall of Silla and it has been regarded as part of Korea's territory under the jurisdiction of Uljin prefecture since Koryo dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These documents were distributed to Japan and china and used as important basic documents for shaping their diplomacy toward Korea. These documents were valid as official state documents and manifested the state will as there was no modern international law at that time and the islet was not widely known even after its institution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ri dynasty announced royal order no. 41 on October 25, 1900 within the framework of the international law to reconfirm its dominium over the islet, thus clearly reclarifying its dominium over the islet. This order was officially announced to the world through October 27th, 1900 (the 4th year of Kwangmu) issue of Kwanbo, the government newspaper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even a Japanese record said that Tok islet belonged to Ullung island as part of the territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Written opinions submitted by Watanabe, director of the registration department of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, Tanabe, director of its communications department, and others in December 1878 noted that \"an islet called Song islet (Tok islet) in Japan is an islet belonging to Ullung island of Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article disclosed Japan's invasion and plunder of Tok islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to invade and seize the islet began with Japanese pirates' invasion of Ullung island in the latter half of Koryo dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1379 they invaded the Ullung island and killed its inhabitants and looted their property during their 15-day long stay there. They reduced the island to debris during the Imjin (1592) patriotic war, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to seize the islet surfaced since the 17th century (periods of lord Kwanghae and king Sukjong). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves became gradually undisguised and gained in scope with the emergence of the \"theory of conquest of Korea\" and as overseas aggression was declared as a policy of the Meiji government in the latter half of the 19th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Russo-Japanese war the Japanese imperialists illegally built a watch post of its navy on Tok islet and laid a submarine cable linking the northern part of Korea, Ullung island, Tok islet and Japan proper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a cabinet meeting held on January 28, 1905 the Japanese imperialists unilaterally decided to put Tok islet under the jurisdiction of Shimane Prefecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In October 1900 before this decision was made, the Korean empire issued its royal order no.41 reconfirming Korea's dominium over Tok islet and informed, through an official telegram, all countries of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese imperialists cooked up \"Shimane prefectural notice\" no.40 claiming the islet was \"part of the territory of Japan\", asserting \"there is no evidence that it has been possessed by any other country.\" and they argued that their position conforms to the precedure and requirements of the international law which stipulates that \"ownerless land shall be occupied by those coming first.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok islet was not declared as part of the territory of Japan by such decision or \"prefectural notice\". It was, in fact, annexed to Japan when the Japanese imperialists occupied the Korean peninsula and islands belonging to it. That was why after the defeat of the Japanese imperialists the islet was automatically returned to Korea, its owner, under international agreements including Cairo and Potsdam agreements and instruction no. 677 of the allied forces supreme command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the design of the Japanese imperialists to invade and usurp Tok islet ended in total failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Describing the Japanese reactionaries' \"territorial claim to Tok islet\" as sophism of those keen on territorial expansion, the article further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Japanese militarists are raising again the issue of \"dominium\" over the islet, asserting that it should be \"retaken.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertion is totally groundless and it is nothing but a grumbling of the expansionists over their repeated defeats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to historical documents and maps of Korea, Tok islet has been part of Korea's territory. None of them indicates it belonged to Japan. Japan's main historical documents and authoritative maps, too, say unanimously that the islet belongs to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1877 the ministry of home affairs of Japan submitted to Tomomi Iwakura, prime minister of the government, a report on its 5-month long reexploration of the two islets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing himself on it, he gave the ministry an instruction on March 20 that \"Jukdo (Ullung island) and one other islet (Song islet, that is Tok islet) have nothing to do with Japan.\" (from documents at \"Japanese national archives\") &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shihei Hayashi, known as a famous  map producer of Japan, published a map of Korea, Japan and northeastern China as an appendix of \"diagrammatic chart on general view of three countries\" around in 1785. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this map Ullung island and Tok islet, a small islet next to it, were painted as the same yellow color with that of the mainland of Korea, with letters \"belonging to Korea\" printed on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Korean map by copperplate printing\" made by Kimura in 1882 showed those islets belong to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to prove the assertion that there has been a historical document or ancient map clearly indicating Japan's sovereignty over the islet is a sheer lie and it is nothing but a far-fatched argument of the militarists seeking to gratify their wild ambition for territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their argument that Tok islet \"belongs to Japan\" is sheer sophism in view of the international law, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is proved by the fact that Tok islet is an uninhabited islet but it is by no means an ownerless islet. Korea's authority over it was repeatedly and clearly manifested before the Japanese even when the \"the policy of leaving the islet uninhabited\" was in force for a long time, while being known to china through Korean documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea's dominium over this islet was known to all countries and reaffirmed in keeping with the modern practices in 1900 when royal order no. 41 was issued in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The decision of the cabinet meeting and \"Shimane prefectural notice\" no.40 of the Japanese imperialists on exercising authority over the islet were invented five years after Kojong's royal order no.41. worse still, they  were never announced at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that \"decision\", \"notice\" and the like were no more than nominal documents cooked up by some imposters only to use them as evidence in distant future rather than to publicly announce them. After all, they were a product of the down-the-line swindles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries in persistently raising the \"issue of the islet\" is to totally usurp the islet and, centering on it, establish the 200-mile exclusive fishing zone in a bid to hold monopoly over economic interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their main political and military aim to turn Tok islet into a latest multi-purpose military base suited to modern warfare and use it for realizing their reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brazen-faced and cunning moves of the Japanese reactionaries to usurp Tok islet have been promoted under such a hideous and strategic plan, the article pointed out, and stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can never allow Japan to persist in the reinvasion moves while letting loose such sophism as \"claim to the islet.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should stop the ridiculous deed as a political dwarf going against the trend of the times at once, renounce their criminal design for territorial expansion and recognize the Korean nation's sovereignty over Tok islet.    \r\n\r\n"

He was at a loss what to do. In fact, his intention was not to have prayers at that time despite the obligation as a believer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president repeatedly urged the hesitating clergyman to pray as it was his life-long obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Deeply moved by the president's broad magnanimity and charisma, he prayed for the president's longevity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened one day when the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953) was at its height. At lunch time, General K1m Il Sung examined the menu. He told the cook to rewrite the menu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cook prepared a new menu as advised by the general's adjutants but it was rejected again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the evening, the general asked the cook why he planned the daily quantity of meat for the supreme commander two times as much as that for soldiers on the menu. And he told the cook to write the same menu as that for the soldiers in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not until he heard this that the cook realized why the menu was rejected.\r\n The third menu was thus accepted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day in May Juche 35 (1946) general Kim Il Sung had an opportunity to have an emotion-charged talk with his schoolmate after the lapse of scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unexpectedly Kim Il Sung was displeased with his manner of speaking. He reproved his schoolmate for repeatedly addressing him as general and earnestly asked to call him by his name, saying that he felt awkward as his schoolmate was talking to him in that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The schoolmate was so deeply moved by his unchanged friendship and noble personality as the hero of the nation that he again addressed him as general unawares.    \r\n\r\n"
