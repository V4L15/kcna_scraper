            "content": "Confidence Building, Key to Ensure Peace on Korean Peninsula\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- The world today is witnessing a phase of detente and positive changes in which regional disputes find political solutions through dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut it is only the Korean Peninsula where tensions and danger of war persist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this regard, the Chinese Magazine Liaowang in its 32nd issue carried an article titled \"Lack of confidence is the problem in the security situation in the Korean Peninsula.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of recent contact between the north and the south and that between the DPRK and the U.S., in particular, a clear sign of detente was likely to show in the security situation in the Korean Peninsula which witnessed serious unrest and even reached the brink of a war in 2010 and there was a ray of hope for the resumption of the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the light of a series of periodical cycles of \"talks\" and \"crisis\" on the Korean Peninsula people cannot but be cautious about the future trend of the situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUncertainty of the security situation on the peninsula and its actual and potential danger originated from the lack of confidence between those involved in the conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is the lack of mutual confidence between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. side does not fully respect the regime in the DPRK though it actually exists. The former has long regarded the latter as a state of other category, far from paying attention and taking into consideration on a strategic level its requirements of interests and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe main purpose of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is to encircle and stifle it politically, impose economic sanctions on it and put strategic pressure on it through regular Ulji Freedom Guardian and other joint military exercises in the military aspect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. does not hesitate to pursue \"brink of war\" policy. The DPRK-U.S. relations still remain in the grip of acute confrontation color though there was once a temporary sign of detente during the office of Clinton. The U.S. arms race and military drills, in particular, have been considered as hostility and offensive posture, straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch for a long time. Once military conflict breaks out, it is bound to escalate the crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA lack of confidence is the biggest hurdle lying in the way of defusing the tensions on the peninsula and building an effective multilateral security cooperation system in Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts go to prove that efforts to promote the process for multilateral security cooperation in Northeast Asia may prove futile as long as the DPRK and the U.S. lack mutual confidence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality testifies to the fact that the U.S. hard line towards the DPRK can never yield an ideal fruit. What is urgent is for the parties concerned to build confidence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the above-said magazine put it, the U.S. unilateral and high-handed policy is a main factor of destroying the fair international relations and fostering mistrust and antagonism, and the root cause of disturbing peace and stability. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe United States is staging madcap UFG throughout south Korea with 530 000 troops including service members of the countries that participated in the Korean War involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is adversely affecting not only the peace on the peninsula but also the development of the situation in the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is nonsensical to expect the situation in the region to improve without defusing the tensions on the peninsula fraught with the greatest danger of war in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should not merely talk about the peace and security in the region but show its will for peace in action."

            "content": "Confianza mutua es clave por la paz de la Peninsula Coreana\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 20 de agosto (ACNC) -- La actual situacion internacional se caracteriza por la creacion de la coyuntura de alivio y el cambio positivo, segun el cual se coordinan en lo politico varios problemas conflictivos regionales a traves de las negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, solo en la Peninsula Coreana no se han eliminado la tension y el peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, la revista china \"Liaowang\" No.32, en su articulo intitulado \"El eslabon pendiente en asegurar la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana es la falta de la confianza\", senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras los contactos entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea, en particular, entre la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Estados Unidos realizados recientemente dieron la impresion de haber aparecido una clara sintoma de distension en la Peninsula Coreana en que se habia creado en 2010 una grave preocupacion hasta extenderse al borde de la guerra y despunto la aurora de reanudacion de las conversaciones a 6 bandas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las personas no pueden menos que ser prudentes ante la futura evolucion de la Peninsula Coreana a la luz de la circulacion periodica de la  \"conversaciones-crisis-conversaciones-crisis\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa incertidumbre y la peligrosidad real de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana tienen su fuente en la falta de confianza entre las partes en conflictos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFalta la confianza mutua entre la RPDC y EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa parte norteamericana no respeta plenamente la existencia real del poder coreano. EE.UU. la considero durante largo tiempo como Estado de otra clase en lugar de prestar atencion en la altura estrategica a la demanda de la RPDC en cuanto a sus intereses y seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC es, en su esencia, cercarla y aplastarla en lo politico, sancionarla en lo economico y acosarla en lo estrategico mediante los ejercicios militares conjuntos como \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, aplica sin titubeo la politica de llevar la situacion al borde de la guerra. Durante el mandato de Clinton se creo temporalmente el indicio del alivio de tension en esa peninsula, pero todavia sigue el matiz conflictivo en las relaciones binacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, el aumento armamentista y los ejercicios militares de EE.UU. agravan al extremo durante largo tiempo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl choque militar engendrara la escalada de la crisis. La falta de confianza deviene el maximo eslabon pendiente que no posibilita eliminar radicalmente la tension en la Peninsula Coreana y preparar el eficiente sistema de cooperacion para la seguridad multilateral en la region del Nordeste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos demuestran que por la falta de confianza mutua entre la RPDC y EE.UU. y entre la primera y el Sur de Corea, los esfuerzos por promover el proceso de cooperacion para la seguridad multilateral del Nordeste Asiatico podrian ser formales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad prueba que la linea intransigente de EE.UU. sobre la RPDC no posibilita surtir el efecto  ideal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo perentorio es establecer la confianza entre las partes interesadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo muestra el articulo, la politica unilateral y de despotismo de EE.UU. es el motivo importante que afecta las sanas relaciones internacionales y promueve la desconfianza, la antipatia y la confrontacion entre los paises y constituye la causa raigal que destruye la paz y la estabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, EE.UU. libra freneticamente en toda la extension surcoreana los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" movilizando 530 mil uniformados juntos con los militares de varios paises participantes en la pasada guerra coreana, lo que da la grave influencia negativa a la paz de la Peninsula Coreana  y al desarrollo de la situacion de la region de Asia-Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe mostrar su voluntad de paz no con la palabra sino con la accion practica."
