This was a direct product of the U.S. hostile policy to enslave the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK have reached such a dangerous phase as openly disclosing the scenarios for aggression and preemptive attack on the latter by staging the largest-ever joint military drills Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. is the chieftain of aggression and disturber of peace and security as it has gravely violated the sovereignty and vital right of the DPRK and the Korean nation for the past several decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the DPRK to cope with the U.S. nuclear war moves by bolstering up its nuclear force both in quality and quantity as the U.S. is focusing all its forces on bringing down the DPRK by physical means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which should be brought to justice for reneging on its commitments and duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has made every possible effort to realize the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula, pursuant to the September 19 joint statement adopted at the 4th round of the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 15, 2008 the U.S. magazine News Week, referring to the DPRK's efforts for denuclearization, said that one may say that the sincerity on the part of north Korea was proven for sure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, resorted to undisguised hostile military acts and threats to the DPRK, totally breaching the basic idea of the September 19 joint statement in which the former promised to respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and peacefully co-exist with it and it declared it has no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nuclear or conventional weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the U.S. categorically refused to fulfill all its commitments such as provision of light water reactors and energy to the DPRK and promise to opt for building lasting peace-keeping mechanism on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The September 19 joint statement much touted by the hostile forces was thus finally scrapped by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment the U.S. is busy massively introducing all types of modern military hardware into south Korea and its vicinity to stifle the dignified DPRK at any cost and getting frantic with the \"human rights\" and \"sanctions\" rackets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will react to the U.S. hostile moves with tougher countermeasures. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces' desperate moves against the DPRK would only cause it to remarkably bolster up its nuclear attack capability."
