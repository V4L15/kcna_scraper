NATO  military operations against Yugoslavia are motivated by the U.S. doctrine of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A country weak in national power is conquered by the imperialists.   Peace is guaranteed by the power of the gun of justice. If a nation has not its own solid national defence industry and military power, it cannot but be a slave of imperialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the imperialists who are wolfish before the weak and impotent before the strong. They dare not provoke a strong country but commit without hesitation unreasonable military intervention and aggression on a country weak in national defence capacities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The dignity, sovereignty and peace of a nation are guaranteed by its own strong military power. \r\n \r\n"

That is why the garden was turned into an \"experimental farm\" called Kumsusan Experimental Plot.    After making the garden a bean experimental plot, that year he went to the plot on 32 occasions to cultivate the crop and gave teachings on bean farming on 59 occasions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When a bumper year visited the bean experimental plot, he called the chief secretaries of the provincial party committees and agricultural officials, organized a model and demonstration lecture at the plot and gave a lecture on bean farming for one hour and more. This shows how the Juche method of farming for bean cultivation was established at the plot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also did maize, fruit and parsley experimental farming at the Kumsusan Experimental Plot and put heart and soul into the study of them.\r\n   No head of state and leader but President  Kim Il Sung turned residence gardens into an experimental farm for the people and created a scientific method of farming suitable for the natural features of the country. \r\n\r\n"

Kim Dae Jung should unveil the guise of the \"government for the people\" and cast clear light on the crimes against the history and the nation that were committed in concert with murderers of the Kwangju Uprising.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We cannot but ask you Kim Dae Jung whether you know the significance  of the May 18 Kwangju Uprising and stress its \"inheritance.\"\r\n   From the Kwangju Popular Uprising, the people have drawn a bloody lesson that neither the democratization  of South Korea nor national reunification can be expected unless the United States is driven out of this land.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Kim Dae Jung has national dignity and conscience he will never connive at the fact that it is none other than the United States that wire-pulled the operation of the Kwangju massacre by Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Tae Woo by mobilizing the forces under the U.S. army commander in South Korea and even the 7th U.S. fleet flotilla at the time of the May 18 Kwangju Uprising.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ruthless suppression of the people of various social strata who turned out in the struggle for attaining independence, democracy and reunification in the spirit of the Kwangju Popular Uprising is the revival of the Kwangju massacre. Since he took office, Kim Dae Jung has brought fascism redolent of the Kwangju massacre.\r\n   Kim Dae Jung should clearly know that the traitorous, murderous, fascist rule will precipitate his destruction. \r\n\r\n"
