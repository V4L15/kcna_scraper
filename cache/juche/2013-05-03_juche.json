Its numbers included mixed chorus \"May, Month of Victory\", male solo \"Chollima Gallops Forward\", female solo \"For Another Great Surge under the Uplifted Banner of Self-reliance\" and orchestra \"We Will Never Forget\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hero sportspersons who won gold medals at the 30th Olympic Games and workers of the Pyongyang Children's Foodstuff Factory also mounted the stage and sang songs \"What Did We Cherish Deep in Our Hearts\" and \"Boundless Is Our Yearning\" with deep emotion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The performers sang high praises of the glorious history of the struggle in which the Korean people worked world-startling miracles from debris after the war and paved a wide avenue for prosperity despite difficulties and trials under the wise leadership of the peerlessly great men and a bright future of the great Paektusan nation advancing under the line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The audience was mesmerized when orchestra and mixed chorus \"The Dear Home in My Native Village\" and female solo and mixed chorus \"Peace Is Guaranteed by Our Arms\", in particular, were presented. The artistes sang those songs again in response to the repeated encores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The concert ended with mixed chorus \"The Leader and the General Are Together.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un, reflecting the feelings of the audience, requested the artistes to repeat the songs \"The Dear Home in My Native Village\" and \"Peace Is Guaranteed by Our Arms.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He warmly congratulated the artistes, expressing great satisfaction over their splendid performance which is distinct in its ideological and thematic content and style and represents the ardent aspiration and desire, high awareness and determination of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Appreciating the Unhasu Orchestra as outpost and reliable agitator on the ideological front of the WPK, he extended thanks to it in the name of the First Secretary of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Unhasu concert marking May Day instills the spirit of defending the socialist country, the will to annihilate the enemies, faith in victory and optimism into the army and people with its might as powerful as a nuclear bomb, he noted, adding it is an excellent concert electrifying the audience and fully reflecting the revolutionary stand and principle of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting \"The Dear Home in My Native Village\", a wartime song strong in philosophical nature and full of patriotism, was excellently represented in the spirit of the era, he said the service personnel and people of the DPRK would turn out in a decisive battle, singing such wartime songs once the second June 25 war breaks out on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Peace Is Guaranteed by Our Arms\" is a very good song which one wishes to listen again and again, he said, adding: This song fully reflects our principled stand toward the enemies who haven't dropped their wicked design to stifle our socialist country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to such revolutionary and militant songs as \"The Dear Home in My Native Village\" and \"Peace Is Guaranteed by Our Arms\", our service personnel and people will win only victory in their final decisive battle against the enemies, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed his expectation and belief that the creators and artistes of the orchestra would powerfully encourage the army and people through creation of arts and performing activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the audience were Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Kyok Sik, Hwang Pyong So, Kang Phil Hun, Ryom Chol Song, Jo Kyong Chol, Kim Yong Chol, Pak Jong Chon and Jon Chang Bok, Pyongyangites and local people of different strata staying in the capital city."

The line was set forth by the dear respected Kim Jong Un at the historic March 2013 Plenary Meeting of the C.C., Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t Presented at the seminar were some papers on the validity of the line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The president of Kim Il Sung University, Thae Hyong Chol, in his paper said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Respected Marshal Kim Jong Un's line on simultaneously building up the economy and nuclear forces serves as a guarantee for achieving national reunification and finishing the building of a thriving socialist nation at an earliest date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the only choice for the DPRK to get access to nukes in order to deter the U.S. nuclear threat and achieve national reunification. Only when the country beefs up the nuclear striking power in every conceivable way, is it possible to overpower all sorts of hostile forces under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line is eternal guidelines for defending the nation's sovereignty and dignity. They can be defended only on the strength of military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the nuclear armed forces are the most reliable and mighty means for defending the nation's sovereignty and dignity in the present-day era when the imperialists openly threaten other countries with nukes.    This is truth shown by tragedies in Libya and several other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ju Chang Il, dean of the Faculty of Philosophy of the University, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new line is most scientific as it correctly reflects the situation prevailing in the country and the requirements of the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Beefing up nuclear armed forces is the only way to avert a nuclear war and secure peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nukes serve as powerful means for self-defence and peace. Nobody can dare to provoke the DPRK for fear of its nukes. It is considered to be a universal truth that nations with nukes have no other choice but to seek peaceful co-existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that international laws have so far been adopted in favor of nuclear powers. Justice turns to be injustice in accordance with the U.S. perspective. It lays hurdles to economic development and growth of those countries refusing to follow it and labels those calling for sovereignty and principle as \"criminals\" and \"evils\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not a few UN bodies, whose mission is to ensure sovereign rights and security of their member nations, have turned into marionettes of the imperialist forces, yielded to their high-handed practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a nuclear weapons state, the DPRK has been able to determinedly challenge the U.S. that is styling itself the \"only superpower in the world\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rim Yong Chol, a section chief of Pyongyang Agricultural College of the University, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new strategic line is a succession of the line of simultaneously carrying on the economic construction and defence buildup, as it represents the principle of independence, the principle of Songun (military-first) politics and the ideal of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It fully conforms to the requirements of the present era in which the DPRK is energetically stepping up the building of a thriving nation, in acute confrontation with the U.S."

sobre la linea de desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la de las fuerzas armadas nucleares presentada por el Mariscal Kim Jong Un en el historico pleno de marzo de 2013 del Comite Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t  En la ocasion fueron publicadas varias disertaciones que argumentan la justicia de dicha linea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El rector de este plantel docente, Thae Hyong Chol (59 anos de edad), senalo en su articulo que la linea de desarrollo paralelo presentada por el Mariscal es la revolucionaria invencible que permite llevar a feliz termino en el mas corto tiempo la causa de la reunificacion de la patria y la construccion de un Estado prospero socialista y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para lograr la gran causa historica de la reunificacion de la patria rechazando rotundamente la amenaza nuclear de Estados Unidos, tenemos que poseer sin duda el poderoso medio de represalia, o sea las armas nucleares fortalecidas en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Solo cuando fortalezcamos por todos los medios la capacidad de ataque nuclear tomando la construccion de las fuerzas armadas nucleares como estrategia permanente de la revolucion,  podemos rechazar de un golpe a todas las fuerzas hostiles que actuan con imprudencia bajo el paraguas nuclear de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nueva linea de desarrollo paralelo es la guia eterna para exaltar a todo el mundo y defender firmemente la soberania y la dignidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La soberania y dignidad de la nacion no se determinan por el dinero o el bien ni se defienden por la ilusion o la obediencia a otro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ellas son la vida de la nacion que puede defenderse solo con las inagotables y potentes fuerzas de autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el mundo actual en que las maniobras de escision nacional de los imperialistas se tornan cada dia mas graves y se comete abiertamente el chantaje nuclear de las fuerzas reaccionarias tendente a convertir en los esclavos de version moderna a otras naciones, las fuerzas armadas nucleares son la mas confiable y poderosa garantia para defender la soberania y dignidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto es el principio de la historia que demuestra el estado tragico ocurrido en Libia y otros paises en los ultimos anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El decano de la Facultad de Filosofia, Ju Chang Il (52 anos de edad), apunto que la nueva linea del desarrollo paralelo es la mas cientifica que refleja exactamente la demanda legitima de la situacion dada y la revolucion en desarrollo y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La garantia real para prevenir la guerra nuclear y defender la paz en la Peninsula Coreana tambien reside en el fortalecimiento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nuestras fuerzas armadas nucleares son las fuerzas poderosas de la autodefensa y el medio potente para el aseguramiento de la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Gracias a contar con el disuasivo nuclear, nadie intenta atreverse a burlar el destino de la nacion coreana y nosotros hemos convertido en el pais y la nacion poderosos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el mundo actual se considera como verdad universal el que entre los paises poseedores de las armas nucleares, no se puede menos que buscar el remedio de la coexistencia pacifica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No es mucho decir que desde el fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial hasta la fecha el orden del mundo se ha controlado de hecho por las potencias poseedoras de las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun los intereses de las potencias fue establecido el orden del mundo, la justicia se convierte en la injusticia por la interpretacion al estilo estadounidense, se restringen el desarrollo y el crecimiento de los paises que no obedecen ni adulan a los paises grandes y se califica de \"crimen\" y \"mal\" si dicen sobre la independencia y los principios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto es la realidad del actual mundo lleno de contradicciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especialmente hasta las organizaciones de la ONU que deben tomar como su mision el aseguramiento de los derechos independientes y la seguridad de los paises miembros ante la coaccion y la arbitrariedad de las brutales fuerzas imperialistas, se convierten en los aparatos titeres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Gracias a poseer las armas nucleares, nuestro pais abrio el orificio en la estructura politica del mundo centrada en las potencias nucleares y llego a enfrentarse dignamente a EE.UU. que se autodenomina como \"unica superpotencia\" en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El jefe de seccion del Instituto Superior de Agricultura de Pyongyang, Rim Yong Chol (50 anos de edad), subrayo que la nueva linea estrategica es la brillante sucesion y desarrollo  de la linea de desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la de defensa nacional en que se materializaron el principio de independencia, el del Songun y el ideal del socialismo y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nueva linea de desarrollo paralelo es la estrategica que profundizo la linea para desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y la defensa nacional conforme a la demanda de la revolucion en desarrollo y la condicion de la epoca actual en que se libra mas agudamente el enfrentamiento total con EE.UU. y avanzamos con pasos firmes hacia la victoria final de la construccion de un Estado prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Durante casi 70 anos despues de la apariencia de las armas nucleares en la Tierra, la guerra fria continuo en escala mundial y las guerras grandes y pequenas se realizaron en varias regiones, pero solo los paises poseedores de las armas nucleares no fueron invadidos en lo militar por otro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este hecho historico y la condicion real en que EE.UU.,  mayor poseedor de las armas nucleares en el mundo, ejerce constantemente la amenaza nuclear a nuestro pais, comprueban que el disuasivo nuclear poderoso es el medio fisico mas potente y el remedio invencible para defender la soberania del pais y la nacion, prevenir la guerra y garantizar la paz."

            "content": "Responsabilidad de estado de ZIK recae sobre autoridades surcoreanas\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 3 de mayo (ACNC) -- Los titeres surcoreanos siguen acusando a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en cuanto a la Zona Industrial de Kaesong que se halla en visperas del cierre total.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn rueda de prensa concedida el 22 del mes pasado, el vocero del Ministerio de Unificacion dijo que se agrandan los danos de las empresas surcoreanas debido a la medida tomada por la parte Norte para restringir el transito y que esta debe ser fiel a los acuerdos intercoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reciente reunion de jefes de secretarios, la duena de Chongwadae argumento que la parte Norte es el responsable del estado de la ZIK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal proceder es una astuta artimana para encubrir sus crimenes de haber llevado al fracaso la cooperacion economica intercoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC aprecio el alma patriotica pro-reunificacion de Jong Ju Yong, presidente honorario del Grupo Hyundai del Sur de Corea, y le concedio los favores especiales. Asi fue construida la ZIK, que es el valioso fruto de la epoca del 15 de junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el unico deseo de que la ZIK se convierta en la base de reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion nacional, la parte Norte cedio esa zona militarmente sensible para las actividades economicas de la parte surena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, cuando durante su mandato el traidor Lee Myung Bak interrumpio totalmente las relaciones intercoreanas enfrascandose a la confrontacion fratricida, la parte Norte hizo todo lo posible para mantenerla en funcionamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl margen de los esfuerzos abnegados de la RPDC para el interes, la paz y la prosperidad comunes de la nacion, es imposible pensar en el hecho de que la ZIK vino manteniendose milagrosamente bajo la actual situacion aguda en visperas de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los maniacos conflictivos surcoreanos insultaron la ZIK como \"fuente de ingreso\" de la parte Norte y obstaculizaron persistentemente su gestion y desarrollo normales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY hasta infiltraron a los conspiradores y agentes entre los empresarios y obreros surcoreanos que entraban en la zona y se valieron de todas las maneras para derrocar nuestro regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo intolerable es que los belicistas surcoreanos pusieron al desnudo su intencion de introducir en la citada zona las fuerzas armadas agresivas hablando de la llamada operacion de \"rescate de rehenes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos demuestran claramente que los titeres tratan de convertir la ZIK no en la base de reconciliacion y la unidad sino en el campo de confrontacion y fuente de guerra de agresion al Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon muy justas las contramedidas de la RPDC tomadas frente a ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no podran liberarse jamas de la responsabilidad del estado de la ZIK que se encuentra en una fase del cierre total."
