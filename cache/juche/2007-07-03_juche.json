            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves for Retrogressive Revision of Constitution under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- Some time ago the French paper La Liberation said what the Japanese reactionaries seek through the retrogressive revision of their Constitution is not to defend Japan but participate in a war against the third country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As commented by the French paper, their moves to adopt a war constitution are aimed to reorganize the present state system into a wartime system for overseas aggression, observes Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: The Abe forces are vociferating about the necessity to revise the present Constitution, calling for \"departure from the postwar regime\" pursuant to the \"change of the times\" and \"a responsible role\" in the settlement of international issues. This is sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe has disclosed his attempt to replace the \"Pacifist Constitution\" by a war constitution within three years while blustering that now is the time to boldly reorganize the postwar regime and start with a clean sheet and it is his \"mission to make the state take on fresh appearance\". They have already adopted the \"law on referendum\" aimed to revise the Constitution. If the results of the referendum came out as intended by the Abe regime, this would mean providing legal conditions for scrapping the \"Pacifist Constitution\" that has existed in name only and adopting instead a war Constitution in Japan. This indicates that the moves of the Japanese reactionaries for the retrogressive revision of the Constitution are being pushed forward at the last phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the above-said retrogressive Constitutional revision they intend to develop the \"Self-Defence Forces\" (SDF) into regular armed forces and grant it the \"right to collective self-defense\" in a bid to justify the aggressor armed forces' overseas military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Graves are consequences to be entailed by their moves for the retrogressive Constitutional revision. The appearance of a war constitution in the wake of the demise of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" would enable the Japanese reactionaries to hurl their aggressor forces into any area of the world and mount a preemptive attack on any other country, unhindered.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK's mighty war deterrent for self-defence has become an invincible shield for curbing reckless war provocations of the bellicose forces at home and abroad and firmly defending the peace of the country and the security of the nation. In actuality, the U.S. is now standing in an acute military standoff with the DPRK on the Korean Peninsula, but it dares not to resort to such a rash military adventure against the DPRK as what it did in the 1950s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun politics is a politics of true patriotism for bringing a peaceful life and prosperous future to the fellow countrymen in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans at home and abroad all benefit by Songun politics as it guarantees peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is under the protection of Songun just like the north. Should the U.S. ignite a war on the Korean Peninsula, the south Korean economic and social foundations will be reduced to ruins. Had it not been for the powerful war deterrent built in the DPRK by Songun politics which guarantees a stable situation on the Korean Peninsula, south Korea would have long ago witnessed a confusion and total catastrophe defying comparison with what suffered under the \"mandate\" of the International Monetary Fund in 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun politics is, in deed, an unbreakable shield and a powerful treasured sword protecting all the Koreans, whether in the north or in the south, from a holocaust of war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Y ahora intenta ejecutar por la fuerza una subasta sobre el solar y el edificio de la Casa Central de la Chongryon por conducto de la Corporacion de Resolucion y Coleccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellos llevaron unilateralmente al fracaso los esfuerzos por resolver el problema al ordenar a esa entidad rehusar obstinadamente las sinceras y racionales propuestas de la Chongryon sobre la solucion de las deudas y presentar una demanda sumamente discriminatoria y parcial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto resulta una maniobra para acabar con la Chongryon y el movimiento de los coreanos radicados en Japon al eliminar fisicamente la base de las actividades de esta institucion, que deviene la defensora de los derechos nacionales democraticos de estos compatriotas, siendo un siniestro atentado a la soberania de la RPDC, al que no se atrevio ninguno de los anteriores gobiernos del pais isleno. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La Chongryon es una legitima organizacion de los compatriotas en ultramar de la RPDC fundada para defender los derechos nacionales democraticos de los coreanos residentes en Japon, quienes son victimas directas de ese criminal arresto forzado a los coreanos perpetrado en el pasado por los imperialistas islenos y sus descendientes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tanto a la luz de las circunstancias historicas de la creacion de la Chongryon como en vista de todos los crimenes cometidos de generacion en generacion por la familia de Abe en contra de la nacion coreana, el actual mandatario japones tiene la ineludible responsabilidad juridica y moral de protegerla y garantizar sus actividades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, como si no le bastaran todas esas acciones represivas a la Chongryon, la horda de Abe trata de arrebatar hasta el edificio y la tierra de la Chongryon, lo cual deviene un flagrante atentado a la soberania de la RPDC de similar gravedad que la sancion financiera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos dias, las autoridades japonesas justifican esas tentativas anunciando como si fueran un \"asunto economico relacionado con la recaudacion de los bonos de credito\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, detras de esta cruenta campana, se hallan la premeditada intriga y la indicacion directa de Abe encaminadas a cumplir sus mezquinos fines politicos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Inquietado por la constante caida de apoyo en visperas de las elecciones de los consejeros previstas para finales del mes en curso, Abe, quien no pudo conseguir resultados esperados con su absurda insistencia en cuanto al \"problema del secuestro\", maniobra irracional y desesperadamente para poner escollos en el curso de las conversaciones a 6 partes al llevar a la peor fase las relaciones con la RPDC mediante la toma forzada de ese edificio de la Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon frena el avance de la cita a 6 bandas para la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana en su intento de dilatar la solucion del problema para seguir utilizandolo como el pretexto de militarizacion de su pais hasta completarla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es una conducta muy virulenta el que la banda de Abe se mantiene callada en la mesa de esa cita y, a las espaldas, acosa brutalmente a esa inocente organizacion de los coreanos en Japon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Entonces, nuestro pais se ve obligado a dudar de la necesidad de la continua participacion en ese dialogo de Japon, que se porta tan suciamente partiendo de su malsano proposito. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nuestro pais nunca se mostrara indiferente ante esa brutal represion a la Chongryon y nuestra entidad competente tomara medidas necesarias.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia enmienda constitucional de Japon\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 2 de julio (ATCC) -- Hace poco, el periodico frances \"Liberation\" revelo que la enmienda constitucional de los reaccionarios de Japon no es para la defensa de su territorio sino para participar en la guerra contra un tercer pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como lo revelo el rotativo galo, las maniobras de los reaccionarios japoneses para fabricar una constitucion belicista se orientan a cambiar el actual sistema estatal en el belico para la agresion a ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Ratifica el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual publicado este lunes y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Es un absurdo engano el que las fuerzas de Abe resaltaran la necesidad de enmendar la constitucion vigente abogando por la \"salida del sistema posbelico\" en ajuste a los \"cambios de la epoca\" y el ejercicio de un \"papel responsable\" en la solucion de los problemas internacionales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Abe expone abiertamente su intencion de cambiar dentro de tres anos la \"constitucion pacifista\" por una belica pregonando que ahora es \"cuando hay que modificar valientemente el sistema posbelico y comenzar de nuevo\" y que su \"mision\" es \"proyectar un nuevo aspecto estatal\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Para este fin, la pandilla de Abe ya elaboro la \"ley de plebiscito\" para el particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Como se de en este sufragio un resultado esperado por el gobierno de Abe, se prepararan las condiciones legales para fabricar una constitucion belica cancelando la \"pacifista\", que vino existiendo formalmente hasta ahora. Esto insinua que entro en su ultima fase las maniobras de enmienda constitucional de los reaccionarios japoneses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A traves de este trabajo, ellos intentan convertir en un ejercito regular a sus \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" y legalizar las acciones militares en ultramar de las fuerzas agresoras al permitir el \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si se llevan a efecto tales maniobras, se produciran graves consecuencias. Es que los reaccionarios japoneses podran despachar libremente a sus tropas invasoras a cualquier parte del mundo y perpetrar el ataque preventivo a otros paises.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
