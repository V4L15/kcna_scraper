Earlier, the warmongers introduced a large number of war equipment including ground attack planes and fighter bombers till last April. They are scheming to bring in six fighter planes in near future.   This is  part of foolish war maneuvers of the warlike forces to unleash a new war of aggression in the Korean peninsula under the signboard of filling up the \"vacuum of combat power\" from the Yugoslav crisis. \r\n\r\n"

Korean rulers' moves to put forward former dictators\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland published information bulletin no. 787 on May 19 denouncing the South Korean authorities for scheming to put forward former military fascist dictators again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The information bulletin said:   The South Korean authorities recently said that they would construct a \"memorial\" of Park Chung Hee who had resorted to the treacheries, division, fascism and war moves for 18 years before being killed. And they are conniving at and patronizing the behaviour of Kwangju murderer Chun Doo Hwan who is mocking the people by announcing his \"visit to Kwangju\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This fully shows that although the South Korean rulers are proclaiming their regime the \"people's government,\" they are tarred with the same brush as the former military fascist dictators and are following in the footsteps of their predecessors.   The South Korean authorities are plotting to mercilessly trample underfoot the massive struggle of the workers and people for vital rights and democracy in a bid to commit a \"second Kwangju bloodbath\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should give up at once the anti-historic, anti-social moves to revive the ghost of the \"Yusin\" fascist dictatorship and bring the traitor Chun Doo Hwan to a trial by history and stop the unreasonable suppression of the labour movement unconditionally as unanimously demanded by the people. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' suppression of labour movement\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed commentary accusing the South Korean authorities of ruthlessly cracking down upon cadres of trade unions under the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) which has begun the second general strike.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst says:   On May 17, the \"public security department of the supreme public prosecutor's office\" of South Korea started an operation to arrest the chairman and five other cadres of the Federation of Metal Trade Unions under the KCTU according to warrants of arrests issued on charges of violating the \"law on assembly and demonstration.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"prosecution\" also demanded warrants of arrests for two leaders of the federation including the director of its organising department and the chairman of the Medical Service Industrial Trade Unions.   Such deeds of the South Korean authorities are part of the premeditated repressive campaign to put down the ever mounting righteous struggle of workers. These are an unpardonable challenge to the workers calling for vital rights and democratic freedom.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The struggle of the KCTU and other workers' organisations for democracy and vital rights cannot be an \"illegal\" struggle and the target of suppression in any case.\r\n   South Korean workers are going on strikes, unable to eke out their existence. Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities, far from lending an ear to their ardent demands, are ruthlessly cracking down upon them. This is a very illegal deed which fully reveals the fascist nature of the self-proclaimed \"government for the people.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers must draw a serious lesson from lots of preceding dictators who sustained a miserable defeat for their frantic fascist suppression, put an immediate end to the layoff and \"restructuring\" as demanded by the workers and unconditionally guarantee democratic freedom and rights of workers including three rights of labour. And it must stop the crackdown upon the KCTU and its affiliated organisations at once and release all the arrested people promptly. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun on Wednesday said this in a political essay entitled \"Our Leader's Outlook on Happiness.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The essay said:   President Kim Il Sung's lifelong view on the value of happiness was that one who enjoys love from people is happy, but one who doesn't is unhappy.\r\n   Regarding the idea of \"the people are my god\" as his lifelong motto, he had a great institution of life in the guerrilla way, without a wedding dress and feast, like a soldier, though he was the commander of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although he was at head of the party and the state, he had the same meals of millet with people's and saw to it that the same amount of food with that for an ordinary official was supplied to his family. In this way, he led a humble and simple life, like an ordinary people, until the last moments of his great life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He considered it as greatest happiness to make friends and felt greater joy and satisfaction at making each friend than at getting gold.\r\n   Especially, it was his greatest fortune to have had Kim Jong Suk, an anti-Japanese heroine and the supreme incarnation of loyalty, as his close revolutionary comrade-in-arms and life partner.   It was the greatest blessing and happiness of the President to have Kim Jong Il, the great son of guerrillas, as the only successor to his cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President was the supreme personifier of the noble view on happiness. He regarded it greater happiness to devote than to enjoy.\r\n   He had traveled a long journey of on-site guidance for the people until the last period of his great life, from the very day when he visited workers in Kangson without a call at his dear old home after the liberation of the country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His great joy and happiness was to devote all his love and affection to comrades.\r\n   He valued the blessings with his successor above anything else and had done all he could to honor the blessings and leave more legacy for the Kim Jong Il era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He personally worked out and signed a decree on making it traditional to splendidly celebrate the respected leader Kim Jong Il's birthday as a greatest holiday of the nation. \r\nAnd he personally chose the site of a large attachment to the international friendship exhibition to preserve gifts to Kim Jong Il and took all measures for its construction.\r\n   He took heavy works of his own accord for Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that Kim Jong Il achieved the cause of immortalizing the life of President Kim Il Sung for the first time in history, the essay said:   Thus, the President is still alive in the hearts of the Korean people as before and will be with us for all ages. \r\nHe, who is preserved in state, illumines the road ahead of the people and encourages them with his sacred image while being blessed with the people. \r\n\r\n"

Only then is it possible to struggle against imperialism to the end with staunch fighting spirit and preparedness.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is more important to quite grasp the nature of imperialism because the imperialists are getting more vicious and cunning in aggression and war moves. The imperialists are now resorting to \"appeasement\" strategy while viciously maneuvering to strike the world community with terror to them.   Therefore, it is an important guarantee for vigorously waging the anti-imperialist struggle.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is important in looking squarely in the true nature of contemporary imperialism is, above all, to see through the intention of the imperialists clamoring about the \"gloomy prospect\" of socialism.\r\n   Imperialism is in a dilemma and its future is gloomy. \r\nThat is why the imperialists have been flinging mud at the prospect of socialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is also important to correctly understand the imperialists' deceptive sophism whereby they prattle capitalism is prospering.\r\n   Today the developed capitalist countries seem to be prospering in appearance, but they are becoming degenerated with daily growing internal contradictions.  \r\n\r\n"
