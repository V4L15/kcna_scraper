The title of the first part was \"we firmly uphold the June 15 joint declaration as a great banner of national reunification\" and the second was \"achieving national reunification 'by our nation itself' is an irresistible trend\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the rally said that last year the South Korean people from all walks of life fought against the U.S. hardline policy toward the north and its moves for a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, the struggle to punish GI killers of the two schoolgirls was turned into an all-people anti-U.S. struggle and all the fellow countrymen vigorously struggled to achieve great unity under the great slogan \"By Our Nation Itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Published at the rally was an \"article to the people seeing out 2002, the year of loud shouts of 'By Our Nation Itself'\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A literary and art presentation including the singing of one anti-U.S. song after another, signature campaign for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops who killed schoolgirls and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the north and the united states and other propaganda activities took place at the rally.    \r\n\r\n"

It declared that it will struggle with the people until the grudge of Hyo Sun and Mi Son is paid off, Bush officially apologizes, GI murderers are punished at South Korean court and the SOFA is revised.    \r\n\r\n"

The editorial is a banner of struggle encouraging the whole party and army and all the people to win fresh victory, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that a bold offensive should be launched and great changes made to fully display the dignity and might of the motherland this year, the 55th anniversary of the DPRK, they said: officials, working people and youth and students should turn out as one to successfully carry out the militant tasks laid down in the joint editorial in the spirit of devotedly defending the motherland and the spirit of the \"arduous march\", which were displayed in the 1950s and the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A similar meeting of servicemen of the ministry of people's security was held here on Monday with Minister Paek Hak Rim, who is vice marshal of the Korean People's Army, and leading officials of the ministry attending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting Sim Won Il, director of the Political Department of the Ministry, made a report which was followed by speeches of generals and officers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter and speakers said they would keep in mind the unshakable faith that the dignity and the future of the DPRK are guaranteed only when Kim Jong Il is devotedly safeguarded. And they would reliably fulfil their honorable duty to defend the leader and fully discharge their mission in cementing the singlehearted unity of the party, the army and the people based on the idea of giving top priority to the army, they stressed.    \r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n Fully reflected in the army-based policy is the unshakable anti-imperialist spirit of fighting to the last at the risk of one's life against anyone who tries to encroach upon the sovereignty of Korea and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its sovereignty is guaranteed by armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Arms serve as an invincible treasured sword that can be placed in the hands of only those with faith and will ready to fight against enemies to a finish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The revolutionary spirit of soldiers is now being fully displayed among the servicepersons and the whole society is learning from it as it helps step up the advance of the era of army-based policy. Underlying this spirit are the firm resolution and will of the army and the people of the DPRK to devotedly implement the army-centered policy of the party based on the staunch anti-imperialist fighting spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy reflects the transparent spirit of class struggle, the spirit of allowing neither compromise nor concession in the confrontation with imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The master key to emerging victorious in this confrontation lies in firmly adhering to the revolutionary principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army remains strong regardless of whether enemies pursue an appeasement policy or a hardline one. It does not allow any slightest compromise or concession in the struggle against class enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is based on the firm revolutionary principle that the DPRK will never lay down arms of the revolution and class as long as imperialists remain on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism is sure to triumph as long as the army-centred policy of the WPK remains in force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
