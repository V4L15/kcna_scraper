            "content": "NDC of DPRK Clarifies Principled Stand on U.S. Hostile Policy toward It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission of the DPRK Friday released the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t Time goes by, bringing changes in the era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is long since the scars left by the horrible disasters of World War II were no longer visible in various parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it is only the Korean peninsula where the tragedy of territorial and national division is going on and military tension and war danger are escalating.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is entirely attributable to the U.S. brigandish hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bosses of the White House have been replaced many times from the Truman administration which was directly involved in partitioning Korea to the present Obama administration. But the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the contrary, its hostile policy toward the DPRK has been steadily modified and supplemented to be a harsher one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed at strangling the latter politically, economically and militarily and Washington's moves pursuant to it  have reached such a grave phase that they can no longer be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington has tightened \"sanctions\" against the DPRK and stepped up the moves to \"isolate and blockade\" against it and posed undisguised military threat to it over its nuclear deterrence for self-defence. This has only driven the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.  It is escalating the \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK by falsifying facts. This racket has also reached an extreme phase, going beyond a danger level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the U.S. Department of State made no scruple of daring accuse the DPRK of its election results, a provocation. It asserted that the election of deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly can not be viewed as a \"model of democracy\" and it is \"skeptical\" about the news that 100 percent of the electors voted for the candidates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When looking back on history, it is none other than the U.S. which has always recklessly found fault with the DPRK over everything done by its service personnel and people, terming it \"provocation\" and \"threat\", and dared wantonly infringe upon its sovereignty, their life and soul. The U.S. is the sworn enemy which has perpetrated wicked and foolish acts to undermine the ideology of the DPRK and bring down its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the prevailing grave situation, the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK clarifies its principled stand on the U.S. hostile policy toward it at home and abroad as follows, reflecting the unanimous will of its party, state, army and people:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The U.S. should make a policy decision to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and lift all the measures pursuant to the policy, before it is too late.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its hostile policy toward the DPRK is the harshest one aimed at undermining the ideology of the DPRK and bringing down its social system by dint of U.S.-style democracy and market economy, and swallowing up all Koreans and the whole of Korea by force of arms for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a bid to realize such a politically-motivated sinister scenario, the U.S. has recklessly escalated its moves to slap \"sanctions\" against the DPRK and \"isolate and blockade\" it by bringing together all hues of dishonest forces after labeling the DPRK \"provocateur\" and \"dangerous target\" according to its unilateral and self-righteous Yankee-style criteria and principle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the U.S. is the chieftain of provocation and aggression. It, at the same time, styles itself an apostle of peace though it is an ill-famed mastermind of war and destruction, groundlessly accusing others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hence, the U.S. has covered up its overseas policy of aggression with such ostentatious veils as \"peace\", \"democracy\", \"deterrence\" and \"rapid reaction\" and termed its undisguised war moves for aggression \"defensive\" and \"annual\" ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even U.S. Secretary of State Kerry in a recent public appearance slandered the DPRK, branding it as a \"country of evils\", \"evil place\" and \"closed country\", crying out for making \"diplomacy work on it through pressure and sanctions\" and forcing it to yield to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, during his junket to Seoul early this month former U.S. President Bush praised some \"defectors from north,\" human scum to be thrown into a dumping ground, as heroes, cynically blustering that the social system in the DPRK should not be allowed to be as it is. Such brigandish behavior of the U.S. may work on other continents and countries, but not on the army and people of DPRK who regard sovereignty as dear as their life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to lift by itself all unjust measures in all fields before facing the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The U.S. should have a proper viewpoint and stand on the DPRK's nuclear deterrence and stop behaving foolishly, letting loose a string of reckless remarks that the DPRK's \"dismantlement of its nukes first\" is the \"keynote\" of the hostile policy towards it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK has clarified on various occasions, the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula originated from the U.S. introduction of nukes into south Korea in the 1950s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time, the U.S. secretly deployed more than 1 000 nuclear warheads and its launching means in various parts of south Korea, arrogantly claiming \"neither to confirm nor to deny is the nuclear policy of the U.S.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then, Washington has shipped various types of nuclear strike means into the vicinity of the DPRK's territorial air, waters and land, escalating its nuclear threat and blackmail against the latter.  It thus deliberately laid obstacles in the way of denuclearizing the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This situation compelled the DPRK to have nuclear deterrence for self-defence to defend the sovereignty of the country and nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK does not hide that the main target of its already-diversified nuclear strike means is the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Placing main emphasis on putting an end to the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail, the service personnel and people of the DPRK will make sustained efforts to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington is now persistently letting loose such rigmarole that it does not recognize the nukes of the DPRK and there will be a \"dialogue and improvement of relations\" between the U.S. and the DPRK only when the DPRK takes an action to dismantle its nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should properly understand that Pyongyang's nuclear deterrence is neither a means for bargaining nor a plaything to be used by it keen on dialogue and blinded by the improvement of the relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the DPRK's nuclear deterrence is by no means a ghost-like means which does not exist when it is not recognized by the U.S. or remains when it is \"recognized\" by it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is resorting to what it calls \"patience strategy\", hoping the DPRK to move and make changes first, but such things desired by  Washington will never happen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stand of the DPRK to wait with a high degree of patience for the time when the White House has a person with normal insight and way of thinking as its boss.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should bear in mind that the efforts of the army and people of the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence will go on and additional measures will be taken to demonstrate its might one after another as long as the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail persist as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The U.S. should stop at once its groundless \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK which began as part of its new hostile policy towards the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One can hardly find in the world such an advantageous social system as the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses which fully guarantees human rights, the fundamental rights of human beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Admittedly, the people of the DPRK are still not as well off as others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, its army and people are not envious of such corrupt and ailing capitalist society as the U.S. where the rich get ever richer and the poor get ever poorer and the law of the jungle and arbitrary and high-handed practices are rampant and human rights are ruthlessly violated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are proud and honored to live in the society full of joy and optimism as they have a far-reaching goal to build a paradise on this land by their own efforts and are working hard to translate it into stirring reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. quite often accuses the DPRK, even using such words as the \"worst tundra of human rights\" and \"society with poor human rights records.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the U.S. noisy \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK is nothing but hysteria kicked up by the human scum who fled to south Korea after being forsaken even by their kith and kin for their all sorts of evil doings and vices perpetrated in their hometowns. In other words, it is the charade staged on the basis of the misinformation provided by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that such big country as the U.S. uses those human scum who are more dead than alive for its campaign for hurting the dignity of the DPRK. This must be a tragicomedy of the 21st century orchestrated by Washington.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National sovereignty is more important than human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Probably this is the reason why the U.S. keeps more prisoners than any other countries in the world, mercilessly brandishing sharp swords against any forces opposed to the state and endangering its existence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK also does not show any mercy and leniency towards a tiny handful of hostile elements doing harm to the ideology and social system chosen by all its people who are the masters of the sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because they are riff-raffs and dregs of society and good-for-nothings as useless as slag in molten iron in the furnace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to mind its own business, being aware of where it stands, before talking nonsense about others' affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hackneyed hostile policy toward the DPRK is bound to finally go bust as it fails to properly understand it, turning its face away from the trend of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the immutable truth taught by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The  more persistently the U.S. pursues its scenario for forcing the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear deterrence with brigandish sophism, the further it ratchets up its campaign to impair the prestige of the dignified DPRK and defame its social system with conspiratorial \"human rights\" racket and the more deliberately it brings the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war, peddling rumors of \"provocation and threats,\" the more serious self-contradiction it will face and the more gloomier and more miserable its prospect of downhill turn will be.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better roll back its worn-out hostile policy toward the DPRK as soon as possible and shape a new realistic policy before it is too late. This would be beneficial not only to meeting the U.S. interests but also to ensuring the security of its mainland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should judge the situation with a cool head and make a policy decision in line with the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people in the DPRK advancing dynamically full of conviction in the final victory will never tolerate the U.S. hostile policy but decisively foil it."

It is titled \"Why does the U.S. dare not conduct armed invasion of north Korea?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The article accused the U.S. of employing all sorts of means to put countries desirous of independence under its rule as it invaded such countries as Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Washington dares not invade the DPRK, it said and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reason can be explained above all by the fact that President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il ushered in a new era of national independence and provided a firm foundation guaranteeing the country's prosperity and happiness of the generations to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have fully displayed the might of the powerful revolutionary army under the leadership of the preceding leaders and are now growing to be a powerful army having all-mighty Juche-oriented tactics and experience of all victories and the Korean-style offensive and defensive means capable of successfully fighting any modern war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Juche Korea has a hundred-year-long glorious history and the future of the DPRK is in safe hands as the heroic Korean People's Army has an ever-victorious history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another reason why the U.S. dares not provoke the DPRK is that the latter is a society in which the service personnel and people are single-mindedly united around their leader, the article concluded."

            "content": "CDN de RPDC declara posicion en cuanto a politica hostil de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 15 de marzo (ACNC) -- En relacion con que en estos dias, la politica hostil y las acciones de Estados Unidos contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea se  tornan peligrosas hasta no mas, el Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC hizo publica el dia 14 una declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento revela que EE.UU. es precisamente el que ha venido pisoteando atrevidamente la soberania de la RPDC considerada como su vida, y el enemigo jurado que actua absurdamente para destruir la idea y el regimen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn reflejo de la unanime voluntad del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, el Estado, el ejercito y el pueblo, el CDN de la RPDC expuso al interior y al exterior la siguiente posicion de principios:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Antes de tardar por mas tiempo, EE.UU. debera tomar la decision politica de abandonar su politica hostil anti-RPDC y todas las medidas concernientes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. es la mas brutal encaminada a destruir la idea y el regimen de la RPDC con la democracia al estilo norteamericano y la economia de mercado y ocupar con las fuerzas militares agresivas toda la nacion coreana y todo el territorio de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de afrontarse con las consecuencias catastroficas que se emanen su anacronica politica hostil anti-RPDC, seria mejor que abandone por si mismo todas las medidas injustas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. EE.UU. no debe portarse neciamente chismeando atrevidamente que la \"renuncia primero de armas nucleares\" es el \"principio fundamental\" de la politica hostil anti-RPDC al tener un correcto criterio y posicion en cuanto al disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe saber correctamente que el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC no es el medio de negocios y regateo a usarse para el dialogo y el mejoramiento de relaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas no es el medio fantasmal que desaparece si el imperio no lo \"reconoce\" y existe si lo \"reconoce\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio estadounidense recurre a la llamada \"estrategia de paciencia\" deseando que la RPDC se mueva primero y cambie algo, pero tal resultado nunca le tocara a ese pais norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, la RPDC tiene la posicion de esperar con paciencia hasta que entre en la Casa Blanca el dueno que tenga una normal vision y reflexion realistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio debe tener presente que mientras siga aferrandose a la amenaza y el chantaje nuclear, los uniformados y civiles de la RPDC lucharan de continuo por intensificar el disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo y tomaran sucesivamente las medidas adicionales para demostrar su poderio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. EE.UU. debera poner de inmediato fin a la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC, iniciada como una parte de nueva politica hostil a esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe dice que sobre DDHH hay el poder estatal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, tambien EE.UU. rechaza sin titubeo a las fuerzas que se oponen al Estado y dan peligro a su existencia y tiene mayor numero de encarcelados en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTampoco hacemos caridad ni tolerancia a las minimas fuerzas malsanas que atentan la ideologia y el regimen, optados por si mismo por el pueblo, dueno del poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seria mejor para EE.UU. limpiar primero su nariz antes de censurar a otros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbandonar cuanto antes su vieja politica hostil anti-RPDC y establecer la nueva politica real sera util no solo para intereses nacionales de EE.UU. sino que tambien para la seguridad de su territorio propio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio norteamericano debe apreciar serenamente la realidad y tomar la decision politica adecuada a la situacion general."
