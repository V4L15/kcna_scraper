Paektu on February 16, Juche 31 (1942) during the warfare against the Japanese imperialists, he grew up among guerrillas  and experienced the importance of guns more keenly than anybody else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the military parade at the opening ceremony of Pyongyang Institute in February 1946 and the military parade of the Korean People's Army (KPA) in February 1948 after national liberation, he firmly resolved to strengthen the army into an invincible one so that no formidable enemy could invade Korea again.\r\n In order to guarantee the final victory of the Korean revolution by dint of arms, he gave field guidance to the Guard Seoul 105 Tank Division named after Ryu Kyong Su of the KPA on August 25, 1960, which marked the start of his Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From then on he has been putting his heart and soul into strengthening the KPA to be matchless revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu, inspecting one unit after another.\r\n He has successfully applied President Kim Il Sung's idea and line on attaching importance to the military affairs in his Songun politics to powerfully push forward with the socialist cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last ten-odd years in particular, he has further cemented the military position and the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks with the KPA as the core and as the driving force and shattered the enemy's persistent moves to isolate and stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distance covered by him for the inspection tour of KPA units in the year of 1996 alone to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation totaled over 10,000 kilometers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His inspection tour of Songun has served as a powerful driving force in increasing the combat capability of the KPA in every way and making the whole society replete with the revolutionary soldier spirit, inspiring the people and the army to build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, under the leadership of the brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu, will glorify the ever-victorious history, the history of Songun without the slightest vacillation in any trial and adversity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
