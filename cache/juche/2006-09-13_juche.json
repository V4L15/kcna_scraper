And the present situation is turning very unfavorable to the Bush administration and the Republican Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public at home and abroad is becoming increasingly critical of the Bush administration's foreign policy and there is a growing pressure on it to stop the war and on the responsible politicians to resign. Such social atmosphere has led to a drastic drop in the support rate for the president and the administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that if this trend is left to go on, the administration and the Republican Party will suffer a crushing defeat in the upcoming off-year election. Top brasses of the Bush administration, much upset by this, are trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the people with such words as \"fascism\".

This socialism has won one victory after another despite unprecedentedly hard and complicated trials because it is strictly based on collectivism. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The advantages of Korean-style socialism based on collectivism lie in that the headquarters of the revolution, the Workers' Party of Korea, the army and people form an integral whole and all fields are making steady progress thanks to such motive force as the creative energies of the whole army and all the people united on the basis of true comradeship. One of the great advantages of Korean-style socialism based on collectivism lies in that all people enjoy a worthy and happy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Individual interests tally with those of the collective in a socialist society and individual interests are reflected in the interests of the collective. Under socialism not only the interests of the collective but individual interests are respected and utmost care is shown for all people. This is one of the important advantages of socialism in which the principle of collectivism is strictly observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people are fully enjoying an independent and creative life in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warm and deep care of the Party and the leader reach everywhere in the country and all people help and lead each other along like a big harmonious socialist family. This is the cradle where everyone can bring his hope and talent into full bloom. Ordinary working people and their sons and daughters are becoming heroes, intellectuals glorifying the honor of the country in the international arena and officials commanding the revolution under the care of the Party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The period of the \"Arduous March\" provided the people with an opportunity to keenly realize what great benefits they received from the state in the past. Even in this difficult period, the Party and the state invariably enforced free education and free medical service for the people and made utmost efforts to provide them with stable living conditions. The standard of people's living is improving as the days go by as the building of a great prosperous powerful nation makes progress under the Songun leadership of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no future under capitalism based on individualism but the prospect of Korean-style socialism is very bright.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
