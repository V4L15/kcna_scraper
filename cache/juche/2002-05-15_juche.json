It serves as a great banner redoubling the people's politico-ideological awareness and indomitable spirit to fight for the country and the nation going through thick and thin. It is the basic spirit of the army-based policy that it is possible to defend the country and the nation, ensure peace and achieve reunification only when the army remains strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's Army today is demonstrating its might as a matchless army in terms of its ideological and moral readiness to defend the security of the nation at the cost of its lives and its combat capability to wipe out at a single blow those who try to infringe upon the dignity and the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This army-based policy also reflects the revolutionary stand and staunch anti-imperialist fighting spirit of those who brave death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of giving priority to the army represents a firm spirit of attack to protect the dignity and pride of the country under any circumstances and it is based on the death-defying revolutionary stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the vitality of the army-based policy aimed to guarantee the peace of the country and the security of the nation represents the might of the steellike single-hearted unity of the DPRK, the article concludes that the inexhaustible strength of the DPRK emanates from the strong single-hearted unity of the whole society.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
