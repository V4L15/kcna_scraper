            "content": "Bush's violation of international law accused \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The jurists Association of the DPRK issued an indictment on March 16 informing the progressives and conscientious lawyers of the world against the Bush administration, a group of criminals disturbing the world peace and security in violation of the international law.\r\n The indictment said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the United States is resorting to high-handed and arbitrary practices everywhere in the world in pursuit of hegemony. This is not only contradictory to the aspiration and desire of humankind to establish an international order of peace, progress, reconciliation and cooperation but also a criminal act of wantonly violating the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is gravely breaching the principles of respect for state sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs, the principles recognized as the supreme principles governing the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the onset of its coming to power, the Bush administration has openly interfered in internal affairs of other countries, placing its partisan and individual interests above the international law under the pretext of the \"top priority to national interests.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is listing those countries that go against the grain with it as members of \"axis of evil\". This is an expression of the most blatant violation of the dignity of sovereign states and interference in their internal affairs in the history of international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. issued a \"report on human rights situation,\" \"report on religious issue\" and the like every year in a persistent bid to invent pretexts and secure levers to interfere in internal affairs of other countries and undermine the systems chosen by the peoples of these countries. \r\n The U.S. criminal acts of trampling underfoot the sovereignty of other countries and interfering in their internal affairs find a vivid expression in the fact that it is applying economic sanctions against other countries while hurling mud at their policies by invoking its domestic laws as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is wantonly violating the principle of territorial integrity and the principle of banning threat by force of arms and use of armed forces, the cornerstone of international peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless war policy of the bush administration reduced Afghanistan to ashes and left many civilians dead and wounded, bringing dark clouds of war to Central Asia, Middle East, Southeast Asia, Northeast Asia and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After proclaiming this year as a \"year of war\" the Bush administration intends to increase the military spending to the biggest in 20 years. Worse still, it is recently floating even a new nuclear war doctrine designed to mount nuclear attacks on non-nuclear states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not only wantonly violating the international law but unhesitatingly encouraging such former war criminals as Japan to repeat their crimes following the U.S. strategy for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is grossly violating the principle of respect for international commitments and duties on which international relations are based. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration unilaterally withdrew from the 1972 ABM treaty, refused to implement the \"Kyoto protocol\" and adopt a protocol on the convention on biological weapons and violated the Geneva convention on treating Afghan pows, defying the unanimous protest of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are too many examples to cite to prove those practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's criminal acts are more clearly manifested in its relations with the DPRK in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become so rash as to malignantly vilify the Korean-style socialist system chosen by the Korean people themselves in breach of the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework adopted by its preceding administration with the DPRK on the basis of mutual respect for sovereignty. This is a wanton violation of the principle of respect for sovereignty and non-interference in internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The jurists association of the DPRK expressed the expectation that all judicial organizations and lawyers of the world would merge their voices with the just voices of the world public denouncing the U.S. criminal acts.    \r\n\r\n"

So there is no doubt that it is watching for a chance to provoke a war against the DPRK, While staging war exercises in the area close to the military demarcation line with huge aggressor forces involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become clear why the U.S. imperialist bosses are vociferous about the \"reduction of conventional weapons\" and \"withdrawal of armed forces from the front.\"       Also clear is the aim sought by them in blustering that they would not rule out even a \"nuclear attack\", groundlessly picking a quarrel with the DPRK and singling out it as a member of the \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not remain a passive onlooker to the war moves of the U.S. imperialists to establish world domination at the expense of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop the reckless sabre-rattling, aware that it is the firm will and faith of the single-heatedly united people's army and people of Korea that there can be no earth without Korea. If aggressors provoke a war at any cost defying the DPRK's warning, the DPRK will mercilessly wipe them out with deep-seated enmity and hatred against them and achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean warmongers are well advised to behave with decorum, aware that their treachery will only invite miserable destruction.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a revolutionary and resolute assertion to protect the Korean-style socialist system and the supreme interests of the country.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration totally denied the political system of the DPRK to undermine the foundations for the DPRK-U.S. dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush called for the change of power, vilifying the political system of the DPRK. This means the U.S. is not ready to recognize the DPRK. It reveals, in the final analysis, his intention to overthrow and destroy the socialist system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though a great deal is said about the \"unconditional dialogue regardless of time and venue\" by the Bush administration, it is, in essence, a pressure put upon the DPRK to abandon its political system and arms. Its assertion is unacceptable and unpardonable brigandish logic and a deception and mockery of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's call for dialogue cannot be construed otherwise than a declaration of war designed to stifle the political system, the lifeline of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before calling for dialogue with the DPRK, the Bush administration should make an apology for its listing of the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil\" and call for the change of the political system and own fell responsibility for the consequences of its unpardonable crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will make every possible effort for the preservation of peace on the Korean Peninsula, but has no intention to allow its dignity and sovereignty being violated for the sake of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will not give up their principle and step back, panicked by pressure and war moves of someone. It is the quality of the army and people of the DPRK to lay down their lives without hesitation in the defense of the supreme interests of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to act with discretion, mindful that its moves to stifle the political system and idea of the DPRK will lead to self-destruction.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. condemned for interfering in DPRK's internal affairs\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists and their stooges are these days seeking to use the reunion of U.S.-resident Koreans with their families and relatives in the DPRK as a lever of pressure intended to isolate and stifle it. In this regard, the Korean committee for aiding overseas Koreans released a statement today.\r\n According to it, the U.S. House of Representatives has already adopted a \"resolution\" \"urging\" an official discussion of the reunion issue at the DPRK-U.S. inter-governmental negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the senate is working hard to fabricate even a more \"specific and binding legislation\" on this issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. let some reactionary organizations of Koreans in the U.S., including the \"world headquarters of the Koreans' movement for helping each other\", spread rumours that a DPRK official visited the U.S. in secrecy to discuss the issue related to the reunion of separated families and that U.S.-resident Koreans were allowed to visit the DPRK from early this year to meet with their families and relatives on a regular basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also building up public opinion that the U.S. government's intervention is needed for the settlement of this issue as it is a matter related to the interests of U.S. citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that thanks to the all-embracing, benevolent politics of the Workers' Party of Korea, many Korean residents in the U.S. have visited the DPRK without any restrictions from long ago to reunite with their families and relatives, the statement notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. ruling quarters and their stooges are now working hard to build up a world public opinion over this matter. This is to isolate and stifle the DPRK by painting it as such a political matter as a human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, this matter surfaced becausee of the U.S. imperialists who occupied one half of Korea, dividing its nation into two, and provoked the aggression war.     Therefore, the U.S. should have already owned due responsibility for this issue and apologized for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past years the U.S., however, has committed such inhumane deeds as persecuting in various ways U.S. resident-Koreans for their visits to their homeland to reunite with their parents, brothers or sisters and relatives who have lived separated from them for many years, thus stirring up anger of world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK visit by overseas Koreans with foreign citizenship is a matter entirely pertaining to the DPRK's sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not interfere in other country's internal affairs, but properly mind its own business such as serious human rights situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, which values the national dignity, will never allow the U.S. imperialists to interfere in its internal affairs and encroach upon its sovereignty over the above-said issue, but resolutely react to their moves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea joint military exercises\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK today issued a statement denouncing the United States and the South Korean warmongers for their projected joint military maneuvers.\r\n The statement reads in full: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-South Korea \"combined forces command\" recently announced that large-scale joint military maneuvers, a combination of \"reception, staging, onward movement and integration\" (rsoi) and \"foal eagle\", would be staged across South Korea from March 21 to 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To be involved in the exercises slated to take place under the simulated conditions of a war are tens of thousands of U.S. forces present in South Korea, forces from the U.S. mainland and its bases in Japan, Guam and other areas and the bulk of the South Korean armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the U.S. is going to stage the largest-ever joint military exercises surpassing the ill-famed \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercise in scale with the whole area of South Korea as an operational theatre at a time when a scenario for nuclear attack in which the DPRK is made the target of nuclear assault is floated in the U.S. these days after bush proclaimed this year as a \"year of war\" and listed the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil\" and whipped up war hysteria on the forefront and at U.S. bases during his recent visit to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military exercises to be staged by the Bush administration are all-round war exercises aimed to put the \"plan for preemptive strikes\" at the north into practice and very dangerous war gambles to seize the chance to provoke a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration's hard-line and hostile policy toward the DPRK has thus turned into a policy of war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the situation on the Korean Peninsula has now gone beyond the limits of danger and turned into a touch-and-go situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts go to clearly prove that \"resumption of dialogue\" much touted by the Bush administration is nothing but a deceptive trick to cover up their sinister war plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean bellicose forces joining the U.S. in the war exercises targeted against fellow countrymen is an hostile act diametrically running counter to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in which the north and the south committed themselves to reconciliation and unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can predict how adversely these war maneuvers will affect the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to properly understand who is its opponent and behave with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK neither wants war nor avoids it but has a will and strength to mercilessly strike and wipe out any aggressors no matter where they are coming from. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and people of Korea keep themselves fully ready to cope with the prevailing serious situation. If the enemy ignites a war of aggression against the DPRK in the end, it will wipe out the aggressors to the last one and achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
