His strong remarks cannot be overlooked because they were urged by the U.S. Intention to draw public opinion to the \"missile issue\" of the DPRK, tarnish its high international Prestige and justify the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To develop, test and launch a satellite or missile is an issue which belongs wholly to the sovereignty of the DPRK, and no one can poke his nose into it.\r\n   This is why the DPRK has clarified that anyone has no right to bargain about its policy on missile.\r\n   Not content with its smear campaign over the DPRK's policy on missile, the United States has gone the length of crying out for \"countermeasure.\" This is an ample proof that the U.S. is recklessly trying to stifle the DPRK with \"strength.\"\r\n   As a matter of fact, the U.S. has no face to find faults with the DPRK's policy on missile.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is none other than the U.S. That has posed threats to the DPRK and other countries with a large number of ballistic missiles and inter-continental ballistic missiles deployed.\r\n   No one can predict when the U.S. missiles targeted at the DPRK will be launched.\r\n   This is enough to guess how dangerous the U.S. \"countermeasure\" will be.\r\n   It is the indomitable will of the Korean people and People's Army to answer \"countermeasure\" with a counteraction.\r\n   The United States would be well advised to give up its foolish design to attain its sinister purpose by finding faults with the DPRK. \r\n \r\n"

It also made public a statement laying bare the truth behind the incident.\r\n   Upset by this, the South Korean authorities spread rumors that radio Pyongyang in a report on Jan. 24 admitted that a diplomat of the DPRK was not kidnapped but \"defected\" of his own accord.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an intrigue of the authorities.\r\n   The DPRK mass media have never carried such a report nor can do so.   \r\n   By inventing such a report the South Korean authorities thus added another crime to the crimes they had already committed.\r\n   Facts more clearly show that the South Korean authorities have been driven into predicament as the inter-Korean relations have worsened and as they are denounced by the international community as a herd of kidnappers and terrorists after the kidnapping of the DPRK's diplomat they committed hand in glove with the United States.\r\n   The authorities are resorting to such a clumsy plot in an attempt to extricate themselves from their poor plight and find a way out, but they can never flee from the responsibility for their crime in any case.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We strongly demand again that the South Korean authorities, the kidnappers, and the United States, an accomplice, make an apology for their crimes and reinstate the DPRK's diplomat unconditionally.\r\n   If they neglect our warnings, they will face a thousand-fold punishment and retaliation.\r\n   The South Korean authorities and the U.S. should act with discretion, clearly seeing the trend of the times. \r\n\r\n"

He noted the United States and Russia should reduce nuclear weapons considerably and quickly  for convincing the world of their efforts for nuclear arms reduction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His call is somewhat belated, and it refers to the Start-2 with Russia.  As  it reflects an important and realistic demand for reduction of nuclear weapons, it is praiseworthy.\r\n   The building of a Peaceful World Free of Nuclear Weapons is a unanimous aspiration of mankind, as well as an urgent demand of the times.\r\n   The United States has constantly pursued the policy of monopolizing nuclear arms and missiles. Worse still, it is guaranteeing a nuclear umbrella for a specific region, that is, South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the fact, the United States let no chance pass by without crying over the \"proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles,\"  acting as if it were a \"judge.\"  it is persistently raising a hue and cry over non-existent \"suspected underground nuclear facility in North Korea\" and \"missile threat.\"\r\n   That fully proves that the U.S. \"policy of non-proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles\" which it advertises as its \"moral obligation\" and \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" in the DPRK are, in the final analysis, a trick to conceal its true colors as a source of proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles.\r\n   It is only too natural that some time ago Xinhua described the U.S. demand FBR \"inspection\" of the DPRK's underground facility and its slander on the DPRK's launch of an artificial satellite as  \"unjustifiable and silly,\" and said it seems as if the United States were the only one country which can launch rocket or missile in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Everyone has the option of development, launch and test of rocket and missile.\r\n   The DPRK is always exposed to the U.S. nuclear and missile threat.  So, the option is a matter concerning our sovereignty about which nobody can say this or that.\r\n   The U.S. ambitious policy of nuclear arms and missiles will only result in encouraging other nations to proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles, not disarmament.\r\n   The United States should dismantle its nuclear arsenal and completely do away with weapons of mass destruction instead of crying for deceptive \"non-proliferation of nuclear arms and missiles.\"\r\n\r\n"

No one can deny that this Conforms with the nation's common interests and unity and is part of the reunification movement of nongovernmental organisations.\r\n   The South Korean authorities outwardly say they support the nongovernmental cooperation between the Hyundai and Daewoo business groups and the north on the principle of \"separation of politics from the economy.\" in fact, however, they slander every project and put a brake on its progress and activation. For example, the tour of Mt. Kumgang met with difficulties from the beginning and is going through turns and twists. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee put into effect the tour of Mt. Kumgang as a compatriotic measure on the principle of great national unity for national reunification, valuing the initiative of Jong Ju Yong, Honorary Chairman of the Hyundai Business Group of South Korea. To our regret, the process of the tour is far from satisfying the nation's expectation and there still remain obstacles that make its prospects unpredictable. \r\nIn this regard, the South Korean authorities are groundlessly alleging that the earnings from the tourism are used for a \"military purpose\" and persistently insisting on \"specification of the period of the right to the tourism.\"\r\nTheir allegation, needless to say, stems from their sense of confrontation and antagonism against the north. It clearly indicates that they disliked the proposal for the tourism and its beginning and that they are trying hard to hamper it.\r\n   We state once again that their allegations an insult to the magnanimity and good intention of the north, which has allowed the tourism, though the Mt. Kumgang area belongs to the north's military jurisdiction, and is also an unpardonable crime laying an obstacle to the country's reunification  long desired by the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   It is obvious that any progress cannot be expected from the tourism, with the South Korean authorities, motivated by an ulterior purpose, poking their nose into non-governmental cooperation and hindering it.\r\n   Kang In Dok's talk about \"support\" to the reunification movement of non-governmental organisations cannot be construed otherwise than a shameless hypocrisy.\r\n   That proves that the South Korean \"Ministry of National Unification\" does not work for national reunification, but obstructs it and makes it a thing of the distant future.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should stop obstructions, mindful that in case the tour of Mt. Kumgang and other projects of non-governmental cooperation are suspended, they will be held responsible entirely for the suspension.   \r\n\r\n"

Korea's \"ANSP\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland made public a statement today in connection with the fact that the South Korean rulers are more undisguisedly intensifying intelligence and smear campaigns against the north after promoting the anti-reunification plot-breeding \"Agency for National Security Planning\" (ANSP) to the \"National Intelligence Service\" (NIS) on January 22. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   This is one more criminal anti-north, anti-reunification trick to worsen the inter-Korean relations and lay graver obstacles to reunification with anti-north plots, the statement said, and continued:\r\n   The South Korean authorities' renaming of the \"ANSP\" as \"NIS\" is nothing but a foolish artifice to appease public opinion at home and abroad calling for its dissolution and to cover up the true colors of their tip-off politics and anti-reunification moves.\r\n   With the renaming of the \"ANSP,\" however, they cannot conceal its fascist nature and intelligence activities against the north nor evade strong protest and criticism from people at home and abroad calling for its dissolution. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   All facts show that the present South Korean regime changed only its signboard into a \"Government for People\" as The \"ANSP\" did and has nothing different from the successive fascist regimes which won infamy for political surveillance, intelligence and plot-breeding activities.\r\n   The South Korean rulers must completely disband the \"ANSP\" instead of changing its signboard into \"NIS\" and put an immediate end to the anti-north confrontation moves of worsening inter-Korean relations and gravely threatening the peace of the country and its peaceful reunification.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
