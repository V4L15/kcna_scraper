            "content": "Kim Jong Il inspects fish farm \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il visited a fish farm newly built by KPA unit no. 583 on Sunday.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was accompanied by member of the DPRK National Defence Commission Yon Hyong Muk, secretary of the WPK Central Committee Kim Ki Nam, KPA generals Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee Pak Song Bong, Jang Song Thaek and Choe Chun Hwang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unit's soldiers had built a large fish farm by reclaiming some tideland on the west coast that had been neglected for a long time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They demonstrated the might of the revolutionary soldier spirit again by successfully finishing the vast project with their own efforts in 40 days though the project included disposal of 150,000 cubic metres of earth, construction of some 10 kilometers of dykes and laying of about 5,000 metres of water channels. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He looked round the fish farm and fish ponds built on the quiet tideland in place of reed marsh as a symbol of the great spirit of creation and change in the building of a powerful nation and learned about how the fish farm had been built and how fish culture was done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Looking at the neatly built fish farm, he expressed great satisfaction and thanked soldiers for having turned a barren field into a useful area in the revolutionary soldier spirit and successfully finished the vast nature-harnessing project in a little more than a month though it would usually have taken some years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that thanks to the devoted efforts of soldiers, another modern fish farm has taken place on the west coast in a short span of time. This miraculous success can be made only by the heroic Korean People's Army, which removes a mountain and fills in the sea once instructed by the party, he added, highly appreciating their feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After inspecting the fish farm, he put forward important tasks to further develop the nation's fish culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted that these years witnessed the appearance of more fish farms suited to topographical conditions in different parts of the country and unprecedented innovation in the production of fresh-water fishes by making most use of the fish farms. This shows the enthusiasm of the army and people of Korea who have risen up in hearty response to the party's call for activating fish culture through a mass movement, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said Korea has good prospects as it has very favorable geographical conditions for the culture of various kinds of fresh-water fishes and a firm material and technical foundation for radical development of fish culture has been laid. He called for putting great effort into fish culture continuously and effecting a fresh change in this work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to rapidly increase the production of fresh-water fishes, fishes should be grown wherever there is water through the combination of intensive method and natural feed method, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called for generalizing the experience of the unit's soldiers in building a modern fish farm of scores of hectares with local materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The most important thing in prospective development of fish culture is to enhance the level, he said, calling for intensifying scientific research into fish culture, introducing advanced methods and steadily increasing the production of fishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fish culture is an important undertaking to supply more quantities of fishes to the soldiers and the people, he noted, urging the officials to pay attention to this work at all times and keep organisation work with the trend of the development of fish culture. \r\n\r\n"

What they need now is field exercise and an excuse for unleashing war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They continuously talk about \"provocation by the north\" in a bid to conceal their bellicose nature and mislead world opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jo Song Thae called for building up elite forces fully ready to carry out combat tasks, saying that the north might make an overall provocation if it misjudges the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nothing but aggravation of inter-Korean confrontation can be expected from Jo Song Thae, a heinous warmonger and traitor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation will never pardon the bellicose element who incites antagonism and confrontation within the nation and seeks war, going against the desire of the nation and demand of the time. \r\n\r\n"

Such laws as the \"law on emergencies in surrounding areas\" called war law, law on \"Hinomaru and Kimigayo,\" \"law on wiretapping\" and \"emergency law\" aimed to fascistize the society and establish a war system are all to serve the purpose of overseas aggression. The move to elevate the status of the Defence Agency to the ministry is also part of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan, a war criminal and defeated country, is making desperate efforts to become an \"ordinary country.\" The promotion of the status of the Defence Agency to the ministry would make a breakthrough in becoming an \"ordinary country.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the Japanese reactionaries are escalating military exercises for overseas invasion in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this goes to prove that they are working round the clock to achieve at any cost the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere,\" which they failed to realize in the past. They are well advised to drop this daydream.  \r\n\r\n"
