            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan for Its Abduction of Koreans \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- Japan is talking much about the \"abduction\" by someone in a bid to mislead the international community with the second round of six-way talks at hand.\r\n Its loudmouthed \"abduction\" is a crafty trick pertaining to Japan to lay an artificial stumbling block in the way of the talks and cover up its true colors as the kingpin of abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past century Japan committed such an extra-large crime against humanity as abducting and forcibly drafting at least 8.4 million Koreans. It has not yet reflected on its past crimes. Of late it went to the lengths of abducting at least 20 DPRK citizens in the Korea-China border area to take them to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the \"fund for the relief of north Korean refugees\" which is to blame for the abduction is trying to justify its criminal abduction as a \"humanitarian aid\" as it has become a controversy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The allegation that the crime contrary to international law and the DPRK laws is \"humanitarian aid\" is a burglary logic that cannot go down with anyone and it cannot but be a target of denunciation by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is the fact that formal officials of the Japanese government are actively defending the crime of the fund by asserting that it is the duty of the government to protect the victims to the abduction and promote their safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While talking much about the already settled issue of the abduction year after year, Japan is keeping mum about its own abduction. This shows what an extent its moral vulgarity and shamelessness have gone to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is not in a position to slander the DPRK over the issue of abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has detained five persons who went to Japan for a hometown visit in violation of the promise made between the governments of the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt itself should be called into question as it is an abduction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's abduction is, in the final analysis, a government-sponsored one, which is a complete perfidy to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should ponder over the consequences entailed by the reckless abduction and send the DPRK citizens back at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The US ultra- neo-conservatives fabricated it after having a confab for more than 10 days in the wake of U.S. presidential envoy Kelly's Pyongyang visit in October 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The story is nothing but a poor burlesque orchestrated against this backdrop. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why the U.S. styling itself \"the world's only superpower\" has worked so desperately for years to paint the non-existent and unverifiable \"enriched uranium program\" as truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind it is an ulterior intention to make the international community believe it, scour the interior of the DPRK on the basis of legitimate mandate in a bid to disarm it just as the U.S. did in Iraq and justify its brigandish demand that Pyongyang scrap its nuclear program first at the upcoming six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a trite method of the Bush administration to fabricate false information and violate the sovereignty of independent states under that pretext. The U.S. can not exist without plot-breeding and conspiracy. It is clearly proved by the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that foreign news reports quoted the parties concerned as saying they have never transferred nuclear technology to the DPRK.\r\n According to the British Financial Times, the Pakistani president officially stated that Pakistan purchased missiles, not nuclear technology from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's self-reliant nuclear power industry and its nuclear deterrent force for self-defense were indigenously developed and perfected by scientists and technicians of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to change the purpose of its nuclear power industry based on graphite-moderated reactors and possess a nuclear deterrent force for self-defence with a firm determination because the U.S. nuclear threat increased as the days went by and the outbreak of a dangerous war of aggression became imminent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. smear campaign once again forced the army and the people of the DPRK to keenly realize what a just measure it took to build a nuclear deterrent force for self-defence by its own efforts.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
