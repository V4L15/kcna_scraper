It is an unpardonable act to crack down on the south Korean forces seeking reunification through alliance with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What intellectuals of south Korea did was nothing but their expression of high respect, reverence and admiration for the peerlessly great persons whom the whole nation looks up to and their manifestation of ardent desire for reunification. Their deeds, therefore, deserve praise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group unhesitatingly let loose a spate of outbursts that \"it is necessary to suppress the freedom of expression\", kicking up a whirlwind of brutal suppression.

South Koreans are trusting and following the DPRK as a fortress for defending the sovereignty and the future of a reunified country, revering the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu. Neither bayonet nor violence can suppress these feelings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities had better stop at once the unreasonable suppression of the freedom of thought in violation of public mindset and opt for rolling back their anachronistic policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen."
