Under these circumstances the revolutionary parties should unite the popular masses and call them to the struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the fulfilment of the task, we cannot but show special interests in the experiences of the DPRK in building socialism and its reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His work fully coincides with today's reality and we sympathize with his idea.    \r\n\r\n"

It was addressed by Jong Kwang Hun, permanent representative of the \"National People's Solidarity\", Kwon Yong Gil, representative of the Democratic Workers' Party, and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said the additional troop dispatch to Iraq means acting as a marionette of the U.S. conservative forces and it is a critical issue at which the destiny of the nation is staked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They gave vent to their indignation, saying: We can never approve the war which would kill our sons by spending our own money. They called on the people to hold higher the candle light of national independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to the people was released at the news conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that many countries oppose the war, it called for launching a struggle against troop dispatch as a nation-wide movement and a movement of the people themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A five-point plan of the people's action against troop dispatch including an all-people signature campaign, an all-people rally and a movement for urging the \"National Assembly\" to oppose it was made public at the news conference.    \r\n\r\n"

All the officers and men of the People's Army and the people should cherish deeper in their hearts the faith that the greatest worth and honor of life lie in devotedly defending the headquarters of revolution and the prosperity of the country and eternal happiness of generations to come are promised in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should become self-blasting fighters and human-bomb heroes who dedicate the whole course of struggle and life to defending the headquarters and lay down their lives without hesitation to safeguard leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An important part of socialist education at the present moment is to bring up all the officials and working people into true revolutionaries and patriots putting the interests of the society and collective above individual benefits and working heart and soul for the prosperity of the socialist homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the working people should be made to clearly understand that effecting constant innovations in the building of a powerful nation with their sincere efforts as befit the master of the country is to fully display the superiority and might of Korean-style socialism based on collectivism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important is that all the members of the Workers' Party of Korea and the working people should be made to have the moral view of socialist collectivism as their physical quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the members of society should regard it the happiest and worthiest life to live and struggle, helping and leading each other forward on the basis of revolutionary comradeship and sense of obligation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people, officers and men, officials and working people should further consolidate the relations of genuine comradeship, sharing sweets and bitters on the road of the Songun revolution under the leadership of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should deepen socialist education on the basis of correct methodology elucidated by Kim Jong Il while leading the ideological work of the Party for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the officials lead the people and become their faithful servants in the work for the prosperity of the country can the invincible might of Korean-style socialism be fully demonstrated and the spirit of socialist patriotism highly displayed by the masses.    \r\n\r\n"

It has persistently insisted on its brigandish assertion that the DPRK should scrap its nuclear program first, turning aside the latter's just proposal to solve it, and escalated its moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation proves that in order to defend the destiny of the nation from the U.S. war moves, it is necessary to build a strong self-defensive deterrent force, instead of calling for justice and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. has become more undisguised than ever before in its aggressive ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms under the pretext of the nuclear issue, it is the only powerful weapon to protect the destiny of the nation to build invincible military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy is aimed to contain the U.S. imperialist aggressors, not compatriots in the south, and to foil the U.S. war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for our Songun policy, a war would have broken out on this land many times and our compatriots already suffered from the scourge of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has advanced under the uplifted banner of independence without the slightest vacillation and the peace and security on the Korean peninsula have been firmly preserved despite the escalated moves of the U.S. imperialists and its allies to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. This is the shining result of the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upholding the Songun policy provides the only way of frustrating the foreign forces' moves for a war of aggression, saving the destiny of the nation and achieving the prosperity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. should express its will to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK and opt for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
