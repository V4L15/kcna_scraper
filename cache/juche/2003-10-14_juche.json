            "content": "U.S. Abuse of United Nations under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 13 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces the United States for getting more undisguised in its attempts to tighten sanctions and blockade against the DPRK and stifle it by force of arms through the United Nations.\r\n U.S. President Bush, addressing the UN General Assembly session some time ago, brought forward again \"the issues of nuclear development and missile diffusion\" by the DPRK and proposed drafting \"a new resolution for checking dealings in weapons of mass destruction\" and called upon all the UN member nations to support it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind it is a heinous intention of the U.S. to use the UN as a leverage of realizing its policy for stifling the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of a UN \"resolution\" on sanctions and blockade against the DPRK would be an open encroachment upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and, at the same time, a violation of norms of international law. The United Nations is not a tool for the U.S. military intervention and aggression and the UN member nations are not henchmen of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has resorted to high-handed and arbitrary practices, and, as it they were not enough, dares try to use the UN for a leverage of the attainment of its aggressive goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a criminal act that can never be tolerated for the U.S. to try to impose international sanctions and blockade on the DPRK under the pretext of \"checking the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In working to cook up a \"UN resolution\" designed to form an international encirclement ring around the DPRK, the U.S. seeks to abuse the name of the UN in a bid to legally and more zealously step up its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. The more desperate the U.S. tries to lay an international ring around the DPRK, the worse the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. will grow, and this will not be favorable to the U.S. itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already warned that it would regard sanctions and blockade against it as a war. The U.S. should not carry the developments into extremes but drop its foolish attempts to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves for Overseas Aggression Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ruling quarters are getting over-heated in the moves to establish the missile defense system, making much ado about \"missile threat\" from the DPRK in a bid to realize their ambition for military power and overseas expansion, Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just after forming the new cabinet the present chief executive of Japan instructed the director general of the Defense Agency to strengthen missile measures, which means to step up and complete the establishment of the missile defense system to prevent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has preserved and developed a military power not to threaten others but to defend itself. The DPRK's development, production and deployment of missiles are not contrary to the principle of self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains true to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration which promises to suspend missile launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government insists on the implementation of the declaration though Japan is aggravating the DPRK-Japan relations while shunning the liquidation of its past, a hardcore article of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves for military buildup and overseas expansion have gone to extremes and the threat of missile and reinvasion comes from Japan to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Closely following Japan's reckless moves, the army and people of Korea recognize that they should approach Japan with arms, not words.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses Reckless Row Kicked up by GNP\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The group of the Grand National Party of south Korea is busy with an anti-north campaign, clamouring for an investigation into the case of a social scientist in Germany who visited his hometown.\r\n As far as the scientist is concerned, he emigrated to Germany long ago, disillusioned with the military fascist dictatorial regime after being engaged in the struggle for democracy in south Korea. Yet, the group linked him to the north. Such act can be done only by those who are steeped in the fever of confrontation with the north to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If several visits paid by an overseas compatriot to the north of the divided country with feelings of kinship were in violation of the \"present law\" in south Korea, many overseas compatriots and all the political, social and media persons of south Korea &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nwho have visited the north should be charged with violating the law and punished as criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north can not but worry about all those who have visited the north, taking wide-range opportunities provided since the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless campaign staged by the group of the GNP every day bereft of reason is nothing but the last-ditch effort of the separatists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anti-reunification elements including Choe Pyong Ryol, representative of the party, are busy talking bloody nonsense that the overseas compatriot must be punished by the \"security law\" and he is a follower of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a product of a political strategy of the party to fare well in the \"general election\" slated for the next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party is now forsaken by the people as it groups pro-U.S. flunkeyists and traitors and anti-reunification elements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this reason they do not bother to launch all sorts of anti-north smear campaigns in a bid to discredit and contain other political forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such hostile remarks of the GNP are only harmful to the democratic development of the south Korean society and the improved inter-Korean relations as they are based on the self-righteous and fascist moves in the past period of military dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP's persistent anti-national reunification acts based on the dictatorial logic would deprive it of any future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
