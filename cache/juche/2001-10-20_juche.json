It is one of the dangerous military moves to realize the U.S. unchanged design for domination over the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. insists on the military confrontation with the DPRK, its army and people will take arms more tightly to decisively smash the aggressors' anti-DPRK moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not resort to such reckless move, properly understanding their will, but immediately rectify its policy towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

Only when the principle of independence is observed is it possible to achieve the genuine reunification, the desire of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation is optimistic about the prospect of the independent reunification and steadily advancing along this road chosen by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's leadership provides a firm guarantee for the successful accomplishment of the cause of independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, adhering to the idea and line of independent national reunification, ushered in a new historic era of independently achieving Korea's reunification by the Korean nation's efforts with his clairvoyant outstanding leadership, rare strategy, broad magnanimity and a great patriotic and courageous decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The entire nation under the leadership of Kim Jong Il will more vigorously step up its march for independent national reunification, holding fast to the three charters for national reunification and the five-point policy of the great national unity formulated and advanced by him.    \r\n\r\n"
