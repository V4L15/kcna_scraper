Underscoring the weighty significance of the drill in carrying out the party's military strategic policy, he instructed the KPA to frequently organize the similar drill in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that a powerful offensive means rock-firm defence, he said only when the KPA is capable of mounting a deadly attack, can it prevent the enemies from behaving flippantly in its eyes on the forefront.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the KPA should prepare all soldiers as a match-for-a hundred fighters capable of fighting actual battles by making their training more intensive just as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did in Mt. Paektu, and should keep itself highly alerted so that it may mercilessly wipe out the aggressors, should they dare make a preemptive attack on the inviolable land of the DPRK, and successfully carry forward the tradition of victory in the confrontation with the U.S."

            "content": "KCNA Slams Creation of Staff of US-S. Korea Combined Division\r\n Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The United States and the south Korean military set up the staff of the U.S.-south Korea combined division and put it into full operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The staff will reportedly perform special missions such as disabling the DPRK's nukes and missiles and carrying out \"special civil operations in the north\" in contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an extremely dangerous provocation as it is aimed at souring the atmosphere of dialogue now being created with much effort thanks to the positive proposals of the DPRK for defusing the danger of a nuclear war and de-escalating the tension on the Korean peninsula with a horror-ridden war atmosphere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the DPRK to defuse the danger of war, ease the tension and create a peaceful climate on the peninsula and thus bring about a great change in the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year the DPRK put forward a series of crucial proposals for achieving detente on the peninsula and opening up a broad avenue to independent reunification such as demanding a moratorium on the joint military exercises of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These proposals have drawn positive support and response from public at home and abroad as they reflect not only the requirements of the times for peace and stability in Korea still remaining  divided on the earth but all Koreans' desire for a free and peaceful life in a reunified country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that the U.S. created the war staff, the first of its kind in the world, and put it into operation after slapping \"additional sanctions\" against the DPRK from the outset of the year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said staff is like a unit for steering the moves for a new war on the peninsula and a political and military terrorist mechanism to bring down the inviolable political system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clear from the fact that the staff was created with the 2nd division of the U.S. forces, the main force of the U.S. troops in south Korea, as its backbone and all units of the division and a motorized brigade of the south Korean army are to rapidly operate under it and participate in a war in contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dangerous nature of the staff is also proved by its mission and operations to launch preemptive attacks on the DPRK, totally disable the DPRK's armed forces for self-defence including nuclear deterrence and carry out \"civil operations\" in it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mulling getting familiar and rounding off \"scenarios for eliminating nukes and WMDs from the north and carrying out civil operations\" through military drills such as the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle planned to stage together with the south Korean warmongers from early in March.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The large-scale joint war games ceaselessly staged in south Korea every year are the root cause of escalating tension on the Korean peninsula and bringing the danger of nuclear war to the Korean nation. But the U.S. moves to increase the function and role of the above-said war staff through saber-rattling are as dangerous an act as inviting disaster. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the creation of this war staff is a sinister scenario to hurl the south Korean army as cannon fodder for igniting a new war on the peninsula at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inclusion of officers of the south Korean army in the staff is nothing but sophism and a height of hypocrisy to mislead the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to ask what role the officers of the south Korean army can play in the staff as its military sovereignty is entirely in the hands of the U.S. Needles to say, the U.S. forces have real power in the staff. This once again proves that the south Korean army is no more than a bullet shield for the U.S. forces when a war is launched against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. inaugurated the staff on the occasion of the 65th anniversary of the \"mutual defence pact\", humiliating and traitorous war agreement it concluded by instigating the south Korean authorities. This is a vivid expression of the warmongers' scenario to keep south Korea under their permanent occupation and put the whole of Korea under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal disturbing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and an aggressor and a provoker."
