In April Juche 21 (1932) he founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army (KPRA) and declared a war against Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dealt a telling political and military blow to the brigandish Japanese imperialists by applying original guerrilla tactics without the backing of the state and the regular army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He instilled into the people the confidence in the victory of revolution and unshakable faith that when they fight against Japanese imperialism they are sure to win. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He wisely led the work to mobilize the whole nation to a final decisive battle against the Japanese imperialists while fighting many battles and making marches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An all-people resistance was thus fully prepared to positively greet a great event of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 9, Juche 34 (1945) he ordered all units of the KPRA to launch a final offensive operation for national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The operation for national liberation was participated in by units of the KPRA, people's armed groups, organizations of armed uprisers and broad sections of people across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists unconditionally surrendered in just a week after the start of the operation.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a dastardly attitude in view of international morality and ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the Japanese authorities refused to allow the entry into Japan of the DPRK delegation only. This is an expression of the undisguised hostile policy of Japan towards the DPRK and it can never remain indifferent to this attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unfriendly policy persistently pursued by the Japanese authorities towards the DPRK compels it to take a corresponding measure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
