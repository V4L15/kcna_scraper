He also sent all-purpose fishing boats having modern fishing equipment and tackles to make big fish hauls every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter and speakers referred to the achievements and experience gained in the practical efforts for upholding the intention of the supreme commander on injecting fresh vitality into sideline fishing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They stressed the need for officials in the field of fisheries and fishermen to work hard to bring about big hauls of fish next year, too, under the leadership of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An appeal to all the officials in the field of fisheries and fishermen of the army was adopted at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal ardently called on them to become pioneers and shock forces in materializing the far-reaching plan of the supreme commander for supplying large quantities of fish to all defence posts of the country and reenergizing the fishing industry of the country."
