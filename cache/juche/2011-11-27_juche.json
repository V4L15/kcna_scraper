Being told about this fact, Kim Jong Il recalled the President's devoted efforts for the development of the county.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the room devoted to the history of the county Kim Jong Il looked round with keen interest data on the successes gained by the county under the Party's guidance over the past years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He toured various parts of the county to acquaint himself with their modernization and fruit production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commanding a panoramic view of the vast orchard, he praised the party members and other working people of the county for having done a lot true to the WPK's policy of pomiculture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Going round the Pomicultural Institute, he learned about the researches into fruit culture and indicated the tasks and ways to be carried out by the institute.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He acquainted himself with the culture of a new kind of willow which grows fast, greatly helping produce fruit containers including baskets and solve the problem of firewood for the people in the county.
