            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM on U.S. Intention to Stop LWR Construction \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the reported U.S. intention to stop the construction of light water reactors and formally declare it:\r\n The Bush administration is reportedly contemplating putting the KEDO in motion to decide to stop the LWR construction and formally declare it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this is true, it would mean that the U.S. would stop the construction of LWRs in the wake of its suspension of the supply of heavy fuel oil and thus unilaterally and finally scrap the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing surprising to the DPRK as it had already expected it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why Washington is so getting on the nerves of the DPRK at a time when the resumption of the six-party talks is high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels the DPRK to doubt whether the U.S. would come out to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK in case the six-way talks are resumed in the future. This makes it hard for the DPRK to understand the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation clearly shows us what we should do to cope with the U.S. pressurizing position. It also provides the DPRK with a reason strong enough to take the most appropriate measure when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has so far suffered huge political and economic losses due to the U.S. noncompliance with the agreement on the provision of the LWRs. Tremendous is the adverse impact it had on the development of the DPRK's national economy as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and KEDO are obliged to make full compensations to the DPRK under relevant articles of the LWR agreement as Washington has caused such huge losses to the DPRK by refusing to fulfil its commitments under the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will hold them accountable for this to the last. It will never allow them to take out all the equipment, facilities, materials and technical documents now in Kumho area for the LWR construction till this issue is settled.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

It is a declaration of justice based on the firm belief in its powerful military power built up with the Songun politics and victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people extend full support and solidarity to the heroic Korean people in their struggle to defend peace and achieve the country's reunification under the great banner of the Songun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This system is a Juche-oriented method of managing the economic life of the country for all the local districts to manage their economic lives by themselves under the unitary guidance of the state and develop the economy and more effectively provide the people with an independent and creative life by calling internal reserves into maximum service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past 30 years the local budget system has made great contributions to running the local economy assiduously, raising the standard of people's living and accelerating socialist construction by correctly implementing the state budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has developed in depth the idea and theory of the local budget system set forth by the President and completed it into a method of managing local economic life to meet the demand of the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A national meeting was held here on Nov. 5 to commemorate the anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mun Il Bong, minister of Finance, in his report said it was the demonstration of the validity and vitality of the policy of the local budget system that the economic life of the country has been successfully managed and the popular polices have been invariably put into practice even in the periods of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march, in which the DPRK underwent grim ordeals caused by the imperialists' persistent moves to isolate and stifle it and successive natural disasters for several years, and in the present times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He said it would not be tolerated, charging Iran with the \"breach of international nuclear safeguards\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defence Secretary Rumsfeld alleged that Iran was building two nuclear power plants in secrecy and hiding and backing al-Qaeda members, so tough measures should be taken against the Iranian government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though Iran has decided to go ahead with its peaceful nuclear program in cooperation with the International Atomic Energy Agency, U.S. State Undersecretary Bolton even said recently that the final means for a solution to the Iranian issue would be a military action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the United States has tried in a planned way to destabilize the situation of Iran and disintegrate the country from within. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The French newspaper Figaro and other European media have said that after the Iraqi war, Washington had become all the more offensive against Iran and that the hawks of Washington had already worked out a plan to destabilize the Iranian government and encourage the Iranians to start a riot against the government, and were attempting to carry it out overtly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States' escalated anti-Iran campaign indicates that it intends to stifle one anti-imperialist independent nation after another, particularly \"members of the axis of evil\" it designated, and replace the Islamic system with one based on the American-style value in the Middle East. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilateral, high-handed practice, however, has touched off a strong protest in Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iranian Foreign Ministry voiced indignation at the United States seeking to isolate Iran and cause instability in society and vowed to defend the sovereignty of the country with the utmost resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iran, to cope with the U.S. policy, is cementing national unity, while expanding and developing political and economic relations with Russia, the European Union and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Khamenei, Iran's Islamic revolution leader, called for strengthening the unity of the Iranian people and dismissed the U.S. plan to topple the Iranian government under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" as foolish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia and other European countries, opposed to the U.S. unilateral policy towards the Middle East, are boosting cooperative ties with Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Russian president pledged to strengthen the Moscow-Tehran cooperation for Iran's peaceful nuclear program, while the top diplomats of France, the EU, Australia and other countries had talks with their Iranian counterpart and agreed to further develop bilateral ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Former German Chancellor Helmut Schmidt said the ultranationalist and unilateral thinking pattern of the Americans rendering the policy imperialist was more serious than that they pursued right after World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iran is pushing ahead with its nuclear energy program, unyielding to the U.S. hostile policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
