Korean authorities' pro-U.S. funkeyist behavior under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Council of Religionists on Saturday issued a statement denouncing the South Korean authorities' pro-U.S. flunkeyist behavior.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for religionists and people from all walks of life in South Korea to condemn the flunkeyist trip of the chief executive and express concern over the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-U.S. servile diplomacy brought great disappointment and displeasure to the people of all social strata desirous of protecting independence and peace through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n None of the successive South Korean regimes so undisguisedly joined the U.S. in its moves to stifle the north and impose disasters upon fellow countrymen as the present regime did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean council of religionists fully supports the South Korean people from all walks life in their struggle and bitterly denounces the authorities' submissive act, branding it as blatant challenge to the basic spirit of the June 15 Joint Declaration calling for defending the nation's safety and peace by our nation itself and an anti-national criminal act of paving the way for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the religionists in the northern half of Korea will positively defend the great Songun policy defending the nation's safety and peace and continue to wage a vigorous peace movement against the U.S. war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman expressed the expectation that the religionists and people from all walks life in South Korea who are concerned about the destiny of the nation and love peace would more valiantly struggle against the U.S. moves to ignite a war in Korea and the authorities' anti-national act of supporting them. \r\n\r\n"

After the emergence of the bush group, in particular, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK reached its zenith and this put the process of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula into the danger of collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the U.S. worked out and made public a \"scenario for nuclear attack\", adopting it as its policy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. is spreading misinformation that the DPRK has unilaterally backtracked from the declaration on the denuclearization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a mean behavior to shift the blame onto the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. false propaganda about \"North Korea's non-compliance with the declaration on denuclearization\" is aimed to pit the international community against the DPRK and increase international offensive to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has nothing to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should clearly see who its opponent is and stop playing a clumsy sleight of hand to flee from its responsibility for derailing the process of the denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA urges U.S. to admit its responsibility for nuclear crisis \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- The United States is recently spreading the rumor that the DPRK unilaterally derailed the north-south joint declaration on denuclearization.\r\n This is nothing but a foolish attempt of the U.S. to flee from its responsibility for the crisis caused by the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n KCNA issued a detailed report on May 12 to cite historical data scientifically explaining why the nuclear issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula and who is to blame for derailing the process of denuclearizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we have already clarified, it was the United States that spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and consistently obstructed the process of denuclearizing it, the process that had started thanks to the initiative and sincere efforts of the DPRK to settle the nuclear issue, and disrupted the process, in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is seeking to bedevil the relations between the north and the south and fish in troubled waters for a political purpose, shifting the blame for reducing the inter-Korean joint declaration on denuclearization to a dead document onto the DPRK. This only brings into bolder relief the shameless and crafty nature of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the DPRK stand toward the nuclear issue on the peninsula and its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. officially drops its political, military and economic hostile policy toward the DPRK intended to destroy its state and system and approaches negotiations with it from a fair and equal stand, it will take the U.S. touted \"security concern\" into full account. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, however, persistently insisting only on \"North Korea's dismantling of its nuclear weapons program before dialogue\", while talking about \"all options\" or \"further steps,\" paying lip-service to the \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue. This can never go down with the DPRK which regards independence as its life and soul as it is an insult and violation of international justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lesson drawn from the U.S. Iraqi war proved that it is necessary to boost the physical deterrent force to stand up against aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. styling itself the world's only superpower is describing the DPRK's self-defensive stand and steps as \"threat\" and \"blackmail\". This is a far-fetched assertion and a sinister trick which can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conception of absolute denuclearization on this planet is quite meaningless unless the U.S., the nuclear weapon state, proves its anti-nuclear policy by dismantling its nuclear weapons and abandoning its nuclear threat. This is the stark reality today created by the U.S. nuclear blackmail policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to humbly admit its responsibility for nuclear proliferation, advance a correct policy quite understandable to all the sovereign states before approaching the debate on the nuclear issue. It should drop its policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes as its first practical step.    \r\n\r\n"

They are \"the bill to cope with armed attack,\" \"the bill on revising the law on the 'self-defence forces'\" and \"the bill on revising the law on setting up the security council.\"\r\n As it is universally known, these bills are war laws and regulations similar to the \"state law on general mobilization\" during Japan's war of continental aggression in the past as they are wartime legislations aimed at mobilizing the human and material resources of the country in case of military emergency, that is, in case Japan goes to war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These three bills were passed as an extension of legislative activities to rearm Japan and escalate the SDF's overseas advance over the last ten years including the institution of the \"law on emergency surrounding Japan\" and the \"law on supporting measures against terrorism\". They provide a sure legal guarantee for Japan's emergence as a military power and overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing forces consider it as their vital demand to realize their ambition for overseas expansion by force of arms and the present Japanese government is adopting it as its policy and putting it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now involved in wars in different parts of the world under the pretext of \"supporting the anti-terrorism war\" and stepping up the SDF's overseas advance in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that these bills focus on Japan's mode of coping with the \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. \r\n After listing the DPRK as the first target of overseas aggression, Japan passed those bills by unprecedented majority vote in a bid to legalize its war actions. This is arousing the DPRK's great precaution and concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that Japan, obsessed with its ambition for militarization, is leveling guns at the DPRK, the latter is compelled to take strong steps to cope with it.    \r\n\r\n"

Timed to coincide with this, a spokesman for the U.S. administration, clarifying the U.S. stand toward the \"theory of preemptive attack on North Korea\" said that \"it is the long-standing policy of the U.S. not to take all options off the table including a military one\".

It is obstructing the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and escalating the military standoff between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula is, therefore, inching close to an extremely dangerous phase. \r\n The DPRK can not remain a mere onlooker to such disturbing developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK value the sovereignty and the dignity of the country more than anybody else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, they are left with no option but to take tougher military counteraction to cope with the U.S. hawks' invariable plan to mount a preemptive attack.
