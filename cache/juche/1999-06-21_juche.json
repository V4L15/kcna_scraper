However, the South Korean authorities were hit hard in the conflict. The U.S. has begun massively reinforcing their aggression forces in South Korea in the wake of the incident.   The U.S. introduced two ultra-modern nuclear-powered submarines into South Korea and sent the aircraft carrier \"Kitty Hawk\" to Japan under the pretext of \"coping with the tense  situation on the Korean peninsula.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Defense Department announced that aircraft carriers and many fighter planes have been placed on the alert to cope with the \"emergency\" in Korea.   These military actions of the U.S. have created a touch- and-go situation in the Korean peninsula.   This is arousing a deep concern among the  Korean people and the world peaceloving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is going to put the adventurous scenario of war against the north \"operation plan 5027-98\" into practice, taking advantage of the west sea incident.   The U.S., which egged the South Korean authorities on to attack the north first, is spreading a false rumour about the north's \"provocation\" in a bid to start a total war against it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the u.s. Is seriously mistaken.   The Korean peninsula is not the Balkans.   It is the unshakable faith and spirit of the Korean people and people's army to meet the aggressors' challenge with a thousand-fold deadly blow and answer a war of aggression with a just liberation war.   The U.S.  and their followers are well advised to clearly see who their opponent is  and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"

By this order the three services of the army have been placed on a \"round-the-clock stand-by.\"   Such reckless military actions are leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent conflict at the west sea was triggered by the South Korean authorities whose intention was to unleash a war against the north, provoking us first and then taking issue with the ensuing military counteractions by us. For this purpose, scores of their warships had intruded into our side's territorial waters for ten odd days and staged a \"bump-and-push operation,\" causing the conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These provocations were an open challenge and a prelude to the implementation of the U.S.'s \"operation plan 5027-98.\"   We displayed to the full our patience and self-restraint from the outset so as to prevent an armed conflict.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, battleships of the navy of the South Korean Army intentionally bumped against warships of the navy of the Korean People's Army and fired thousands of bullets and shells according to the prearranged scenario.     In face of these military provocations, we could not but take a self-defensive measure against such military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAs a result of the counterattack of the KPA naval ships, more than ten enemy battleships were  either burned or severely damaged, with heavy casualties.   Such being the case, the South Korean authorities  assert that it was the north side which provoked and started gunfire, in a bid to mislead public opinion at home and abroad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent armed conflict did not develop into a total war entirely thanks to our high patience and self-restraint.   We state once again clearly that anyone who encroaches upon our territory, even a blade of grass, will be mercilessly punished.\r\n   There is no limit nor mercy in our retaliation against the enemies. \r\n\r\n"

The seminar was an international meeting which was of great significance in advancing the socialist movement on a new basis, the letter said, and went on:   The Juche idea, founded by President Kim Il Sung, was comprehensively systematized and is being ceaselessly developed in depth in conformity with the demand of the developing revolution through your tirelessly energetic ideological and theoretical activities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world progressive people aspiring after socialism are now deeply respecting you as a defender of the socialist cause and leader of the socialist movement of our era.   Our faith and will to advance under the banner of the Juche idea is unshakable because we experienced bitter twists and turns in the socialist movement and drew a historic lesson from it.    We will resolutely struggle to defend socialism of Korea, the fortress of the socialist movement, and do our utmost to support the Korean people in their effort for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, the letter said. \r\n\r\n"

Korean war moves \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the central committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (GFTUK) released a statement on Sunday denouncing the South Korean authorities' war provocations which are getting more undisguised these days.   Recalling the recent reckless military provocations made by the South Korean rulers in the north side's territorial waters off the West Sea of Korea, the statement said:   This is an unpardonable treason to the nation and a grave challenge to the cherished desire of the entire fellow countrymen for peaceful reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While leading the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension, the South Korean rulers are further intensifying the fascist repression of pro-reunification patriotic forces, linking them with the north.   The facts show how desperately they are running to aggravate the political and military confrontation with the north in a bid to divert elsewhere the attention of the people standing against the \"government\" and tide over their ruling crisis.    The South Korean rulers must clearly know that if they persist in confrontation and war, going against the demand of the times and the nation for reconciliation, unity, detente and peace, they will be severely punished by history and the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Afterwards, the U.S. ruling quarters and brasshats attempted several times to use nuclear weapons, considering them to be almighty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the Korean War, the United States intended to change the war situation in its favour by using these weapons. It has stockpiled a bulk of nukes in South Korea, increasing the danger of nuclear war on the Korean peninsula.   The United States has no justification to interfere in others' matters, talking about \"nuclear problem\" and \"theft of nuclear secret.\"   The United States is well advised to stop slandering other countries  under absurd and brazen-faced pretexts and completely eliminate its nukes before others. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
