This is entirely ascribable to the might of national unity and cooperation based on the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration is a banner of national unity as it calls on all Koreans to achieve reconciliation and unity under the banner of national independence. Only when the Korean nation has the stand and attitude of national independence, can it achieve the reconciliation, unity and cooperation on the road of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration underscores the need to independently solve the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation responsible for the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration is a patriotic banner encouraging all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to actively turn out in the struggle to achieve the unity, enshrining the noble spirit of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration set forth the patriotic great proposition \"By our nation itself,\" stirring up the love for the country and the nation enshrined in the hearts of all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans are turning out in the movement for national reunification, greatly inspired by the spirit of patriotism enshrined in the above-said proposition.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today declares this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is the avowed basic idea of the foreign policy of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent policy of the DPRK is the most advantageous and mighty political mode as it meets the intrinsic demand of human beings and propels the independent development of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a country fails to make revolution and construction independently and enforce its foreign policy from an independent stand and principle, it will not be possible for the country and nation to prevent their sovereignty and interests from being violated nor is it possible for them to escape from the danger of being subject to the imperialists and dominationists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a country fails to maintain independence in politics but applies such \"remedies\" as \"democracy\", \"human rights\" and \"multi-party system\" much touted by the imperialists, it will not be able to escape a social and political confusion and inter-national and inter-tribal dispute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has independently decided on all the foreign policies in keeping with the interests of the Korean people and the requirements of the Korean revolution and handled all issues arising in the international relations according to its independent judgment and view and developed the friendly and cooperative ties with foreign countries on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference, equality and reciprocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy enforced by the Workers' Party of Korea is the most vivid manifestation of the independent policy to resolutely defend the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has fully exercised its sovereign rights without reading other's face and tolerating other's interference in its internal affairs and pressure on it even in the slightest degree thanks to the tremendous military capability built under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
