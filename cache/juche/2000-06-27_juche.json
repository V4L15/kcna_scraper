Moreover, he never lorded it over the popular masses nor considered himself to be a hero born of heaven bestowing 'grace' upon people.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"He always lived among people as he was a benevolent father who made the people live in a great harmonious family on the basis of one and the same idea, faith, sense of obligation and cause.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that he was the most steadfast communist in the present-day world, she pointed out that he united the people to bring in a powerful trend of the times and defeat vicious and ferocious imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Il Sung built the best society not only for the people in our times but for all people to live in this world in future and he is immortal with the flow of time, she concluded. \r\n\r\n"

After liberation the state built silk mills in the areas to steadily increase the silk production and fully satisfy the people's needs for silk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least 40 varieties of silk and over 1,200 expanded varieties of silk are produced in the DPRK at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Silk made in the DPRK is popular on world markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Brocade produced at the Nyongbyon silk mill won several gold medals at international commodities exhibitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yaksandan silk with azalea pattern and Kuryongdan silk with graceful pattern reminiscent of flowing river water are also popular abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the Nyongbyon and Pakchon silk mills on June 21 where he called upon the workers to bring about innovations in the production of silk liked by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said the mills should increase silk production to provide girls and boys who are going to get married and the old who are to celebrate their 60th and 70th birthdays with silk clothes and silk quilts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The daily production quotas are now being fulfilled at over 160 per cent thanks to the collective innovation drive of the workers there to implement tasks put forward by Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

He testified that the U.S. amassed all military supplies and weapons in the area along the 38th parallel to attack North Korea on the eve of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In an effort to cover up such a policy of aggression and undisguised invasion and shift the responsibility on to the DPRK the U.S. rigged up an illegal \"resolution\" at the UN Security Council meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Passage of the time cannot write off history. Nor can any distortion change it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent anti-DPRK diatribe of the U.S. chief executive cannot be construed otherwise than a provocation designed to chill on-going negotiations aimed at confidence building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. continues to do an act of increasing distrust, swimming against the trend of the present situation toward reconciliation and cooperation, it will only go to reveal with added clarity the true colors of the U.S. as a wrecker of global peace and stability. \r\n\r\n"
