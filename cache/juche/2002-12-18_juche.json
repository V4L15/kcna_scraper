This has made it possible to push ahead with the projects in real earnest.\r\n This is a shining fruition of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a landmark of national reunification, and a product of the desire of all the Koreans and efforts exerted by them to rejoin the ties of the nation and reunify the divided land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projects of reconnecting the east and west coastal rail and road links open a bright prospect of boosting the inter-Korean cooperation, exchange, reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the projects are completed, inter-Korean visits will become more frequent and the South Korean tourists who had to come to Mt. Kumgang only by ships will be able to travel overland. As a result, the number of tourists will sharply increase. This will also open a bright prospect of investing in the Kaesong Industrial Zone where the ground is expected to be broken soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean railway project is of great international significance as it will be linked to the trans-Siberian railroad in Russia in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The project of connecting Korea-Russia railways will be greatly conducive to boosting economic ties and cooperation not only between the DPRK and Russia but among countries in Northeast Asia and Europe and, furthermore, achieving peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world and the common prosperity of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the whole world is supporting and welcoming these gigantic railway projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is only the united states which is getting in the way of the projects. The U.S. has pursued only inter-Korean confrontation, not peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt attempted to derail the reconnection of north-south rail and road links, talking about a \"list of verification group\" and \"permit.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This put the once brisk mine-clearing project in the DMZ in stalemate for some time when it was at its final phase. But it was resumed and finally completed thanks to the inter-Korean cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south rail and road links will be reconnected without fail thanks to the concerted efforts of all the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n"

They will not allow the enemies to invade territorial waters, air and land of the DPRK but deal telling blows at them.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why this is intolerable.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary demanding the U.S. stop the anti-DPRK burlesque against the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the outset of their production, the films caused trouble because they are based on the theme intended to insult the Korean nation, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is locked in the noisy \"nuclear racket\" against the DPRK and depriving the people in South Korea of their sovereignty, dignity and right to existence. As if it were not enough with this, the U.S. is misusing even a movie, a product of human civilization, for the purpose of its policy of despising the Korean nation. It is not hard to guess what is the U.S. real intention. The U.S. seeks to bar the Koreans in the north and the south from getting united and perpetuate the division of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTo this end the U.S. produced and is showing such anti-reunification film against the Korean nation despite protest from all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is a dignified nation who values self-respect more than its life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop at once the anti-DPRK burlesque against the Koreans, clearly understanding the will of the Korean nation not to allow any act of infringing upon their dignity but to force the U.S. to pay a high price for it.    \r\n\r\n"

They have gone the length of saying that \"Japan may fight a war with North Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's joining the U.S. in the strategy to invade Korea and Asia is little short of digging its own grave by itself. \r\n If Japan dares violate the spirit of the declaration, dancing to the tune of the U.S., it will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n"
