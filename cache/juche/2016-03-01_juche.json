It called for resolving the issue of Korea independently and peacefully free from any foreign interference and building lasting peace-keeping mechanism in the Korean Peninsula, not temporary ceasefire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, systematically rendered the AA defunct and persistently shunned the DPRK's series of fair and aboveboard proposals to conclude a peace treaty for a definite end to the Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which holds wartime operation control over the south Korean army and manages the AA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces have allowed the conversion of south Korea into the biggest arsenal of nuclear weapons in the Far East as a shock brigade of the U.S. for a war for more than six decades and ceaselessly staged war exercises, big and small, against the DPRK under various codenames.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still now, they are talking about \"firm commitments\" to the U.S. over the DPRK's launch of the earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong-4. They have introduced U.S. F-22s and nuclear capable B-52s into south Korea, offering it as a theater of U.S. nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace will never settle in the Korean Peninsula as long as the south Korean puppet group is hell-bent on confrontation with the compatriots in the north as the shock brigade of the U.S. for carrying out its scenario for stifling the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces would be well advised to stop running riot, well aware that they are no more than slaves of the American master as they have not an iota of sovereignty."

The anti-Japanese struggle arose even in the overseas Koreans residential areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The March First Popular Uprising left a serious lesson that the struggle of the popular masses should be led by an outstanding leader if sovereignty of the nation and independence of the country are to be achieved and that people should fight the aggressors armed to the teeth with the armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though nearly a century passed since the popular uprising, outside forces persist in the criminal moves to invade Korea and the national sovereignty of the south Korean people is cruelly violated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial calls on all the fellow countrymen to hold fast to the three charters for national reunification and the north-south declarations associated with the noble lives of the peerlessly great men as programmes for reunification common to the nation and turn out in the drive for implementing them."
