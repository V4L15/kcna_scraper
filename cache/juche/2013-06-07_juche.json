It does not conceal the intention to \"internationalize\" all aspects of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is due to the \"internationalization\" campaign of the south Korean authorities that everything in south Korea including peculiar and resourceful tradition and beautiful manners and customs of the nation are eroded and its society has become Americanized and Japanized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with this, they are working hard to make such tragic reality unfold in the DPRK under the signboard of \"internationalization.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves for \"internationalizing\" the north-south relations are absolutely intolerable as it is an action to sell off the nation's dignity and sovereignty to outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, which regards the nation's dignity and sovereignty as its life and soul, will categorically reject the above-said moves.
