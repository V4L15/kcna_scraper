It is, therefore, nonsensical for the U.S. to take issue with their human rights this or that way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present U.S. administration, the present U.S. secretary of State, in particular, unlike the successive U.S. administrations, are officially pursuing a policy for bringing down the state and social system of the DPRK over the \"human rights issue\", thus reneging on the September 19, 2005 joint statement which calls upon the DPRK and the U.S. to \"respect each other's sovereignty and exist peacefully,\" the statement which laid a basic groundwork for denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has become totally meaningless for the DPRK under the situation where the U.S. is reneging on its commitment. It is self-evident that one party cannot discuss its unilateral disarming with the rival party keen to bring it down at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK keeps the door of dialogue on genuine human rights open to the countries that respect its sovereignty but it will never allow any human rights dialogue or nuclear one with the enemy keen to overthrow it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will witness the shining victory of the DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts before the expiry of the tenure of office of the present administration, not just the distant future."

            "content": "MINREX denuncia intencion de EE.UU. tendiente a derrocar RPDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 4 de noviembre (ACNC) -- En relacion con que Estados Unidos cuestiona a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea so pretexto de problema de derechos humanos, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio el dia 4 la siguiente respuesta a la ACNC:\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, el secretario del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos, el enviado especial encargado de las conversaciones a 6 bandas de esta cartera, y otras autoridades norteamericanas soltaron disparates politicos encaminados a manchar en lo politico y moral la imagen de la RPDC y justificar sus maniobras de asilamiento y aplastamiento contra esta acusandola de \"problema de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio yanqui se vale de anacronico metodo de inventar el \"problema de DDHH\" de los paises que no le agradan, fomentar su inestabilidad interna, division y desintegracion y realizar el derrumbe de regimenes mediante la \"revolucion de color\" o la \"transicion pacifica\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre el debate verdadero sobre los derechos humanos y el \"problema de DDHH\" como aparato politico tendente a fomentar la \"revolucion de color\" y otros hay diferencia como la noche y el dia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el pais que no reconoce la misma soberania estatal que sintetiza DDHH del pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ilogico que este pais lo cuestione. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA diferencia de los ejecutivos anteriores, la actual administracion norteamericana, en particular, el actual secretario de Estado persiguen oficialmente la politica de derrocar nuestro Estado y regimen con el \"problema de DDHH\" y rompen asi el compromiso de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre de 2005 en que la RPDC y EE.UU. acordaron \"respetar la soberania de la contraparte y coexistir pacificamente\", la cual devino la base fundamental de la Desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que EE.UU. abandona su compromiso, ya no valdra nada para nuestro pais la Desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. Claro esta que uno no puede debatir el desarme unilateral de si mismo con el enemigo que se obstina en derrocar su regimen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDejamos abiertas las puertas al verdadero dialogo sobre los DDHH con los paises que respetan nuestra soberania, pero no podemos permitir las platicas del mismo tema ni las conversaciones del problema nuclear con el enemigo que trata de derrocarnos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un futuro no lejano, ya antes de que termine el mandato de la actual administracion, EE.UU. vera la victoria fulminante de nuestra linea de impulsar paralelamente la construccion economica y el aumento de fuerzas nucleares."
