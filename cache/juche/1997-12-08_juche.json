            "content": "R.S. calls for repeal of \"National Security Law\" in South Korea \r\n Pyongyang, December 8 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed article entitled \"notorious 'National Security Law' must be repealed at once.\"\r\n   The author of the article says:\r\n   The \"National Security Law\" (NSL) of South Korea is a product of the colonial fascist rule and anti-DPRK confrontation policy of the United States and the South Korean clique, their stooges. Accordingly, it is an anti-national fascist law which hinders the democratic development of South Korean society and the reconciliation and unity of the nation, antagonizes the fellow countrymen in the north and obstructs the reunification of the country.\r\n   Hundreds of thousands of people have been murdered or punished by the law in South Korea since it came into being.\r\n   It is a cancer-like law of the worst type against the democratisation of South Korean society and the national reunification.\r\n   After taking office, however, Kim Young Sam reneged his commitments and cried that the \"NSL\" could not be cancelled under any circumstances. With this evil law as a ruling means, he has been engaged in flunkeyism, treachery, fascist outrage, anti-reunification and splittist moves and the policy of confrontation and war against the DPRK.\r\n   By invoking the \"NSL\", the Kim Young Sam group harshly persecuted not only reunification champions who had visited the northern half of Korea but also South Korean people who were sharing the painful sorrow with the fellow countrymen in the north in the greatest national misfortune. And they ruthlessly cracked down upon the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) and other progressive organisations calling for independence, democracy and reunification, branding them as \"forces seeking to overthrow the system\".\r\n   All these facts clearly show that as long as the \"NSL\" remains in force in South Korea, the independence and democratisation of South Korean society can never be realised nor can the reunification of the country be achieved.\r\n   The South Korean rulers must abrogate the \"NSL\" without delay, guarantee people all their political freedom and democratic rights including free debates on and activities for reunification and provide legal and institutional devices for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
