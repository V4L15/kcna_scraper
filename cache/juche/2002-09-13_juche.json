They have also hampered inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation, describing the present south Korean authorities' policy for reconciliation and cooperation with the north as a \"drain on resources for the north\" and \"unilateral\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits serious attention is the fact that the GNP gang, who brought the nation nothing but shame and blot, has become most undisguised in its challenge to the north, though the north and the south are in the relationship of solving issues by the concerted efforts of the nation and its will to relink the severed blood ties is growing stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts go to clearly prove that the GNP gang is a group of thrice-cursed sycophantic traitors who consider outsiders more important than the fellow countrymen in the north and seek division rather than reunification and that they are dishonest elements who stoop to any infamy to gratify their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is ridiculous is that these traitors are now loudmouthed about \"peace\" about which they are not entitled to talk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang is now talking about \"three principles of peace policy\" and \"five tasks for peace\". But these are no more than a broad hoax to cover up his true colors as a warhawk, mislead the public opinion, improve his public image and win more votes in the forthcoming presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His \"peace policy\" is nothing but a fig leaf to conceal with a peace veil his intention to totally scuttle the inter-Korean dialogue and bring a scourge of war to the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is well advised to drop such a broad hoax intended to fool the public and quit the political arena. The GNP group should stop obstructing the inter-Korean dialogue and fostering division between the fellow countrymen, well aware of the true meaning of the great proposition \"by our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n"

The south Korean people have no longer regarded the United States as an ally, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, more than 100 people including members of the solidarity for implementing the south-north joint declaration gathered in the plaza in front of Yongdungpho railway station, Seoul, to denounce U.S. 57-years-long military occupation of south Korea and GIs' murder of south Korean schoolgirls and demand the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, the root cause of crimes, from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A photo exhibition and a signature campaign concerning GIs' crimes took place in the plaza. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south headquarters of the national alliance of youth and students for the country's reunification also made public a statement on Sept. 9 under the title \"U.S. Forces, a group of murderers, leave this land.\"     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The map shows the history and geography of Songchon, South Phyongan Province before 1018.\r\n An appendix to the book \"Chronicle of Koryo Dynasty\" published during the Koryo dynasty, \"Map of Songju Township\" was reprinted in 1905. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"History of Songchon\" published in 1640 deals in detail with politics, economy, culture, nature and geography in Songchon at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Map of Songju Township\" is 33 cm long and 42 cm wide. It vividly shows the old Songju township and topography in its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The map includes the River Taedong and Mt. Taebak where the mausoleum of King Tangun stands and places named after the successive kings and state ruling institutions of ancient Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The legend says that Rungra islet made its appearance in Pyongyang during the flood that hit Songchon in the 1400s. What is interesting is that the name of Rungra islet is found in the middle of the River Piryu marked in the centre of the map. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The map is greatly instrumental in ascertaining the historical changes in names of places in Songchon as it contains many geographical designations hard to be found in the historical records after 1018. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The map of Pyongyang area attached to the book \"History of Pyongyang\" published in 1590 is believed to be the oldest map in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Map of Songju Township\" and \"History of Songchon\" are listed as treasures of the country as they are very helpful to studying the history of Korea of Tangun.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then the lymphocytes will display their utmost immunity to prevent cancer cells from spreading. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Researchers of the institute proved the efficacy of vaccine through experiments on animals. On this basis, the vaccine was applied to those who were operated for the cancer of stomach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The results showed p0. 05. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A clinical observation was made of those inoculated patients who had abnormal cells in their livers and abdomens sometime after operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its results showed that the vaccine was efficacious for reducing the cells or stopping them from growing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Response to the vaccine is very positive as it has no side effect and is distinct in its effacacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institute is intensifying its research into vaccine, while treating more patients.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
