For example, manager Pak Ok Chun of the Tongdaewon Clothing Factory was awarded the title of twice labour heroine while the title of labour hero went to  O Kyong Jo, a room chief of the farm machine institute of the Academy of  Agricultural Science, Pak Ok Hui, chairwoman of the management board of the township cooperative farm in Janggang county, Jagang Province and Pyon Tok Sang, an engine driver of the Jongju locomotive corps  of the Kaechon Railway Bureau, and  Ri Ok Sil and her husband Kim In Bok of the art propaganda squad of Jagang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     It is thanks to the boundlessly noble benevolent politics of General Secretary Kim Jong Il that an increasing number of heroes and heroines of the times are being produced from among the ordinary people who defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il,  leading the drive to overcome manifold difficulties,  encouraged all the people to  perform great heroic feats,  saying it is the most worthwhile life of the independent human beings to live and struggle heroically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, the heroism of the Korean people is now being displayed to the full in the course of the second grand Chollima march, a follow-up of the arduous yet worthwhile revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The party, army and people are united single-heartedly and running at a canter to hasten the building of a powerful nation. This is the true picture of the DPRK today. \r\n\r\n"

And when a lovely daughter was born, they named her Ryu So Gum (So Gum means salt in English). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn reaching the photographing site, Kim Jong Il approached them and asked their daughter \"Are you Ryu So Gum?\" and he wished her a happy future, patting her on the cheek. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Very satisfied with their deeds, he invited them to stand very close to him while having a picture taken.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This family was one of many families loved and blessed by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He spared time to visit new houses to which newly-wed couples had moved and took care of their living like their real father, during his on-site guidance in recent months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While giving an on-site guidance to Taehongdan county in August, he visited the family of a discharged soldier and took deep care of every aspect of its living.  He asked the couple about the expected baby and bestowed warm solicitude upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And during his on-site guidance to the Hamhung disabled soldiers plastic daily necessaries factory, he met disabled soldiers there and their wives, gave a warm pep talk to them and had a picture taken with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hence, the Korean people are running at a canter full of vigor under Kim Jong Il's wise leadership, holding him in high esteem as their real father. \r\n\r\n"

No one can predict when they will lose their lives while toiling every day in such critical conditions to make ends meet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This deplorable plight of the unconverted long-term prisoners is attributable to the fact that the South Korean authorities put them to harsh torture in prison, after forcing them to spend nearly all their lives there for their refusal to make \"ideological conversion.\"  Even at the end of their prison terms the authorities defined them as \"those under supervision for public peace\" and persecuted them mentally and physically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an anti-national crime to greet a new millennium, leaving unsolved the issue of the unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea which drew world attention as the worst violation of human rights in the middle of the 1900s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should be repatriated to the DPRK without fail before the end of the century to find solution to the worst human rights issue called \"issue of unconverted long-term prisoners\" in South Korea.  Only then can a good atmosphere be created for the reconciliation and unity between the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We strongly urge your side drop the outdated conception and take a measure to repatriate all the unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea to the north where their families eagerly wait for them, in compliance with their request. \r\n\r\n"
