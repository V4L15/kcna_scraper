            "content": "Brutal suppression of human rights film festival in s. Korea exposed \r\n Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- The south Korean newspaper Hangyore recently carried a detailed report on the Kim Young Sam group's brutal suppression of the human rights film festival sponsored by the \"human rights movement committee\", a dissident organisation in south Korea, between late September and early October.\r\n   Pointing out that the film festival was literally a process of \"continued hardships\", the paper fully exposed the brutal suppression of the festival.\r\n   According to it, more than 20 films on human rights issue including a documentary film on the April 3, Juche 37 (1948)  resistance of the Jeju islanders were screened at the film festival.\r\n   At the beginning, the sponsors of the festival had planned to hold it at Dongguk University in Seoul. \r\n   One month before the opening of the festival, however, the fascist clique warned that the university could not be used as the venue of the festival. Therefore, the executive committee of the festival moved the venue to the Christian Federation Hall in Seoul. But, the festival could not be held at this hall due to the blockade by the fascist clique. \r\n   Thus, it was decided to select Hongik University as the venue.\r\n   The fascist clique forcibly closed a hall of the university and cut off its electric supply. Not yielding to the obstructive moves of the fascist clique, the sponsors of the festival held it with the active support from the general student council of the university. They installed generators at the lounge of the student hall and in front of the hall and screened films with electricity produced by the generators.\r\n   Enraged at this, the fascist clique forced the university authorities to lodge a lawsuit with the prosecution against So Jun Sik, executive chairman of the film festival and chairman of the \"human rights movement committee\", on charges of \"infringement on building\" and ask for protecting \"facilities\". Therefore, the police force was hurled into the campus to search the university. Prior to the arrest of So Jun Sik, it walked away the acting chairman of the General Student Council of the University.\r\n   The paper further said:\r\n   The true color of the barbarians of the times exposed by the films is little different from the barbaric nature of the present south Korean authorities.  That is why they tried hard to block these films from being screened. \r\n\r\n"

Kim Jong Il, incarnation of people-oriented politics \r\n  Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il is deeply respected by all people for his rare benevolent politics.\r\n    Regarding the love for the people as the fundamental principle of political activity, he has carried it into practice in all aspects of social life, which is a source of a great many legends on this land.\r\n   In early August Juche 84 (1995) a flood hit Sinuiju, a border city, and Uiju county,  North Phyongan Province, on the River Amnok.\r\n   No sooner had he been informed that more than 2,000 residents in these areas were exposed to a danger than he issued an order to the units of the three services of the Korean People's Army to save them from the jaw of death. He led the rescue work.\r\n   Greatly satisified with the fact that all the residents were saved with the help of helicopters, amphibious vehicles and clippers, he took all steps for the stability of their living.\r\n  In August this year the highest tidal wave in scores of years brought heavy damage to different domains of the national economy. At the time he paid primary attention to the rescue of people and property and rehabilitation work to provide the people in flood-afflicted areas with stable living conditions.\r\n   \"It was like a dream. It has been said that flood is a source of wails and cries.                               However, we got more than we lost. in addition, new-born babies enlarged the village population. Indeed, Marshal Kim Jong Il is the tender-hearted father of all people.\"     This is what all the people in flood-afflicted areas want to say.\r\n   When all the Koreans were overwhelmed with bitter sadness at the unexpected death of President Kim Il Sung, General Kim Jong Il felt the pain of the loss more keenly than anyone else did. Even at that time he sent a special plane to carry triplets from a remote mountain village to the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital.\r\n   One day, ten crewmen of a wrecked ship were exposed to a danger on the East Sea of Korea. General Kim Jong Il issued an order to an air force unit of the KPA to save them immediately.\r\n   His love for the people saved a girl mechanic on the top of a remote mountain 2,000 metres above sea level, a technician in a mid-east country and a boy in Africa.\r\n   Encouraged by his great love, the Korean people are confidently pulling through difficulties and trials. \r\n\r\n"

But Hwang has neither address nor neighbours. He lives a solitary life in a secret room of the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and goes out only at night in disguise and with a bullet-proof vest.\r\n   Permanent residence in south Korea is all he has been given in the colony. It is nothing but a lodging and boarding card the \"ANSP\" gave to the lunatic and a ticket for a train to his doom.\r\n   The spokesman berated Hwang for slandering the institution of the Juche Era and asking Japanese officials to refrain from normalizing diplomatic ties with the DPRK and making a compensation to it.\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   The institution of the Juche Era was only too natural in view of the position of the Juche idea, which ushered in a new era in the history of the Korean nation and human development.\r\n   The Juche idea has been recognized as the greatest guiding idea by the international community for its immortal truth and great attraction.\r\n   It was a natural and inevitable requirement of the time, history and the nation that the Juche era was instituted with the year when President Kim Il Sung was born as the first year. President Kim Il Sung founded the Juche idea in his early years and opened up a new history of an independent nation, an era of independence when the working masses emerged as makers of a new world.\r\n   But Hwang abused the institution of the Juche Era as being \"feudalistic\" and as being \"against common sense\". His abuse is as foolish as killing himself.\r\n   His remarks concerning the normalization of DPRK-Japan diplomatic ties and Japan's compensation are a negation of his assertion that he defected to south Korea for \"peace and reunification of the country\" and also an indication that he is a stooge of Japan.\r\n   Hwang also said it is \"realistic to expect a switchover in the north's policy\".\r\n   The north has already declared that it will carry forward President Kim Il Sung's cause without slightest declination. \r\n   It is well known in the world.\r\n   Hwang's call for \"switchover\" is nonsense. His remarks only show the uneasiness of \"Chongwadae\" and \"ANSP\". \r\n \r\n"
