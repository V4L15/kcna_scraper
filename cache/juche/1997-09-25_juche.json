Accordingly, they cannot be construed otherwise than a war declaration against the north.\r\n   It is an open secret that the Kim Young Sam group, together with outside forces, have already worked out the provocative \"new operation plan 5027\" against the north.\r\n   \"Conception of joint operation of war theatre\" is a document which comprehensively systematizes the war preparations against the north made by the south Korean authorities hand in hand with outsiders, in line with real warfare. Accordingly, it is at every point a plan of aggressive war for making a three-dimentional surprise attack on the north.\r\n   The south Korean authorities would be well advised to ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless moves and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"

The work also said that contemporary imperialism has a serious inner contradiction so it cannot escape its doom.\r\n   The work stressed the need to be watchful for and decisively struggle against the vicious and cunning moves of the imperialists, who are trying to bring the people of the socialist countries and other progressive people the world over to their knees by threatening and blackmailing them militarily, bribing and subordinating them economically and disrupting them ideologically and culturally.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il in the work said that the driving force of the revolution should be strengthened and its role enhanced to push ahead with the revolution and construction.  In particular, he stressed that the working-class Party, the vanguard of the revolution, should be strengthened and its role enhanced to rally the broad masses of the people closer around the Party and the leader. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then, Secretary Kim Jong Il, who accompanied the President, went out to Sakju county which was designated as the place of visit by the participants in the conference and learned how things were going there.\r\n   Exposed to mid-summer heat, he acquainted himself in detail with the production and maintenance of equipment at local industrial factories and cooperative farms in the county and with the technical level of the people and their living standard. On this basis, he wrote a treatise under the title \"validity of our Party's policy on developing local economy\" and presented it to the President. This treatise gave a valuable help to the President who had been devoted to the work of developing the local economy rapidly.\r\n   When he was accompanying the President who was on the guidance tour of south Hamgyong Province and Ryanggang Province in August 1963, Secretary Kim Jong Il deeply learned how county Party and people's committees were operated, how education, cultural and commercial activities were conducted and how the people lived. And he said that county Party officials should perform their responsibilities and role, well aware of the position and importance of counties.\r\n   When he mounted Mt.

This greatly affected agriculture in north and south Phyongan and North Hwanghae Province, South Hwanghae Province ,the major bread baskets of the DPRK. 470,000 hectares of paddy rice and maize fields were hit by the long spell of drought.\r\n   Worse still, the highest tidal waves in 20 years inundated 107,000 hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields in the granaries in the Western Coast of Korea, where harvest can hardly be expected.\r\n   As a result, it is foreseen that the grain output this year will be reduced to a great extent and the output of maize will be much less than last year's.\r\n   Earlier this month, a joint inspection team of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation and the World Food Programme went round the areas hit by drought and high tidal waves before publishing an early warning report that maize output will decrease by some 1.2 million tons and rice output by 0.6 million tons in the DPRK this year.\r\n   It is expected that our food problem will continue to be serious next year, due to the natural disasters this year.\r\n   What we should do now is to harvest the crops without any waste, though it is difficult to have an optimistic view of the grain output.\r\n   All people now work hard to harvest in time all the crops they have grown with much care. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
