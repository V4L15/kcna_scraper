Kim Jong Il from Japanese \r\n   Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il received a letter of thanks from Takaaki Hada, elder brother of Ri Hwa Sun who had visited Japan as a member of the first hometown-visiting group of Japanese-Korean women.\r\n   In the letter he said the recent hometown visit of the Japanese women who are Korean citizens is a product of the loving care and bold decision of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, and extended wholehearted, deep thanks to him.\r\n   When he visited the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in 1986, he met with his sister thanks to the deep care of President Kim Il Sung and came to know that she was leading a happy life, bringing up her children as excellent pillars of socialism under the warm care of the President, he wrote.\r\n   All this which is inconceivable in Japan is a product of the guidance of President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the letter said.\r\n   Old as he is, he would make every possible effort for solidarity movement to hasten the normalisation of relations between the DPRK and Japan and the independent, peaceful reunification of the North and South of Korea, it added.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

According to it, it has given top priority to the work of strengthening the Korean front.\r\n   What it seeks in this is to make a collective military attack on the DPRK with Japan and the South Korean authorities as war servants and shock brigades after working out a new U.S.-Japan-South Korea war scenario called \"joint strategy\" for providing against the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   This is why it is trying to develop the relations of subordinate U.S.-South Korea and U.S.-Japan military alliances into \"future-oriented alliances\" and perfect the \"cooperation system\" for the \"case of emergency,\" while reinforcing its military presence in South Korea and Japan, a legacy from the Cold War.\r\n   Through the \"joint strategy\", U.S. hardliners intend to strengthen its military predominance in Asia, realise the U.S.-Japan-South Korea military integration and thus carry out the second Korean war on a large scale with the use of the military strength of Japan and South Korea.\r\n   Their intention is foolish and very dangerous.\r\n   This can drive the situation to a catastrophic phase, bringing only death and defeat to its main culprits and accomplices.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- If the cause of national reunification is to be achieved at an early date, a radical change must be made in South Korea, says Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n   The author of the article says:\r\n   A radical change is badly needed in South Korea to realise independence and democratisation of South Korean society and national reunification, extricate it from the extreme political and economic crisis and confusion and improve the devastated living standard of its people.\r\n   If a radical change is to be made in South Korea in conformity with requirements of the times and aspirations of the people, the South Korean authorities should above all take the stand of national independence.\r\n   Nothing will change in South Korea even if regimes or \"presidents\" are changed.\r\n   Only when a democratic regime representing the will and desire of the people is established and independent policies are pursued in south korea can a radical change be made in South Korea.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must rely upon the nation, not upon outsiders, enforce democratic politics, not fascist repressive politics. They must not try to hurt the fellow countrymen in the north hand in glove with outsiders but promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests with them and shape policies to achieve national reunification with the united strength of the whole nation. \r\n   Besides, they must replace the anti-north confrontation policy with a pro-north reconciliatory policy, pull down the concrete wall, repeal the \"National Security Law\", an anti-reunification fascist law, and disband the \"Agency for National Security Planning.\" by doing so, they must show changes in their policies and their will for reunification.\r\n   We will follow the behaviour of the South Korean authorities.    \r\n\r\n"
