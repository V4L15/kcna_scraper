It is a hard fact that the frozen minds melted in a moment after 50 odd years and the blood and terrestrial veins of the nation are being connected into one thanks to the idea. All the Koreans should regard it as the greatest honor to contribute to reunification and plunge themselves into the vast flow toward independent reunification to dedicate to the cause of reunification their utmost energy, ability and talent. Then the driving force of reunification will grow a hundred times stronger and the internal force for the cause of the country's reunification will gain in strength beyond measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea is a source of revitalization of the reunification movement. This is proved by the dramatic events that have occurred in the reunification movement waged by all the compatriots in both parts of the country under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself.\" The inter-Korean relations which had remained in confrontation for more than half a century are now being converted into relations of \"By our nation itself,\" the relations of cooperation.. The substantial reunification process is being accelerated through dialogues and contacts in various fields, political, economic and cultural, including the north-south ministerial talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the idea of \"By our nation itself\" serves as the banner of the country's reunification, the guiding pole of victory, as it inspires the reunification movement while fully displaying its validity and vitality.    \r\n\r\n"
