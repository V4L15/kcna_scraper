            "content": "Anti-DPRK \"Joint Statement\" of UNSC Rebuffed\r\n Pyongyang, May 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry Sunday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the fact that permanent members of the UN Security Council issued a \"joint statement\" pulling up the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t The permanent members of the UNSC which took part in the first preparatory meeting for the 2015 NPT Review Conference now under way in Vienna released a \"joint statement\" pulling up the DPRK over its launch of satellite for peaceful purposes and demanding it stop its nuclear activities and dismantle its nuclear deterrence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a grave illegal action of violating the sovereignty of the DPRK and its right to use space and nuclear energy for peaceful purposes, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the matter is that the member nations unilaterally accepted the U.S. brigandish demand in contravention of the principle of action for action laid down in the September 19 joint statement, turning their faces away from the crimes the U.S. has committed by spawning the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through ceaseless nuclear threats and hostile policy in breach of the principle of impartiality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the member nations that have conducted much more nuclear tests and stockpiled much more nukes than other countries in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have no moral qualification to say anything about the nuclear issue of someone as they keep arsenals of nukes enough to kill the whole mankind hundreds of times. It is like a guilty party filing the suit first that these countries took issue with the DPRK which has been directly exposed to the threat of nuclear war for the longest period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They let loose such sophism at a meeting reviewing the implementation of the NPT in an effort to divert its attention in a bid to evade the fulfillment of the commitment to nuclear disarmament, prompted by their purpose to perpetuate their monopoly of nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the nuclear powers are to deter more countries from withdrawing from the NPT, they should respect the rights of all the countries to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes as required by the basic mission of the NPT, and stop making word-play and sleight of hand over their commitment to nuclear disarmament. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are days never to return when the U.S. could threaten the DPRK with A-bombs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, depending on its nuclear deterrence for self-defence, will firmly protect its sovereignty and dynamically push forward the development of space for peaceful purposes and the industry of nuclear energy and proudly build a thriving nation where its people will fully enjoy prosperity under socialism."

New skycrapers are standing up in rows and brightly-lit streets of the capital city at night were fascinating. I could feel that the overall standard of its people's living is in the process of improvement though there are economic difficulties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Witnessing the double standards of the U.S. and the West terming the DPRK satellite launch for peaceful purposes a violation of the UNSC resolution while patronizing and encouraging other countries' launch of long-range missiles, I keenly felt that the improved relations between the U.S. and the DPRK can hardly be expected unless the former rolls back its hostile policy toward the latter."
