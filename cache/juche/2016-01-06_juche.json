            "content": "DPRK Proves Successful in H-bomb Test\r\n Pyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- The DPRK government issued the following statement Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place a world startling event to be specially recorded in the national history spanning 5,000 years in the exciting period when all service personnel and people of the DPRK are making a giant stride, performing eye-catching miracles and exploits day by day after turning out as one in the all-out charge to bring earlier the final victory of the revolutionary cause of Juche, true to the militant appeal of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first H-bomb test was successfully conducted in the DPRK at 10:00 on Wednesday, Juche 105 (2016), pursuant to the strategic determination of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the test conducted with indigenous wisdom, technology and efforts the DPRK fully proved that the technological specifications of the newly developed H-bomb for the purpose of test were accurate and scientifically verified the power of smaller H-bomb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was confirmed that the H-bomb test conducted in a safe and perfect manner had no adverse impact on the ecological environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test means a higher stage of the DPRK's development of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By succeeding in the H-bomb test in the most perfect manner to be specially recorded in history the DPRK proudly joined the advanced ranks of nuclear weapons states possessed of even H-bomb and the Korean people came to demonstrate the spirit of the dignified nation equipped with the most powerful  nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This test is a measure for self-defence the DPRK has taken to firmly protect the sovereignty of the country and the vital right of the nation from the ever-growing nuclear threat and blackmail by the U.S.-led hostile forces and to reliably safeguard the peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the appearance of the word hostility in the world there has been no precedent of such deep-rooted, harsh and persistent policy as the hostile policy the U.S. has pursued towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a gang of cruel robbers which has worked hard to bring even a nuclear disaster to the DPRK, not content with having imposed the thrice-cursed and unheard-of political isolation, economic blockade and military pressure on it for the mere reason that it has differing ideology and social system and refuses to yield to the former's ambition for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula and its vicinity are turning into the world's biggest hotspot where a nuclear war may break out since they have been constantly stormed with all nuclear strike means of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops, including nuclear carrier strike group and nuclear strategic flying corps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While kicking up all forms of economic sanctions and conspiratorial \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK with mobilization of the hostile forces, the U.S. has made desperate efforts to block its building of a thriving nation and improvement of the people's living standard and \"bring down its social system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to H-bomb of justice, standing against the U.S., the chieftain of aggression watching for a chance for attack on it with huge nukes of various types, is the legitimate right of a sovereign state for self-defense and a very just step no one can slander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Genuine peace and security cannot be achieved through humiliating solicitation or compromise at the negotiating table.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present-day grim reality clearly proves once again the immutable truth that one's destiny should be defended by one's own efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish than dropping a hunting gun before herds of ferocious wolves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spectacular success made by the DPRK in the H-bomb test this time is a great deed of history, a historic event of the national significance as it surely guarantees the eternal future of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is a genuine peace-loving state which has made all efforts to protect peace on the Korean Peninsula and security in the region from the U.S. vicious nuclear war scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, a responsible nuclear weapons state, will neither be the first to use nuclear weapons nor transfer relevant means and technology under any circumstances as already declared as long as the hostile forces for aggression do not encroach upon its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can neither be suspended nuclear development nor nuclear dismantlement on the part of the DPRK unless the U.S. has rolled back its vicious hostile policy toward the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will steadily escalate its nuclear deterrence of justice both in quality and quantity to reliably guarantee the future of the revolutionary cause of Juche for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Juche Korea will be prosperous forever as it holds fast to the great WPK's line of simultaneously pushing forward the two fronts."

6 la siguiente declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, todos los militares y civiles coreanos logran cada dia el gran avance con los milagros deslumbrantes y proezas al movilizarse con audacia en la ofensiva general para adelantar la victoria final de la causa de la revolucion del Juche apoyando de todo corazon el llamamiento combativo del Partido del Trabajo de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En este tiempo conmovedor ocurrio el gran acontecimiento que se registrara especialmente en la historia nacional de 5 mil anos estremeciendo esta tierra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Segun la decision estrategica del PTC tuvo lugar con exito la primera prueba de la bomba de hidrogeno de Corea del Juche a las 10:00 del dia 6 de enero del 105 (2016) de la Era Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A traves de la presente prueba basada totalmente en nuestra sabiduria, nuestra tecnica y nuestras fuerzas, comprobamos que son exactos los datos tecnicos de la recien desarrollada bomba H para el ensayo y dilucidamos en lo cientifico el poderio de la bomba H minimizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se verifico que el presente ensayo realizado segura y perfectamente, no ejercio cualquiera influencia negativa al medioambiente ecologico del contorno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reciente prueba deviene la etapa mas alta del desarrollo de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a este exito mas perfecto a ser registrado especialmente en la historia, la RPDC entra a la primera linea de los paises poseedores de armas nucleares, que cuentan con bombas de hidrogeno, y el pueblo coreano exalta el impetu de de la nacion orgullosa que posee el mas poderoso disuasivo nuclear.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente ensayo deviene la medida autodefensiva para defender estrictamente la soberania del pais y el derecho a la subsistencia de la nacion desde las cada dia mas crecientes amenazas y chantajes nucleares de las fuerzas hostiles encabezadas por EE.UU. y asegurar mas fidedignamente la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y la estabilidad regional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de la aparicion de la palabra \"hostilidad\" en este mundo, no hubo otra como la tan arraigada, extremada y tenaz del imperio la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es la horda de gangsteres crueles, que insatisfecha con ejecutar el aislamiento politico, el bloqueo economico y la presion militar sin precedentes, hace esfuerzos desesperados por acarrear hasta la catastrofe nuclear a la RPDC que tiene la ideologia y el regimen diferentes y no se obedece a su codicia de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe convierte en la zona mas candente del mundo y punto de estallido de la guerra nuclear la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno donde se introducen sucesivamente el colectivo de ataque de portaaviones nucleares, la aviacion estrategica nuclear y otros medios de ataque nuclear de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. hace esfuerzos desesperados por impedir la construccion de un Estado prospero y la mejora de la vida del pueblo de la RPDC y lograr el \"derrumbamiento del regimen norcoreano\" instigando a las fuerzas hostiles a la sancion economica de diferente formas y la intrigante campana de \"DDHH\" contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa posesion de la bomba de hidrogeno de la RPDC, que se enfrenta con EE.UU., caudillo de agresion que acecha la oportunidad de ataque a esta, deviene el legitimo derecho a la autodefensa de un Estado soberano y una justa medida incensurable para nadie. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa paz y la seguridad verdaderas no se logran por la solicitud avasallante ni por el dialogo conciliativo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa severa realidad de hoy vuelve a comprobar mas evidentemente que uno debe defender su destino solo con su propia fuerza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera una tonteria abandonar la escopeta de caza ante la horda de lobos que arremeten furiosamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran exito deslumbrante logrado por la RPDC en la prueba de la bomba de hidrogeno constituye un gran acontecimiento de la historia nacional, que garantiza fidedignamente el eterno futuro la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC es el verdadero Estado amante de la paz que hace todos sus esfuerzos por frustrar el malsano intento de la guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y asegurar la paz en la Peninsula Coreana y la seguridad de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Como ya fue declarado, la RPDC, responsable pais poseedor de las armas nucleares, no sera primero en usar las armas nucleares, ni trasladara en cualquier caso los medios y las tecnicas relativos mientras que las fuerzas hostiles agresivas no violen nuestra soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si no se interrumpe la atroz politica hostil de EE.UU. contra la RPDC, no habra jamas el cese del desarrollo nuclear o la renuncia nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercito y el pueblo de Corea fortaleceran constantemente en lo cuantitativo nuestro justo disuasivo nuclear que garantiza confiablemente el eterno futuro de la causa de la revolucion del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sera prospera para siempre la Corea del Juche que avanza enarbolando la linea del desarrollo paralelo del PTC."
