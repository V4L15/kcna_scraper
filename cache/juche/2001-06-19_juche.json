            "content": "Five-storey pagoda at Jahye Temple \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- Among many Korean historical relics is the five-storey Pagoda at the Jahye temple, evidence showing the resourcefulness of the medieval Koreans.\r\n The stone Pagoda remains in the yard of the Jahye temple, whose construction dates back to the period of Koryo dynasty (918-1392), in Sowon-ri, Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province in the middle of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It consists of a pedestal in two tiers, a tier of stereobate, a five-storey tower body and the top. It is 5.94 metres high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In every side of the lower part of the stereobate, there are three hollows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Square pillar is projecting from the main body of the stereobate and each storey of the tower. The first storey is decorated with sculpture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At each centre of its both northern and southern sides is a lock and on both sides of the lock are the images of the two deva kings, the guardian gods of Buddhism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sculpture is delicate and refined. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cap is thin and the eaves are protruding comparatively long, which makes it look large and light. At their corners are holes used for hanging bells. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The design of the five-storey tower which becomes narrow going upward gives an admirable symmetrical effect and its cutting was done daintily with polished engraving. This pagoda has every claim to be described as one of the excellent stone pagodas in the early period of Koryo.    \r\n\r\n"
