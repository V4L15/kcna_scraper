Sent \"warning\" to the DPRK against this.\r\n   We will never be frightened by the U.S. \"warning.\" the U.S. still knows little about the DPRK.\r\n   Since we are convinced of the validity of what we are doing, we do not read other's face but will exercise our legitimate sovereignty no matter what others may say. We are fully ready to launch an artificial satellite again when we think it necessary.\r\n   It is our character and mode of activities to do anything once we declare we will do it.\r\n   The United States had better not try to test our faith and will.    \r\n   \r\n"
