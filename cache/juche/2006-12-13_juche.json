Lyimo, vice-chairman of the Tanzania-DPRK Friendship Association and chairman of the Tanzanian National Coordinating Committee of the Juche Idea Study Groups, in the lecture titled \"Outstanding Supreme Commander\" said that Kim Jong Il is the most outstanding man in the modern times as he is leading the stand-off with the U.S. to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Edie Kekana, chairman of the Group for the Study of the Progressive Idea of the Northern Branch of Pretoria of the Democratic Teachers Union of South Africa, in the lecture titled \"Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il with the Treasured Sword of Songun in His Hand\" expressed belief that the KPA commanded by Kim Jong Il would as always creditably fulfill its sacred mission standing guard over the outpost to accomplish the cause of independence against imperialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Papers today observe this in their signed commentaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has plugged south Korea deep into the Iraqi war under the pretext of what it called \"alliance\" with it. This is aimed at reducing south Korea to a partner of the U.S. aggression troops and using young and middle-aged south Koreans as their canon fodder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities seek to remain in power in return for serving and pleasing their American master. How miserable the south Korean regime is as it can hardly exist without the backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flunkeyism, treachery and dependence on outside forces will bring nothing but shameful destruction. History clearly proves what a miserable end those who worked hard to serve the U.S. to gratify their personal greed for power met while being utterly indifferent to the interests of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson urges the south Korean authorities to take the stand of national independence, a stand of attaching importance to the nation and working for cooperation between compatriots, away from the idea of submitting to the U.S., retract the above-said decision and move at once to pull back the troops from Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reason was that there had been \"an advice\" to the effect from the Ministry of Justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year alone, Pak Hui Jin in the capacity of vice-chairman of the council has attended several times working negotiations and joint events held by youths and students from both parts of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Utterly not understandable is the inconsistent act of the Ministry of Unification in refusing to allow the participation of the council in the function, reading another's face, according to the advice of the Ministry of Justice, contrary to the least knowledge of law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now it is more urgent than ever before to bring together the will and mind of the nation for the achievement of peace on the Korean Peninsula by boosting contact, exchange and cooperation between the south and the north and no one should be elbowed aside in this.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This will put peace and security in Northeast Asia at stake and increase the military tension in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the Japanese reactionaries are dangerous forces of a war of aggression who do not think twice about a criminal act of harassing peace and security in the region when it comes to attaining their ambition for militarist expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be held fully responsible for the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless behavior.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Hostile Policy toward DPRK Bound to Go Bankrupt \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. had better draw a serious lesson from its failure in its hostile policy toward the DPRK this year and make a switchover in its policy, urges Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. has worked hard to seriously infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK from the outset of the year, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A typical example of this is \"OPLAN 5027-03\" which the U.S. modified and supplemented to suit \"new security environment.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists newly established \"CONPLAN-8022\" after deciding to round off their conception plan called  \"OPLAN 5029\" aimed at coping with the \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula as a military operational scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the new military operational plan, they brought a nuclear carrier and its flotilla made up of Enterprise, Aegis destroyer, cruiser and submarine, etc. to Pusan Port and massively hurled a task force including F-15Ks into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has escalated sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK, talking about \"overall examination\" of its DPRK policy and \"hard-line counteraction.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists kicked up a hysteric row against the DPRK in the sky and land and on the sea in and around south Korea by mobilizing their allies and even the nuclear carrier task force at a time when a touch-and-go situation prevailed in Korea. This saber rattling was prompted by their gunboat diplomacy and horror strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was their calculation that the Korean people would make a concession and yield to their gunboat diplomacy and horror strategy. By doing so they tried to achieve their goal to invade the DPRK with ease. In a nutshell, the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK this year was a product of the Bush administration's crafty and vicious attempt to realize its brazen-faced design to bring the DPRK to its knees and put it under their domination through high-handed military actions and sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and their allies posed serious threats to the DPRK and made desperate efforts to bring it to its knees but all this proved futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has honorably defended peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world from the U.S. imperialists' attempt to provoke a war. The U.S. dared not ignite another war of aggression in Korea in face of the DPRK's powerful war deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK reacted to the U.S. hard-line stand with the toughest stand. It exerted positive efforts to foil the U.S. hostile policy toward it and defended peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, looking back on the struggle waged by them this year to defend socialism, standing in confrontation with the U.S., once again harden their conviction that the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK is always bound to meet a failure and setback as it remains ever stronger under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Aphorism on Great National Unity\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- \"Unity leads a nation to prosperity and split leads a nation to ruin\". This aphorism of Kim Jong Il indicates the clear-cut way for the members of the nation to shape their own destiny.\r\n A nation is a most solid and inclusive social collective and the community of same destiny. A nation, the main unit in carving out the destiny of people, presupposes the unity. If a nation is dismembered without achieving unity, the nation cannot keep itself as a social collective and a community of same destiny and will go to ruin in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the truth shown by the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation had keenly experienced the importance of the unity as a ruined nation. It could make a new history of national unity under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung, peerlessly great man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of the great national unity is successfully carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the idea of the great national unity that the Koreans in the north, south and abroad should firmly unite for the country's reunification under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification, transcending the interests of class and strata irrespective of differences in ideas, systems, political opinions and religious belief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing movement for national reunification proves the truth of this aphorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, the south Korean people from all strata hardened their will to promote the reconciliation and unity and to strive for reunification, visiting Pyongyang, Mt. Paektu and Mt. Kumgang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than ten times of reunion of families and relatives who have been separated into the north and the south for scores of years, reunification festivals held in various places of the north and the south and joint entrance of athletes of the north and the south into international events--all these strikingly show that the Korean nation is realizing reconciliation and unity on the way to shape the destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aphorism of Kim Jong Il implants patriotism in the hearts of the fellow countrymen who have turned out in the movement for the independence and reunification of the nation and inspires them to devoted efforts for the cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
