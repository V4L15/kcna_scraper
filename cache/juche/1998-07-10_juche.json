The Korean people keenly feel indebted to the Chinese people for their assistance.\r\n   Choe hoped that the fraternal Chinese people under the leadership of the party led by the respected Jiang Zemin would achieve a new success in building socialism with Chinese characteristics and unifying the whole country.\r\n   In his reply Chinese ambassador Wan Yongxiang said the Communist Party and the government of china set great store by the traditional Sino-Korean friendship and do everything they can to  steadily consolidate and develop friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries.\r\n   He expressed the belief that no matter which way international situation may change the traditional friendship between China and the DPRK would certainly be kept in bloom more beautifully.\r\n   Today the fraternal Korean people, he noted, are making every possible effort to adorn the elections of deputies to the 10th Supreme People's Assembly and the 50th anniversary of the foundation of the DPRK with great achievements, giving full play to the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and the spirit of the forced march under the guidance of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n   They are joyful at having nominated him for the 10th SPA, Wan said, adding that the elections would be successful and socialist construction of Korea would move ahead without letup.    \r\n     \r\n  \r\n"

Some time ago, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen said the U.S. troops should be kept on the Korean peninsula even after its reunification.\r\n   The U.S. military occupation of South Korea is unreasonable in every respect.\r\n   In actuality, the U.S. policy of military presence in South Korea has become a serious problem in the international community. Due to the presence of U.S. troops in South Korea and their reckless military manoeuvres, the Cold War has not yet been terminated on the Korean peninsula but the situation has become all the more strained. Such developments threaten the peace and security of Asia and impede a proper development of the international situation.\r\n   If the United States is to work out a new Asia policy and a new Korea policy suitable to the next century, it should promptly take a step for the withdrawal of its troops from South Korea and Japan.\r\n   Minju Joson says only when the united states withdraws its troops from South Korea and Asia as early as possible, a favorable climate will be provided for the reunification and peace of the Korean peninsula and for the peace and security of Asia.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

The slogan fully mirrors  the courage and faith in certain victory with which the Korean people are cheerfully pulling through manifold ordeals and hardships as they are led by General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   Visiting Huichon, Jagang Province, in June last, Kim Jong Il saw this slogan hanging on the wall of a production building of the youth electric complex, and said it is a very good slogan.\r\n   When he called at the February 26 Factory he saw the workers full of faith and optimism and encouraged them, saying, \"Socialism is winning victory after victory and we should be always cheerful though our way is thorny.\"\r\n   His deep loving care and trust have made people strong in faith and struggle. \r\n   In a recent month the production of rolled steel and steel increased three times  and 1.5 times respectively and hundreds of millions of more kwh of electricity was turned out compared with the previous period. This year more than 2,000 minor power stations have been built.\r\n   Signal achievements have been made in the broad gauge railway projects between Haeju and Ongjin and between  Singangryong and Pupho and at the construction site of a new road between the Rimhung intersection and Sinmi-dong in Pyongyang and other projects across the country.\r\n   Owing to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and years of devastating natural disasters, the Korean people are facing difficulties in life including  food shortage, but they are convinced of victory, not discouraged by them.\r\n   Jagang Province is already making a march of paradise after successfully finishing the \"forced march\" in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. It has built many minor power stations to meet its need for electricity by itself. The number of such areas and units is on the increase.\r\n   The Korean people are pushing ahead with production and construction under the slogan \"Let's be always cheerful, though our way is thorny \" in order to significantly greet the 50th anniversary of the DPRK as a grand festival of victors.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

This was the result of a nationwide win-soil-from-the-sea campaign launched a decade ago to gain additional agricultural land. From Pidan island at the northwestern tip of Korea at the mouth of Amnok River to the middle of west coast Rimhan-ri of Phanmun county sea walls have been erected to bring tidal flats into active agricultural use and thus create new highly intensive granaries.\r\n   More than 100 islands and islets have been linked with the mainland to reduce the length of coastline by more than 500 kilometres, thus pushing the coastline 12 kilometres offshore.\r\n   In the newly-reclaimed land, dozens of reservoirs and many salterns, fish-culture ponds and chemical-fibre producing centres, as well as the state and cooperative farms and workteams, have come into being.\r\n   The drive to reclaim tidal flats, initiated by the DPRK government and the Workers' Party of Korea, reached a high-water mark in the 1980s.\r\n   More and more sea walls were erected to link one peninsula with another and islands with the mainland. To take a few examples, a dozens-of-kilometre-long dike connecting the Tasa islet in Yomju county and Rihwa-ri, Cholsan county to create a new granary of 8,800 hectares, Taegye islet, 68-km long dikes across the sea off Haeju connecting Kumhak, Chongdan county and Ryongmae islet to create new areas of agricultural use covering 2,500 hectares, 5,200 hectares in Kangryong, 3,300 hectares  in Kumsong, 3,200 hectares in Unryul, 2,600 hectares in Kwaksan and 1,000 hectares in Chongsu islet. The lands thus won from the sea are equivalent to the total arable land of five counties.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
