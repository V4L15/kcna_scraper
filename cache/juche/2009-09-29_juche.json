There is no knowing when they will torpedo the process of the inter-Korean relations which have been put on the orbit of normalization with so much effort. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inter-Korean relations can never be improved by the efforts of one party alone. The prospect of improving the inter-Korean relations entirely depends on the stand and attitude of the south side."
