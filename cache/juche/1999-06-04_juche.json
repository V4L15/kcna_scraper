This is motivated by its brigandish ambition to secure the position of a superpower in the unipolar world and  take the initiative in the 21st century by \"containing\" the north that is admired by the world people as an independent, strong nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hanminjon bitterly condemns the U.S. war hawks for having worked out the concrete operation plan aimed at making a preemptive attack on the north and occupying the whole of the Korean peninsula and for  working hard to plunge the whole of Korea into a holocaust of a thermonuclear war by military force.   The United States should face up to reality and stop acting rashly.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe treacherous Kim Dae Jung group which is begging for the permanent presence of the U.S. forces in South Korea in pursuance of the U.S. war strategy for aggression on the north  and is getting more frenzied in arms buildup than ever before must ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their moves and give up a foolish dream of stifling the fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces. \r\n\r\n"

Needless to say, this action was a product of the heinous plot hatched under the U.S. manipulation behind the scene.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such undisguised intrigue which is made at a time when the diplomatic efforts for a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue are hectic clearly shows that the United States is not willing at all to seek a peaceful settlement of the crisis  but is leaving no stone unturned to  militarily bring the Balkans under its control and dominate the world.   This is a grave violation of justice and international law and a wanton interference in the internal affairs of a sovereign state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  To violate human rights under the signboard of \"defence of human rights\" is a shameless hypocrisy. The assailant  who unleashed a war of aggression is trying to lay a \"war crime\" at the door of  the victim  who is subjected to aggression and do harm to him. This is, in the real sense of the  term, a brigandish act  reminiscent of a thief turning on the master with a club.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is an unheard-of shameless arbitrary practice to bring an  unreasonable suit against the publicly recognized head of state of a sovereign state who was elected by the people's will and try to trample down the sovereignty of a  full-fledged UN member nation with strength. If such practices are connived at and tolerated, the imperialists will become more high-handed  in their atrocities, choosing \r\nSmall countries as targets of their assaults and scapegoats at random.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.-led NATO forces' indiscriminate air raids of more than two months killed many   defenseless people, reducing Yugoslavia to debris and producing millions of refugees and wanderers.\r\nMoreover, the United States is using without hesitation up-to-date lethal weaponry of all types, while forbidding  other countries to produce and possess weapons of mass destruction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This unethical act is, indeed, a real crime that should be prosecuted.\r\n   We, together with progressive humankind the world over who want a peaceful solution to the Kosovo issue, will in the future, too, extend invariable support and solidarity to the Yugoslav people in their just struggle to defend their dignity and sovereignty. \r\n\r\n"

But neither crafty deceptive moves nor reckless suppression  by these ruling quarters can check the struggle of the students in the south for justice and truth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the students in the North Korea will continue to extend support and encouragement to the fighting fellow students in the south and earnestly pursue study and scientific researches in the  spirit of being in the  same boat with them to prepare themselves to be able  builders of a reunified powerful nation. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean authorities' \"engagement policy\"\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a commentator's article headlined \"On South Korean authorities' 'engagement policy'\".\r\nRecalling that the South Korean authorities were reported to have sympathized with Park Chung Hee who  could not live out a natural life, while suppressing hundreds of thousand of people, it observes:    This is precisely \"generosity\" and \"engagement\" advertised by the South Korean authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are now talking about \"engagement\" with someone, although they are not in a position to engage even the pro-reunification, pro-democracy forces.  This is nothing but a silly dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the truth behind the \"engagement policy,\" the article goes on:   The South Korean authorities claim that the \"engagement policy\" is aimed at promoting \"peace\", \"co-existence and co-prosperity\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation.\" But, underlying the \"policy\" is their ulterior intention to extend the corrupt anti-popular colonial system of South Korea to the North Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"engagement policy\", which has fully disclosed its ill-intentioned nature, is an overt betrayal of the north's generosity and trust as well as an intolerable challenge to the best socialist system in Korea.   The \"engagement policy\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities is meant to impose their policy upon others. It is a daydream that can never be realized.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such \"changes\" which the South Korean rulers wish to see in the north will never take place in the north. If there be any, it will be  only dynamic advance and victory of socialism which they can hardly imagine.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although the South Korean authorities seek to undermine the north from within through the so-called \"cooperation and exchange,\" it is ridiculous, indeed, to try to bring about a policy switchover with money. Their attempt to  apply the principle of market economy into politics seems to be possible in the capitalist society where money is everything, but will never  work on the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The destiny of the entire nation is what we cannot but worry about. \r\n   The \"engagement policy\" will bring about nothing but confrontation, fuelled by the endless  drain of nation's treasure,  a merciless war and tragic permanent division.   Herein lie the anti-national nature of the \"engagement policy\" as well as an actual justification for not tolerating it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ultimate result of the north-south confrontation, which is pursued by the South Korean authorities through their \"engagement policy\", cannot be a  positive one.   The north has consistently sustained the patriotic faith with conviction and optimism about future and is keeping to the most right path it has already chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should adhere to the three principles of national reunification, promote the great national unity and opt to found a reunified confederal state, which is the genuine way of national resurrection.   The South Korean authorities should refrain from  acts of delaying the reunification by  wasting time with the infeasible \"engagement policy\" and take the road the north  and the entire nation have  chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should change themselves, not  inducing others to bring about changes.\r\n   They should drop a silly illusion about their masters, the United States and Japan, and throw off the yoke of a servant.\r\n   If they miss the chance, it will never come again. \r\n\r\n"

The battle took place in Pochon county, Ryanggang Province in the northern part of Korea.\r\n   The Japanese imperialists illegally occupied Korea, strengthened colonial ruling machines in the middle of the 1930s and enforced the repressive policy of allowing no slightest anti-Japanese movement of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They drove the people hard into the expanding military  establishments in the northern part of Korea with a view to making continental invasion.\r\n   At this juncture, the President Kim Il Sung organized and commanded the Pochonbo battle to give the Korean people a dawn of national liberation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President personally commanded the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army  to break through frontier defenses, loudly advertised by the Japanese imperialists as a \"wall of iron\", and advanced to Pochonbo.\r\nBy his signal of attack, the KPRA soldiers raided in a flash a police substation, a farm test ground, Myon administration  office  and other ruling organs of the enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the victorious battle, he made a speech before the cheering crowd.
