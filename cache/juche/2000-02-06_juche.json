He wrote it in early November, Juche 88 (1999) before his return home after receiving medical treatment in China under the loving care of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the note O Ik Je wrote about the loving care shown by Kim Jong Il for him and the leader's greatness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted that he was treated under such tender care that details of his treatment were daily reported to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSuch love was something which his parents failed to show for him, he added, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I received news that General Secretary gave an on-site guidance to the Kwangmyongsong saltern. I have never heard in 70 years of my life a leader is so considerate of even salt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is, indeed, the greatest of the great men of the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The most precious truth I have learned in two years of my life under his care is that the capitalist society is the place to where one should not go again and that a socialist society is a place good to live in forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   True socialism is Juche-based socialism under which  I live. Future for mankind in the 21st century is Juche-based socialism gaining victory after victory under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under his leadership the people of the DPRK carried out the \"arduous march\" and the forced march for a final victory and they are sure to emerge victorious in their drive to build a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the solicitude bestowed by Kim Jong Il upon him is immeasurably great, he vowed to devote himself to the sacred cause of reunification to repay that. \r\n\r\n"

Because they need this process before igniting a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Pointing out that this smear campaign over the \"suspected kidnapping\" is being conducted under a carefully worked out plan, the  article demands the Japanese authorities stop this campaign at once. \r\n\r\n"
