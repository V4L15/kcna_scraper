But France rejected his offer as it would impose nuclear disaster not only to the Vietnamese army but to its army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the U.S. is a nuclear war state that does not rule out a preemptive nuclear attack on any country which it considers an obstacle to realizing its ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a nuclear criminal state which developed and used nuclear weapons to inflict nuclear disasters on lots of people for the first time in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In August 1945, the U.S. dropped A-bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki, claiming hundreds of thousands of casualties in Hiroshima alone and turning everything in the cities into ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sought to use nuclear weapons during the Korean war in the subsequent period, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was admitted by the Japanese chief executive in recent days, Japan agreed in secrecy on the introduction of nuclear weapons to Japan in an attempt to unleash a nuclear war in Northeast Asia in the 1960s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a state keen on provoking a nuclear war as it threatened humankind with nuclear weapons and has never given up its ambition to put the world under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to provoke a nuclear war are part of its moves to realize the ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its strategy for world domination is, in essence, a strategy for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is its scenario for aggression to deploy nuclear weapons in different parts of the world and ignite a nuclear war by using them as outposts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the U.S. has steadily deployed nuclear strike means in strategically important vantage areas of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It deployed 60 percent of the forces of the nuclear submarines in the Asia-Pacific region including the waters around the Korean peninsula and put in place an emergency nuclear strike system against those on the list of its targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks a military edge with nuclear weapons as decisive means for realizing the ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, it is putting spurs to the modernization of nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mulling disbursing one trillion U.S. dollars for the modernization of strategic nuclear weapons in the 30 years to come and allocating most of them in the 4-6 year period after the year 2020 so that it may reach a peak level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It plans to squander 17.6 billion U.S. dollars, the biggest ever, for additionally introducing 10 Virginia-class high-performance nuclear submarines to the U.S. navy by 2018.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, in a nutshell, the present day U.S. nuclear policy, to hold an unchallenged edge in the military field through the modernization of nuclear weapons and induce other countries to dismantle nuclear weapons and deter them from developing and possessing nuclear weapons in a bid to carry out its strategy for world domination as quickly as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an action of the U.S. is an extremely dangerous criminal act of sparking off worldwide nuclear arms race and increasing the nuclear threats. It is also a blatant challenge and a mockery of humankind desirous of nuclear disarmament.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear armed buildup in different parts of the world and its modernization of nuclear weapons are inviting military counteraction by countries in the region, triggering off worldwide nuclear arms race.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that the U.S. is an arch criminal posing constant nuclear threat to humankind and sparking arms race."

Closely following its lurch to the Right, the world is stunned by such an undisguised state-sponsored attempt of Japan to change the international order which has been abided by since the end of World War II.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an aim sought by Japan to reemerge as an ordinary state \"capable of fighting a war\" free from its post-war system as early as possible by blatantly challenging the international community calling for eradicating the history of fascism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revival of militarism has begun to be potentially dangerous. Japan is emerging a war force with considerable military capability under the patronage of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such move is getting more serious as it is timed to coincide with the shift of the U.S. strategic pivot to Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military operational sphere of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) has expanded to Asia-Pacific from the vicinity of Japan and its military strategy has been fully converted to the one for preemptive attack from \"the exclusive defense\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are now tightening \"alliance\" with the U.S. under the pretext of exercising the right to collective self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is their view that the \"tightened Japan-U.S. alliance\" is prerequisite to ensuring \"peace and security\" in the region and this is impossible without Japan's exercise of the right to collective self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, it is their contention that Japan-U.S. alliance might be reduced to a mere name in case the SDF can neither protect the U.S. warships from the attack of hostile forces nor intercept their missiles flying to attack its mainland while conducting joint military actions with the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan, as a war criminal state, is banned from having an army as its regular forces, deprived of its right of belligerency and the right to participate in a war, and allowed to exercise only the right to individual self-defense by law in face of the strong demand of the international community after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries, always displeased with this, have established a legal foundation for ensuring the overseas military activities of the SDF, as evidenced by its adoption of \"the law on coping with contingency in the vicinity of Japan\", \"the law on special measures against terrorism\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan failed to hurl the troops of the SDF into overseas military operations, afraid of the public pressure at home and abroad. But entering the new century, it has drastically expanded the sphere of the activities of the SDF even to the Indian Ocean in the new century under the pretext of \"supporting the U.S.\" as if it had got a golden opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has thus become able to hurl all forces of the SDF into overseas under that pretext though it is not exposed to direct attack from outside.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks not to miss the opportunity to do so now that the U.S. is concentrating its forces on Asia-Pacific, pursuant to its pivot-to-Asia strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent formal support voiced by Obama for the intention of Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense is little short of putting spurs to Japan's militarism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Japan's act of calling back the departed soul of militarism will only bring disasters not only to itself but to the U.S. and the rest of the world. The road taken by Japan at present is the one for reemerging a war state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should keep sharp vigilance against Japan oblivious of the lesson taught by its defeat."
