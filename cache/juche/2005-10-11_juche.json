Paektu born of Heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n You have markedly strengthened the WPK into a guiding force of the Songun revolution, taking firm hold on the army as required by the changed situation and revolutionary practices, and firmly defended Juche-oriented socialism and sovereignty of the Korean nation in the acute political and military confrontation with the imperialists and brought about a radical turn in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation, relying on its matchless might. This is a historic exploit of special mention as it has strikingly demonstrated the sagacity and invincibility of the leadership of the WPK to the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Juche-oriented idea and theory of building a vanguard party and invincible policy of struggle set forth by the President and you the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front has grown strong to be the patriotic vanguard leading the movement of people from all walks of life for independence, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will hold high the banner of the historic June 15 joint declaration to put stronger spurs to the march for national reunification with the might of national cooperation and conduct a vigorous struggle to foil the moves of the U.S. imperialists and the pro-U.S. conservative forces to block reunification and for a war against the north and thus fulfill the heavy duty before the times and history in the sacred struggle to build a great prosperous powerful reunified country on this land of three thousand-ri.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Ridicules U.S. \"Advise\" over \"Human Rights Issue\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- The United States is busy spreading rumors about a step taken recently by the DPRK not to receive international humanitarian aid in a bid to cater to its political taste.\r\n The \"Committee on North Korean Human Rights\", a non-governmental human rights organization of the U.S. invited official and unofficial political figures to a seminar in Washington on September 26 to slander the system in the DPRK, claiming that the food shortage there should be viewed in linkage with \"the absence of elementary human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theme of the seminar \"starvation and human rights\" itself was intended to hurl mud at the DPRK as it was attended by representatives from such institutions of the administration as the U.S. Department of State and the Agency of International Development and institutes and NGOs exerting influence on the government's policy making including Brookings Institute. There is, therefore, no worth considering what was discussed at the seminar.\r\n What merits attention is that the seminar was ostensively aimed at the \"separation of politics and humanitarianism\" but, in actuality, it totally helped the U.S. implement its policy of using food aid as a lever for pressuring the DPRK. This only revealed the vulgarity and double-dealing tactics of the U.S. conservative politicians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already officially notified to the UN and international organizations, the DPRK decided to conclude the international humanitarian aid as the humanitarian situation has remarkably improved in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no need for others to say this or that about the DPRK's step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether to receive humanitarian aid or not is a matter to be decided by the DPRK, the master. It is an issue pertaining to its sovereign right. \r\n For anyone to take issue with this matter is little short of interfering in the internal affairs of other country to serve his ulterior purpose. This is, at the same time, as bad an act as defiling the sincere efforts of international organizations and various countries for humanitarian aid. \r\n The U.S. slandered the system in the DPRK, deliberately linking humanitarian aid with \"human rights\". This self-exposes that it has used humanitarian aid for its sinister political purpose such as an aim to \"bring down the system\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. has used the \"human rights issue\" as well as the nuclear issue as main leverage for escalating tensions and isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. advise given to someone over \"human rights issue\" can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such problems as \"weapons of mass destruction\" and \"starvation\" are products of the military threat and economic blockade imposed by the U.S. upon the DPRK for more than half a century, pursuant to its hostile policy toward the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has a way to overcome its difficulties as they are temporary and its people are making big successes in the course of surmounting them.\r\n There is nothing insurmountable for the DPRK as long as there is a system chosen by its people and a solid independent economic foundation and strong potential built up for several decades with much efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Opposing this or that issue against other issues in a bid to slander the political system and way of life in other country is a human rights abuse.\r\n Explicitly speaking once again, human rights represent state sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This reality teaches a lesson that it is a delusion to expect human rights apart from state sovereignty and protect them without the use of force and there is no genuine solution to the \"human rights issue\" unless the U.S. makes a switchover in its policy to use the \"human rights issue\" as an all-powerful lever for interfering in the internal affairs of other country and overturning its system. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "WPK's Sixty-year-long History Lauded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 10 (KCNA) -- Papers here Monday editorially stress that the 60-year-long history of the Workers' Party of Korea is a glorious history which has recorded great victories and epochal changes.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says that the WPK has been strengthened into the party of Kim Il Sung, its founder, for tens of years and is now demonstrating its dignity as a revolutionary party intensely loyal to his cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the WPK is a glorious one as it has left the most brilliant trace in the popular masses' noble cause for independence and socialism, the cause of building a revolutionary party in our era, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History has never seen such a patriotic party as the WPK which has creditably discharged its noble mission and duty for the nation, weathering through the hardships of the times, such a promising and revolutionary party as the WPK which has victoriously pioneered the road ahead of the country and the revolution with rich fighting experience and seasoned leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the WPK has set an example of the times in party building and activities along the unique road indicated by the Juche idea.\r\n The history of the Party building is characterized by the building of an organizational backbone for founding the party and a mass foundation with a steadfast Juche-based stand and on Songun principle and by the unique settlement of all theoretical and practical problems arising in the party building and activities at every stage as required by the Korean revolution and the specific reality of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the WPK is a proud history in which the cause of man-centered socialism has been successfully led and epoch-making changes brought about. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is proud of having developed Korea, a backward colonial and semi-feudal state even in the mid-20th century, into a strong country, independent in politics, self-sustaining in economy and self-reliant in national defence, and of having created and defended a new socialist life most advantageous in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the WPK is a dignified one as it has firmly maintained its revolutionary character and principle despite grim trials.\r\n The Party has waged the struggle, considering the Juche idea and principle set forth by President Kim Il Sung and the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu as its lifeline in the whole course of its history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution has experienced unprecedented hardship but the Party has always maintained its transparent and steadfast stand to defend its idea and principle and the basic interests of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The passage of times, the replacement of generations and worldwide political tempest and hardships could never change the revolutionary character of the WPK that has been consolidated in its long history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biggest pride of the WPK's history lies in that the Party has been built in a prospective way so as to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche which started with the foundation of the \"Down-with-Imperialism Union.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The high honor and dignity of the Party as the party of Kim Il Sung is infinitely shining thanks to the undisputed authority and political ability of leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is now demonstrating its honor as an invincible militant party which guides the popular masses' cause of independence, the Juche cause of socialism to a brilliant victory under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is a great guide which brightly illumines the way of the popular masses' cause of independence, the cause of socialism in the new century with its invincible Songun revolutionary idea and line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Songun leadership of the great Party, the Korean army and people are fully confident and optimistic about future and the country is demonstrating its dignity as an invincible country strong in ideology, a homeland of the Songun politics in the era of independence.\r\n The Party is the party of an impregnable fortress in which the whole party has formed an organizational integral whole, an integral whole of steadfast idea and will on the basis of the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, the supreme brain of the Songun revolution, is leading the WPK and loyal party members firmly equipped with the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution are forming an iron wall around him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party is demonstrating its might as a revolutionary party which reliably defends the independent dignity of the country and ushers in a brilliant new era of national prosperity in reliance upon the strong military might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party led by Kim Jong Il, a great master of revolutionary party building and a veteran statesman for the century, will always demonstrate its honor as a dignified and powerful revolutionary party which steers the era of independence in the van. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls on all the party members, KPA soldiers and people to uphold Kim Il Sung as eternal leader of the Party and revolution for all ages and eternally glorify his revolutionary history and exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it is the basic mission of the Party to thoroughly apply Kim Jong Il's Songun idea and leadership, the editorial stresses the need to wage a vigorous struggle to model the whole party and society on the Songun idea of Juche and consolidate the Songun revolutionary unity of the entire party and the whole army and all the people around the headquarters of the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
