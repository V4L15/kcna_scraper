            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group's Anti-DPRK Reckless Remarks Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, May 24 (KCNA) -- Confidants of Lee Myung Bak are vying with each other these days to let loose reckless remarks against the DPRK. Shortly ago, the south Korean minister of Unification at a \"forum on the policy toward the north\" urged the north to \"withdraw the stand of rejecting the six-party talks\" and \"stop posing the threat of nuclear test and launching intercontinental ballistic missiles\" and the like. And the presidential secretary for foreign strategy of Chongwadae at a \"seminar\" cried out for making a decision on the final terminal called complete dismantlement of nukes and so on. \n\t\t\t\t\t Mandarins of the ministries of \"National Defence\" and \"Foreign Affairs and Trade\" also vied with each other to let loose similar outbursts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday says in a signed commentary in this regard:   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is very pitiful for the Lee Myung Bak group to say this or that about the just and legitimate measures for self-defence taken by the DPRK, just repeating what the United States said without knowing how the security and peace have been protected on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for all of them to echo the utterances of their U.S. master, feeling neither shame nor disgrace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The United States and its followers have perpetrated silly acts unprecedented in the history of the UN only to prove themselves that they remain unchanged in their policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK, depriving the six-party talks of any justification to go on any longer. This being a hard reality, the group is talking nonsense, pursuant to the policy of the U.S. which brought the talks to collapse. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the U.S. and its followers are compelling the army and people of the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defense in every way. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the present U.S. administration and the Lee Myung Bak group worked hard to stifle the DPRK by force of arms over its satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the group keeps going mad with the moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen, echoing the utterances of the U.S. as it does now, it will have to pay a dear price for its behavior, warns the commentary."
