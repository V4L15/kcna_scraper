New roads criss-cross there to be favorable for the mechanization of farmwork. Their total length is 289 km longer than that of the old ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The successful completion of this great nature-transforming work in North Phyongan Province in a matter of a little more than five months following the great change in Kangwon Province is the fruition of the long-term plan and daring and gigantic operation of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Kim Jong Il visited the province last summer to indicate the order of project to be done for the land realignment and went there again in January this year to direct the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   He clarified concrete ways of carrying out the project such as undertaking land leveling and rezoning in a bold and big way under a long-term plan, obtaining more new land, making an effective use of farming equipment and materials, reclaiming swamps, building well-designed waterways and roads and supplying materials necessary for the construction of structures in the realigned land. He instructed the builders to finish the undertakings one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Soldiers of the Korean People's Army, land builders from different provinces and people from all walks of life of the province turned out as one in the gigantic nature-transforming project of lasting significance and admirably carried it out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n   They honored their quotas for land realignment at 103 percent as of May 10 by displaying great patriotic devotion and mass heroism under the difficult conditions where they were hard pressed for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nPreparations for rice transplantation is now in full swing in 40 km-long Unjon, Pakchon, Ryongchon and Handure and other cooperative plains whose appearance has changed beyond recognition as befits the land of the socialist state. \r\n\r\n"
