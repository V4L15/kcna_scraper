In other words, it seeks to attack China's financial institutions under the pretext of the DPRK's \"illegal transactions\" with China's banks in a bid to urge the Chinese government to agree to appreciating Renminbi and thus cover the deficit in its trade with China.\r\n Sanctions are not a cure-all and there would be no more serious political mistake in its relations with the DPRK than this, the commentary notes, and stresses: The  more tightened sanctions of the U.S. would only reinforce the DPRK's tough stand against the U.S. and encourage it to more dynamically advance along the path chosen by it.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They blustered that any attempt to check this survey would be a gross violation of international law.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article terms this a shameless act that can be done only by those seized by the wild ambition to grab other countries' territories. It goes on: It is a well-known historical fact that the Japanese militarists sent \"Unyo-Maru\" to the waters off Kanghwa Island in 1875 under the pretexts of survey and interview, a provocation against Korea, and, availing themselves of this opportunity, systematically committed invasion of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only those accustomed to overseas aggression who insist other countries' territories belong to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan uses \"marine survey\" and \"exploration\" in the waters off Tok Islet as its pretexts this time but no one can vouch that it will not become so arrogant as to assert that its force should land on the islet to conduct a geological survey there.\r\n It is quite obvious why the Japanese reactionaries set their eyes upon Tok Islet.\r\n The economic value of the islet is not the mere reason why they are giving their eye-teeth for the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The islet is of great military and strategic importance as it is situated close to the Korean Peninsula. It is the calculation of Japan that while frequently raising the issue of the islet it will bring the issue to the International Court of Justice one day.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can get something by making Tok Islet, an alienable part of the territory of Korea, an internationally disputed islet with such poor trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never allow them to realize their territorial ambition to grab Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reckless moves for territorial expansion and its operation to seize Tok Islet is a product of the U.S.-Japan collusion and conspiracy. The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to give up their attempt to seize the islet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Bush administration had better stop the foolish act of inviting misfortune. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n Accusing the Bush administration of having planned to produce 125 nuclear weapons of new type every year and decided to establish a comprehensive nuclear substance production centre to this end, and seeking to use nuclear weapons as conventional weapons in all wars, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is posing the danger of a nuclear war to the world while stepping up the development and production of new type nuclear weapons behind the scene of \"nuclear disarmament\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose Bush forces cry for new \"danger\" to justify their criminal nuclear war policy. Such \"danger\" is, in essence, just a pretext for a preemptive nuclear attack. They have already designated anti-imperialist independent countries including the DPRK and even nuclear weapons states as targets of their nuclear attack.\r\n The reality teaches the countries aspiring after independence and peace to increase their military capacity to cope with the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will bolster war deterrent to cope with the U.S. intensified nuclear war moves and thus reliably defend the gains of revolution and socialism.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun today runs a signed commentary, which censures the farce as an unpardonable bid to negate the homogeneity of the nation, make south Korea multiracial and Americanize it.\r\n To deny the peculiarity and advantages of the homogeneous nation now that dominationism and colonialism are posing a threat to the destiny of weak nations is a treacherous act of weakening the spirit of the nation, the commentary says, and goes on:\r\n The south Korean pro-American traitorous forces advocating the theory of \"multiracial society\" are riffraffs who have not an iota of national soul, to say nothing of the elementary understanding of the view on the nation and social and historic development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the homogeneity of the nation is not kept, the nation and the destiny of individuals cannot be defended from the U.S. dominationist moves and the attempt of the Japanese reactionaries for invasion of Korea, which is revealed in their claim to Tok Islet, cannot be checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory of \"multiracial society\" is a poison and anti-reunification logic aimed to emasculate the basic idea in the era of independent reunification. The anti-national logic is advocated in south Korea, contrary to the aspiration of the fellow countrymen. This is ascribable to the criminal attempt of the pro-American elements including the Grand National Party to make the north and the south different in lineages, block the June 15 era of reunification and seek the permanent division of the nation and the manipulation of the U.S. behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary calls upon the people from all walks of life in south Korea to decisively reject the anti-national moves of the sycophantic traitorous forces to tarnish the lineage of the Korean nation and obliterate it, bereft of the Juche character and national character.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The independent reunification of Korea can be achieved only through a resolute anti-U.S. patriotic struggle. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's cause of independent reunification represents a struggle against the U.S. standing in its way. \r\n The U.S. is chiefly responsible for the split of the Korean nation and a main obstacle to reunification. But for the U.S. occupation, the issue of national reunification would not have cropped up and Koreans would have fully demonstrated their dignity and honor as a homogenous nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior motive of the U.S. is to keep Korea divided into two and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. seeks to perpetuate the split of the Korean nation as it considers the Korean Peninsula as an advanced base for carrying out its strategy for supremacy in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Bush administration's policy towards the DPRK is an extremely dangerous and high-handed policy of aggression as it is set to resort to means to exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group, displeased with the inter-Korean relations that have favorably improved since the adoption of the north-south joint declaration, has left no means untried to block reconciliation and unity among Koreans. The desperate efforts made by the U.S. to bring down the DPRK are clearly evidenced by the outcries made by Bush listing the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\", its announcement of the \"nuclear posture review report\" which made a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK an established fact, the largest-ever test nuclear war exercises staged by it, its dangerous attempt to escalate its \"anti-terrorism  war\" into the Korean Peninsula, its ceaseless nuclear racket against the DPRK and its moves to lay a siege to the DPRK behind the scene, etc. \r\n All Koreans who wish to be independent and want to exalt the national dignity should turn out as one in nationwide anti-U.S. resistance and drive the U.S. imperialist aggressors out of south Korea.         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Plan to Reorganize UN Command Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- If the U.S. seek to ignite the second Korean war by introducing multinational forces despite our repeated warnings, the army of the DPRK will have no option but to take a decisive and resolute measure to contain them before they go into action, warned a spokesman for the Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army in a statement on Thursday assailing the U.S. plan to reorganize the \"UN Command\" into a \"multinational coalition command\" on an expansion basis. \r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brought military personnel from those countries which participated in the Korean war to south Korea under the nonsensical pretext that duties for the implementation of the Armistice Agreement have increased. It allows them to interfere in the activities of officials concerned of the north and the south on the railways and roads under the joint control of the north and the south and even permits them to strut about in the joint security area in Panmunjom under the guise of \"guides for visitors\".\r\n These disturbing moves of the U.S. allies before and after the U.S. announcement of its plan for the reorganization of the \"UN Command\" go to clearly prove that the U.S. has already begun its operation to build a framework of \"the multinational coalition command\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Command\" is nothing but a by-product from the armistice mechanism, which should have been dismantled long ago. Yet, the U.S. mulls reorganizing it on an expansion basis. This is a high-handed practice swimming against the trend of the times and defying the demand of the Koreans and the UN resolution calling for the dismantlement of the \"command\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind such moves of the U.S. is a sinister strategic aim. \r\n It seeks to continue using the signboard of the \"UN forces\" for justifying its forces' presence in south Korea and perpetuating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. organized the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Command,\" for fear that it might lose the justification for its forces' presence in south Korea in case the \"UN Command\" was disbanded according to the resolution adopted at the 30th UN General Assembly in 1975. Now that the issue of transferring the right of operation to south Korea has been placed high on the agenda, the U.S. again got worried about the disbandment of the \"command\". This prompted Washington to reorganize the \"command\", a U-turn from its former stand, in a bid to find a pretext for perpetuating its forces' presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the only aim sought by the U.S. in its moves for the reorganization of the \"command\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It pursues another sinister strategic purpose to stifle the DPRK militarily, contain China and Russia, and furthermore, expand the sphere of its domination in Asia.\r\n The Korean army and people can never remain a passive on-looker to this development as the U.S. is contemplating the introduction of multinational forces to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea, not content with having kept the Korean nation divided into two for more than 60 years since its occupation of it. \r\n The KPA always remains highly vigilant against the U.S. bellicose forces' war hysteria and is closely following the moves of the allies of the U.S. dancing to its tune.\r\n The U.S. had better disband the illegal \"UN Command\" without delay just as demanded by the unbiased public opinion and the UN resolution and pull back its forces from south Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
