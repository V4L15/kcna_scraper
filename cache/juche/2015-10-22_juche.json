            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Denounces U.S. for Mulling Staging Provocative Naval Maneuver \r\nPyongyang, October 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK Thursday gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA as regards the U.S. moves to disturb the security and escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula again:\n\t\t\t\t\tAs already known, the U.S. is mulling staging a large joint naval maneuver with the south Korean navy by hurling the U.S. nuclear-powered carrier Ronald Reagan together with cruiser and Aegis destroyers into the waters off Pusan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is an open challenge to the fair and aboveboard proposal of the DPRK and unanimous desire of the peace-loving people of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs re-clarified by the DPRK several times, it recently advanced an important proposal for concluding a peace treaty as early as possible to remove the danger of war and create a durable and peaceful environment on the Korean Peninsula under the situation where it is impossible to prevent any clash and defuse the danger of a new war any longer with the existing Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNevertheless, the U.S. is challenging the above-said proposal by introducing the nuclear-powered carrier and other war means into south Korea again. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe protracted efforts for dialogue for the denuclearization of the peninsula failed because of the U.S. ceaseless nuclear blackmail and nuclear war exercises against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is still claiming that denuclearization is priority while aggravating the situation on the peninsula through escalating military provocations. This is a far-fetched assertion and sophism reminiscent of the logic of a highway robber who had no opportunity of getting higher education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality proves that how premature the discussion on the denuclearization of the peninsula was and how urgent the conclusion of a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. desperately clings to its reckless moves for nuclear confrontation while persistently shunning our call for concluding a peace treaty, it will only suffer a bitter failure and regret for it."

This was abused for justifying the ruling conservative forces' pro-Japanese and pro-U.S. dictatorship and inciting confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The struggle of south Koreans from all walks of life resulted in replacing the system by \"the system of screening textbooks\" in 2003. But the conservative authorities are making desperate efforts to retrieve the antiquated system from the dumping ground of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The announcement of the controversial system set the stage for adding pages embellishing the past dictatorial era and justifying the moves for confrontation with the fellow countrymen to the history textbooks for middle and high school students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is attributable to the south Korean authorities who are working hard to revive the \"yusin\" dictatorship, drive the livelihood of people into dire destitution and achieve \"unification through absorption\" after labeling the fellow countrymen in the north as enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the south Korean authorities have been forsaken by the people for their crimes committed against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The daily-mounting anti-\"government\" struggle of the south Koreans casts dark shadow over the ruling quarters' ambition for a longer stay in power and their confrontation moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, they crafted the above-said system in order to attain their sinister purpose at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They claimed that the system is meant for the unity of the people.
