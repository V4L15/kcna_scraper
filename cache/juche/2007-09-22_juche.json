They also wrote revolutionary dramas and novels to enrich the mass culture and art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the hard-fought battles of the Fatherland Liberation War, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, who inherited the traditions of the anti-Japanese war, made front-line musical instruments and danced and sang songs full of conviction in the victory and optimism to strike the enemy with terror. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the periods of the postwar rehabilitation and construction and the socialist construction, too, the Korean people built the gigantic creations for the development and prosperity of the country in different parts of the country, singing the revolutionary songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today officers' families of the KPA and workers in Hungnam have created a model of the mass culture and art in the Songun era to dynamically call the people all over the country to the construction of a great, prosperous and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that the tradition of the revolutionary mass culture and art established during the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle is being carried forward with credit in the DPRK.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now speeding up the development of ultra-modern weapons and the moves to establish their own missile defence system in a bid to boost their capability to wage a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by them through these war maneuvers is to create a tense situation and push ahead with the establishment of a war-time system in the country. They are hell-bent on the war exercises, absurdly asserting that the security of Japan is being threatened by neighboring countries. And they are keen to create a war atmosphere throughout the country and woo the Japanese to sensitively react to the issue of war in a bid to build a public environment favorable for scrapping the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and working out a war constitution instead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are leaving no means untried to realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere,\" which they failed to do in the past, availing themselves of the changed international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Peace\" and \"combating terrorism\" much touted by the Japanese reactionaries are, in essence, nothing but a slogan of war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
