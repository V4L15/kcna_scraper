            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM on DPRK visit of special envoy of U.S. President \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK today gave the following answers to questions put by KCNA as regards the visit to the DPRK by a special envoy of the U.S. President:\r\n As already reported, James Kelly, U.S. assistant secretary of state for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, visited the DPRK from October 3 to 5 in the capacity of special envoy of the U.S. President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expecting that there would be a way of solving the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. through dialogue as the Bush administration told us that it would dispatch the special envoy in a bid to explain its Korea policy and stand toward the resumption of dialogue, we received him and heard his words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the special envoy, raising \"issues of concern\", took a high handed and arrogant attitude by claiming, that the DPRK-Japan relations and inter-Korean relations as well as the DPRK-U.S. relations would be smoothly settled only when the DPRK first meets the U.S. unilateral demand such as nuclear and missile and conventional armed forces and \"human rights\" issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-raised \"issues of concern\" are nothing but a product of its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, the special envoy's explanation made it clear that the Bush administration is pursuing not a policy of dialogue but a hardline policy of hostility to bring the DPRK to its knees by force and highhanded practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since it has been confirmed that the Bush administration refuses to delist the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil\" and a target of \"its preemptive nuclear attack\" and still maintains its unilateral hardline policy of hostility towards the DPRK, the latter clarified to the envoy its principled stand towards such position before his departure from here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such unchanged policy of the U.S. compels the DPRK to take all necessary countermeasures, pursuant to the army-based policy whose validity has been proven.    \r\n   \r\n"

But it is impossible to give full play to it only when they are not awakened ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The popular masses that are conscious of their class interest can fully display their revolutionary ability and victoriously carry out the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche idea newly propounds that the role of ideological consciousness is constantly enhanced with the development of the revolutionary movement, social movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary movement, social movement demands a high level of consciousness of man because of its own nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The role of ideology is raised unprecedentedly in the course of revolutionary struggle and it is also related with the characteristics of the revolutionary idea of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from this Juche-oriented understanding of the decisive factor in the development of the social movement, one can draw a practical conclusion that one should always take the ideology of man as the main in the revolutionary struggle, the social movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As President Kim Il Sung propounded for the first time in history that the independent ideological consciousness of popular masses plays a decisive role in the revolutionary struggle, it made it possible to newly expound the position and role of ideology in social cognition and to formulate a scientific understanding of the decisive factor in the development of social movement.    \r\n\r\n"

Its walls built with trimmed limestone were neatly whitewashed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb facing the south is 7.6 m long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discovered on the remaining walls of the tomb were gorgeous murals showing a procession of people, a hunting scene, warriors, life inside houses, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The corners of the chambers are decorated with paintings showing huge red color pillars so that they look like the inside of a dwelling house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mural paintings are masterpieces which depict different things in detail with various colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Found in the tomb were a gold-copper ring, an ornamental silver hairpin, a coffin nail coated with silver sheet, earthenware and other relics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Archaeologists said it was first time for them to unearth such a tomb with mural paintings of diverse themes as that tomb since Juche 65 (1976). The architectural style and theme of mural paintings of the tomb suggest that it was built in the first half of the 5th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newly discovered tomb is one more precious cultural heritage of the Korean people as it is a clear reminder of the power of Koguryo, a strong state in the east that existed for a thousand years, people's keen interest in martial art, developed architecture and refined skill of painting.    \r\n\r\n"
