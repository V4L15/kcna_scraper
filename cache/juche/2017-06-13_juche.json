Sin embargo, a fin de encubrir sus crimenes tacharon intencionalmente los sucesos en el parte sobre trabajos de \"Chongwadae\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso constituye un crimen pesimo que engano y burlo a la poblacion surcoreana y ademas una traicion proyanqui. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCausan una gran indignacion de los habitantes las locuras de la capa militar que encubrio hasta la fecha la introduccion de las 6 plataformas correspondientes a una bateria de THAAD. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante toda la trayectoria de despliegue del demonio belico, la traidora Park Geun-hye y los compinches de la capa militar enganaron a la poblacion surcoreana y obedecieron a yanqui. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu posicion \"3No\" sirve de un ejemplo representativo del engano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando circulaba una opinion publica sobre el emplazamiento de THAAD en el suelo surcoreano, la banda de Park abogo por su posicion de \"3NO\" diciendo que \"no habian negociaciones ni resultados porque no hubo la peticion de EE.UU.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwan Jin, que era en 2014 el ministro de Defensa Nacional, habia chismeado que el \"THAAD esta en discusion en EE.UU. y que el pais no tiene el plan de introducirlo y ubicarlo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, detras de esa cortina, no cesaron las conversaciones oficiales y extraoficiales entre EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea y se ha declarado oficialmente en julio de 2016 la resolucion de ubicacion de THAAD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa capa militar surcoreana titere se entrego a su amo norteamericano que intenta ubicar el sistema antimisil aprovechando la desordenada situacion politica causada por la dimision de Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos compinches militares mintieron a la poblacion diciendo que no instalarian el sistema antimisil antes de las \"elecciones presidenciales\". Pero, por la noche avanzada de finales de abril pasado introdujeron de manera sorpresiva en Songju de la provincia de Kyongsang del Norte la mayoria de los equipos de THAAD inclusive el radar X-Band. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas 4 plataformas en cuestion tambien fueron introducidas bajo tales enganos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra claramente que Park y los sobrevivientes de la capa militar son la horda de traidores enloquecidos en el servilismo a granes potencias y se valen de todos los medios y maneras para congraciarse con su patron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera imposible evitar las calamidades originadas por el despliegue de THAAD sin eliminar a los remanentes de Park que mantienen su vida a cambio de servilismo a grandes potencias y sacrifican sin vacilacion alguna a sus habitantes como victima de la guerra nuclear ni liquidar las maldades causadas por ellos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes surcoreanos exigen unanimemente a las actuales autoridades la pena capital de estos traidores que obedeciendo a yanqui, cometieron los delincuentes inauditos ante la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara atenuar la colera sobre el caso sensacional, las autoridades surcoreanas insisten en la investigacion sobre Kim Kwan Jin, Han Min Gu y otros involucrados, por una parte y por la otra, toman una posicion de no retirar el emplazamiento de THAAD diciendo de la \"alianza\" con el pais norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves del presente incidente, ellas deben tener bien presente que podran danar los intereses principales de la nacion y darles el arruinamiento, si siguen doblegandose a la presion bandidesca de EE.UU."
