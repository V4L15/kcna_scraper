Taesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe park consists of the district for comprehensive education of history, district for the display of historic relics, modern district, folk village district, folk playing district, park district of Mt. Paektu and Mt. Kumgang and the management and operation district. It is an open-air history museum where visitors can see and experience at first hand the Korean history and folk custom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter hearing a report from commanding officers that the park has been successfully completed, Kim Jong Un went round its various places.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the education district at the entrance of the park, he went round visual boards for comprehensive education of history set up in the form of a large mural painting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people have acquired an advantageous national identity, taking the road of independent development for a long historic period, he said, adding only when the younger generation know about this well, can they deeply grasp the Korean nation-first spirit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the district for the display of historic relics he saw round picture boards and primitive straw-thatched huts showing the lifestyle of primitive people, Mausoleum of King Tangun, dolmens and pipha-shape daggers during ancient Korea, Mausoleum of King Tongmyong, monument to the Mausoleum of King Kwanggaetho and Kumggang Temple Pagoda during Koguryo period, Miruk Temple Pagoda of Paekje, Hwangryong Temple Pagoda of Silla and a stone lantern    during Palhae period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tViewing structures of reduced sizes at the modern district such as Kim Il Sung Square, Grand People's Study House, Korean Revolution Museum, Mansudae Art Theatre and West Sea Barrage not only from distance but at close range, he was satisfied to learn that the soldier-builders set right the defects mentioned by him when visiting there in January.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeeing the structure depicting leader Kim Jong Il's birthplace in the Paektusan secret camp, he underlined the need to plant trees appropriate for the building so that its environment may look like its original one and successfully conduct afforestation so that there may be a clear distinction among different lots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStanding before a miniature of the Korean Revolution Museum, he said when people come there they would think of the statues of Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on Mansu Hill, calling for successfully erecting their statues and group sculptures of subsidiary theme. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to set up a miniature of Panmunjom symbolic of division so that people may harden their resolution to reunify the country in our generation without fail, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe gave an instruction to construct in the park miniatures of the Three-Revolution Museum and the People's Theatre and other buildings newly built or those omitted as the area of the park is so vast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round the folk village district, he was pleased to learn that typical structures belonging to the primitive age, period of ancient Korea, ancient period and periods of Koguryo and Koryo retain their former glory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the miniature of the government office of Koguryo, he said the building was constructed well on the principle of historicism, adding if models of soldiers of government army wearing uniforms of the Koguryo period are set up at the entrance to the government office, visitors will think of aspects of society in that period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe also went round the Korean Folk Museum newly built inside the park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter going round the Palhae Palace, he saw historic relics unearthed by soldier-builders of KPA Large Combined Unit 630 in the course of construction and pencil drawings done by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that going round the park nearing its completion, he missed Kim Jong Il very much. He said with deep emotion how happy he would have been, if he had accompanied Kim Jong Il who personally initiated its construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe called for managing and operating the park well to help people and school youth and children more deeply grasp the Juche character and national identity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe underlined the need to build the world district, too, at the park so that they may have profound knowledge about history and tradition of other countries while seeing buildings of various countries of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe enjoyed large reed ensemble \"Song of devotedly defending the leader, looking up to the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun\" presented by soldier-builders of KPA Large Combined Unit 630.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe gave the highest appreciation to the large combined unit, saying it has performed shining labor feats on the forefront of socialist construction by powerfully demonstrating the revolutionary soldier spirit and the fighting spirit of devotedly implementing the leader's instructions in the construction of the park. He, at the same time, extended thanks of the KPA Supreme Commander to the unit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Jang Song Thaek, Kim Jong Gak, Choe Thae Bok, Pak To Chun, Kim Yong Il, Kim Yang Gon, Kim Phyong Hae, Mun Kyong Dok, Kim Kyong Ok, Pak Thae Song, Hwang Pyong So, Kim Pyong Ho and Ma Won Chun."

Korea Is Vivid Expression of Hostile Policy toward DPRK: Foreign Ministry Spokesman\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman released the following statement Friday with the lapse of 67 years since the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. occupation of south Korea in the first days of Cold War between the East and the West was aimed to secure a bridgehead for realizing its strategy for the military domination of the Eurasian continent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis quenched the nation's desire for complete sovereignty of the country and its independent development and led to the territorial and national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the first day of its presence in south Korea, the U.S. trained pro-U.S. forces and prodded them to escalate confrontation with the fellow countrymen in its ceaseless moves to launch invasion and ignite a new war to seize whole Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor more than half a century the DPRK has fallen a victim to the U.S. forces in south Korea which regarded the DPRK as the No. 1 target of attack. This compelled the DPRK to build its own nuclear deterrent even by tightening its belt to cope with the nuclear threats from the world's biggest nuclear weapons state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. forces' presence in south Korea turned the Korean Peninsula into the world's biggest hotspot and it has become a malignant tumor that seriously threatens peace and stability in Northeast Asia and, furthermore, the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPursuant to the new defense strategy of amassing armed forces in the Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. seeks its forces' permanent presence in south Korea while saying that their mission is to \"maintain regional peace\", not just to \"defend\" south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. forces in south Korea are becoming forward-deployed forces and \"strategic mobile forces\" whose nature and role are to contain China and Russia and hold military hegemony in the region. Here the south Korean puppet forces are playing the role of colonial stooges tasked with the duty of executing the U.S. war policy for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is increasing the frequency and scale of military exercises of various codenames to boost the U.S. mobility and attack capabilities under the pretext of coping with \"provocations\" and \"nuclear threats\" from the DPRK, thereby pushing the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. persistent denial of the conclusion of a peace treaty with the DPRK is aimed to keep the DPRK as its enemy, a pretext for its forces' permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is the most vivid expression of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as its forces remain in south Korea, the U.S. is not entitled to claim that it has no hostile intent toward the DPRK and no one will believe it, either.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. continued hostile policy toward the DPRK will only force the DPRK to bolster its nuclear deterrent, making the prospect for solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula gloomier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is a common task of parties concerned desirous of lasting peace and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. seeks to keep its forces in south Korea, contrary to the unanimous desire of the regional people, it had better get itself ready to taste an all-out war with the DPRK."

This indicates that the regime does not hesitate to perpetrate political and military provocations in a bid to do harm to fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the ulterior intention of the Lee regime to realize its wild ambition for invading the DPRK by reducing all parts of Korea to ashes and making them drenched with blood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the unshakable resolution and will of the DPRK not to pardon any force pursuing the policy of confrontation with compatriots and seeking a war against the DPRK in denial of the inter-Korean declarations. The destiny of the nation can never be a plaything of philistines, concludes the article."
