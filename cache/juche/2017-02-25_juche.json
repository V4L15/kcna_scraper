She also branded the proposal for military authorities' talks between the north and the south which the DPRK made in order to prevent military conflict between the two sides and defuse tension on the Korean peninsula as the one aimed at \"conflicts among south Koreans\" and \"hobbled international efforts for putting sanctions on the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At \"commemoration of March 1\" and on several other occasions she went frantic, calling for \"making the north regime collapse through international cooperation.\" She even egged citizens of the DPRK on to \"defect from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She shut down the Kaesong Industrial Park, a product of the June 15 era and the last lifeline of the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, lots of south Korean businesses who had been dependent on the park suffered huge economic losses amounting to billions of U.S. dollars either to go bankrupt or to be reduced to small ones. This also left more than 200,000 south Korean workers jobless overnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the traitor's fascist oppression, the Unified Progressive Party, a legitimate political party, was forced into disbandment on absurd charges of attempted rebellion and Jaju Minbo which advocated independence and progress was forcibly closed. A great many organizations comprising people of various social standings which stood for democracy of society and right to existence were branded as \"parasite-like entity\", \"enemy inside south Korea\" and \"enemy-benefiting organization\" and over 3,000 cultural organizations and nearly 10,000 people of culture and arts were blacklisted to be subject to all kinds of political persecution and suppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From mid-April to early May 2015 Park hurled riot police to fire over 79,000 liters of water with cannons at participants of peaceful rallies and demonstrations. The amount of water reached as many as 40,000 liters at night of May Day alone and poisonous gas that was spread in this period reached more than 700 liters or 3.7 times the total amount used the year before.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea's \"national debt\" reached 1,170 billion US dollars, hitting all time high, the number of the unemployed stood at more than 4.5 million or  23.3 percent increase over the first year of her office and that of the underemployed reached over 10 million while the rate of unemployed young people registered 34.6 percent, an all-time high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 8.5 million families accounting for 47 percent of the families in south Korea barely make their ends meet in rented rooms, small cells, plastic houses, plank houses and cardboard houses. More than 5.7 million under the absolute poverty line barely make their living, being unable to earn the minimum living expenses. The number of suicides is on the steady increase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ferry Sewol sinking disaster, MERS chaos, humidifier disinfectant case and other cases make people tremble with anger as they are deliberate massacres committed by the traitor who does not regard people's lives worth those of flies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park still had the face to hurt the DPRK, flower garden full of love for the people, while shelving vices in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She set up the UN \"office on human rights in north\", an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization, in south Korea which her predecessors dared not and in March last year retrieved anti-reunification document that had been disregarded at the \"National Assembly\" for more than 10 years, thus enacting \"law on human rights in the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park began man-hunting targeting citizens of the DPRK. When operations were conducted to lure and abduct inhabitants of the north, she directly controlled and monitored them after coiling herself up in the underground air-raid shelter in Chongwadae, thus displaying her skill as a boss in skirt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year this dragon lady abducted in group in broad daylight 12 women citizens of the DPRK who had been working overseas and have kept them away from outside contacts and have pressed them to \"surrender\" through shuddering spiritual and physical pain, persecution, appeasement, deception, threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans will certainly mete out the most merciless and severest punishment to her so that there would no repetition of such tragedy in which serpents like Park bring harm of all descriptions to the nation."

            "content": "IRP enumera crimenes de Park Geun-hye cometidos en 4 anos de su mandato\r\nPyongyang, 25 de febrero (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que se cumplen 4 anos desde cuando la traidora surcoreana Park Geun-hye se hizo duena de Chongwadae mediante la sucia manipulacion de la opinion publica y el golpe de Estado politico caracterizado por el engano al pueblo, el Instituto de la Reunificacion de la Patria (IRP) hizo publica el dia 25 una carta blanca para revelar sus crimenes cometidos durante ese periodo.\n\t\t\t\t\tEse cuatrienio fue el tiempo de indignacion, pesadilla, verguenza y afrenta en que esa traidora sofoco la aspiracion nacional a la reunificacion, impuso intolerables desgracias y sufrimientos a la poblacion surcoreana y vendio la dignidad e intereses nacionales a las fuerzas extranjeras, senala el documento y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cientos de ocasiones, la traidora calumnio atrevidamente en lugares publicos la dignidad y el regimen de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el primer ano de su mandato, trazo junto con los belicistas del circulo militar el plan operacional para atacar a precision con misiles los monumentos de homenaje al lider, levantados por doquier de la RPDC, y elaboro hasta la \"lista de los que deben ser eliminados por orden\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn febrero del ano pasado, abogo abiertamente por el \"cambio del poder norcoreano\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu histeria llego al climax cuando ella pronuncio el \"discurso por el Dia de las Fuerzas Armadas\" el primero de octubre del ano pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDijo disparates como \"renuncia de desarrollo de armas nucleares\", \"hambre y represion violenta\" y \"acabar con la provocacion y dominacion antietica del poder norcoreano\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 4 anos, libro en mas de 40 ocasiones como promedio anual los ejercicios belicos de caracter provocativo y agresivo junto con EE.UU. movilizando un millon y cientos de miles de efectivos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn confabulacion con su amo gringo, completo nuevos guiones de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC que en los \"poderes\" anteriores, estaban en discusion o ni habian sido presentados siquiera, y los aplico en los ejercicios de combate real. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDecidio introducir en suelo surcoreano el sistema antimisiles norteamericano THAAD, lo cual es el peor \"merito\" de la maniaca de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalumnio la justa propuesta de la parte connacional sobre la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas como \"ofensiva disfrazada de paz\" y \"dialogo carente de sinceridad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY nego hasta la propuesta de la RPDC de sostener las conversaciones de autoridades militares Norte-Sur para prevenir los choques armados entre ambas partes y aliviar la tension de la Peninsula Coreana calificandola de proyecto para sembrar \"discordias entre los surcoreanos\" y \"quebrar la sancion internacional anti-Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la \"ceremonia por el Primero de Marzo\" y otras ocasiones, dijo que \"hay que fortalecer la colaboracion internacional para lograr el derrumbe del poder norcoreano\" e incito hasta la \"fuga del Norte\" de los ciudadanos de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCerro hasta la Zona Industrial de Kaesong, fruto de la era de reunificacion del 15 de Junio y ultimo hilo de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, muchas empresas surcoreanas sufrieron enormes perdidas economicas valoradas en miles de millones de US$ y mas de 200 mil obreros surcoreanos se quedaron sin empleo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la gobernacion fascista de la traidora Park, el Partido Progresista Unido, legitima organizacion politica, fue disuelto por la fuerza bajo la sospecha de haber trazado un complot de rebelion. Ademas, Jaju Minbo, periodico que abogaba por la independencia y el progreso, tuvo que suspender la publicacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, muchas entidades, que demandaban la democratizacion de la sociedad y el derecho a la subsistencia, fueron estigmatizadas como \"entes nocivos\", \"quintacolumnistas\" y \"entidades proenemigas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas de 3 mil entidades culturales y cerca de 10 mil hombres de cultura y artistas fueron catalogados en la lista negra siendo sometidos al hostigamiento politico de toda indole. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde mediados de abril hasta principios de mayo de 2015, la policia fascista, instigada por la traidora Park, disparo con canones lanzaaguas mas de 79 mil litros contra los participantes en los mitines y manifestaciones de caracter pacifico. Solo en la noche del primero de mayo, su cantidad llego a 40 mil litros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, en ese tiempo fueron usados mas de 700 litros de lacrimogeno, equivalentes a 3.7 veces de toda la cantidad usada en 2014.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el Sur de Corea, la \"deuda estatal\" llego a un billon 170 mil millones de dolares marcando el record de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de desempleados llego a mas de 4 millones y medio con un aumento de 23.3% frente a la cifra del primer ano de mandato y el de subempleados, a 10 millones y el porcentaje de la poblacion juvenil desempleada registro el 34.6%. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas de 8 millones 500 mil familias, 47% de todos los nucleos familiares de la poblacion surcoreana, se ganan la vida a duras penas en los cuartos de alquiler y las casas provisionales y mas de 5 millones 700 mil viven en extrema miseria. A eso se suman los casos de suicidio que se reportan sin parar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante su mandato, Park cometio los crimenes de magnicidio que dejaron consternado a todo el mundo, entre ellos, la tragedia del ferry Sewol, el caso de MERS y el de esterilizante toxico de humidificador.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Park Geun-hye se atrevio a difamar a la RPDC donde se practican las politicas populares en todos los dominios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstalo en el Sur de Corea la \"Oficina de DDHH del Norte\" de la ONU, aparato intrigante anti-RPDC de las fuerzas foraneas, a lo que no se atrevieron ni sus antecesores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn marzo de 2016, fabrico por fin la \"ley de DDHH del Norte\", cuya aprobacion habia sido suspendida en la \"Asamblea Nacional\" durante mas de 10 anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cada operacion de secuestro y rapto a los habitantes norcoreanos, Park demostro su habilidad de la caudilla de gangsteres controlandolos directamente en el refugio antiaereo subterraneo de Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHizo secuestrar a plena luz del dia a las 12 ciudadanas norcoreanas que trabajaban en el extranjero en 2016 y llevarlas al Sur de Corea. Pero, hasta la fecha, encarcela a ellas en celdas y les impone la \"sumision\" con horribles torturas mentales y fisicas, la persecucion, el adormecimiento y engano, la amenaza y chantaje.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos sentenciaran mas implacable y severamente a la traidora Park para que no se repita tal tragedia en la historia nacional."
