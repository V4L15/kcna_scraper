            "content": "4th Conference of KPA Artillery Personnel Held in Presence of Kim Jong Un\r\n Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The fourth conference of artillery personnel of the Korean People's Army (KPA) took place at the April 25 House of Culture on Dec. 3 and 4.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present there were Hwang Pyong So, Pak Yong Sik, Ri Yong Gil and other commanding officers of the KPA, officers of artillery units and sub-units at all levels of the KPA, political officers, officers of military academies and officers and men of sub-units which set an example in the movement of crack shots including the members of the Hero Artillery Piece on Mu Islet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marshal Kim Jong Un was present at the conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un made an opening speech.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the conference is of a great significance in glorifying the exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il for the building of Juche-oriented artillery forces and perfectly rounding off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel as required by the modern warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He declared the conference open, expressing the conviction that the conference would make success in its work thanks to high political enthusiasm and active participation of all its attendants and thus provide a historic landmark in rounding off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel and increasing the invincible might of the Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conference analyzed and reviewed the fulfillment of the tasks set forth by Kim Jong Il in his letter to the participants in the 3rd conference of KPA artillery personnel and successes, experience and lessons gained in the work of implementing the tasks set forth by the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) for the artillery field in recent years, and discussed measures for bringing about a drastic turn in rounding off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A report and speeches were made at the conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un delivered a speech at the conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He extended thanks to all the artillery personnel of the KPA who are standing guard over the sky, land and sea posts of the country along with their beloved artillery pieces even at the moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is most important in rounding off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel is to conduct an ideological campaign all at once for making intensive and saturation firing for on-target impact and thus prepare them to be those strongest in mental power who do not abandon their revolutionary faith even though they may die, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to thoroughly carry out the party's policy of bringing about a turn in the training and make the flames of collective innovations rage in all the training grounds and focus efforts on raising the rate of hits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to increase the power of artillery pieces, it is necessary to step up the work of modernizing artillery hardware as required by the modern warfare, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was taught by Kim Jong Il, a war is not declared in advance and, therefore, it is important to always keep a high alert in order to cope with any unexpected situation on one's own initiative, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on all the commanding officers of the artillery units of the KPA to turn out as one in the struggle for rounding off the combat readiness with the unusual resolution and determination of a self-blasting fighter out for a final battle and thus create a heroic myth of Chollima speed at which they fulfill their mission for bolstering up artillery forces in a matter of one year instead of 10 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also mentioned issues arising in firmly establishing the trait of attaching importance to the artillery in the whole army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The supreme commander of the KPA expressed the conviction that all the artillery personnel would creditably fulfill their mission and duty they have assumed before the times and the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A letter of pledge to Kim Jong Un was adopted at the conference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un made a closing speech.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the fourth conference of KPA artillery personnel would be  brilliantly recorded in the history of building Juche-oriented revolutionary armed forces as a historic conference, a conference for all-out advance of the artillery personnel as it brought about a fundamental turn in making artillery personnel fully combat-ready and ushering in a heyday in increasing the capabilities of the armed forces as required by the four strategic lines for building powerful armed forces set forth by the party and the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called on all the participants in the conference to make charge full of confidence by holding fast to the important guidelines for increasing the capabilities of the artillery forces as clarified by the WPK and become pace-setters and vanguard in the struggle for greeting the 7th Congress of the WPK with shining achievements in increasing the might of the artillery forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He emphasized that a revolutionary turn would be sure to take place in rounding off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel as there are the correct guidance of the WPK and the heroic artillery personnel who are intensely loyal to the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un declared the conference closed, expressing his firm belief that all the participants would fully embody the spirit of the conference and creditably discharge their sacred mission and duty they have assumed before the party, the revolution, the country and its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He extended warm militant salute to the participants in the conference, expressing his expectation and conviction that all of them would thoroughly round off the combat readiness of the artillery personnel amid the high-pitched movement for conducting intensive training in the spirit of Mt. Paektu and becoming crack shots and take the lead in ushering in a heyday in the drive for increasing the military capabilities."

A fierce war on terrorism is going on in Syria, a bomb attack downed a Russian airliner in Egypt, a series of terrorism occurred in France and hostage-taking incident took place at a Malian hotel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this background, a Russian bomber, which was on the counter-terrorism operations at the request of the legitimate sovereign Syrian government, was shot down by a Turkish fighter, thus escalating criticism and arms build-up among various countries. The situation is growing tense with each passing day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, it was none other than the U.S. that made the \"Islamic State\" appear and let it reduce the Mideast to a theatre of terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent downing of the Russian bomber was a product of the U.S. crafty and sinister plot to scupper the hard-won international climate of cooperation in counter-terrorism and carry out its strategy for dominating the Mideast. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a stereotyped method of the U.S. to fish in the troubled waters by inciting the ethnic and religious distrust and standoff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should be held entirely accountable for the escalated tension related to Syria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK remains unchanged in its principled stand of opposing all forms of terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK also categorically rejects all the attempts to use terrorism for meeting sinister political purposes."

Through this the U.S. threw away its mask under which it has systematically transferred sensitive technology, personnel and hardware needed for the nuclear development to south Korea behind the scene and fully disclosed its true colors as a chief culprit of nuclear proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the U.S. is to let south Korea stand on the forefront of the nuclear stand-off with the DPRK and thus easily pursue its aggressive policy towards the DPRK and its strategy for dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to calm down the international community critical of the revision of the \"atomic energy agreement\" the U.S. is letting loose groundless rubbish that south Korea is \"faithfully honoring its obligations, pursuant to the declaration on denuclearization\" and south Korea's development of nuclear weapons is \"technically impossible\" under the \"atomic energy agreement,\" etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the international community is seriously concerned about the moves for nuclear development that is becoming a reality in several countries including Japan and Israel as well as south Korea and several regions including Europe at the connivance of the U.S and under its patronage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now left with neither justification nor pretext to find fault with the nuclear program of others including the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula which surfaced and has become ever more serious due to its moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can never evade its responsibility as a chief culprit of nuclear proliferation and nuclear arms race."

            "content": "Responsabilidad por agravacion de situacion en torno a Siria recae sobre EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 5 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que se crea una situacion complicada en el Medio Oriente en torno a la guerra antiterrorista, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 5 a la ACNC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad se libra una furiosa guerra antiterrorista en Siria, mientras ocurrieron en Egipto el accidente de explosion de avion de pasajeros de Rusia, en Francia los casos sucesivos terroristas, en un hotel de Mali el incidente de rehenes, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a esta circulacion viciosa del terrorismo y antiterrorismo, todo el mundo esta preso del panico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal circunstancia, un cazabombardero ruso que volaba para participar en la guerra antiterrorista segun la demanda del gobierno de Siria, legitimo Estado soberano, fue derribado por las fuerzas aereas turcas. Este incidente provoca la campana de censura y el aumento armamentista entre algunos paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrecisamente EE.UU. es el autor que habia creado el \"Estado islamico\" y convirtio el Medio Oriente en la escena caotica del terrorismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso de derribo de cazabombardero ruso es tambien el producto de la intencion astuta del imperio de romper el ambiente de cooperacion antiterrorista internacional que se crea a duras penas y lograr la estrategia de dominacion sobre el Medio Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovecharse de la desconfianza y confrontacion entre naciones y entre religiones es el metodo rutinario de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la responsabilidad por la agravacion de la situacion en torno a Siria recae enteramente sobre EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Republica Popular Democratica de Corea mantiene la invariable posicion de principios contra el terrorismo de todas formas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRechazamos fuertemente las tentativas de utilizar el terrorismo en los designios politicos malintencionados."
