And the DPRK has conducted positive external activities in a bid to reenergize the NAM while paying deep attention to the actions to make sure that double standards are repudiated and the principle of equality and impartiality is observed in the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the NAM is faced with important tasks to be implemented by it to strengthen the solidarity and cooperation among its member nations and give fuller play to its ability of action in order to cope with the ever-changing international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM should preserve its basic principle and purity and thoroughly reject any attempts to divide and destabilize it.

The history of his Songun leadership comprehensively deals with the guiding idea and line and encyclopedic experience and exploits performed in the struggle for successfully advancing the socialist cause, the cause of independence of the popular masses in our times. It, therefore, serves as an eternal cornerstone of the Korean revolution and a most valuable national treasure of Kim Il Sung's Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest exploit performed by Kim Jong Il in the history of the Korean nation that he has given steady continuity to the tradition of the Songun revolution which was started and pushed forward by President Kim Il Sung with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Kim Jong Il who set a shining example of socialist politics by firmly maintaining the independent principle, skillfully combining revolutionary principle with creativeness and superbness and leading all fields of the revolution and construction through his on-the-spot guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is a symbol of the greatness of Kim Jong Il who is the most prominent statesman in the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The daily calls on the whole party and army and all the people to bear deep in their minds the great national pride of having such great illustrious Songun commander and single-heartedly uphold his Songun leadership, augment the military power and reinforce the self-reliant defence forces and thus continue giving full play to the might of the socialist military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson notes that his history of Songun revolution is a history in which he has creditably inherited the Songun idea and tradition founded by the President.

As if it were not enough with this, they blustered that they would not rule out even a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have been dead-set against the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea, the demand of the times and all the Koreans. They have worked with bloodshot eyes to boost the \"war alliance\" with foreign forces, talking nonsense that the \"U.S. forces should remain in south Korea even after Korea is reunified.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP zealously supported the north-targeted war exercises of the foreign forces intended to do harm to its compatriots and obliterate the reunification cause of the Korean nation, fully revealing its true colors as a pro-U.S. sycophantic and traitorous party, an anti-reunification party seeking war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is, indeed, an enemy of peace as it is going mad with its moves to provoke a war against the north, backed by the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ambition of the GNP gentries to seize power has reached extremes. It is as clear as noonday that if the GNP is allowed to come to power there will return the era of inter-Korean confrontation and the Koreans suffer war disasters again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Actions to condemn the GNP and smash its attempt to come to power precisely mean a struggle for peace against war and a struggle for national reconciliation and unity and the independent reunification.

Hay que eliminar a tiempo la causa de las calamidades.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
