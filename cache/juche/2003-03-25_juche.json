Not content with it, they are now driving the situation to extremes under the unreasonable pretexts.

Among the organizations were the society of people working for peace and reunification, the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration and the Korean Catholic Priests' Association for Justice.\r\n At the conference, the participants branded the Foal Eagle and Rsoi as war exercises directly targeted at the north in view of their scale and nature, which are increasing the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current joint military exercises can never be regarded as \"defensive drills\", when the forces involved there are compared with those participating in the invasion of Iraq, but they are, in actuality, a replica of the already suspended Team Spirit joint military exercise, they pointed out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this conference as an occasion, they would wage a vigorous struggle against the U.S. imperialists' war games, they declared, urging the authorities to check the U.S. military reinforcement.    \r\n\r\n"

Moreover, it mired in serious economic recession due to arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violation of human rights and infringement upon other countries' sovereignty are getting all the more serious worldwide due to the bush administration's high-handed and arbitrary foreign policy and its war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is eloquently proved by the Iraqi war, a war against humanity, started by the U.S. to acquire oil concessions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If U.S. Congress truly wants to protect and represent the just interests of the U.S citizens, fairly judging this reality, it should, above all, properly check the Bush administration's war policy based on its cold war way of thinking. \r\n The U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, too. \r\n\r\n"

He also said the project should be started immediately and took necessary measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three months later, he visited the village again to learn about how the project was finished. Leaving the village, he told an official accompanying him to take sample water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After several days, the county's officials and villagers received an analysis of the water quality sent by the president. \r\n\r\n"

Korea a \"high alert posture\" the kind of which can be seen only on the eve of a war, while raising a hue and cry over \"possible provocation from the north\" which has nothing to do with the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities are pushing the situation to the brink of a war siding with outsiders, far from cooperating and standing by their fellow countrymen who are exposed to the outside threat of aggression. This can not but be thrice-cursed perfidy to compatriots and cursed treachery to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities can never flee from their responsibility for cooperating with outsiders in their moves to invade the north and thereby laying a stumbling block in the way of peace on the Korean Peninsula and the process of improving inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists finally ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK, defying its efforts for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue, it will mercilessly punish the aggressors to protect the sovereignty and the right to existence of the nation, pursuant to the army-based policy, and the aggressors will not be able to go back alive. The U.S. and the South Korean warhawks are well advised to pay heed to the DPRK's warnings and stop at once the dangerous saber-rattling.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Even at this moment a great number of innocent Iraqi civilians are falling victim to the U.S. missiles and other sophisticated weapons of mass destruction and suffering the most horrible disaster in view of humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That's why the majority of countries the world over are demanding the U.S. stop the war at once and prevent disaster in Iraq, terming the war a typical example of disregarding the international community and the world public opinion and violating international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent resolution adopted by U.S. Congress in the stead of the U.S. administration, and its decision to submit it to the un commission on human rights betray the U.S. sinister intention to project the human rights issue in the DPRK along with its nuclear issue, pursuant to the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK, in a bid to escalate its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally and divert the world condemnation of the Iraqi war elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that the belligerent conservative hard-liners of U.S. Congress foolishly seek to focus the world attention on the DPRK under the pretext of its \"human rights issue\" by singling out it as de facto next target after the Iraqi war, pursuant to bush's \"axis of evil\" doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. Congress claims to conduct law-making activities concerned about the global peace and human rights issue representing the constitutional rights and interests of the citizens of the United States of America. It is, therefore, tragedy and shame for such congress to betray its prejudice and hypocritical double-dealing nature in handling practical issues at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has, in fact, the world's poorest human rights record as it is beset with serious social and political issues at home including the issues of religious performance and racial discrimination, crimes related to the random use of guns and other weapons and narcotics and violence. Moreover, it mired in serious economic recession due to arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violation of human rights and infringement upon other countries' sovereignty are getting all the more serious worldwide due to the Bush administration's high-handed and arbitrary foreign policy and its war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is eloquently proved by the Iraqi war, a war against humanity, started by the U.S. to acquire oil concessions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If U.S. Congress truly wants to protect and represent the just interests of the U.S citizens, fairly judging this reality, it should, above all, properly check the Bush administration's war policy based on its cold war way of thinking. \r\n The U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK, too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
