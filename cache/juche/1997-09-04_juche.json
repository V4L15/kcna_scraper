The imperialists and reactionaries should be aware of this and should not resort to a military adventure. And they should give up an attempt to bring the Korean people to their knees.\r\n   The United States should stop pursuing the policy hostile towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, work hard to conclude a peace accord with the DPRK as soon as possible and do things helpful toward the peaceful reunification of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

The customs inspection reminiscent of a \"search operation\" lasted nine hours in three rounds, to the consternation of the DPRK crewmen who had travelled around the world for many years.\r\n   A few days ago, the Sankei Shimbun, given to fabrication and intrigue, carried another false report that a north Korean crewman was found carrying two forged dollar bills when buying goods.\r\n   Forgery of dollars is unthinkable in the DPRK where people are educated in law observance and a sound way of life is established.\r\n   Each time a merchant ship of the DPRK goes to Japan, customs authorities and paid media of Japan fake up a case and spread false reports. This shows how viciously they try to slander the DPRK.\r\n   As facts show, the incident of forged dollars is an intolerable insult to the DPRK crewmen and a product of the undisguised hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   The incident comes when the talks for normal ties between the DPRK and Japan are to resume.\r\n   This makes the DPRK suspect that their smear campaign is a deliberate act to throw a wet blanket over the improvement of bilateral relations.\r\n   Japan's double-dealing tactics will inevitably have no good effect on the improvement of its relations with the DPRK.\r\n   The DPRK will watch the Japanese authorities' position, measures and attitude toward the incident.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
