No force on earth can block the advance of the Korean nation which is energetically conducting the three-point patriotic movement under the banner of \"By our nation itself\".\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the steadfast will of the Korean nation to invariably hold fast to the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea correctly reflects the aspiration and interests of the Korean nation and the requirements of the times and clarifies the way for the Korean nation to hew out its destiny. That is why \"By our nation itself\" is the national idea of universal significance and attractiveness in the struggle for the reunification and prosperity of the country.\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is the idea of independent reunification leader Kim Jong Il expounded at the historic Pyongyang summit and specified in the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea is evoking great support and sympathy of the whole Korean nation with an extraordinary attraction as it applies the idea of national independence to the settlement of the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea requires the Korean nation to achieve the reunification of the country with its concerted efforts in conformity with its will and interests. The idea intensively reflects the desire and will of the Korean nation for independent reunification.\r\n The idea entirely conforms with the independent desire of the Korean nation, the national independent characters of the issue of national reunification and the requirements of the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea serves as a powerful ideological and moral weapon which helps the Korean nation achieve the reunification of the country independently. The idea has rapidly enhanced the consciousness of independence on a nationwide scale and instilled the conviction of independent reunification into the hearts of all the fellow countrymen. The idea has opened a turning phase for the north and the south to cooperate with each other and advance along the road of reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These war exercises once again clearly indicate that the U.S. loud-mouthed \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\" and \"talks\" are nothing but hypocrisy to deceive the public opinion at home and abroad and it is invariably pursuing confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" are a test nuclear war, a preliminary war against the DPRK in view of its scale, nature and contents. Nuclear-powered carrier \"Abraham Lincoln\" is involved in these war maneuvers for the first time. It was active in the military operations against Iraq. Its operation in the East Sea of Korea for the current war maneuvers discloses the real intention of the U.S. imperialists to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These war exercises are fraught with the increasing danger as they started right after the U.S. published the new \"national security strategy report\" in which it re-clarified the \"strategy for preemptive attack\" as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. has revealed its clear objective to seize the DPRK, its dialogue partner, by force of arms at any cost, in violation of the spirit of the September 19 joint statement in which it committed itself to mutual respect and peaceful co-existence the army and people of the DPRK will strongly react to it with their own traditional mode of actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should know that a preemptive attack is not its monopoly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The ongoing general march for the Songun revolution is just a march of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance is an important work to preserve and glorify the Korean people's traditions of heroic struggle forever.\r\n It is an important task laid down in the joint editorial for this year to bring about the heyday of overall development of Korean-style socialism by making a higher leap full of great ambition and confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should effect a new surge in all fields of economic construction true to the intention and plan of the Workers' Party of Korea and, to this end, give fuller play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is most important to have firm confidence in our might and our inexhaustible political, military and economic potentials which have been built up in the protracted and glorious course of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All fields and units should strictly adhere to the principle of self-reliance based on modern science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Economy means increased production, and it is self-reliance to maximize production and economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party members and other working people should economize valuable resources, raw materials and funds of the nation as much as possible and make an effective use of them with a high degree of consciousness that they are masters of the country and performers of production, so as to produce and construct more. \r\n They should live and work in the same revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and strenuous efforts as was fully displayed in the period of the great surge of Chollima after the war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its history is associated with the leadership exploits of the peerlessly great men, President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\r\n The President went to Huichon in March Juche 40 (1951) when the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953) was at its height to choose the site of the factory and solve the problems arising in its construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited the construction site again in February Juche 42 (1953) and indicated the orientation and ways of construction in detail and instructed officials that it should be built in a perspective way to suit the mother factory of the engineering industry after the victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his great care, the workers of the factory succeeded in making the first lathe by their own technology and efforts after the war. They, on the basis of the experience, turned out more than 10,000 machine tools of various kinds in a year in the early 1970s.\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il visited the factory in June Juche 87 (1998) and highly appreciated the workers there, saying that they, who were keenly aware of its mission, were firmly defending socialism. In October that year, he called at the factory again and saw highly efficient and quality machine tools made by them with great satisfaction.\r\n The workers of the factory are registering signal successes in production every day, bearing deep in mind the immortal feats performed by the great leaders in the development of the machine-building industry.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts U.S. Insidious Move for Supremacy in Asia-Pacific\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- The \"trilateral security dialogue\" of the United States, Japan and Australia took place in Sydney some days ago.\r\n The \"dialogue\", the first of its kind on the foreign minister-level, drew attention of the world public as it was an assembly of the U.S. and its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The choice of Sydney as the venue of the \"dialogue\" can be explained by the on-going scramble of big powers to hold supremacy in Asia-Pacific and the geographical and military strategic importance of Australia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to gain an unchallenged military edge in the region, the U.S. has pursued the strategy to contain China by laying a siege to it whereby to link the \"triangular military alliance\" of the U.S., Japan and south Korea, the \"triangular relations\" of the U.S., Japan and India and the \"triangular alliance\" of the U.S., Japan and Australia.\r\n As public opinions view, the \"trilateral security dialogue\" is a link in the chains of the strategy to contain China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main thrust of the U.S.-sponsored \"dialogue\" was to define China as the biggest \"threat \" to its strategy for world supremacy as China's influence is daily growing in the international arena politically and economically and label it \"an undesirable force\" in a bid to lay a foundation for building a military alliance aimed at implementing its policy for containing China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Washington attempted to build a NATO type military bloc in the Asia-Pacific region and discussed the way of forming the \"four-nation maritime alliance\" by plugging even Britain into the \"triangular alliance\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, there is growing concern that the \"dialogue\" was nothing but a move to knock into shape an alliance of big powers in the region and if it is allowed, it will scuttle the process of ASEAN dialogue and endanger the regional peace and security. A \"joint statement\" demanding north Korea unconditionally and immediately return to the six-party talks was adopted at the \"dialogue\" and the U.S. attempted to establish a cooperation system against the DPRK with the \"dialogue\" as leverage. This compels the DPRK to heighten vigilance against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that the above-said \"dialogue\" was a meeting to form the U.S.-led \"tripartite security consultative mechanism\" in the region and deter the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that Japan is busy with shuttle diplomacy to establish the \"triangular framework\", a new Cold War-type alliance the U.S. is keen to form in Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is deeply involved in the U.S. strategic moves to use the former as a lever for establishing its domination over the region and a shock force for invading East Asia. In the first few months of the year alone the U.S. advanced a series of \"triangular framework\" proposals including \"trilateral dialogue and security cooperation framework\" grouping the U.S., India and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that Japan is involved in the U.S. stepped-up \"triangular military alliance,\" \"triangular relations\" and \"triangular alliance\" clearly indicates what phase its consciousness of toeing the U.S. line has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this behavior of Japan is a foolish attempt to emerge a military power with the U.S. backing at any cost and hold supremacy in Asia-Pacific. \r\n Japan used to cite \"threat from north Korea\" to justify its moves to turn itself into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nowadays it is raising a hue and cry over \"threats from north Korea and from China\" and vociferating about the need to bolster up its armed forces to cope with those threats. \r\n  The above-said \"threats\" touted by Japan are nothing but a subterfuge to step up its moves to convert it into a military giant and hold supremacy in Asia and thus realize its old dream of \" the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".  \r\n The above-said moves of Japan are nothing but reckless acts to strain the situation in Asia and spark off a fresh arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a military alliance between the U.S. and Japan and between the U.S. and Australia. Japan and Australia dispatched their troops to Iraq and are involved in the PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the \"trilateral security dialogue\" is put on a regular basis,   there is no guarantee that it will not lead to the formation of a \"triangular military alliance.\" It is as clear as noonday that this development will embolden Japan in its moves for continental aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ambition for hegemony is arousing high caution among the Asians.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
