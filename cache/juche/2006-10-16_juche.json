            "content": "Traditions of DIU Described as Eternal Lifeline of Juche Revolution \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- The appearance of the Down-with-Imperialism Union (DIU) meant the start of the Korean revolution and it served as the roots of the Workers' Party, the People's Army and socialism in the DPRK and its traditions have provided lifeline that has linked the glorious past and present and the rosy future of Songun Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in an editorial article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditions of the DIU provided by President Kim Il Sung are glorious ones symbolic of the whole history of the Korean revolution and they serve as the lifeline of Songun Korea, the article notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DIU formed in 1926 was the first revolutionary organization in Korea, which gave origin to the Korean revolution and provided historical roots of the party and revolution in the DPRK. Its formation served as a starting point in founding the revolutionary party of Juche type in Korea, its anti-imperialist fighting spirit as a cornerstone of the WPK's Songun politics and the programme for building socialism advanced by the DIU became the main idea of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the great traditions of the DIU that the Korean party, army and people could steadfastly advance along the path of the protracted and arduous revolution and set a brilliant example in accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The glorious revolutionary traditions of the WPK established by Kim Il Sung from the days of the DIU have been successfully carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the energetic guidance of Kim Jong Il, Kim Il Sung's idea, exploits, experience and leadership methods have been embodied in all fields through generations, the WPK has developed into a revolutionary party of Juche type, a heir to the traditions of the DIU, and the ideal of socialism advanced by the DIU has come true on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his early years Kim Jong Il made a comprehensive review of the century-long history of the working class' ideology and on this basis formulated Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea as an integrated whole of the idea, theory and method of Juche, thus glorifying it as the guiding idea in the era of independence. This was an event of historic significance in eternally glorifying the idea of the DIU and carrying forward and accomplishing the cause of Juche in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea has been developed in depth by Kim Jong Il to meet the requirements of the new century. It is a revolutionary idea whose validity and invincible might have been proved in the practice of the Korean revolution which started with the founding of the DIU and has always emerged victorious under the banner of Juche. It also serves as a militant banner for winning a final victory of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unanimous faith and will of the Korean army and people to give steady continuity to the glorious and triumphant history of the WPK and the Korean revolution started with the formation of the DIU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no step backward on the road of the Korean revolution started by Kim Il Sung under the flag of the DIU, though old generations are replaced by new ones and conditions and circumstances of the struggle may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just as the DIU members, the first generation of the Korean revolution, stubbornly fought, looking up to Kim Il Sung and confident of the bright future of the country, the servicepersons and people of the DPRK are now full of the conviction of certain victory and optimism that they can surely bring earlier the dawn of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation as they are under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The road hewed by Kim Il Sung with the formation of the DIU is one chosen by the Korean people themselves, and it has been defended through protracted bloody battles. It is also a proud road for bringing happiness and prosperity to posterity. The Korean people will neither step back nor waver even a bit on this road.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the way of defending the basic interests of revolution and advancing revolution to victory without vacillation to maintain the revolutionary principles consistently in accomplishing the cause of independence of the popular masses, the socialist cause. On the contrary, to shrink back from the revolutionary principles means surrender and ruin. To take one step back from the revolutionary principles means to take two steps, ten steps back from them. Finally, it means to lose national dignity and the sovereignty of the country and face the miserable destiny of subordination and slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has been proved by the situation of some countries. Those countries which were building socialism in the past deviated from the revolutionary principles with no faith in socialism when facing difficulties and ordeals. And they were afraid of the threat and blackmail by the imperialists and yielded to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is true of the Iraqi situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state which is strong in the revolutionary principles does not go to ruin and those people who keep the revolutionary principles are not conquered. This is the truth verified by history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea has always firmly maintained the principles of independence, the working class and socialism in the revolution and construction on the basis of the basic interests of the revolution, worked out revolutionary lines and policies of Juche and carried through them consistently. The party has consistently defended the basic interests and principles of the revolution, stepping up the revolution and construction with ceaseless creation and innovation as required by the developing reality and positively countering the rapidly changing situation. The Korean party and people know neither compromise nor concession in the revolution and construction. This is the revolutionary spirit and ideological and mental characteristics of the party and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the party has maintained its revolutionary principles and line and policies, the Korean revolution could victoriously advance along the road of socialism without vacillation even under the arduous conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world revolutionary political parties and peoples should staunchly maintain the basic interests and principles of revolution in accomplishing the cause of independence against imperialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "WPK Inherits DIU Tradition\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- Eighty years have passed since the Down-with-Imperialism Union (DIU), the historical root of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), was formed by President Kim Il Sung in Huadian on October 17, Juche 15 (1926).\r\n The WPK has developed as an experienced, seasoned and invincible revolutionary Party while leading the unprecedentedly arduous Korean revolution to victory, because it has taken the idea of the DIU as its fundamental bedrock and has embodied it in the party building and activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the formation of the DIU the Korean revolution has forged ahead on the principle of independence and in reliance upon the revolutionary unity and cohesion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence held aloft by the DIU served as a starting point of the struggle for founding a revolutionary party of Juche type, a party of new type, differing from other parties in Korea in the past. And it has been kept and implemented in the whole period of the Party building and activities.  The President adhered to the firm independent stand in this cause. He, proceeding not from approved theories and any experience of other countries but from the demand and interests of the Korean people and actual conditions of the Korean revolution, laid a solid organizational and ideological foundation for founding the Party by the method of organizing basic Party organizations before anything else. Basing himself on it, he founded the new revolutionary Party enrolling the progressive elements of workers, peasants and intellectuals immediately after the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the DIU's brilliant tradition of attending President Kim Il Sung as the center of the unity and the leadership at the initial stage of the Korean revolution, the WPK has been strengthened to be a steel-strong party in which the whole party is firmly united with one thought and one will on the basis of the Juche idea and a revolutionary party which moves as one under the monolithic guidance of the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having leader Kim Jong Il at its head, the WPK has been further consolidated as an ever-victorious one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Remaining true to his Songun revolutionary leadership, the WPK has defended the destiny of the country, the nation and socialism and paved the way for building a great prosperous powerful nation in the fierce confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. And it is demonstrating the high authority and the dignity as the tested general staff of the revolution, vanguard of the anti-imperialist and independent cause and the protector of justice which enjoys absolute support from the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the result of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" that bomb explosions, suicidal bombings and armed attacks are unabated in different countries including Iraq and Afghanistan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., chieftain of state-sponsored terrorism, is not qualified to talk about \"terrorism.\" The U.S. should stop the \"war on terrorism\" aimed to realize its wild ambition for world domination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Security Authorities' Plot under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 14 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson Saturday comes out with a commentary denouncing the south Korean security authorities for plotting to fabricate a \"case of an organization behind the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon)\".\r\n Accusing the Intelligence Service and the Public Security Investigation Corps of south Korea of having faked up such document as prearranged \"organizational line-up\" and pressurized Choe Hui Jong, permanent researcher of the Institute for Civil Rights Studies, to admit to it, the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a crime reminiscent of the period of the fascist dictatorship, an indication that the security authorities have not yet dropped their bad habit of faking up cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their sinister intention to quell at any cost the tendency of supporting the Songun politics daily growing among the south Korean people and crack down upon the south Korean progressive reformist forces by linking them with the DPRK. By doing so, they seek to create an environment favorable for the \"Grand National Party's\" seizure of power in a bid to install a pro-U.S. \"regime\" without fail through the 2007 presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end they made Choe a victim of their plot for the mere reason that he wrote articles supporting the Songun politics and are orchestrating a charade aimed at suppressing Hanchongryon, which has conducted the movement for national reunification with main emphasis on the anti-U.S. struggle under the banner of the three-point patriotic movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves of the security authorities are calling on the south Korean people to be vigilant against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should they remain an onlooker to such plot, this will make it impossible to prevent the tragedy of youths and students and people desirous of independence, democracy and reunification being punished on false charges of their involvement in the case. Then it will be as clear as noonday that the pro-U.S. conservative forces including the GNP will wrest power and bring back the inter-Korean relations to those before the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
