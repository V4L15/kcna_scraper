Japan is shelving the issue of its redress for its past crimes, a most serious moral problem pending an urgent solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing reactionaries are evading their moral responsibility for redressing its past crimes and reflecting this stand in history textbooks without any modification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan, considerate of its future, truly wishes to see the sound moral development of the rising generation, it should know well what is most urgent. Any short-sighted action will only invite misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a priority task for Japan to redeem its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Solutions to all problems such as challenges of Japan's diplomacy, moral education of students, etc, depend on the fulfillment of this priority task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to face up to the reality and make a right judgement and decision. \r\n\r\n"
