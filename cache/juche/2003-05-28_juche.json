            "content": "South Korean authorities' trip to U.S. accused \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the central committee of the Union of Agricultural Workers of Korea issued a statement on May 26 to brand the recent trip of the South Korean authorities to the United States as the most dangerous anti-DPRK and anti-reunification tour intended to pave the way for a war against fellow countrymen in league with the foreign forces and bring inter-Korean relations back to confrontation.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is very just that the tour of the U.S. heedless of national dignity and independence is being seriously condemned in South Korea as a shameful and disgraceful trip which showed pro-American sycophantic relationship and an anti-national trip which will bring about nuclear holocaust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yielding to foreign forces without sovereignty and betraying fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces will lead to shame and ruin. This is a serious lesson drawn from the over half-a-century long history of South Korea under the U.S. domination and arbitrary rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean authorities truly want the development of the north-south relations and peace, they should clearly see the trend of the times and take the road of national independence and cooperation instead of flattering and yielding to the foreign forces.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. decision to repeal \"law banning smaller nukes\" under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Senate recently decided to repeal the \"law banning smaller nukes\" that was adopted and took effect in l993, according to a news report.\r\n In accordance with this decision, the U.S. Department of Defense was tasked to work out a plan to develop, manufacture and use smaller nukes such as underground-penetrating smaller nukes and start full-scale research into them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This decision discloses a dastardly move of the bush administration to carry out the reckless war strategy to dominate the world by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of developing smaller nukes is nothing new as it has long been clamoured for by the hawkish hardliners of pentagon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the recent decision of the senate arouses profound concern of the world public as it lifted the legal ban on such nukes so that they may be developed in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that the destructive power of an underground-penetrating smaller nuke which the U.S. plans to develop is equivalent to one third of that of the a bomb dropped over Hiroshima late in World War II as its trotyl equivalent is less than 5kt and it is capable of destroying any underground structure 300m deep. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. production of such type of weapon is aimed to maintain an unchallenged edge over other nuclear weapons states and dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This will only escalate the worldwide nuclear arms race and prompt various countries to pull out of the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What arouses the caution of the DPRK is the U.S. assertion that the development of smaller nukes is necessary for striking \"rogue states\" and terrorist organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the development of such type of nuke is resumed at a time when the U.S. is increasing its pressure on the DPRK over such non-existent issues as drug trafficking and counterfeit money while blustering that \"further steps would be considered in case the danger increases\" and \"all options are not taken off the table\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear threat compels the DPRK to heighten its revolutionary vigilance and build a deterrent force to counter the use of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has its own effective method to retaliate against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army and the people of the DPRK remain unfazed in face of the U.S. undisguised threat of nuclear attack as they have consolidated the country's defences as an impregnable fortress with the might of the Songun policy. They are fully determined to increase the might of singlehearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop acting rashly, well aware that the DPRK has its own effective method to cope with Washington's nuclear threat.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Materialization of federal formula for reunification called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The proposal for reunifying the country by federal formula is a just proposal for national reunification as it is in full accord with the reality and the Korean nation's desire to achieve the independent reunification of the country by its concerted efforts. This fully reflects the demands, interests, will and desire of the nation. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal made by President Kim Il Sung makes it possible to reunify the country, not allowing the interests of different classes, strata and political groups in the north and the south to be infringed upon on condition that the differing ideologies and social systems are tolerated. This is because the proposal is an embodiment of the three principles of national reunification -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- which are the common programme of the nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The federal formula calls for achieving national reunification by way of establishing a unified national government under whose guidance the north and the south run autonomous governments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the country is reunified according to the proposal, Koreans will not need outsiders' interference and will be able to overcome any deviations in the process of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The function of the federal state is basically aimed to respect and protect the interests of the whole nation and a unified government is tasked to discuss and decide any common issues concerning the overall interests of the country and the nation and push ahead with the work to solve them and make positive efforts to realize unity and collaboration in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The federal formula for reunification presents itself as a more pressing issue now that the U.S. imperialists, displeased with promoting the cause of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation, are fostering division and confrontation between the north and the south and escalating the tensions to unleash a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north, the south and overseas are struggling to achieve the independent reunification of the country, their supreme task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification means patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 70 million Koreans who love the country and the nation will surely achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in a few years to come, true to the guidance of leader Kim Jong Il to national reunification, in order to carry out the last instructions of Kim Il Sung for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n Korean-style socialism, by nature, stands for peace and the Korean people's building of a great prosperous socialist power requires a peaceful environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace they want is not peace to be brought by servile submission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They ardently love peace and do not want war but if anyone dares invade and conquer their country, they will exercise sovereignty and strongly retaliate against the enemy by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is guaranteed by an army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is the desire common to humankind and intrinsically needed by the people advocating independence. Peace, the idea of the DPRK's foreign policy, fully represents the desire of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present grave international situation requires humankind to hold higher the banner of peace. As shown by the U.S. Iraqi war, actions speak louder than words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to meet the imperialists' blatant challenge, avert a war and defend sovereignty and peace of a country and a nation unless a powerful physical deterrent force is built. This a serious lesson drawn from the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace on the Korean Peninsula is in peril due to the intensified moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK. It will consolidate its defences as an iron-wall to protect its sovereignty and peace from their aggression.    \r\n\r\n"

That's why they are obtrusively pulling up the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hearts of the army and the people of the DPRK are now burning with towering indignation and grudge against the Japanese imperialists who committed the thrice-cursed crimes against Koreans in the past. They have firm determination and will to revenge upon them thousand times. no one can know what consequences will entail when their wrath bursts out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese rulers should refrain from doing such a reckless act of provoking the DPRK if they think a little of the future of Japan.    \r\n\r\n"
