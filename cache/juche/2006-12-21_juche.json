Korean Authorities against DPRK Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- The United States and south Korean bellicose forces are said to have recently agreed upon rounding off by the end of next year \"CONPLAN 5029\" targeted against the DPRK through the Joint Chiefs of Staff of the south Korean army and the \"South Korea-U.S. Combined Forces Command\" according to the strategic guideline adopted at the 38th South Korea-U.S. annual security consultative meeting which was held in October. \r\n It must not go unnoticed that they are planning to stage a massive war game against the DPRK with the completion of the \"CONPLAN 5029\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is trying to pull a dirty business against the DPRK behind the curtain of talks. This is clear proof that it is seeking to vanquish the DPRK with a military strong arm, whetting its sword of aggression under the mask of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a mistake if the U.S. thinks it can bludgeon the DPRK into submission with the double-dealing tactics which it has employed for decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group is still clinging to its trite hostile policy toward the DPRK, remaining captive to the anachronistic way of thinking. This is only driving the present situation to a more serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Watching the acts of the U.S. bellicose forces framing war plots against the DPRK behind the scene while holding dialogue under the public eyes, the DPRK is getting further convinced that the United States is a dangerous one incredible as ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have a few words of warning to the south Korean bellicose forces. For them to dance to the drum-beating of the U.S. war-thirsty elements watching for a chance of a new war against the DPRK is an act of bringing a war to the Korean Peninsula. This is an indelible crime in the history of the nation &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will decisively smash the vicious challenge of the enemies with the might of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
