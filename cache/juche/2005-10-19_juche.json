It is contemplating introducing new type missile tracking equipment into Japan from the U.S. under the pretext of \"missile threat from the DPRK\". This is an indication that Japan is keen to realize its wild ambition for overseas expansion come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive recently issued an order to speed up the discussion on the realignment of the U.S. troops in Japan.\r\n Japan's moves for military overseas expansion under the patronage of the U.S. are fraught with ever-increasing danger and gravity.\r\n The Korean Peninsula is made the first target of Japan's wild ambition for overseas expansion. It is as clear as daylight that in case a new war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, the troops of the SDF will be hurled into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such a crisis would only lead Japan once again to destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to ponder over this.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this is a miscalculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said case is a product of the anti-peace, anti-national criminal moves as it is detrimental to the denuclearization of the peninsula and aimed at starting a nuclear war. It should be, therefore, thoroughly probed in such a manner quite understandable to the public at home and abroad. The \"denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\" touted by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities without doing so is nothing but hypocrisy. \r\n A news analyst of Minju Joson urges the U.S. and the south Korean authorities to clarify where the missing uranium has gone and what it is used for in a manner understandable to the public at home and abroad and the IAEA to properly handle this case.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They reduced 200,000 Korean women into sexual slaves, destroyed and plundered valuable cultural assets and tremendous natural resources and products of Korea and tried to do away with the peculiar national customs of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's \"high-rate growth\" has been made at the cost of the blood shed by Korean people, the article points out, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hatred and revenge of the Korean people against Japan are going to extremes and it is an unchangeable will of the Korean people to make Japan pay for its past crimes at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To liquidate the past is Japan�fs unavoidable state responsibility, moral duty and obligation under the international law and the unanimous demand of world conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the present international trend to repent of and redress the wrongdoings of the past. But only Japan has not yet liquidated its past even though 60 years have passed since its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is seeking to use the issue of liquidation of its past as a political bargaining for its sinister purpose and make a profit. This is an unreasonable and foolish attempt. Japan should not dream of normalising bilateral relations without liquidating its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should change its wrong attitude, clearly aware that the liquidation of the past is not a mere issue of history but the most urgent and serious political issue to be settled between the DPRK and Japan and a key to the normalization of bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed that Japan has persistently put the \"issue of abduction\" to the fore. What Japan seeks is to avoid its liquidation of the past infinitely and get any concession from the DPRK under the pretext of the \"abduction issue.\" This is a revelation of Japan's nonsense, moral vulgarity, diplomatic immaturity and ignorance of the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should sincerely implement its commitments to the settlement of the past as referred to in the joint statement following the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will settle accounts with the crimes of Japan and make it pay dearly for them in the new century.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
