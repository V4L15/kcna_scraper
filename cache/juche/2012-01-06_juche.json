Y arrestaron al presidente y el ex secretario general de esta entidad calificando de actos \"pro-enemigos\" el contacto legitimo con la parte Norte y sus actividades por la ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl recibir la noticia inesperada y triste sobre el fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, la direccion surena de la APRP envio mas antes que nadie el mensaje de condolencias. Y los veteranos de la entidad organizaron el grupo de visita de condolencias y se dirigieron a Pyongyang con la pancarta \"Vamos a expresar las condolencias con el alma del 15 de Junio\". Cuando los militares titeres les impedian con armas pesadas, gritaron: \"Que abren el paso. Vamos a expresar las condolencias por el fallecimiento del Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional, Kim Jong Il\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales actividades parten de la infinita veneracion al padre de la nacion, quien preparo la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre y abrio la nueva era de la reunificacion independiente, y muestran el amor a  los compatriotas para compartir con ellos la tristeza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa represion fascista de la banda titere surcoreana resulta insolencia al gran duelo nacional, crimen antietico nunca visto y desafio nunca tolerable a la nacion coreana aspirante a la reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas lagrimas derramadas por la nacion coreana no son el reflejo de simple tristeza, sino se convertiran en una gran indignacion para castigar severamente a la horda de traidores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere no podra detener nunca el avance de la APRP, vanguardia de la reunificacion de la patria que bajo la bandera de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\", supera todas las pruebas y obstaculos puestos en el camino de reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak debe poner de inmediato en libertad a los miembros de la direccion surena de la APRP y otras personalidades patrioticas pro-reunificacion arrestados injustamente."
