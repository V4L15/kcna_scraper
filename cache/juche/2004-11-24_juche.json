The U.S. has breached the agreement on and common understanding of the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\", the basic way of solving the nuclear issue, reached between the parties concerned and this resulted in blowing up the basic groundwork of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only too plain and self-evident that the six-party talks can never be held unless the U.S., which is to blame for the destruction of their groundwork, rebuilds it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified more than once that it would not stick to any form of dialogue to solve the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should rectify its hostile policy toward the DPRK and opt to co-exist with it in peace. It would be impossible to think about the six-party talks or expect any results without this. The dialogue without seed, even if it were held, would result in exchange of verbal attacks and waste of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel constrained to emphasize that the Bush administration should give abundant clarity to its willingness to make a switchover in its policy toward the DPRK and co-exist with it in peace. This would provide groundwork for the two sides to sit at the negotiating table. Correctly understanding this, the U.S. should retract its hostile policy aimed at \"overthrow\" and \"collapse\" of the system in the DPRK and choose peaceful co-existence with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a foolish and useless act to expect good will from the imperialists and try to preserve sovereignty by submitting to and compromising with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to win victory in the confrontation with imperialism without a strong self-defensive power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That the increase of self-defensive power is the best way of defending sovereignty is a serious lesson drawn from the miserable lot of the countries and nations which collapsed like a wet mud wall in face of the imperialists' aggression in recent years to find their sovereignty ruthlessly violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only political independence but also self-supporting economy are ensured and guaranteed by strong military force. Negligence in increasing self-defensive power results only in the loss of sovereignty and the lot of slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bloody lesson of the Iraqi situation is that the sovereignty and independence and peace of a country can be defended only when it increases its self-defensive power, firmly arms the servicepersons and people with the spirit of national independence and right view on war and fight the enemy staunchly, not begging for peace by compromise and concession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When one has a mighty self-defensive power, one has nothing to fear and gets dauntless grit and no enemy would dare pounce upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the countries aspiring after independence increase self-defensive power with an unshakable anti-imperialist independent stand, the aggression and war moves of the imperialists will prove powerless and the sovereignty, security and peace of the countries and nations be firmly guaranteed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is again evidenced by the fact that as soon as Kim Young Sam criticized the south Korean chief executive's remarks, asserting that he shielded the north though its nukes were intended to attack somebody, Kim Tok Ryong came out to echo the former's outcry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such disgraceful act of betraying the security and interests of the country and the nation can be perpetrated only by such wicked sycophantic traitor keen to seek a way out in acting a running dog of the U.S., utterly indifferent to the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling on all Koreans to hold in check the GNP's traitorous act of supporting the U.S. in its hostile moves against the north in betrayal of the nation, the commentary stresses this is the way of preventing a war and achieving peace, reunification and national prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The fact goes to clearly prove that the story about the \"secret sale of fluorine gas\" is nothing but a product of the premeditated plan worked out by the forces hostile to the DPRK in a bid to invent pretexts for isolating and stifling the DPRK one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with setting afloat the fiction of the DPRK's \"uranium enrichment program,\" they orchestrated such poor farces as the \"secret sale of uranium hexafluoride\" and the \"secret sale of fluorine gas\". This only indicates that the enemies' hostile policy toward the DPRK has reached an extreme phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never tolerate such sinister plots of the U.S. and its allies to convince the international community of the DPRK's \"nuclear crisis.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Liars have short wings and truth is bound to be distinguished from falsity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is nothing but a pipedream to bring down the DPRK through false propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Increased efforts on the part of the U.S. and its allies to isolate and stifle the DPRK would only encourage it to further boost its self-defensive capability to defend its sovereignty and right to existence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
