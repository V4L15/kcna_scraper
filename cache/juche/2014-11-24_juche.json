They instigate the reactionary forces in other countries to cause social chaos and discontent in a bid to set up regimes obedient to them. When those countries voice opposition to them, they put pressure upon the countries and imposed Western-style \"democracy\" and \"human rights standard\" upon them under the pretexts of \"human rights abuse\" and \"retreat from democracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. put up the slogan of \"protection of human rights\" when it seized Grenada and murdered its prime minister after dispatching aggressor troops to it in the 1980s and did the same when it kidnapped the head of state of Panama after invading it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the Western countries are persistently working to force other countries to accept its \"human rights standard\" by abusing the issue of universality of the human rights standard that is mentioned in the international human rights conventions as they did in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by their unilateral interests that are quite irrelevant to the human rights, the U.S. and the Western countries are putting collective pressure on those countries that maintain their own social systems and political modes by branding them as \"human rights abusers.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. and other Western countries, the view that \"human rights are above state sovereignty\" is afloat in the international arena and interference in the internal affairs under the signboard of \"protection of human rights\" is being justified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and those forces kowtowing to it are trying to politicize the human rights issue while resorting to the application of selectivity and double-standards even though they are not qualified to talk about genuine human rights. If these acts are overlooked, such an act as taking issue with specified countries, prompted by political purposes, will rule the roost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that analysts contend that the people of a country  have the greatest say about its human rights record and that the international community may show common concern for human rights through dialogue and cooperation but should never take such \"confrontational\" mode as the EU and Japan do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely intolerable are the acts of the U.S. and the Western countries to make a dangerous precedent of speaking ill of human rights performance in other countries in the international arena for the mere reason that they are not their \"allies\" and \"partners\"."

It does so to mislead the public opinion and thus cover up its true colors oriented to confrontation, not because it is interested in dialogue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the international community truly hopes for peace in the Asia-Pacific region and reunification of Korea divided by outside forces, it should reject the war drills of the U.S. and south Korea, to begin with."

Por otra parte, estan recrudeciendo su campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal comportamiento constituye una seria provocacion politica contra la RPDC y un crimen antinacional que lleva las relaciones intercoreanas a la peor fase de ruptura.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl frente de la fabricacion de la citada \"resolucion\" en la ONU, tambien estuvo la banda titere de Park Geun-hye instigada por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla lo hizo con el siniestro objetivo de desvirtuar el alto prestigio y las influencias de la RPDC, justificar sus maniobras de confrontacion fratricida, calmar la opinion publica del Sur de Corea y salir de la crisis de gobernacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos demuestran claramente que son hipocritas los alegatos de los titeres surcoreanos sobre la \"confianza\" y \"dialogo\" y ellos acechan la oportunidad de realizar su ambicion de agredir a la RPDC al cabo de su campana de enfrentamiento fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa participacion activa de los titeres surcoreanos, lacayos de EE.UU., en la fabricacion de la \"resolucion\" anticoreana, constituye la negativa total al sistema y al regimen de la RPDC, por lo cual deviene una declaracion de guerra contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere surcoreana debe actuar con prudencia al darse cuenta de las nefastas consecuencias que emanaran de su campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC."
