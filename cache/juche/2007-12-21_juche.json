Timed to coincide with this, they are working hard to deter the United States from moving to delist the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have gone the lengths of warning the U.S. that its action to cross north Korea off the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\" would do harm to the Japan-U.S. alliance and push Japan to nuclear weaponization in the long-run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their pressure offensive against the DPRK is nothing but a revelation of the wicked intention and uneasiness of those who are much upset by the might and invincibility of the DPRK's socialist system centering on the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The points agreed upon at the six-party talks are in the process of implementation. Voices supporting this process are also heard from the social and academic circles of Japan. It is only the right-wing reactionaries and their henchmen that are opposed to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those reactionaries are seized with extreme zeal for reinvasion as they are steeped in militarism and revanchism to the marrow of their bones. They are citing the non-existent DPRK's \"nuclear and missile threat\" as a pretext for justifying the moves stepped up by them to let Japan emerge a military giant and accelerate nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the above-mentioned offensive is aimed to render the Japanese politics reactionary and fascist and bar the relations between the DPRK and Japan from improving. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their persistent reckless campaign against the DPRK would only precipitate their isolation and destruction.
