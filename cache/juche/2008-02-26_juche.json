            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Dangerous Moves for Arms Race in Space  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. launched a missile to shoot down a spy satellite in the Northern Pacific on Feb. 20 defying the protest and denunciation from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was done in the form of a general exercise staged by warships equipped with the specially improved interceptor missiles and the commanding system controlled by radars and computers under the U.S. Strategic Command, according to foreign press reports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign observers commented that it was a test for actual battle aimed at establishing a missile defense system (MD) as it marked an important occasion in rounding off a phase for developing the MD and flatly refuted the U.S. assertion about the reason behind its shooting down of the satellite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. claimed as a reason was that its spy satellite launched in December, 2006 was in such shape that it could hardly be remote-controlled from the earth and it might fall on the earth in the first week of March and it was, therefore, necessary to shoot down the satellite loaded with toxic fuel so that it might not fall down on a densely populated area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. asserted that the satellite shooting down was neither a weapon test to intercept other countries' satellites nor a demonstration of force against potential hostile countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the unanimous view of the experts that although the satellite loaded with toxic fuel might be shot down as asserted by the U.S., its toxic substance might seriously contaminate the air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the aim sought by the U.S. in shooting down the satellite is to restore the \"Star Wars\" initiative in the 1980s in a bid to contain China and Russia and other countries and hold military supremacy in the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, the Ministry of Defense of Russia on Feb. 16 said that the shooting down of the spy satellite was obviously designed to test a new type strategic weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As known, the U.S. conducted a test of intercepting a satellite in 1985 by launching a missile from a fighter and has squandered a huge amount of fund on the development of space weapons for the last several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of China's test of intercepting a satellite in January last year, the U.S. used this as a pretext for justifying its development of space weapons and accelerated its moves for the space militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the recent UN Disarmament Conference the U.S. stubbornly rejected the draft treaty on banning the deployment of weapons in the space proposed by China and Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. in its \"national policy on space\" made public in October 2006 declared that it rejects the discussion on any agreement which may limit the advance into and use of space by the U.S. and objects to any form of arms reduction agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is crystal clear that these adventurous moves of the U.S. would reduce the international treaty on the peaceful use of the space to a dead document and spark off an arms race in the space as they were prompted by its unchanged way of thinking dating back to the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts clearly prove once again that the U.S. is a harasser of world peace and stability.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Various countries of the world are expressing support and sympathy with it but the U.S. remains adamant in opposing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cites facts to prove that by coming out against this proposed treaty the U.S. seeks a criminal aim to realize its ambition for dominating the world at any cost by accelerating the space militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. invariable strategy to hold military supremacy in the space, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long regarded the space militarization as a means for realizing its ambition for dominating the world while persisting in the moves for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is apt to accuse other countries of their activities in the space. This is aimed at containing their peaceful development and use of the space and securing a strategic edge in the space in a bid to use this for carrying out its strategy for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and Iran much touted by the U.S. is nothing but a subterfuge for pushing ahead with the space militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous and a typical example of partiality and double standards for the U.S. to paint any countries' activities for space development as a \"missile test,\" though it is for a peaceful purpose, while conniving at some other countries' activities for space development to serve a military purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Space can never become anyone's monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intolerable that the precious scientific and technological achievements and social wealth created by humankind are used for putting down and dominating other countries and nations through high-handed military actions and producing means of aggression and war threatening the existence and peace of humankind, instead of using them for the mankind's welfare and development of civilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to abandon its attempt to violate other countries' right to peaceful development of space while spreading its unreasonable and nonsensical assertions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
