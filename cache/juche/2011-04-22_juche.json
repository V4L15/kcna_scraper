They set up the Usan State by bringing Ulrung Island and Tok Islets under their control. In this course they acquired profound knowledge and understanding of the East Sea and named the sea off Korea \"East Sea of Korea\" before any others. This name had been used till the end of the Ri dynasty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The name \"Japan\" appeared in the world from the latter half of the 7th century and the name of the country called \"Korea\" has a five thousand years-long history.

They became all the pronounced in their moves to name \"Japan Sea\" after occupying Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Korea was barred from sending its delegate to the conference of the International Hydrographic Organization held in 1929, the Japanese imperialists registered the East Sea of Korea as \"Japan Sea\" in a cunning way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries have recently resorted to foolish moves to make \"Japan Sea\" recognized and preserved by the international community in a bid to \"protect\" it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are making desperate efforts to preserve their unilateral designation of \"Japan Sea\" but their ambition will be decisively shattered and the fair and aboveboard international standardization of geographical name of the East Sea of Korea will be certainly realized for its truth and justice."

Esto es la invariable posición de nuestro ejército, una parte beligerante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que la parte Sur comete ese acto cambiando astutamente los lugares por el temor a la reacción de nuestro ejército, éste informa oficialmente que ampliará el ya notificado perímetro del fuego a puntería directa como el fuego de destrucción total que se dará en cualquier momento y alcanzará cualquier zona.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvemos a recordar que las locuras conflictivas de la parte Sur contra la RPDC no darán otro resultado que la punición imprevisible e implacable de nuestro ejército.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak debe parar ahora mismo sus aventureras acciones en aras de enfrentamiento fratricida al ver bien la voluntad del ejército y el pueblo de la RPDC de no perdonar ni en lo mínimo ningún acto provocativo anti-RPDC por muy taimado que fuera."
