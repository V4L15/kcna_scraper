They are effecting miracles and innovations every day with a resolution to make a signal success in the offensive campaign for building an economic power this year again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Surging are the enthusiasm of officials and working people in the people's committees of all levels and the fields of light industry and public service who are positively responding to the call of the Party for directing the primary effort to improving the standard of the people's living as the main task in the present general march.\r\n The editorial says that the people should, as in the past, keep up farming as the great foundation of the country and make an epoch-making advance in solving the problem of food for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In response to the call, the agricultural workers, with a firm determination to increase the grain production this year, are striving hard to acquire new arable land and raise the fertility of soil while energetically carrying on the water-way project of Miru Plain to be converted into a granary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With responsibility for a pilot of the national economy, the workers in the field of the electric power industry including the Pyongyang Thermal-power Complex are brilliantly carrying out their daily assignments from the beginning of the year.\r\n The workers of the Musan Mine Complex, who had succeeded in blasting 100,000 cubic meters of earth on the first day of the year to make a breakthrough in turning out large quantities of concentrated iron ore, are making every effort to hit the production target for the first month of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Labor achievements have been reported from the Songjin Steel Complex, the Ryongsong Machinery Complex and other industrial establishments.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It clearly indicates the fighting tasks the Korean nation should carry out in the new year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\", the spirit of the June 15 era of reunification, is the most steadfast idea of attaching importance to the nation. The Korean nation should regard it as the strict rule to develop the inter-Korean relations and the reunification movement according to the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to safeguard peace is a just patriotic struggle for defending the existence of the nation and its land of living. All the fellow countrymen should turn out as one man in the struggle to defend peace with death-defying will, staking the destiny of the cause of independent reunification and the security of the nation. \r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should intensify the struggle to consolidate the achievements made in the patriotic movement for the great unity of the nation last year and boost the unity of the entire nation.  This year, too, they should bring the atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity to a high tide and push it to independent reunification. It is important to wage a relentless struggle against the south Korean conservative forces standing in the way of national unity.\r\n It is an entirely just and realistic patriotic initiative that the joint editorial put forward the three major tasks to attach importance to the nation, defend peace and achieve unity which the Korean nation should carry through in the new year. If these three tasks are fulfilled to the letter, a brighter prospect will spread in accomplishing the cause of peace and independent reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should firmly defend and invariably implement the north-south joint declaration, whatever ordeals and difficulties they may face, thus adding shine to the June 15 era of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Thursday.\r\n It is not only an intolerable insult to the DPRK but an undisguised war outcry that the group of militarists of this island country dared compare the DPRK with Japan before the World War II, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this diatribe is their sinister intention to impose international blockade upon the DPRK and, furthermore, use force against it by labeling it a \"dangerous state.\" This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the ruling quarters and the gentry of the Liberal Democratic Party of the island country called for stepping up the preparations for its participation in the above-said military sanctions.\r\n The DPRK has already clarified that it would regard any sanctions against it as a war declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese militarists' talk about military sanctions against the DPRK is intended to seize it through preemptive strikes as they precisely mean military attacks on it. This reflects the nature of the samurais who have grown corpulent through aggression, war and plunder and are keen to get richer by the same method in the future, too. \r\n The above-said militarists are leaving no means untried to revenge the defeat suffered by the Japanese imperialists in the past, far from drawing a lesson from it.\r\n They have watched for a chance to stage a comeback to Korea for several decades since the end of the war, whetting their swords. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is one of the reasons why the ruling quarters in the land of Japs have deliberately deteriorated the DPRK-Japan relations, persistently raising the \"abduction issue\" which had already found its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive nature and ambition of the Japanese militarists remain unchanged and their moves for reinvasion of Korea are getting more frantic as the days go by.\r\n Should the Japanese militarists dare preempt invasion of the DPRK to put it under their control, its army and people will deal merciless blows at them by the force of Songun and vent the towering grudge of the Korean people against their sworn enemy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
