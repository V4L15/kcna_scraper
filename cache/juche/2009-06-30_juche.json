He warmly encouraged the workers there in their dynamic 150-day campaign and acquainted himself in detail with the technical equipment and production at the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly estimated the feats performed by the workers of the factory, expressing great satisfaction over the fact that they laid solid material and technical foundations of the factory by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and are mass- producing quality semiconductor materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced tasks to be fulfilled by the factory. Underscoring the need to steadily boost the production capacity in order to satisfactorily meet the daily growing demand for semiconductor materials, he set a long-term production goal and indicated the orientation and ways for hitting it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he examined the products turned out at the Rare-Earth Metal Factory and discussed the issue related to the production with officials of the factory before stressing the need to accelerate the technical updating of the factory so as to increase the production of rare-earth metals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Hamhung Branch of the State Academy of Sciences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He, to begin with, went round the exhibits on display at the Exhibition of Scientific Achievements for hours. He was satisfied with a lot of work the group of researchers of the branch have done by working hard for the prosperity and development of the country with all their wisdom and skills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he learned in detail about the scientific researches at the branch, going round its different places.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the branch has made a great contribution to the development of the nation's Juche-based chemical industry including the establishment of the vinalon industry, he highly appreciated the feats performed by it for the party and the revolution, the country and the people over the past years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced highly important tasks facing the branch, saying that the party has a very great expectation towards the branch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our science and technology can serve as a powerful engine for the revolution and construction and provide a scientific and technological guarantee for building a great prosperous and powerful nation only when they are closely combined with production, he said, underlining the need for the scientists and technicians to pay primary attention to the scientific researches relying on the domestic resources. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Urging the scientists and technicians to choose, study and settle the scientific and technological issues whose solution is required by the realities, he stressed that to this end they should establish the revolutionary habit of keeping abreast of the pulsating reality and solving scientific and technological problems arising in different fields of the national economy and introduce their research achievements to production in good time by relying on the strength of the popular masses so that they may pay off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called upon the scientists and technicians to advance a lot of scientific hypotheses helpful to the guidance to the implementation of the Party economic policies and specified tasks and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our scientists and technicians are the nation's precious persons of talent strong in the revolutionary spirit, he said, underlining the need to take meticulous care of their work and living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed the expectation and belief that the scientists and technicians of the Hamhung Branch would bring about a fresh turn in their scientific researches and register valuable research results through the on-going dynamic 150-day campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the WPK Central Committee, and Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Je Gang, first vice department directors of the C.C., WPK."

But never before has he disclosed it so fully as this time, talking about \"faith\" and \"action\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theory of unifying the systems by strength and the theory of a fratricidal war amount to a total negation of all the agreements between the north and the south of Korea including the July 4 joint statement in which it clarified the three principles of national reunification-- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity-- and its embodiment the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor was reported to have claimed he never negates the existing agreements between the north and the south but intends to implement them. But the recent reckless remarks made by him saliently revealed before the world that it was nothing but a sheer lie and deception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee and his ilk have dreamt of launching a fratricidal war and an operation to stifle fellow countrymen under the signboard of \"co-existence and co-prosperity\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the Lee group has become more reckless in its provocative remarks against the DPRK since Lee's U.S. junket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 22, Lee went the lengths of asserting that the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is to \"deter\" and \"prevent\" a war and \"he was of the view that north Korea would open itself to others and join the international community one day.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet military disclosed even a scenario for preemptive attack on the DPRK in its \"basic plan for national defence reforms\" made public on June 26.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality goes to prove that his American master gave so strong shot in the arm of Lee in the Rose Garden of the White House that he and his group are seized with extreme zeal to stifle the DPRK and war fever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"nuclear umbrella\" is by no means all-powerful. The Lee group is seriously mistaken if it dreams of \"unifying Korea under the liberal democratic system,\" counting on it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will certainly mete out a stern punishment to the group of traitors in the name of the Korean nation for the thrice-cursed crimes it has committed by pursuing confrontation with the DPRK and sycophancy towards the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless visits paid by the group to different countries to beg for protection would only bring to light its miserable plight as fear-stricken stooges and add to its crimes."

This is clearly exemplified by the following facts: The south Korean authorities fully participated in the PSI, a U.S.-led mechanism for a war of aggression against the DPRK, taking issue with its measures for bolstering up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence, they let loose bellicose outbursts that they would not \"rule out even armed clashes\" while amassing armed forces in the waters along the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea and they are getting frantic in their dangerous \"sanctions\" against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reckless acts of the Lee group remind one of the reckless military provocations perpetrated by puppet traitor Syngman Rhee on the eve of the war of northward aggression in the 1950s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith neither plot nor artifice can the south Korean puppets cover up the truth about the war of aggression they started against the DPRK in league with the U. S. imperialists nor can they justify the evermore undisguised moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShould the Lee group finally ignite a war against the DPRK with the U.S. imperialists, oblivious of the historic lesson of the June 25 war, it will perish in the flames kindled by itself, warns the commentary."

            "content": "ATCC comenta el servilismo a EE.UU. de Lee Myung Bak\r\n  Pyongyang, 30 de junio (ATCC) -- El traidor Lee Myung Bak del Sur de Corea dijo el dia 25 en el llamado \"banquete con motivo de la guerra desatada el 25 de junio (de 1950)\" que \"ha reflejado en la vision al futuro Sur de Corea-Estados Unidos su firme fe en la reunificacion mediante la democracia liberal\" y que \"actuaria con EE.UU. bajo cualquier amenaza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este disparate significa la determinacion de realizar sin falta por via militar la reunificacion de los diferentes regimenes con el abrigo de EE.UU., siendo intolerable provocacion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y abierta instigacion a la guerra de agresion al Norte de Corea, o sea, la fratricida entre los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya quedo revelado que la \"politica sobre el Norte\" adornada con las palabras \"convivencia y coprosperidad\", de que hablan tanto las autoridades surcoreanas, es la doctrina de la encarnizada pelea de los compatriotas para eliminarse entre si.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, nunca hubo casos de que el mismo traidor Lee expusiera ese intento tan abiertamente como esta vez hablando de la \"fe\" y \"actuar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las teorias de la reunificacion de los regimenes con el uso de la fuerza y de la guerra fratricida constituyen desafio frontal a todos los acuerdos intercoreanos como la Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio, que aclara los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria, y la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, que son productos de la primera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El nuevo chisme de Lee sirve de prueba contundente para verificar cuan mentirosas y enganosas son sus palabras de que no se niega a los acuerdos existentes entre el Norte y el Sur y tiene la voluntad de ejecutarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los compinches de Lee sonaban con la guerra fratricida y el aplastamiento a los compatriotas detras del vistoso cartel de \"convivencia y coprosperidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas grave del caso es que sus discursos anti-RPDC se tornaron mas agresivos e imprudentes despues de la visita de Lee a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El pasado dia 22, Lee hablo de que la presencia de las tropas norteamericanas en el Sur de Corea es para \"disuadir\" y \"prevenir\" la guerra y que \"cree que el Norte de Corea se unira algun dia a la sociedad internacional abriendo sus puertas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras tanto, el circulo militar titere surcoreano dio a conocer el guion de golpe preventivo contra el Norte de Corea a traves del \"plan principal de la reforma de defensa nacional\" publicado el dia 26.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La realidad demuestra que el encuentro en la Casa Blanca entre el traidor Lee y su amo gringo inculco en la pandilla del primero el fanatismo por atropellar a la RPDC mediante la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, no es un medio omnipotente el \"paraguas nuclear\" de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Estaria muy equivocada la pandilla de Lee si suena con la \"reunificacion bajo el sistema democratico liberal\" confiando en esa proteccion nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC castigaran duro sin falta, en nombre de toda la nacion, a la banda del traidor Lee que cometio crimenes inexpiables recurriendo a la confrontacion con la RPDC y al servilismo a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si la camarilla de Lee sigue deambulando en busca de la proteccion, mostrara mas su miserable condicion de lacayo acobardado y abultara su expediente criminal."
