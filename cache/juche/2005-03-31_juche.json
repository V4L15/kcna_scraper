It is an indication that the Japanese reactionaries have reached a full-fledged phase in their moves to create a perfect legal and institutional environment for turning Japan into a military giant and realizing its ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Pacifist Constitution\" codifies as a state policy that Japan shall not pursue a war again nor participate in any military action of such form as a defeated nation after the end of the Second World War. It is by the force of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" that the Japanese militarists have not openly pursued their wild ambition for reinvasion. If Japan does not want to retain the ill-fame as a war and aggressor state, it should not revise the \"Pacifist Constitution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' loudmouthed \"international contribution\" is nothing but an artifice to justify Japan's moves to become a military giant and realize overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real aim sought by them in the revision of the constitution, while talking about \"international contribution\" is to have a war constitution and thus provide a legal and institutional mechanism to embark on legitimate and open overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the Japanese reactionaries cover up their reactionary and aggressive nature of their moves to revise the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better behave themselves, mindful that the revision of the constitution would only precipitate Japan's self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it is entirely just for the north to bolster its nuclear arsenal now that the U.S. is escalating the tension by ceaselessly introducing nuclear war equipment including a nuclear submarine into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People from all walks of life should not remain a passive on-looker to the U.S. dangerous moves for a nuclear war but foil its attempt to launch a war against the north through cooperation with the north for peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should behave itself, properly understanding the Korean people's strong will to fight the U.S. and achieve peaceful reunification and the pro-U.S. military authorities should immediately stop cooperating with the U.S. for a war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is nothing but a version of the bankrupt nonsensical story invented by the U.S. several years back to derail the inter-Korean economic cooperation and slander the historic Pyongyang meeting and the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time, the U.S. induced the above-said research service to make public an \"investigation report\" to the effect that north Korea diverted the money paid for Mt. Kumgang tourism since 1998 to military purposes including the experiment on detonating device for nukes. Then it provided the report to the Grand National Party so that the south Korean right-wing conservatives kicked up a racket calling for a \"special inspection of remittance to the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. report turned out to be a sheer fabrication and was thrown into a waste basket after being ridiculed and rebuffed at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have drawn a lesson from this if it had stood to reason even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, it is still busy floating the worn-out fiction of the \"diversion of Hyundai fund.\" Through this row the U.S. seeks to inject energy into its insipid nuclear racket, hamstring the inter-Korean economic cooperation and tighten the economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, no one will lend an ear to its propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop such folly, clearly understanding that its lies and deception, plots and fabrication can not work on others in this world but will more saliently reveal its despicable colors as a cesspool of evils, a chieftain of tyranny.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
