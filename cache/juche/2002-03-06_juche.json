            "content": "Bush's crimes condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- The central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea released a white paper on Feb. 13 denouncing the Bush administration for putting the brake on the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, according to Seoul-based Radio Voice of National Salvation.\r\n This lengthy document titled \"white paper on the crimes of the bush administration which blocked the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration\" has three parts: \"1. Crime of straining North Korea-U.S. relations\", \"2. Crime of hindering north-south concord\" and \"3. Crime of sparking crisis of war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the white paper, the brakes have been put on the implementation of the June 15 inter-Korean joint declaration, the north-south dialogue has been deadlocked together with the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, and the Korean Peninsula has been embroiled in the Cold War over the past one year since the appearance of the bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The white paper said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After its emergence, the bush administration began hindering the implementation of the joint declaration by hamstringing the process of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. In order to foil the events of the Korean nation for reunification, it employed three operations to torpedo the North Korea-U.S. summit talks, ditch the North Korea-U.S. agreed framework and bring the North Korea-U.S. negotiations to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's statement on the policy toward North Korea, published after nearly five months of its examination last year, was a statement denying the dialogue and the improvement of relations between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the South Korea-U.S. summit on March 7 last year, bush forced South Korea to warm the inter-Korean relations only with the U.S. approval, claiming that North Korea is not trustworthy and there is much intransparency in its nuclear development and missile issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The emergence of the bush administration has also driven the reconciliation and dialogue between the north and south of Korea to a deadlock, hindered their exchange and cooperation and blocked visits and meetings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush regime emerged a powder-reeking \"military regime\" and \"war cabinet\". \"South Korea-U.S. cooperation system\" which it regards as a basis for the bilateral relations, is a war system intended to drag South Korea into the missile defense system and the U.S.-Japan alliance and force it to participate in the \"anti-terrorism operations\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is shipping into South Korea missiles and other weapons worth ten trillion won from last year while urging the DPRK to unilaterally reduce its arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n War-like Bush has put pressure upon the DPRK, clamouring about \"mass-destruction weapons\", provocative phraseology, to find a pretext for a war against the north. and in his \"state of the union address\" on Jan. 30, he listed the DPRK, Iraq and Iran as members of \"axis of evil\". This was an open declaration of war against the north as it officially singled out it as a target of the \"escalated anti-terrorism operations\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the main target of the bush regime's new military strategy in the 21st century. The U.S. moves made so far since the \"September 11 incident\" were aimed to take the DPRK as a target of the \"anti-terrorism war\" and put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's tour of Seoul on Feb. 19 was a war junket designed to confirm this plan on the spot and let the U.S. forces go over to a real action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through his trip Bush intended to force South Korea to scrap the June 15 joint declaration, a programme for the independent reunification of the Korean nation, and spark on the Korean Peninsula a war which will bring about a national ruin, the paper warned, adding: our people can never overlook this fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper expressed the expectation that the world community would extend full support and solidarity to the Korean people in the just struggle to make the U.S. finally pay its price and achieve independence, peace and reunification of the country by implementing the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"

At last they have fully disclosed their insidious intention to scrap it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreed framework is now at risk owing to the U.S. unilateral and antagonistic attitude and stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its implementation, as a matter of fact, provides a good way of settling the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula, but the united states is keen to totally nullify it. under this situation, the DPRK can no longer underline the significance of the framework now gathering dust but will go its own way, not unilaterally bound to the framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. abrogates the agreed framework at last, it will have to take full responsibility for political, moral and material compensation to be entailed by it.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a deserved blow to him, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The creation of songs critical of the U.S. and Bush in South Korea reflects the public's bitter resentment at the U.S., the empire of evil, and towering hatred for Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the U.S. administration taken office than it rapidly escalated the anti-DPRK policy and the malignant smear campaign against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with this, Bush listed the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind his intention is to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK and fan up confrontation between the north and the south in a bid to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula, dampen the desire of the Korean nation for independent reunification and keep U.S. forces in South Korea for an indefinite period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush is so naive as to calculate that with such vituperation he can browbeat someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that the South Korean people are becoming more angry and critical than ever before of the U.S. and Bush keen to enslave the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public mindset has definitely turned anti-U.S., anti-Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary says that the U.S. imperialists should drop their anachronistic wild ambition for aggression, properly understand the South Korean people's will to struggle against the U.S. and stop at once their moves for aggression and war.     \r\n\r\n"
