Korean authorities' anti-north campaign\r\n Pyongyang, July 6 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Reunification Institute issued a statement today on the continued smear campaign conducted in South Korea against the northern system.\r\n   The campaign comes behind the facade of calls for \"improvement of inter-Korean relations\" and \"reconciliation and cooperation.\"\r\n   The spokesman said:\r\n   Since the change of \"government\" in South Korea in February, the number of anti-north slanders more than trebled.\r\n   The South Korean puppets' anti-north propaganda materials are larger than before in quantity and variety. Besides propaganda through radio and newspaper, they scatter anticommunist publications from the sky through balloons. \r\n   They even insert such materials into humanitarian goods sent to the north through international agencies.\r\n   What is intolerable is that the anti-north campaign is targeted at the dignified social system of the north.\r\n   The proportion of slanders at the social system is more than two thirds of the anti-north smear campaign. It is getting more vicious.\r\n   The developments in South Korea show that the present regime, though calling itself \"people's government,\" is a group of more vicious anti-communist, anti-north fanatics than the preceding regime and that their wish is not improvement of inter-Korean relations, reconciliation and cooperation but aggravation of the tensions and confrontation with the north.\r\n   The \"Agency for National Security Planning\" and the \"Unification Ministry\" stand behind the anti-north smear campaign. It is \"Minister\" Kang In Dok who is notorious for anti-north slanders.\r\n   Taking advantage of the temporary difficulties of fellow countrymen, the South Korean puppets are abusing this opportunity for their sinister political purposes.    This only goes to reveal their moral vulgarity and despicability.\r\n   Human scum who defected to South Korea after committing crimes in the north are used in this campaign. This is a third-rate drama and a dirge of the doomed.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must immediately stop the smear campaign against the headquarters of the Korean revolution, dissolve the anti-communist den \"Agency for National Security Planning,\" operate on the \"Unification Ministry\" and dismiss Kang In Dok, who plays the role of shock brigade in anti-north confrontation, as \"Unification Minister.\" \r\n   We sternly warn the South Korean authorities that without such measures there can be no genuine improvement of relations, reconciliation and cooperation between the north and south.    \r\n\r\n"

South Korean people and the progressive people across the world are speaking highly of the prestige and feats of the President, who was the first in history to defeat the U.S. imperialists, who were boasting of being the strongest in the world. The reverence of the entire nation and humankind for him is ever growing.\r\n   The South Korean puppets' smear campaign is the most vicious and profane provocation to the north and the never-to-be-condoned crime against the nation.\r\n   We bitterly denounce the South Korean puppets, who invented the downright lie, as a group of the most heinous separatists seeking confrontation with the north.
