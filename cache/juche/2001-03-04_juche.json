Both sides recognized the common denominator of the north's proposal for low level federation and the south's proposal for confederation and accepted it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, any side should not pursue military ties-up and cooperation with outside forces under the name of \"security.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the movement for national reunification has entered the track of national independence, it is high time to think twice before doing something. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anyone should refrain from insulting the dialogue partner as a \"principal enemy,\" obsessed by the old way of thinking and conception. The north and the south, should put spurs to the implementation of the north-south joint declaration on the principles of national independence and great unity.    \r\n\r\n"

It underscored the need for all people to loudly denounce their crime of aggression, not forgetting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A recent issue of the U.S. magazine News Week also disclosed the atrocities of the germ warfare by notorious unit no. 731 of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun today runs a commentary, which says the Japanese imperialist aggressors during the war of continental aggression were not men but devils and murderers rare in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists brutally killed millions of people in Korea alone. As unit no. 731 did, they killed people as targets of germ experiment or spread a large sum of bacteria so that people died of diseases en masse. They also drove out people to battle sites and toilsome work and murdered them at random. To \"keep a secret\" they buried people in groups in the earth or at sea and took away numerous women as \"comfort women for the army,\" most of whom were killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists' massacres have been brought to light by witnesses and historic documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Japanese reactionaries are refusing to admit the past crimes in the new century, too, and resorting to a sleight of hand to shun the responsibility for them.\r\n The crimes are bound to be redressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should take a resolute step to apologize and compensate for the past crimes as soon as possible, mindful that its refusal to redress the past crimes will bring fatal consequences to it.    \r\n\r\n"
