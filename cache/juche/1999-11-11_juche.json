Maj. Gen. William Kinn, the then commander of the U.S. 25th division, issued an order for the massacre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On July 26, 1950 just before the massacre he ordered his units to consider all the civilians in the operation theatre as the enemy and take a relevant measure that meant indiscriminate killings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Man Sun, chairman of the \"Measure Committee of Bereaved Families of the Civilians Killed in Kokan-ri\" which was recently formed, asserted that with nothing can the U.S. justify such crime as opening fire at a woman in white clothes who was taking shelter with a baby on her back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On Oct. 7 this year families of the victims and other people held an anti-U.S. meeting before the barracks of a unit of the U.S. aggression forces in Jinhae to bitterly condemn GIs' atrocities and strongly demand compensation. \r\n\r\n"

On Oct. 23 Kim Dae Jung and Kim Jong Pil invited Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi to Jeju Island and agreed with him on realizing Akihito's South Korean visit sooner or later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung regime has stood by the Japanese authorities who are trying to evade the liquidation of the past and taken pains to hide the truth about their crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt does not hesitate to  praise and encourage the moves of the Japanese reactionaries for the revival of militarism and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In October last year Kim Dae Jung was unsparing in his praises of the revival of Japanese militarism, asserting Japan's contribution after the war must be recognized and its positive aspect be appreciated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Pil unhesitatingly let loose outbursts encouraging Japan's wild ambition for overseas expansion, saying that Japan must lead Asia while Hong Sun Yong, \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade,\" said he was of the view that Japan is fully qualified to be a permanent member of the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung regime sold off national interests to its master Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It traded off golden fishing grounds in the east and south seas  of Korea to Japan under the traitorous \"South Korea-Japan fisheries agreement\" and flung open the door of South Korean market to Japanese monopoly capital through the total abrogation of the \"system of diversified import channel.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It assured Japan of \"opening South Korea to Japanese popular culture\" and enforcing \"the use of Chinese characters and other foreign languages along with the Korean language.\" It also set the year 2002 as a \"year of exchange between the South Korean and Japanese peoples\" and decided to set out on the full-scale \"exchange of tourism and  culture.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The document also lays bare pro-U.S. treacheries of the \"people's government.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Dae Jung made his first official visit to the white house after becoming master  of \"Chongwadae\" in June last year. During his junket he asked the U.S. to help him in making achievements while he is in the \"presidential office.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His regime has always implored for the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea. During his U.S. visit in June last year, he said the presence of 100,000 strong U.S. forces in northeast Asia must be continued as it is very important for meeting the interests of the U.S., adding the U.S. troops must stay in South Korea even after the reunification of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He did not bother to unveil even a plan to revise the \"South Korea-U.S. mutual defence treaty\" in a bid to secure a \"legal ground\" for the \"permanent presence\" of the U.S. forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And as the truth of massacres committed by GIs during the Korean War has begun to be disclosed, he is trying hard to hush them up, saying \"there is no clear evidence.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung regime put South Korea under the mandate of the U.S.-led International Monetary Fund and gave the green light to the unprecedented sale of South Korea to outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Because of the policy of selling South Korea, it has become ill-famed for the most serious business bankruptcy and unemployment, biggest  debts and taxes, the largest number of criminals, vagrants and suicides in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Dae Jung has gone the length of bringing to Seoul for burial the remains of Underwood who, under the mask of missionary, spread the ideas of worshipping, kowtowing to, fearing and submitting to the U.S. and conducted espionage in Korea and praising his \"achievements.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The document disclosed the Kim Dae Jung regime's anti-national \"cooperation\" with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung regime has been hell bent on war moves against the north to stifle it through the \"cooperation\" with the U.S. and Japanese aggression forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"South Korea-U.S. summit,\" \"South Korea-Japan summit\" and the \"South Korea, the U.S. and Japan summit\" held last year and this year were designed to establish a system of close military cooperation with its masters the U.S. and Japan to stifle the north on the pretext of \"its missile development.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Kim Dae Jung regime is acting a shock brigade in the criminal moves of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to put into full operation the \"U.S., Japan and South Korea tripartite military alliance,\" the chariot to carry out the \"operation plan 5027-98.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is clearly evidenced by \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise and South Korea-Japan joint maritime exercise held last year and a joint search and rescue exercise of warships of the South Korean and Japanese naval forces, the South Korea-U.S. joint military drill, \"Ulji focus lens 99\" and \"Foal Eagle 99\" war maneuvers staged this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This regime has made desperate efforts to stifle the north through military pressure and imposition of \"opening\" upon it under the \"system of cooperation\" with the U.S. and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present chief executive said that \"the engagement policy of the U.S., the sunshine policy of South Korea, is effective for leading the north to open its doors\" and \"it is proved by the changes that took place in the former soviet union and other east European countries.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The history of the nation will certainly make the Kim Dae Jung regime, the group of the worst pro-Japanese, pro-American flunkeyists and traitors, pay for its crimes and mete out a stern judgement to it, the document warns. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
