Maj. Gen. William Kinn, the then commander of the U.S. 25th division, issued an order for the massacre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On July 26, 1950 just before the massacre he ordered his units to consider all the civilians in the operation theatre as the enemy and take a relevant measure that meant indiscriminate killings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ri Man Sun, chairman of the \"Measure Committee of Bereaved Families of the Civilians Killed in Kokan-ri\" which was recently formed, asserted that with nothing can the U.S. justify such crime as opening fire at a woman in white clothes who was taking shelter with a baby on her back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On Oct. 7 this year families of the victims and other people held an anti-U.S. meeting before the barracks of a unit of the U.S. aggression forces in Jinhae to bitterly condemn GIs' atrocities and strongly demand compensation. \r\n\r\n"
