These actions are spawning serious issues as they are designed to overthrow legitimate governments, but what is graver is that they are most hideous human rights abuses as they cause mass killings of civilians and a sharp increase in the number of refugees. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the expectation that the UN-sponsored high-level meeting on terrorism would have a package discussion on the issue of terrorism and contribute to seeking more effective ways of combating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the DPRK has maintained its avowed stand of opposing all forms of terrorist actions and any form of supporting it, he said that the government of the DPRK would positively contribute to the efforts of the international community to root out terrorism and build a peaceful and stable world in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Insisting that the boat should go first to their villages, each boatman of the two villages tries to steer the boat to his village. As a result, the boat comes back to the uninhabited island. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe film gives the lesson that too many boatmen make the boat go up a mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe film \"A Boy Avenges Himself on the Enemy\", through a story about hero Jangsoe who takes revenge on the enemy of his father, teaches the lesson that in order to win over the foes, one should make full preparations without being seized with a subjective desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd the film \"Gifts of Tree Grandpa\" shows that a little bear repents of his bad habit of breaking off branches of trees at random and corrects it. The film teaches the viewers that they should value each tree. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAmong the new films are \"Secret Document of Dr. Mole\", the 28th part of \"A Squirrel and a Hedgehog\"; \"Chol I and Ok I\", the first part of \"Red Star\"; and \"True Medicine Found by Bear\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

His imperishable feat is that he has steadily enriched and developed the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung into the guiding idea of the times and attached utmost efforts to the ideological education for officials and party members under the banner of the theory of ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, who set it as the basic principle of building the WPK to achieve its ideological oneness, has always worked heart and soul to establish the monolithic ideological system in the whole party from long ago, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He laid down the programme for modeling the whole party on the Juche idea to meet the requirements of the Korean revolution on a new stage. This marked an epochal occasion in strengthening the WPK's unity and purity in thought and purpose in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, he put forward the slogan \"Let us arm ourselves more firmly with the revolutionary ideas of the great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung!\" and has more energetically led the work to train the WPK and the revolutionary ranks as an elite in political and ideological aspects over the last ten odd years. \r\n He comprehensively expounded the theory of the unique Songun politics on the basis of the President's Songun idea and Songun revolutionary leadership exploits. This is the extraordinary feat he performed in developing in depth the revolutionary idea of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the ideological and moral qualities of the WPK members are on a considerably high level. All the party members are firmly equipped with the Songun idea of Juche and live and work in the revolutionary solider spirit. This is the proud picture of the WPK at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the highest honor and pride of the WPK that it has firmly maintained it as the basic line for party building to establish the monolithic ideological system and strictly implemented it under the veteran and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is aimed at increasing the SDF's capability for mounting preemptive attacks and carrying out a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After resuming the refueling mission of the Maritime SDF in the Indian Ocean recently, the Ministry of Defense of Japan is contemplating deploying KC-767 refueling tanker in the Air SDF within this year in a bid to secure the capacity for in-flight refueling. This is an indication that the moves of the Japanese reactionaries for turning Japan into a military power and for overseas aggression are assuming increasingly dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, some days ago a U.S. institute for policy studies listed Japan as the most ambitious country in the arms race in Asia, observing that Northeast Asia is being embroiled in the arms race and this may spark off a perilous conflict in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the reality, with no trick can Japan conceal its ugly colors as a dangerous war force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Shooting down of Satellite under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. recently shot down a spy satellite by spending 60 million U.S. dollars, prompted by the worry that in case the satellite falls down on the earth, the secrets contained in it might come into the hands of \"enemies.\" But its real intention was to get conviction that the missile defence system it has frantically stepped up till now can operate in actuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. really had taken security into consideration, it would have felt no need to use ship-based missiles as the success rate is 50 percent at best, instead of using ground-based missiles to shoot down the satellite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is the fact that the U.S. shot down the satellite right after China and Russia jointly presented a draft treaty on banning the arms race in the space and called on the countries concerned to respond to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot be construed otherwise than a blatant challenge and provocation to the international efforts to ban the above-said arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not conceal the fact that its destruction of the satellite by an interceptor missile proved the credibility of its MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that the U.S. shooting down of the satellite would spark off the arms race in the space among big powers. The U.S. action was little short of triggering off the new arms race in the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is free to test-fire missiles to attack other countries, while persistently finding fault with any missile launch for self-defence in a bid to use it as a pretext for its pressure and sanctions. This is a good example of its brigandish application of double-standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no ruse can the U.S. justify its moves to build its missile shield in the space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be held responsible for having created a complicated situation and cast a dark shadow on our planet by triggering off the above-said arms race quite contrary to the trend of the times towards the demilitarization of the space and use of it for peaceful purposes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is still working hard to achieve its sinister aim with the U.S. backing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the aim of the U.S. to realize its ambition for military invasion with ease by using Japan as the most important stronghold.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military \"integration\" between the SDF which has been reorganized into aggressor forces for mounting preemptive attacks and the U.S. forces in Japan is being stepped up with increased zeal and the Japan-U.S. war maneuvers for invading the DPRK are getting evermore pronounced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan and its vicinity are witnessing ceaseless joint exercises involving all services and all-inclusive joint military drills of the forces of Japan and the U.S. aimed at coordinating the operation commanding system for invading the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of Japan and the U.S. for military nexus are assuming evermore aggressive and graver nature with each passing day, increasing the danger of a new Cold war and other wars in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned moves for the military nexus are criminal actions to threaten and disturb peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and the world.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese and U.S. reactionaries would be well advised to ponder over the consequences to be entailed by those reckless moves and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
