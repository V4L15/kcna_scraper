            "content": "KCNA holds U.S. fully accountable for loss of electricity in DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 19 (KCNA) -- As already reported, KEDO started ground concrete tamping some time ago for the construction of light water reactors (LWRs) to be provided by the United States to the DPRK by 2003 under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.\r\n In this connection the U.S. administration is unreasonably claiming that the DPRK should accept nuclear inspection of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and if not, the U.S. cannot provide LWRs to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that officials of the U.S. administration are asserting that the DPRK's demand for compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed construction of LWRs is \"groundless.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a shameless assertion intended to evade its responsibility for the delayed construction of LWRs and force the DPRK to unilaterally implement the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has already clarified, the issue to which the DPRK and the U.S. should pay greatest attention is not an issue of nuclear inspection but the issue of how to preserve the agreed framework and settle the matter raised owing to the delayed implementation of the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The core issue of the agreed framework is the U.S. provision of LWRs to the DPRK in return for its nuclear freeze and this should be implemented strictly on the principle of simultaneous action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. started the ground concrete tamping for the construction of the LWRs only recently and the LWR construction which had been initially expected to be completed by 2003 is unlikely to be finished even by 2008. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework stipulates that after a considerable part of the LWR project is carried out the DPRK shall negotiate with the IAEA and implement the safeguards accord on nuclear inspection. Accordingly, the issue of nuclear inspection is to be settled automatically depending on the progress made in the LWR construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, this construction is much delayed owing to the U.S. unilateral non-compliance with the agreed framework. As a result, the DPRK has suffered a huge loss of electricity, which has seriously affected its overall economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the DPRK developed its independent nuclear power industry, not bound to the agreed framework, it would have been certain to create the nuclear energy generating capacity of 2 million kw by 2003 and would not have suffered such an acute shortage of power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is widely known that the United States has deliberately delayed the construction of LWRs since its outset by enacting even a law intended to hamstring it at congress under various pretexts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly recognized international norm that the loss caused by non-compliance with an agreement in inter-state relations should be compensated for by the party that is to blame for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a hard fact that the point of the agreed framework calling for the completion of the LWR project by 2003 has been delayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. should, therefore, meet the DPRK's demand for compensation for the loss of electricity. It would be quite proper for the U.S. to do so in view of international law and from the moral point of view.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "10th anniversary of Kim Il Sung's work marked\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 19 (KCNA) -- A meeting was held at the People's Palace of Culture today to mark the 10th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung's famous work \"Let Us Realize The Country's Reunification Independently Through The United Effort Of The Whole Nation\".\r\n The work published on August 19, Juche 81 (1992) comprehensively lays down a principle, detailed tasks and ways to achieve the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the political bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, said in his report at the meeting that the work serves as a historic work and a great patriotic programme for reunification as it clarifies ways of expanding and developing the movement for the country's reunification relying on the driving force of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is successfully carrying out the president's instructions for national reunification, arranged with his great patriotic decision the historic Pyongyang meeting and provided the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, thus ushering in a new era of the movement for reunification, a movement to solve the issue of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. As a result, the movement for national reunification has been put on a new higher stage nationwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The short cut to independent national reunification in the new century lies in firmly defending and implementing the historic joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who truly respect the declaration and want its implementation should not rely on foreign forces displeased with the Korean reunification and pursue \"cooperation\" with them but join hands with the fellow countrymen to achieve the country's reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint military exercise Ulji Focus Lens now under way in south Korea is a product of the u.s. moves to throw wet blanket over the atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and cooperation between Koreans and deliberately strain the situation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK-U.S. relations are to improve, the united states should have a proper approach and stand on the DPRK. It should respect the sovereignty of its dialogue partner, give up its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and sincerely implement its commitments and duties as the party directly responsible for the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In south Korea there should be no such things rattling the nerves of the dialogue partner as talking about the \"principal enemy\" and \"cooperating\" with foreign forces and staging joint military exercises against the north after reaching an agreement with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should undertake a more vigorous struggle to firmly defend and implement the declaration so as to achieve the cause of national reunification, the greatest desire of the nation, without fail, Choe stressed.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
