This manifested the potentials of the national economy of the DPRK that has entered the era of knowledge-based economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He visited the modern glass production base as the first stop of his field guidance this year and then visited the workers of Songgang, convincing them that Juche is the path to be unswervingly followed by the DPRK's economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his field guidance to a big chemical base in Namhung in May this year in the wake of that in June last year, the fertilizer production system relying on naphtha came to an end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Units that had been visited by him during his tireless field guidance included the Biological Engineering Branch of the State Academy of Sciences and industrial establishments in North Phyongan Province such as and the machine manufacturing base in Rakwon which produces modern machines at its will as well as sophisticated tools factory equipped with highest-level CNC-based stream-lined production system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il visited workers of the Ryongsong Machine Complex and the February 8 Vinalon Complex four times this year and the gasification process construction site in Hungnam several times to create the new Chollima speed, speed of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His visit to the Tanchon Port construction site offered a historic occasion that let the people of the DPRK display their mental spirit of devotedly carrying out whatever they determine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He continued his undying footsteps to industrial establishments in Tanchon area and a model farm and orchards in Ryongjon and Toksong on the eastern coast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the commodity exhibition of Pyongyang Department Store No. 1 despite hot weather in July, giving important teachings to further improve the country's light industry and promote commercial services.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that modern Meat and Fish Shop in Pothongmun Street was built in six months and gave on-site guidance to it. He instructed officials to build more vegetable production bases such as the Pyongyang Vegetable Scientific Research Institute and supply people with fresh vegetables all the year round.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his guidance the Taedonggang Combined Fruit Farm has turned into a land of bliss in the Songun era and modern combined fruit processing base, stock-breeding base and net production base sprang up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il also left his footprints of great guidance to stock-breeding and fish-breeding farms and orchards across the country including the Tudan Duck Farm, the Kujang Fish Breeding Farm and the Kosan Fruit Farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also provided field guidance to Mansudae area construction to turn Pyongyang into a magnificent and world-level city replete with the revolutionary outlook on the leader in the run-up to the centenary of birth of Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the last period of his life he went round the Hana Music Information Center and the Kwangbok Area Supermarket where he took measures to supply fresh fish to Pyongyang citizens, very pleased that the supermarket would be conducive to improving the people's livelihood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il displayed superhuman strength combating mental and physical strain and illness to bring the people's desire into a reality. His heart stopped beating on a running train to our sorrow. So lamentable is his sudden demise as he passed away with the day, when prosperous socialist Korea so much desired by him is to emerge, just at hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the greatest national loss, the army and people of the DPRK are keenly realizing what an outstanding leader they had been led by along the path of victory and glory and what sacrificing field guidance Kim Jong Il had given to lay an eternal boon for the prosperity of the country."
