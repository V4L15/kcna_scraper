Y se hace cada dia mas derechista y militarista la sociedad japonesa mediante la negacion de la historia criminal y la revision de la enmienda de la constitucion para el ejercicio del derecho de defensa colectiva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la posicion  sobre la historia del pasado es la piedra de toque que determina el desarrollo y prosperidad de Japon como un Estado normal y pacifista  o la ruina como pais agresor militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas deben tomar la correcta decision dandose clara cuenta del pasado, el presente y el futuro."
