Korea Joint Naval Exercises \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Warmongers of the U.S. and south Korea staged large-scale joint naval exercises in the East Sea of Korea from Monday to Wednesday, blustering that they \"assumed the nature of demonstrating their armed forces against the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent joint naval maneuvers were staged to create atmosphere of pressure upon the DPRK in the wake of the UN Security Council's adoption of the unjust \"resolution on sanctions\" against it. This was a grave military provocation aimed at a surprise preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. nuclear powered submarine San Francisco equipped with Tomahawk cruise missiles with a range of thousands of kilometers was involved in the joint exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the nuclear submarine was a main offensive means in the Iraqi and Afghan wars. It had been forward-deployed on the Korean Peninsula at a time when the standoff between the DPRK and the U.S. was most acute in the last century. It reappeared in the waters off south Korea 19 years later to take part in the war maneuvers staged under the simulated conditions of invasion of the DPRK. This brought into bolder relief the provocative nature and danger of the recent saber-rattling. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-submarine, anti-warship, anti-air drills, naval mobile and live-shell firing exercises were included in the war exercises. This suggests they were not a simple \"demonstration of armed forces\" but drills for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean authorities wantonly violated the sovereignty of the DPRK by abusing the name of the UN. However, they are escalating the military provocations, talking about \"additional provocation\" and \"warning\" like a guilty party filing the suit first, pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation goes to prove again that it is necessary to settle accounts with the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea with arms, not with words."

This clearly indicates what phase the present Japanese ruling quarters' reckless zeal to launch overseas aggression and war hysteria have reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is hateful is that the Japanese reactionaries are making great haste to reexamine the \"defense program guidelines\" under the pretext of the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile development\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  This betrays the crafty nature of the Japanese reactionaries accustomed to accusing others to draw water to their mill. They are working hard to realize their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They recently launched a spy satellite targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and the people of the DPRK are greatly infuriated by Japan's frantic moves to beef up the SDF while groundlessly terming the DPRK's satellite launch a \"long-range missile launch\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not a way out for Japan to turn itself into a military giant and launch overseas expansion."
