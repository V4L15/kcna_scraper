This proves that the U.S. is the den of murderers and an empire of evil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, these man-killers and chieftains of aggression are pulling up the DPRK after singling it out as part of an \"axis of evil\" and under the pretext of the nuclear issue. This is a brigandish act that can be committed only by the U.S. imperialists, the world's worst hooligans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on the youth and students aspiring after patriotism and justice to dynamically fight as the vanguard to drive the U.S. imperialists out of South Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified more than once that it has nothing to do with terrorism and is strongly opposed to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one will lend an ear to the U.S. absurd assertion about the \"nuclear issue\" and the \"issue of terrorism\" in the DPRK. This will only lay bare the U.S. brazen-faced and vulgar nature as a nuclear warmonger and a kingpin of terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear this in mind and behave itself.    \r\n \r\n"

The north and the south should reject the sycophancy and dependence on outside forces and achieve the cooperation between compatriots in the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past two years have born witness to the fact that if the north and the south uphold the motto \"by our nation itself\", it is possible to achieve independence and peace and bring earlier national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should reject the \"cooperation\" with outside forces and pool the efforts of the nation from a patriotic stand to successfully overcome all trials and difficulties in their way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have conditions enough to bridge over the present difficulties. The door of dialogue is open and they have good agreements reached between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Organizations for reunification movement and patriotic people in the north and the south and overseas should solidarize and unite with each other, transcending differences of ideas and isms, and thus increase the might of the anti-U.S. patriotic forces thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the United States is the best way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should merge their voices demanding the U.S. positively respond to the DPRK proposal at an early date.    \r\n"
