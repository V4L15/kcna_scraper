            "content": "Japanese Authorities' Inhumane Act Taunted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- Papers here Thursday in commentaries opened a barrage of condemnation at the inhuman folly of the Japanese\r\nauthorities in barring the entry of members of a DPRK delegation into Japan for participating in a memorial service and a meeting for the Korean victims of forcible drafting scheduled in Tokyo.\r\n A Rodong Sinmun analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an intolerable insult to and mockery of the Korean people and an impudent act running counter to the international usage and diplomatic common sense that the Japanese authorities barred the visit to Japan of the DPRK delegation members who are activists of civic organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the DPRK government sent back to Japan all the Japanese victims of abduction and their families after the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are neither diplomatic ties nor any agreement on legal assistance between the DPRK and Japan. The DPRK side, however, not only showed all the materials and documents on the reinvestigation into \"persons whose fate was unknown\" but also handed them all over to the Japanese side as it requested at the DPRK-Japan intergovernmental working-level talks. The DPRK side have made utmost efforts and given everything possible to the Japanese side as regards the issue of the dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities blocked the entry of the DPRK delegation into Japan which was to participate in functions scheduled as a part of the humanitarian work and why? Not much penetration is needed to see through their purpose. In the new century, banking on the wars of aggression staged by the United States, the Japanese reactionaries set a precedent of overseas military operations. Capitalizing on this, they are openly working to institute a war constitution, legalize overseas expansion as a state policy and launch into a \"crusade expedition.\" Now they are massively instilling anti-DPRK hostile feelings into the Japanese people by taking up\r\nagain the abduction issue which had already been solved. By taking advantage of such social climate, they are after laying a flawless foundation for militarization and overseas aggressions. They are very much afraid that if bereaved families of Korean victims of forcible drafting and officials concerned enter Japan and disclose the anti-human crimes of Japan in abducting and taking away and murdering millions of Koreans and not sending even their remains, it might affect the laying of the foundation for militarization and overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson urges the Japanese authorities to behave themselves properly, deeply mindful of the grave consequences to be entailed by their unjust act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Takes Ultra-Right Forces of Japan Accountable \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- The chief cabinet secretary of Japan was reported to have recently announced that the DNA test of the remains of Japanese woman Megumi Yokota proved that they were bones of two others different from hers.\r\n This insistence on the part of the ultra-right elements of Japan is a despicable act, a departure from the normal way of thinking, as the husband of the deceased directly handed her remains over to the head of the Japanese government delegation, free from any involvement of the third party, when it came to Pyongyang for the inter-governmental working contact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They reneged on the agreement made between the two governments on the \"abduction issue\" in the past and now they are insisting that the DNA test proved negative. This false propaganda compels the DPRK to suspect the ulterior aim sought by Japan in persistently raising a hue and cry over the \"solution to the issue of abduction.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the DPRK sent surviving Japanese abductees and their children to Japan under the agreement reached at the DPRK-Japan summit, set up a state-sponsored investigation committee and has conducted sincere investigation to confirm the whereabouts of those whose fate the Japanese side claimed \"unknown.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side arranged interviews with many witnesses so that the death of those whose fate is unknown might be confirmed and handed to the Japanese side not only their unearthed remains but materials and articles left by them. This is just an example of the work done by the committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same is the case with that of Megumi. Her husband who is now alive directly involved himself in the handover of her remains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If, as the Japanese side claims, he handed the remains of other persons to the Japanese side, what did he expect from doing so? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something unimaginable that her husband handed to the Japanese side the remains of other persons, not hers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then there is a question as to why these ultra-right elements are so adamant in their insistence that the DPRK side handed false remains to the Japanese side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, they do not truly seek an earlier settlement of the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What they seek is to drag on the solution to the issue, while making profound confusing of the right and the wrong, in a bid to damage the image of the DPRK and help their country evade its obligation to settle its past wrongs, a pending issue in the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by them is to stoke bitterness toward the DPRK among Japanese under the pretext of \"their sentiment\" in an effort to escalate Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK and create atmosphere favorable for implementing their policy to veer the Japanese society to the Right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right elements have so far pretended to sympathize with the abductees but, in fact, they have invariably used the issue as a leverage for attaining their political design against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, clear that the recent published results of the DNA test were a product of the carefully pre-arranged political scenario for attaining a specific purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moral vulgarity of the ultra-right elements of Japan has seriously damaged the political image of Japan as they have behaved uncouthly bereft of elementary morality and good faith to be observed among countries while seeking their own glory and partisan interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the ultra-right elements of Japan insist that the remains are not those of Megumi despite the DPRK side's sincere efforts to confirm whereabouts of those Japanese whose fate they claimed \"unknown\", the DPRK can not but urge the Japanese side to return them just as they were along with the DNA test data as demanded by the husband of Megumi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ultra-right elements should bear full responsibility for having made a mockery of the investigation into the whereabouts of the above-said persons and hindered the investigation committee from properly conducting its activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They dealt with such issues as relinking of rails and roads and cooperation in marine transport between the north and the south, a flood control project along the River Rimjin, construction of the Kaesong industrial zone and settlement of accounts. In the discussions the two sides reached some agreements to delight the fellow countrymen. Two rounds of reunion of separated families and relatives were also held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, two rounds of Inter-Korean General-level Military Talks were held, with the result that propaganda activities slandering the other side along the Military Demarcation Line have been stopped and the work for withdrawing their means is going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unswerving will of the nation to achieve independence and peaceful reunification with concerted efforts was fully demonstrated through inter-Korean pro-reunification rallies to implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. They included the pro-reunification May Day rally of inter-Korean workers for 2004 in Pyongyang, the Meeting of Our Nation in Inchon, south Korea, the meeting of peasants of the north and south in Mt.

Mun Ik Hwan's visit to Pyongyang and the pan-European function to mark the 4th anniversary of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historians and athletes in the north and the south showed their will to defend and glorify the dignity and the soul of the homogeneous nation, which have created the time-honored history and culture, through joint symposiums and contests. Those included the symposium on the wrong designation of the East Sea of Korea as the Japanese Sea, joint materials exhibition demanding the return of cultural treasures looted by the Japanese imperialists, north-south joint photo exhibition hailing the registration of Koguryo relics as world cultural heritage, contact for a joint march of the north and south athletes at the opening ceremony of the 28th Olympic Games. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a model factory in the Kaesong industrial zone started its operation in December, turning out trial products, an offspring of national unity and cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
