            "content": "U.S. Military Bellicose Forces' Attempt at Permanent Presence in S. Korea Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on Tuesday assailing the U.S. military bellicose forces for becoming evermore pronounced in their attempt to permanently keep their forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On January 28, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Pacific blustered that after the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\" from the U.S. forces to the south Korean troops in April 2012, the U.S. forces would remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commander of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea uttered on January 10 that \"the U.S. forces positively support their permanent presence in south Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bitterly condemning the U.S. military for openly calling for its forces' permanent presence in south Korea, the statement termed this a sinister attempt to permanently keep Korea divided into two and stifle the DPRK by force and a blatant challenge to the ardent desire of all Koreans to usher in a new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After occupying south Korea in the guise of \"liberator\" the U.S. imperialist aggression forces ignited a war against the DPRK in a bid to dominate the whole of the Korean Peninsula. They have lorded it over in south Korea for more than six decades, driving the situation to the worst phase through arms buildup, war exercises and military provocations for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now working hard to provoke a new war, reinforcing the aggression forces in south Korea and ceaselessly staging madcap joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK quite contrary to the trend of the times toward detente and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a bitter lesson drawn from the past more than six decade-long history that as long as the U.S. forces are present in south Korea, it is impossible to achieve the reunification of Korea, realize detente and peace in the peninsula and provide a military guarantee for the development of the inter-Korean relations and prosperity common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never pardon the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' wild ambition for their permanent presence in south Korea but will strongly react to it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It reached its height with Seoul workers' general strike on Feb. 7 as a momentum. Broad masses in almost all urban and rural areas and at factories, mines and schools across south Korea turned out in the anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An Kyong Ho, director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, in a report said that the February 7 national salvation struggle was an eruption of the pent-up grudge and resentment of the people against the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and domination and a mass anti-U.S. struggle to realize their desire to build a united independent state, sovereign and democratic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle taught a bitter lesson that in order to establish national sovereignty and achieve genuine democracy in south Korea it is necessary to wage an incessant struggle till an end is put to the U.S. domination and subjugation and the U.S. imperialist aggression troops are withdrawn from it and that people from all walks of life should unite close under the banner of independence and reunification and struggle against the outsiders and their stooges as an organized force, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon all the fellow countrymen to wage a nationwide struggle to put an end to the U.S. military occupation and domination over south Korea, defend national dignity and sovereignty and usher in the new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, Ryu Mi Yong, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party, and other leading officials of power organs, public organizations and educational institutions, officials concerned and working people in Pyongyang.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Herein lies the danger of Japan's diplomacy for this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves for \"cooperation for pressure\" would be unthinkable without its sinister moves for militarist reinvasion. Its much touted-\"triangular cooperation for pressure\" is aimed at reinforcing the springboard from which to hold initiative in the diplomacy towards Northeast Asia. In other words, Japan, ostracized at the six-party talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula till now, is becoming so imprudent as to try to take initiative and behave as a political power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan would be well advised to know that it is ridiculed by the international community as it is resorting to crafty diplomacy and poor attitude to achieve its sinister political purpose with other's help without its own single card. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson advises Japan to learn from others how to administer political affairs instead of dreaming a foolish dream.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
