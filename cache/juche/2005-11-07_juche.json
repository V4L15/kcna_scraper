Their criminal acts compel the Korean people to harden their will to settle accounts with the Japanese reactionaries to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The film stresses that Korean army and people vigorously advancing under the great Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il will settle accounts with Japan for the crimes of 100 years with hatred and wrath against the Japanese imperialists, the sworn enemy sharpening a dagger for a comeback to Korea.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
