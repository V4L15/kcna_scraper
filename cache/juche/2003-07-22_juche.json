            "content": "U.S. urged to change its undesirable stand \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- These days some officials of the Bush administration, though belatedly, acknowledge the realistic nature of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, referring to the unfeasibility of the U.S. policy that calls for \"the scrapping of nuclear program first\" and \"pressure\" upon the DPRK. Such moves are quite natural and the U.S. should change its unrealistic stand as soon as possible, urges Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n The paper says: The situation of the Korean peninsula is running toward the brink of an unpredictable war due to the U.S. which is dead set against the DPRK-proposed direct DPRK-U.S. talks and conclusion of a non-aggression pact and insists only on \"the scrapping of nuclear program first\" and multilateral talks while seeking to lay an \"international siege\" around the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has no intention to attack the DPRK, there will be no reason for it to fail to accept the proposal of the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly know that any pressure, blockade and military threat never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. should, under all circumstances, be settled through equal and direct talks between the two sides and their conclusion of a non-aggression pact. This is the invariable principled stand of the DPRK on the solution of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better properly understand the unreasonableness of its assertions and the justice of the DPRK's proposal and make a practicable option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully ready for both dialogue and military action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhether the nuclear issue between the two countries is settled in a peaceful way or by war depends on the U.S. action.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA urges negotiations based on equality and trust \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- The DPRK and the United States are locked in tense confrontation at the crossroads of war and peace due to the extreme hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK. If a war broke out between them, it would be the fiercest war ever seen in the history of humankind.\r\n In face of this serious situation, the DPRK government some time ago put forward an innovative proposal to hold bilateral talks between the DPRK and the U.S. before U.S.-favored multilateral talks out of the desire to resolve the nuclear issue between the two sides and ensure durable peace and security in the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it set forth a new and broad-minded proposal to fundamentally settle the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue at the Beijing talks in April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposals are realistic, fair and aboveboard ones which take into consideration the background and present state of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., the ways of its settlement and even the U.S. \"concern.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known a fact that the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula was caused by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and has got more serious after the Bush administration came on the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush administration had dropped this hostile policy and not listed the DPRK as a member of the \"axis of evil\" and target of preemptive nuclear strike, the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue would not have been pushed to such an acute phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even though the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue was carried into extremes, the DPRK with utmost tolerance proposed to hold DPRK-U.S. bilateral talks first and sign a non-aggression treaty through a statement of the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on October 25 last year and other occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the United States is still insisting on \"scrapping nuclear program before dialogue\" and seeking to isolate and stifle the DPRK by forming what it calls \"international siege\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a brigandish demand little short of a call for unconditional surrender that a belligerent party urges the other to lay down arms before talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is a very acute matter of \"who beats whom.\" therefore, there can be no unilateral concession or compromise forced by one side. It can be settled only through negotiations based on the principles of fairness, equality and trust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the increasing nuclear threat and war provocation moves of the U.S. compelled the DPRK to reinforce its self-defensive nuclear deterrent, the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue must in any case be settled through simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States dropped its hostile policy toward the DPRK and legally committed itself to non-aggression, the latter would be ready to dispel the U.S. \"concern.\" insisting on \"scrapping nuclear program before dialogue\" aimed at disarmament of the DPRK cannot be construed otherwise than an intention not to solve the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States truly wants a peaceful solution of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue, it should respond to the DPRK-proposed negotiations based on equality and confidence. \r\n    \r\n"

But the U.S. is working desperately to stem this trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that it is now giving spurs to bolstering up the U.S. troops in South Korea after working out the very provocative \"Operation Plan 5030\" targeted against the DPRK and is holding war confabs with South Korean brasshats one after another. But this only lays bare its despicable true nature as an aggressor and splittist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national reconciliation council bitterly denounces the U.S. warhawks for stepping up their criminal moves for a new war in a bid to harass the peace in Korea, block its peaceful reunification and bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No war fever on the part of the U.S. can bring the army and people of the DPRK to their knees or stop the nation's advance for reconciliation, unity and reunification, the statement said, urging the U.S. to stop running amuck and immediately stop reckless anti-DPRK war racket, clearly understanding who its opponent is.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very dangerous military move.\r\n In the meantime, a provocative anti-north war scenario dubbed \"5030\" is said to be in the making by the U.S. Defence Department. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is part of the U.S. extremely reckless preparations to launch a nuclear war, pursuant to its strategy for a preemptive attack, going beyond the phase of \"deterrence\" that has been maintained so far while shunning the DPRK's new, bold proposal. It is, therefore, a breach of the un charter which bans any act of threatening the sovereign states by armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. has massively bolstered up its troops in and around South Korea for a preemptive attack on the north. \r\n It published \"arms buildup plan\" of the U.S. forces present in South Korea, a plan that calls for spending 11 billion dollars, and according to it, hi-tech weapons that had been used in the Iraqi war are being redeployed in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that it is stepping up the transfer of the U.S. second infantry division to the areas south of the River Han in a bid to occupy positions favorable for mounting a preemptive attack on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brought f-117 stealth fighters to South Korea and deployed B-52 and B-1 strategic bombers on Guam island targeted against the DPRK. All these moves are to carry out its strategy for a preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Defense Department reorganized the U.S. 8th army stationed in South Korea into a field army system, thus letting the huge U.S. forces in Northeast Asia come within the sphere of the military operation of the U.S. 8th army command. It set up the U.S. 9th theatre army command in Japan, making it possible for it to directly participate in military operations on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pentagon also organized a first-line unit for a preemptive attack involving U.S. marines in Okinawa, the U.S. 7th fleet and 3rd fleet, the U.S. 7th air force in South Korea, the U.S. 5th air force in Japan and others  it is quite clear that these dangerous military moves being staged by the U.S. behind the scene of \"multilateral talks\" are aimed to mount a surprise attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not misjudge the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the U.S. mounts a preemptive attack on it, the DPRK will take self-defensive measures involving all means equivalent to what the U.S. will use.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is now going to launch the second Korean war under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue.\" This is a real aim sought by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. is not opting for a solution to the nuclear issue, adamantly sidestepping the DPRK-U.S. direct talks, but making it more complicated and leading the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt at a military attack under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" has now gone beyond its critical point and this pushes the situation on the Korean peninsula to such a dangerous phase that the most disastrous and catastrophic nuclear war in human history may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. which has become more arrogant than ever before through the Iraqi war is now getting frantic, bereft of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly punish the aggressors and provocateurs by mobilizing all means they have built up century after century and give miserable death to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. adventurous \"Operation Plan 5030\" will only precipitate its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we express the firm belief that all the South Koreans and world peace-loving people desirous of peace on the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification will reject and denounce the U.S. dangerous war moves rendering the situation on the peninsula extremely tense and turn out in a vigorous campaign to stop them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
