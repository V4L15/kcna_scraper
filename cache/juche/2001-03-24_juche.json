This is nothing but a dangerous plot to revive the already bankrupt \"trilateral cooperation system\" and stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a daydream as the U.S. intention to destroy the DPRK by force can never succeed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's principled stand and mode of retaliation to counter force with force and react to a hard line with the toughest policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those keen to stifle the DPRK will only meet a shameful fiasco and ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. State Secretary's remarks under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell recently insisted that not only the \"missile issue\" of the DPRK but the \"issue of reduction of its conventional military forces\" should be brought up for discussion.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that the new U.S. administration is pursuing the policy of confrontation and war against the DPRK, not dialogue or negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation compels the DPRK to maintain the highest vigilance against the U.S.  Whether the DPRK develops missiles or increases conventional military forces is an issue to be handled by itself according to its need. It is not the issue which allows the U.S. to meddle in it and say this or that about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the new U.S. administration's talk about the DPRK's \"missile issue\" and the \"issue of reduction of its conventional military forces\" is a sinister design to realise its wild ambition to stifle the DPRK with ease by weakening its military forces and disarming it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another war was averted and peace preserved on the Korean peninsula because the U.S. war moves were frustrated by the DPRK's strong military forces based on its line of giving priority to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK wants dialogue, but it does not wish to have dialogue with its sovereignty being infringed upon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is prepared to meet U.S. challenge with challenge and react to its hardline policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persists in its moves to put military pressure upon the DPRK, pursuant to the policy of \"strength,\" the DPRK will strongly react to it and deal deadly blows to the U.S. though the earth may collapse.    \r\n\r\n"

This condition makes a favourite habitat for seafowl the year round. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The island is a wintering place for sea gulls and wild ducks and a summer breeding place for some 20 species of sea-birds including spoonbills and Chinese egret, native to northeast Asia and under worldwide protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seafowl breeding starts in late April and continues through mid-August. From late August, most of species, with their young, flock for food to seashores and estuaries of rivers, leaving the island gradually. In mid-September, only blacktailed gulls and some others are found staying. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rap island is a solitary island about 45 km southwest of Unjong-ri, Sonchon county, North Phyongan Province in northwestern Korea. Overgrown with rank wormwood, reeds and some shrubs, it hosts a dozen species of seafowl including hornbilled puffins, streaked shearwater and temmicks cormorants for breeding in April through June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The other reserves on Unmu, Taegam, Unggi Al and Thongchon Al islands are reserved for breeding of grey herons, white rumped swifts, bering island guillemots and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government guards against any environmental pollution around these refuges.    \r\n\r\n"
