Moreover, it has not yet begun implementing the measure it took to partially lift economic sanctions according to the framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We can conclude that the U.S. Side has  maintained an insincere approach to the framework for the past 5 years.   Its implementation requires both sides  to display a high degree of political will.   Now that the DPRK side has done everything  possible so far,  now is the time for the U.S. side to show a good faith by taking a prompt measure to sincerely implement  what was agreed between the U.S. and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the construction of the LWR  is further delayed as now and the failure to complete it until the year 2003 becomes clear,  the U.S. side will be held wholly responsible  for that and it will have to  meet undesirable consequences. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
