Korean Puppet Regime Flayed for Taking Lead in Adoption of Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights Resolution\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Saturday issued information bulletin No. 1080 condemning the south Korean puppet regime for joining those states which co-sponsored the railroading of the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" through the UN session.\n\t\t\t\t\t The information bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the south Korean puppet regime which cried out for the adoption of the \"resolution\" with the information full of lies, fabrications and plots, while begging for the cooperation for the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign. It is also the regime which, not content with arranging interview of human scum by riff raffs of the international community in south Korea, let them present \"testimonies\" in the international arenas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The puppet group took the lead in fabricating the \"human rights resolution\", pursuant to the U.S. It is aimed to defame the high authority and influence of the DPRK, justify the moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and divert public opinion elsewhere in a bid to put the people's mindset under control, calm down the spirit of the south Korean people's anti-\"government\" struggle and thus tide over the ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are the top-class sycophants and traitors without an equal in the world who leave south Korea to the tender mercy of the U.S. as its colony and offer even the military prerogative to foreign forces, and the biggest human rights abuser who turned south Korea into a tundra of human rights. It is, therefore, nonsensical for them to talk about someone's \"human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a ridiculous daydream to try to use \"human rights\" racket for bringing down Korean socialism that displays its might by dint of Songun and wins victory after victory by dint of single-minded unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group actively joined the U.S. manipulation of the provocative \"human rights resolution\" against the DPRK while kowtowing to the U.S. This is little short of a declaration of an all-out war against the social system and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will neither remain a passive onlooker to the puppet forces' \"human rights\" racket nor pardon anyone who provokes its dignity, social system and people even a bit with the \"human rights\" as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans and the international community should see through the despicable nature and sinister scheme of the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign kicked off by the U.S. and south Korean puppet group and categorically reject it."

            "content": "No toleraremos a los ofensores a  dignidad, destaca CRPP\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 22 de noviembre (ACNC) -- Para condenar a la banda titere del Sur de Corea que presentandose como \"pais co-proponente\", se entrego a la fabricacion de la \"resolucion de DDHH\" contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 22 una informacion no.1080.\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos, al mendigar la cooperacion en el sector de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC, incitaron la fabricacion de la \"resolucion de DDHH\" con los datos llenos de fraude, falsificacion e intrigas, invitaron a la morralla de la sociedad internacional al Sur de Corea para que se reunieran con las escorias humanas e hicieron que ellas hagan \"testimonio\" hasta en la escena internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi recuerda el documento y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente comportamiento de los titeres surcoreanos es para manchar el alto prestigio y la influencia de la RPDC, justificar sus maniobras conflictivas, desviar la opinion publica a fin de calmar a los habitantes y desanimar la lucha \"anti-gobierno\" de los habitantes surcoreanos y de esta manera salir de la crisis de dominacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ilogico que hablen de \"DDHH\" de alguien los violadores de DDHH quienes entregaron a EE.UU. el territorio surcoreano como colonia de este imperio y hasta la autoridad de mando militar y convirtieron el Sur de Corea en el infierno de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs absurda la intencion de la banda titere surcoreana de atentar con tal campana contra nuestro socialismo que ostenta su aspecto majestuoso con el Songun y marcha victoriosamente con la unidad monolitica. Esa intencion no se realizara nunca aunque pasen mil anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos se sumaron a la aprobacion de la \"resolucion de DDHH\" anti-RPDC en contubernio con el imperio, lo que significa la declaracion de guerra total contra nuestro regimen y nuestro pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo estaremos con brazos cruzados ante la campana de \"DDHH\" de la banda titere del Sur de Corea ni perdonaremos jamas a quienes se atrevan a danar nuestra dignidad, regimen y pueblo, bajo el pretexto de \"DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos y la sociedad internacional deberan rechazar categoricamente la siniestra intencion y el sucio complot que hay detras de la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y la banda de titeres surcoreanos."
