The spokesman said that the UN Security Council took a step of withdrawing the UN peace observation mission from Angola as demanded by its government. This is entirely due to the U.S. arbitrary practices and interference, the spokesman noted, and went on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. has behaved as it pleases lording it over the UN.    The U.S. used name when necessary, and defied the UN when unfavorable to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The UN adopted a just resolution on dismantling  the \"UN command\" present in South Korea and withdrawing  all the US armed forces from South Korea already 20 years ago. In spite of this, the U.S. still keeps its armed forces in South Korea under the berets of the \"UN forces.\" This is a clear evidence of U.S. arbitrary and insolent acts of defying the UN.   The U.S. should stop such illegal acts as interfering in internal affairs of other countries to trigger off disputes and aggravate them, clearly mindful that the time has gone when it had its arbitrary decision passed at the UN by using its voting machine.  \r\n   \r\n"

A gross violation of the principle of UN Charter and International Law, the current NATO air strikes have  cast their gloomy shadow over the peace and security of the Balkan peninsula and other parts of the world, he said. \r\n\r\n"

In this connection, a spokesman for the Committee for Investigation into the Damage Caused by the Japanese Imperialist's Occupation of Korea answered a question put by KCNA today.   He said Japan should not embellish its history of aggression and unheard-of anti-ethical crimes and follow the dangerous footsteps of militarism, but frankly admit and make a sincere apology and adequate compensation for its past crimes as Germany did.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The government of Germany announced it would pay compensation out of \"fund for memory, responsibility and future\" from September 1 to those victims who have not yet received it, irrespective of religious belief and nationalities, the spokesman noted, and said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since the end of the World War II the German government has paid 60-80 billion dollars in compensation in various forms, honestly admitting the Nazi state crimes and apologizing to the world community.   Germany, which shows continued governmental care for compensation to the victims, announced another huge compensation this time. The step is an expression of its will to see in the new century after completely settling the Nazi past.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unlike Germany, Japan has refused to liquidate its past wrong.   In the past Japan occupied Korea illegally and imposed immeasurable misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean people. Nevertheless, it has been resorting to all kinds of tricks to shirk the blame for the past crimes instead of admitting and apologizing for them.   It is now talking about \"improvement of relations\" with the DPRK. Though, it turns aside the responsibility for the past crimes and, on the contrary, sets out these or those conditions for the \"improvement.\" \r\n  \r\n"

He said:&nbsp;&nbsp; I was forced to be cannon fodder for the U.S. forces during the last Korean War, and volunteered to join the People's Army in the remaining days of the war.   The South Korean authorities describe those who joined the People's Army, refusing to serve in the \"ROK army\" in the war as \"POWs of the ROK army.\" I was not a \"POW\" but voluntarily joined the People's Army and fought with the enemy.   In the North Korea there is no \"POW of the ROK army.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim said he hailed from Yangbok-ri, Pogae-myon, Ansong county, Kyonggi Province.   He defected to the DPRK because he was disillusioned with the living in South Korea occupied by the U.S. and unable to serve any more in the cursed \"ROK army,\" he said.   On May 7, 1951, he came over to the DPRK, joined the Korean People's Army and fought at Yanggu in the eastern sector of the front, he said adding:&nbsp;&nbsp;I was admitted to the Worker's Party of Korea in October 1953.   I have worked at the Pyongyang Mechanization Office ever since discharge from military service.   I made home and live a very happy life  as a full-fledged citizen under the care of the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   I, a war veteran, am respected and loved by the people.   My returning to cursed South Korea, turning my back on the generous DPRK, is unimaginable.   The South Korean authorities should not call for the return to the south of those who do not want to go back, but repatriate as early as possible the unconverted long-term prisoners who earnestly call for their return to the north. \r\n  \r\n"

Meanwhile, the \"prosecutor's office\" adopted a so-called \"countermeasure\" to step up the \"arrest campaign against\" the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) and foil its activities beforehand, including its inaugural ceremony.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is another repressive order  and plan of the fascist clique to arrest  at all costs the struggle of workers and students for vital rights and democracy, says Minju Joson in a commentary today.   The news analyst continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The present South Korean rulers, in utter disregard of the living of the working people, have resorted to the policy which gratifies the greed of foreign monopoly capitalists and meets the interests of entrepreneurs alone.   They have legalized the \"layoff\" and forced \"restructuring\" of enterprises, which resulted in massive dismissal of workers.   The South Korean ruler's  threat to \"strictly check\" the struggle of workers against the \"layoff\" and \"restructuring,\" dismissing it \"illegal\" is a wicked act that can be committed only by those forsaken by the people. \r\n\r\n"
