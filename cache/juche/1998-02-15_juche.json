Kim Jong Il\r\n Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the 6,000-seat hall of the April 25 House of Culture here today to celebrate the 56th birthday of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n    Choe Thae Bok, alternate politburo member and Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee, made a report. \r\n   The birth of the respected comrade Kim Jong Il as a great son of guerrillas on Mt. Paektu, the sacred mountain of revolution at the stirring times when the dawn of national liberation was breaking, was a great national auspicious event of the nation that ensured the future of successful succession to the revolution of Juche and promised a bright future of Korea, the reporter said, and continued:\r\n   Comrade Kim Jong Il is the destiny of our party, revolution and country and organizes and guides all the victories. \r\n   After he was acclaimed as a prominent leader in the period of a great worldwide upheaval when the international socialist movement were undergoing repeated trials, the Workers' Party of Korea and our own socialism could greet a heyday and enter a period of all-round flowering.\r\n   He has constantly maintained and applied the principle of the leadership that politics, the economy and culture should be developed in our own way, and the guiding method of solving all problems arising in the revolution and construction by setting in motion people's mind, thus bringing about a radical turn in political, economic, military, cultural and all other fields.\r\n   He has exceptionally strengthened the three major forces of the party, the army and the people into a harmonious whole and built them into the invincible revolutionary forces which reliably ensure the victorious advance of Korean socialism in any storms. It is his greatest brilliant feat of historic significance. \r\n   He also advanced reunification policy in keeping with the requirement of the developing revolution to give a powerful stimulus to the nationwide struggle to reunify the country. \r\n   Consistently adhering to the foreign policy in the idea of independence, peace and friendship, he has conducted external activities so energetically that the socialist movement could powerfully advance on the track of independence.\r\n   He is the supreme incarnation of fidelity to the great leader President Kim Il Sung. And he is a gifted, great man with matchless, distinguished leadership ability and noble virtues and an elder of world politics, who has performed immortal feats for the victory of the Juche revolution and the human cause of independence and opens a bright future of the nation and humankind.\r\n    The reporter called for strengthening the singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks around General Secretary Kim Jong Il as firm as a rock and upholding his idea and politics to glorify the new era of the Juche revolution with brilliant achievements for national prosperity.\r\n   Recalling the fact that General Kim Jong Il gave his on-site guidance to Jagang Province to start the forced march of all the people for a new great progress in socialist economic construction, he stressed:\r\n   The whole party, all the army and all the people should turn out to bring about a new advance in the socialist economic construction.\r\n   They should keep keyed-up and mobilized attitude toward the obtaining situation and continue directing big efforts to strengthening the revolutionary armed forces, true to our party's idea of attaching importance to the army.\r\n   We, under the guidance of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, will resolutely smash the moves of anti-reunification separatist forces at home and abroad through a nationwide struggle of all the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas, upholding the banner of the three charters of national reunification and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country without fail.\r\n   Our party and government of the republic will invariably pursue the foreign policy of independence, peace and friendship and further strengthen solidarity and unity with the world's progressive people under the banner of independence against imperialism and greatly contribute to accelerating the cause of global independence, the reporter concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
