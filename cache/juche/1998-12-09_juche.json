They have inflicted immeasurable pains and disasters upon the people, occupying  the southern half of  Korea for more than half a century. In the three-year-long Korean war they dropped nearly 600,000 tons of napalm and other bombs on the northern half of Korea, reducing streets and villages to heaps of ashes and killing a large number of innocent people in cold blood.\r\n   The Korean people still remember the thrice-cursed atrocities of the Yankees. They have waited for a chance to wreak their vengeance upon the enemies at any cost.\r\n   The Korean people neither want nor avoid a war. If the war is imposed, they will never miss the opportunity, but wreak their century-old grudge of the nation.\r\n   \"Option of preemptive strike is not a monopoly of the U.S. at all.\"\r\n   \"Who tries to dispirit us?\"\r\n   \"Let us deal an annihilating blow at the enemies without mercy.\"\r\n   \"Concession to the U.S. imperialists is precisely submission and surrender.\"\r\n   \"U.S. imperialist aggressors, do not expect mercy from rifles and bayonets of justice.\"\r\n   They all represent the eruption of the resentment of the Korean people throughout the country.\r\n   Korea has matchless courage and the people are in high spirits.\r\n   It is clear that the U.S. imperialists whose decline began in this land in the 50s will certainly go to ruin in the 90s.\r\n   The Korean people who rose up in the fight with the U.S. imperialists, with surging indignation, will make the latter meet the fate of forlorn wandering spirits.    \r\n \r\n"

The unity enables the army and the people to move as one on the orders of the respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The army and people of Korea are wholeheartedly united around Marshal Kim Jong Il. Their experiences convince them that he represents their destiny and the banner of all victory and glory. When the time comes for decisive battle, they will become human bombs and defend the headquarters of the revolution, shouting \"long live Marshal Kim Jong Il \"\r\n   The DPRK is full of revolutionary ethos. The party, the army and the people move as one in conformity with the leader's ideology and will. They readily go through thick and thin if the leader wants them to do so, and never deviate even if there is a mine field ahead. This is the feature of the wholeheartedly united revolutionary ranks.\r\n   Wholehearted unity is also a source that enables the army and the people to display mass heroism to the full.\r\n   There is no limit to the might of mass heroism, a product of our wholehearted unity based on intense loyalty and filial piety to the leader and noble revolutionary comradeship.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n"

Space experts of the world highly estimate the DPRK for successfully solving difficult scientific and technical problems such as development of super heat-resisting material, control of satellite's position and  peculiar stage separating method.\r\n   The launching site built by Korean scientists and technicians themselves attracts attention  from the world because it costs a large amount of fund.\r\n   The observation of the satellite is  being made on a scientific basis.\r\n   It is helpful toward accelerating the space study for peaceful purposes.\r\n   Technical problems of manufacturing and controling the multi-stage carrier rocket and separating its engines have already been solved satisfactorily. And complex and difficult technical problems of placing a satellite into orbit and issues of making  communications with the satellite, accurately operating electronic devices in the space and establishing a perfect system of observing the satellite in the earth have been solved. \r\n   Some time ago, scientists, technicians, workers and officials who contributed to the launch of the satellite were awarded state commendations, gifts and state academic degrees and titles.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
