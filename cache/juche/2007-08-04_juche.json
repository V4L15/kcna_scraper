These immortal exploits he performed by leading the war to victory are shining along with the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These exploits have been successfully carried forward thanks to the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu possessed of extraordinary wisdom and far-sighted strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As commanded by Kim Jong Il the Korean People's Army has grown to be an invincible revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu capable of annihilating any formidable enemy at one blow and developed into a driving force for reinforcing the socialist military power and mighty vanguard for achieving the prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite a new war, far from drawing a bitter lesson from their defeat in the past Korean War, the Korean People's Army will fully demonstrate before the world the mettle of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt.

When he was staging an armed struggle later, he keenly witnessed that the Jiandao area was soaked in a sea of blood at the point of bayonets of the invaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@What deeply moved him was the feature of the indomitable Korean people who courageously rose up in the resistance, without submitting to such miserable lot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@This all-out resistance even involved the women, who had been bound by three bonds and five moral rules and three principles of obedience preached by Confucianism, and their children, who used to grumble over their food on their mothers' laps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@As he provided support to them and sympathized with them, the images of a woman and her children, who followed in the footsteps of their fallen revolutionary husband and father formed and developed in his mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@He wanted to produce a work dealing with the principal character of such a woman. He found time in hot battles to write single details and a few words of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@On a summer day in Juche 25 (1936) a premiere of the play \"The Sea of Blood\" was staged in Manjiang, a slash-and-burners' village, immediately below Mt.

But the famous work \"The Sea of Blood\" still implants in the minds of the Korean people the truth that the revolution is the only way-out and the revolution should be carried to accomplishment.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is no more No.1 party in the house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Friday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group itself is to blame for the defeat of the LDP in the election. Japanese voters turned their backs on the LDP because they felt disillusioned about the political incompetence of the Abe Cabinet and its corrupt policy and its policy poor in substance, though showy in appearance&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The disgraceful defeat of the LDP is a deserved result of the Abe regime's political incompetence and anti-popular policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nearly one year long course of the Abe Cabinet is marred by nasty records run through with Abe's incompetence and diplomacy bereft of principle and reckless militarist moves. No sooner had the Abe group taken office than it got frantic in realizing its militarist ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The miserable defeat of the Abe group in the election is, in a way, a result of its hostile policy toward the DPRK. During its office it has pursued a hostile policy previously unknown toward the DPRK. Foaming at its mouth as a manifestation of its hostile feelings toward the DPRK, the group resorted to a madcap smear campaign and sanctions against it. And it has thrashed around in a desperate effort to destroy the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, the dignified overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group, after taking office, brought forward again the already-settled abduction issue under the pretext of the \"sentiments of the people\" and made it \"an industry of abduction,\" reaching the peak of hysteria to utilize it for the maintenance of its power and for the victory in the election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group should clearly learn from the upper house election returns what consequences an unpopular, corrupt policy entails and what sorry lot awaits incompetent fellows acting rashly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun comenta derrota del PDL de Japon\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 3 de agosto (ATCC) -- En las elecciones de consejeros de la dieta japonesa, celebradas hace unos dias en Japon, el Partido Democratico Liberal sufrio una gran derrota. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De esta manera, perdio el control en esa camara por primera vez despues de su fundacion en 1955 y la calidad de primera agrupacion politica de Japon.   Asi comienza un comentario individual difundido este viernes por el diario Rodong Sinmun y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La perdida del PDL en esos comicios se debe a la propia banda de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los votantes japoneses viraron la espalda a esta entidad porque ya estan decepcionados de la incapacidad politica, la vistosa pero inconsistente, impopular y corrupta politica del gabinete de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La estancia de cerca de un ano de este ejecutivo en el poder es una sucia trayectoria signada de la ineptitud y la diplomacia sin criterio propio de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, tan pronto como asumiera el poder, la horda liderada por el se enfrasco en las maniobras para satisfacer su ambicion militarista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por otra parte, esa derrota electoral es un resultado de la brutal politica hostil a Corea, que practican los pandilleros al mando de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al exponer abiertamente su hostilidad a Corea, ellos recurrieron desenfrenadamente a la demagogia y la sancion contra la RPDC y se afanaron en destruir la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon) que es una digna organizacion de los ciudadanos de la primera en ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, pretextando el \"sentimiento popular\" ellos volvieron a cuestionar el ya resuelto problema del secuestro a fin de convertirlo en una \"industria\" que este en funcion de sus maniobras para mantenerse en el poder y de su campana electoral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A traves del saldo de las elecciones de consejeros, la banda de Abe debe darse clara cuenta de que sus impopulares y corruptas politicas tienen nefastas consecuencias y de que los incapaces e imprudentes caen en una situacion muy tragica.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
