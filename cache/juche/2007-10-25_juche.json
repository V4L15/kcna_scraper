But Japan only is engaged in dastardly acts causing the concern of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is calling for extending sanctions while persistently raising the abduction issue that had already found a solution, an issue quite irrelevant to the mission and the purport of the six-party talks. One can wager from this that there is no politician capable of seeing far into the future in Japan, though it is dreaming of becoming a political power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still more fantastic is for Japan to advertise sanctions against the DPRK as a \"breakthrough\" in the solution of the problem. It does not make any sense to talk about normalizing relations while challenging the dialogue partner with sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's push to maintain sanctions against the DPRK is a deliberate and premeditated provocation to escalate the confrontation between the DPRK and Japan and put a hurdle in the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Standing glaringly exposed again is the Japanese reactionaries' criminal scheme to secure a pretext for turning Japan into a military giant and realizing its nuclear weaponization by blocking the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations under the pretext of the abduction issue and curbing the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula with the breakdown of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese Cabinet is trying to repeat what the preceding Cabinet did, crying over the abduction issue. This would be a foolish act of following in the woeful footsteps of the predecessor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese authorities had better draw a lesson from the miserable end of the preceding Cabinet and stop the reckless farce of anti-DPRK sanctions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The UN is faced with a lot of tasks at present. Unilateralism and arbitrary and high-handed practices have become pronounced, disturbing peace and security in the world, making the international relations complicated and hamstringing the progress of human civilization. Mankind can successfully meet these challenges only when the member states of the UN establish and develop the fair international relations based on the multilateralism that calls for strictly abiding by the universally accepted principles of respect for sovereignty, equality, territorial integrity and reciprocity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The application of unreasonable double standards to the international relations constitutes a factor of obstructing the development of the equal and sound international relations and a lever for infringing upon the sovereignty of the member states of the UN. The UN should reject the double standards in the international relations and ensure that the principle of equality and impartiality is strictly observed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lasting world peace and security would be unthinkable without putting an end to the situation where \"the rich get ever richer and the poor get ever poorer\" rapidly deteriorating in the world, eradicating poverty and resolving the social and economic problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be progress in ensuring global peace and security and the trust of the international community in the UN will grow deeper only when the UN increases its role and function as required by the times and in line with the desire and aspiration of humankind and settles all the international issues fairly and reasonably on the principle of justice and equality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A lot of dead cluster bombs are exploding in different parts of the world, claiming huge casualties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. decided to deploy new type cluster bombs to be ready to be used within this year, a challenge to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for harassing the world peace, escalating arms race and proliferating weapons of mass destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
