            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM Lays Bare Reactionary, Dangerous Nature of Obama's Asian Junket\r\n Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t It is reported that U.S. President Obama is to tour Asia soon. Pursuant to the U.S. pivot to Asia-Pacific strategy, his projected trip is a reactionary and dangerous one as it is aimed to escalate confrontation and bring dark clouds of a nuclear arms race to hang over this unstable region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This strategy which the Obama administration adopted under the signboard of \"rebalancing\" in the Asia-Pacific region late in 2011 is, in essence, designed to focus efforts on this region in a bid to encircle and contain its rivals and maintain its political and military edge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is citing the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile threats\" and \"provocation\" as a pretext for hiding the hegemonic nature of the above-said strategy and warding off the resistance of big countries in Eurasia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The Quadrennial Defense Review Report\" announced by the U.S. Department of Defense early in March took issue with the DPRK over its \"provocation\" and \"threat\", reconfirming that the U.S. would deploy 60 percent of its naval force in the Asia-Pacific region till 2020, pursuant to the \"strategy for rebalancing in the Asia-Pacific region\". During his recent trip to a neighboring country, the U.S. secretary of Defense announced that the U.S. would additionally deploy two Aegis in Japan till 2017, citing \"invasion\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Touring south Korea and China in mid-February, the U.S. secretary of State vociferated about the DPRK's promotion of nuclear development and possible \"provocation\" while blustering that the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises would be staged in the same period and by the same method in the future, too, regardless of the crucial proposal made by the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and the north-south high-level contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that Obama will trumpet about the same thing to accuse the DPRK this time, too, just as he habitually did in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the reason why the U.S. is ceaselessly staging extremely offensive and aggressive joint military exercises in south Korea only among various areas in the Asia-Pacific region and steadily increasing their number and scale in a bid to deliberately keep the vicious cycle of tensions. Its aim is to steadily rattle the nerves of the DPRK and compel it to bolster up its nuclear deterrence, take military retaliatory steps and thus label it a \"bellicose country\" and justify Washington's military moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. is seriously mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. arms buildup in the Asia-Pacific region and joint military exercises are not justified but facing an unprecedentedly open rebuff of countries in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the DPRK is not such a country which may allow itself to make even a slight concession or seek any lucky chance over the fundamental issue related to the security of the country and the nation for fear of the nonsensical label of \"bellicose country.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the policy stand of the DPRK to redouble the efforts to bolster up justifiable deterrence for self-defence in every way to resolutely counter the U.S. hostile action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. seeks hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region as now and continues working hard to infringe upon the interests of the DPRK under this pretext, this will bring adverse consequences to the U.S. itself in the long run.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. reckless moves will have a very negative impact on resuming the six-party talks and realizing the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula for the present and, moreover, inevitably spark a nuclear arms race in the whole region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear arms race in Northeast Asia which will prove more destructive than the nuclear issue in Mid-east is bound to end up making a mess of the initiative for building a \"world without nuclear weapons\" advocated by Obama.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Obama administration would be well advised to coolly examine its hostile policy toward the DPRK whether it is in the final interests of the U.S., in actuality, when there is still time for it."

He highly praised the soldier-builders and officials of the relevant field for making great contributions to creating one more precious asset to be handed over to the generations to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \"There were bottlenecks and difficulties in the course of remodeling the camp but the trouble taken by us proved fruitful, one year hardworking would help the country make a decade of progress. How gratifying it is to watch the camp remodeled this way. We make a revolution to see such fruit\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for giving good finishing touches to the project and holding a ceremony of its completion with splendor as it was remodeled as required by the Party so that happy laughter and cheerful singing of children might be heard from the camp.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Jong Nam, So Hong Chan, Han Kwang Sang, Hwang Pyong So and Ma Won Chu"

Korean Puppet Forces' Anti-DPRK Human Rights Campaign \r\n Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces plan to set up in south Korea a hideous anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization called the UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs said at the \"National Assembly\" Committee for Diplomacy and Unification that \"he conveyed to the UN the point that south Korea has a willingness to house 'Office for Human Rights in North'\" and a spokesman for the Foreign Ministry also clamored for \"actively examining\" the issue of setting up the office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The coteries of the \"Saenuri Party\" staged the farce of making public a \"joint statement\" demanding the establishment of the UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\" and 17 conservative and reactionary organizations including the Citizens' Solidarity for Human Rights in North and wicked conservative media are kicking up a row, calling for taking measures for setting up the office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in an answer given to a question put by KCNA Monday denounced this as another intolerable hideous politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK and a height of confrontation hysteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the farce of setting up the UN \"Office for Human Rights\" was staged by the U.S. to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and bring down their social systems only to be bitterly censured by public in various countries for its illegal and provocative nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has malignantly slandered for no reason the DPRK in which the genuine life of the popular masses is ensured at the highest level by law and institutional mechanisms and kicked up a human rights campaign against it. Not content with this, the U.S. is working hard to set up the above-said office. However, various countries are opposed to its move, voicing objection to south Korea's offer to host the office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, the preceding regimes of south Korea which had been keen on kicking up a human rights campaign against the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S., dared not raise the issue of setting up in south Korea the UN \"Office for Human Rights in North\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate bid made by the puppet forces to set up such office is aimed at building an international center for anti-DPRK human rights campaign in south Korea in a bid to escalate the campaign as their sinister scenario is no longer workable on anyone. It is designed to ratchet up their provocative racket to hurt the dignity and the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This bid was also prompted by their sinister plot to put pressure on progressive and democratic forces including the opposition parties in an effort to railroad the \"Bill on Human Rights in North\" through the puppet NA come what may and use it in favor of the \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" due in June.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the puppet forces persist in their moves to set up the office despite the warnings of the DPRK and the denunciation by all Koreans, the DPRK will regard it as a hideous provocation insulting and mocking at its people and social system and as a declaration of a war against the social systems and force the provokers to pay a dear price for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces should ponder over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their frantic anti-DPRK human rights campaign and immediately stop the foolish farce."
