Korean Authorities Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued information bulletin No. 885 on Saturday, denouncing the despicable pro-American submission of the south Korean authorities over the issue of the withdrawal of the U.S. troops' oil pipe.\r\n The controversial oil pipe was laid in 1972 by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea for oil transport. It was for the exclusive use of the U.S. troops extending a total of 452 km from Phohang in North Kyongsang Province to Uijongbu of Kyonggi Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops in south Korea had used this oil pipe and handed it over to the south Korean authorities in 1992 when its days have expired. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean public says that the astronomic amount of expenses needed for the dissolution of the old oil pipe and rehabilitation of environment can not be borne by the \"tax collected from the people\" and asserts that the U.S. military side should bear all the expenses as it had built and used it, the information bulletin noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea are forcing south Korea to bear all the expenses and the south Korean authorities, yielding to it, are taking a pro-American submissive attitude that the government should bear the expenses for the withdrawal of the oil pipe as it had already taken it over and registered it as state property. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an unpardonable criminal act of doing harm to the dignity, interests and sovereignty of the nation because it shows the aggressive and dominationist stand of the U.S. toward south Korea and the slavish position of the south Korean authorities as henchmen of a colony who cannot live a moment unless they curry favor with the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a prerequisite for reunification and a patriotic struggle for the supreme interests of the nation to drive out of this land the U.S. imperialist aggression troops which are interfering and obstructing the patriotic reunification movement of the Korean nation against their loud-mouthed advertisement of \"peace\" and \"reunification\" of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula is reaching a very dangerous pitch at which a war may break out any moment. It is clear that if a war breaks out on this land owing to the reckless military provocation of the U.S. imperialist bellicose elements, it will immediately turn into a nuclear war and impose unpredictable disasters upon the Koreans in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the peace of the country and the security of the nation cannot be defended as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression troops remain in this land, now that the U.S. criminal attempt to unleash a second war for aggression in the Korean peninsula at any cost has become clear and the movement of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops stationed in south Korea, its field executor, is reaching a reckless stage.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves for Overseas Aggression Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 26 (KCNA) -- Japan is letting out a stream of words that it should relax the \"restraint of arms buildup and three principles of arms export\" and re-prescribe the overseas activity of its \"Self-Defense Forces\" as its main duty, not offbeat one at present.\r\n In this regard, the advisory body of the Japanese prime minister totally revised the present \"plan for fundamental defense capability\" based on the \"exclusive defense\" policy and decided to present to the prime minister an inclusive \"report on defense\", which deals with such issues of introducing long-range large transport planes necessary for overseas dispatch of the SDF and providing legal conditions for possible production of the missile defense system under Japan-U.S. joint research. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fully proves that Japan is trying to change the concept of \"defense\", which it has superficially maintained in the course of realizing its ambition to become a military giant, into an offensive one and openly convert the SDF into armed forces for overseas invasion. Minju Joson Sunday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that Japan is now readjusting the main structure of the Ground SDF allegedly to cope with attacks and surprise strikes and thus prevent \"terrorism\" and \"infiltration of commandoes\", the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's desperate military moves under the pretext of coping with \"terrorism\" are none other than a serious challenge to the aspiration of the international community after the peace and stability of Northeast Asia as they are a manifestation of its ambition for militaristic overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the basic objective of Japan to paint itself as a war state at an early date by realizing its long-cherished ambition for militaristic overseas expansion and conversion into a military power, availing itself of the global trend of \"anti-terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not difficult to guess what holocaust Asia and the rest of the world would suffer if Japan, which is fervent with revenging itself on its defeat in the Second World War, provokes a war of overseas invasion after having complete offensive capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noon day that the Korean peninsula would be the first target of Japan's attack for overseas invasion. Accordingly, the DPRK is watching the recent military moves of Japan with high vigilance and cannot but get fully ready to cope with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should immediately stop its political rashness hastening its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It clarifies on a scientific basis the serious political and economic crisis of bluffing modern imperialism, the issue of its inevitable ruin and issues arising in increasing the driving force of revolution. The period since the publication of the work was one of the proud struggle in which the cause of socialism advanced victoriously under the banner of anti-imperialist struggle and the validity of Kim Jong Il's ideas and theories and the greatness of his leadership have been clearly proved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set out the theory and strategy and tactics of awakening and organizing masses and training core elements among them to suit the changed situation and conditions in recent years, thus strengthening and developing the revolutionary forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made a deep analysis of the socio-class relations and on this basis set out the idea and theory of organizing the revolutionary forces with the People's Army as a core force and a driving force on the principle of placing the army before the working class. This serves as immortal guidelines in drastically augmenting the driving force of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the banner of Songun held aloft by him serves as the most powerful weapon in the present anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle. Revolution can emerge victorious only when the military capacity of the country is increased in every way and the U.S. imperialists' aggression and war moves are decisively foiled in the indomitable spirit that one must fight against the imperialists and class enemies to a finish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will defend their ideology, system and cause at the cost of their lives and always emerge victors in the confrontation with the U.S. thanks to Kim Jong Il who is leading the cause of independence against imperialism to victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
