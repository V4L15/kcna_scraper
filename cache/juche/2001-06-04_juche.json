            "content": "DPRK's principled stand on U.S. approach to dialogue clarified \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, the organ of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea,  today in a signed commentary explicitly clarifies the DPRK's principled stand on the Bush administration's wrong approach and modality towards the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to diplomatic sources from Washington, the United States asserts that it will pursue only business-like political negotiations even though the dialogue with the DPRK is resumed while maintaining its \"basic hard-line stand towards the DPRK\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Negatively reviewing the DPRK-U.S. dialogue held in the period of the previous administration on the basis of falsified facts, the Bush ruling team seeks to lead the DPRK-U.S. dialogue which it wants to resume from a \"hard-line negotiating stand\" and justify it. This shows that it is not truly willing to have a dialogue with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Hard-line negotiation\" and \"leadership\" are unacceptable to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's unchangeable stand to seek a negotiated settlement of the issues between the  DPRK and the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very wrong logic for the U.S. ruling quarters to talk about a \"hard-line negotiating stand\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration insists that the DPRK respond to a dialogue to be held at a time and place appointed by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This high-handed behaviour rubs the DPRK up the wrong way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not have even the slightest intention to resume the dialogue with the U.S., allowing its pride to be damaged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's demand and stand that the DPRK and the U.S. should have a dialogue on an equal footing on the principle of independence and impartiality if the latter wishes to have it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be neither selfish motive nor precondition as far as a dialogue is concerned. If the administration seeks a conditional dialogue with the DPRK, a dialogue aimed at disarming it, talking about \"verification,\" \"cutdown of conventional forces\", \"inspection\" and the like, the DPRK has no interest in such a dialouge. Its practice of putting a precondition on the DPRK-U.S. dialogue is, in fact, a reflection of its stand of denying it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the administration to impose its unilateral unjust conditions upon the DPRK before reaching any agreement with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care about whether it has any dialogue with the United States or not. Even if the dialogue is not resumed, the DPRK will have nothing to worry about or to lose. It will never beg the U.S. for a dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should have a right approach to the dialogue before discussing the issue related to the dialouge with it. Everything depends on the United States.   the ball is in its court. The U.S.  is well advised to bear this in mind and approach the DPRK from a right stand on the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will have its independent option, closely following Washington's attitude.    \r\n\r\n"

It is believed to happen once in 1,000 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From early march to this date precipitation in all parts of the country registered at 18. 3 mm on an average, only 11 percent of the annual average and 17 percent of last year's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A 1 mm rainfall was registered in 5 days and about 5 mm rainfall in 2 days in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Heat is frequently recorded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The temperature in Pyongyang at noon on April 9 was 24. 6 degrees centigrade, 25. 4 in Sariwon, 25. 6 in Haeju and 27. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 9 in Kaesong, 10-13 degrees higher than the annual average which means an all-time high in meteorological observation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strong wind 11-18 m/s hit the areas on the west coast including Pyongyang, Haeju, Sariwon and Kaesong from March 7 to 9 and strong wind 10-14 m/s struck many areas on the east and west coasts including Haeju and Thongchon on April 1, 2, 13, 15, 23, 24 and 26. as a result, soil in all parts of the country remained dry up to over 20 cm deep, making it hardly possible for seeds to sprout. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a preliminary estimate made by the ministry of agriculture as of June 1, hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland are hard hit by drought, taking the country as a whole. Over 80 or 90 percent of the sown seeds of potato, wheat, barley and maize have already been dried up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strong wind did severe damage to Kosong county, Kangwon Province, Sariwon, North Hwanghae Province, Haeju, South Hwanghae Province, Chongjin, North Hamgyong Province, and other areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Crops including potato, wheat, barley and maize sown in a large area of farmland there were rooted out and all the fruits at their best including apricot, peach and plum fell down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite the state's measures to mobilize all pumping equipment and manpower for minimizing drought damage, it still persists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drought is expected to last for more days to come.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
