Not content with this, it committed such shuddering crime as hurting the dignity of the most sacred supreme leadership of the DPRK, touching off the towering anger of its army and people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is hordes of wicked traitors with whom Koreans can never live under the same sky as it has gone crazy with  the anti-DPRK confrontation racket while hurling without hesitation slanders and calumnies at the great leaders whom the Korean people trust and follow like Heaven. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group claims the DPRK-targeted war exercises censured and condemned by the whole world are annual defensive ones. But, the recent most hideous provocation fully disclosed the aggressive nature of the enemy whetting swords with a sinister intention to attack the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Challenging the June 15 era of reunification, the Lee group drove the inter-Korean relations to the worst phase and blocked all sorts of dialogue including the six-party talks, escalating tension only. It is the enemy of the nation and a source of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group made desperate efforts to prevent an atmosphere of dialogue from being created on the Korean Peninsula. When there is a sign of the DPRK-U.S. talks making progress, the group is making last-ditch efforts to upset it in a bid to prolong its remaining days. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to ensure peace and stability on the peninsula and the region, to say nothing of improved inter-Korean relations, and dark clouds of war are bound to hang over it as long as the Lee group whose only means of living is confrontation with compatriots is allowed to stay in power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have already sentenced to death the Lee group cursed and denounced by progressive mankind for committing thrice-cursed crimes against the Korean nation. They will mete out a merciless punishment of their own style to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defending the leader at the cost of one's life is the supreme principle of the DPRK which remains unchanged and allows not the slightest compromise no matter how the world may change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If anyone is going to back the group more dead than alive as it is awaiting a severe punishment by history, he is bound to perish for adding fuel to the fire."

It was again the group of traitors who ordered puppet officers to paste huge slogans hurting the dignity of the DPRK at barracks, gates and walls and their soldiers to shout anti-communist slogans after getting up and before going to bed and during their training and mealtime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent behaviors of the Lee group brought to daylight that though it is letting loose such rhetoric as \"dialogue\" and \"flexibility,\" it is working with bloodshot eyes and malice to do harm to the headquarters of the DPRK behind scene.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will give such ignorant and uncouth confrontation fanatics as the Lee group no space to remain on this land, much less dealing with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is nothing but frenzy which deserves severe punishment as it is to do harm to the lives of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hearts of the service personnel and people of the DPRK are burning with towering anger and resentment at the above-said hideous provocation and firm resolution to annihilate the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly see how they will erupt.

The article cites facts to prove this fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Growing strong in Asia are the revolutionary forces capable of frustrating the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression and finally driving them out of the region, it says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The socialist forces are growing stronger as they did before and the people are getting more awakened in the protracted anti-imperialist struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists tested all new strategies and tactics for cracking down upon the anti-U.S. resistance forces through the Iraqi War. All of them were, however, frustrated by the actions of the anti-U.S. resistance forces and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particularly serious bottleneck before the U.S. imperialists in executing their policy of aggression against Asia is shortage of armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces are short of weapons and troops despite the fact that a huge amount of funds was spent for \"war on terrorism.\"    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another difficulty for them is a long route for logistic supply. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists feel an acute shortage of supplies though most of their transport means in their country were used to meet the need for the transportation of supplies for just one front in the Mideast region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is beyond doubt in case they escalate the war of aggression into Asia, such difficulties will increase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The contradictions and conflict among imperialists will fester, rendering the U.S. imperialists further isolated from their allies."

The DPRK will continue its sacred war with main emphasis on physical attack till all acts of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK are brought to a definite end and Lee Myung Bak and military warmongers and other culprits are punished without mercy in the name of the nation and the group of traitors make an apology to the nation for their high treason.
