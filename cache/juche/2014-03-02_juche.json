This is a valuable fruition of the outstanding leadership Kim Jong Il provided by steering the Korean revolution along the road of victory only by holding fast to the ideology backed by arms, regarding it as a mighty treasured sword.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il set forth in his early years the Juche-oriented theory that ideology decides everything. He worked heart and soul to intensify the ideological work, implementing the line of giving priority to ideology in the whole period of leading the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He developed the party, power and invincible revolutionary Paektusan army by holding fast to the ideology and brought about epoch-making innovations in the socialist construction by motivating people ideologically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his wise leadership, the Korean people could work miracles and perform feats by raising a strong wind of speed campaign in every worksite for the great socialist construction in the 1970s and glorify the 1980s as the greatest heyday in the era of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK worked such historic miracles as achieving a great victory in the battle for protecting socialism and establishing a solid foundation for building a thriving nation by resolutely foiling all the counter-revolutionary moves of the imperialist allied forces in the 1990s when the destiny of the country and nation was at stake, in particular. This would be unthinkable without the extraordinary leadership of Kim Jong Il, who consolidated the ideological position of the country as firm as an invulnerable fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undying exploits Kim Jong Il performed by making a brilliant history of building a thriving nation unprecedented in human history by dint of ideology and mental power of all the service personnel and people will always remain shining along with the successful advance of the revolutionary cause of Juche and the revolutionary cause of Songun."
