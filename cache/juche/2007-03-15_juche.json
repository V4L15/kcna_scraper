In the morning of the day they rushed at least 30,000 policemen to totally seal off different places in the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the police blocked roads in Ulsan and Taegu, and Jonju City of North Jolla Province and other areas and stopped people from heading for Seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The protesters, however, gathered in front of Kyobo Library in Kwanghwamun, breaking through the police cordon, and held the first meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n O Jong Ryol, co-representative of the headquarters, and other speakers at the meeting deplored that the conclusion of FTA at the negotiations would leave the south Korean economy to the tender mercy of the U.S. and force all the people to die. If the \"government\" concludes FTA with the U.S. at the negotiations, defying the demand of the people, it will meet all-people resistance, they warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the participants started a sit-in strike. Offering stubborn resistance against the riot police, they held another meeting in front of Posin Temple in Jongro at which they vowed to fight to their dying breath to check the negotiations for the conclusion of FTA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the meeting members of the headquarters declared that they would hold the second meeting in Seoul on March 25 and stage an indefinite hunger strike around the \"Chongwadae\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, he is behaving quite contrary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not to admit one's wrongs means that one would repeat them. Japan's non-admittance to the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army is little short of its open declaration to the world that it would again launch into a militarist aggression overseas and commit such extra-large crimes against humanity as sexual slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not surprising to hear such malarkey totally denying past crimes from Abe who has inherited the lineage of a militarist family. What is serious, however, is that Japan has reached so dangerous a phase in rushing toward militarist reaction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's full-dressed moves to revise the \"Pacifist Constitution\" under Abe's baton, visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and total negation of the past crimes committed by Japan cannot be construed otherwise than acts targeted at overseas aggression.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Really enormous are the consequences brought to the development of the inter-Korean relations and the cause of national reunification by the treacherous flunkeyist acts of giving importance to outside forces and anti-reunification acts of following the lead of outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An end must be put to the unsavory history in which the inter-Korean relations have been played into the hands of outside forces. To this end, the north and the south should firmly maintain the stance and stand of attaching importance to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This stance and stand is clearly manifested in having the pluck and independent spirit not shrinking before any pressure and blackmail of outside forces and in never backing down on the principle of giving priority to the nation and defending it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now, the inter-Korean relations are being put on the track of recovery again. But, if the Korean nation fails to stay sharp-eyed, the present trend in the inter-Korean relations might be led to another breakdown any moment by the chicanery of outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unpardonable treachery to the nation to faint-heartedly cling to the attitude of giving importance to outside forces and cooperation, captive to the bad habit of flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces, turning a deaf ear to the demand of the times and the aspiration of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the inter-Korean relations are put on a solid track of reconciliation, unity and independent reunification or not entirely depends on the will and efforts of the north and the south.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such exercises are out-and-out nuclear war maneuvers intended to make a surprise and preemptive attack on the DPRK in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula, says Minju Joson in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the U.S. and the south Korean authorities seek to prevent the tendency of the Korean Peninsula toward detente by force, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they truly want peace on the peninsula, they should hold in such rude conduct as pointing a gun at their dialogue partner or any act that may turn the trend of reconciliation and improved relations back to confrontation and hostile relations. And they should announce that they will stop any war exercises against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they are now planning to stage another war exercises against the DPRK, challenging the domestic and foreign opinion, though they have acted as if they have a will to come out for \"dialogue\" and \"improved relations.\" The military maneuvers planned by the U.S. and south Korean authorities whose appearances are deceptive make the DPRK skeptical about the truth of the agreements they have made so far with it and about their will to implement them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What arouses our indignation is the sinister and disgusting attitude of the south Korean authorities who have yielded to the outsiders while betraying their fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities scheme to scuttle the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in a deliberate way through war maneuvers against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war exercises against the DPRK can be justified with no pretext and the dialogue is incompatible with them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it is no more than a deceptive slogan intended to hide with the signboard of \"freedom\" their undisguised operations to spread the bourgeois ideology and justify their campaign for bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning against other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary bourgeois ruling class pretends to allow the progressive thoughts to a certain extent in a bid to paint the capitalist society as a \"model of freedom,\" a \"democratic society\" but mercilessly suppresses them when it concludes they pose even the slightest threat to its rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The suppression of the progressive ideas is still going on in the capitalist countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bourgeois ruling quarters are wooing the reactionary writers, journalists and other media persons to produce for public circulation works, articles and other propaganda materials aimed at distorting and beautifying realities in the capitalist society and prodding people into seeking sexual and other abnormal greed. Such moves of the imperialists are, in essence, suppression of people's thoughts as they bar the independent development of human thoughts and a criminal act of imposing the reactionary ideology on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists have infiltrated bourgeois ideas and culture into the socialist countries and the anti-imperialist independent countries through information-gathering and plot-breeding institutions or through such means and channels as \"cooperation\" and \"exchange.\" They have pressurized other countries to accept bourgeois ideas, using economic aid as conditionality. But when those countries fail to meet their demand, they resort to undisguised interference in their internal affairs and put political, economic and diplomatic pressure upon them and use even the force of arms, after accusing them of the lack of \"freedom\" of thinking and labeling their societies a \"dark world\" and \"closed societies.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt to accept the \"freedom\" of thinking much touted by the imperialists would entail serious consequences. This is eloquently proved by the tragic realities in the countries where socialism collapsed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
