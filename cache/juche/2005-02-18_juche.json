Paektu as a son of guerrillas was a great auspicious event of historic significance as the Korean people acclaimed a prominent successor to the accomplishment of the cause of Juche and a great event of the times which promised the eternal prosperity and a bright future of the Korean nation, the letter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the February holiday that we could emerge victors, remaining true to the revolutionary faith and principle despite all sorts of torture behind bars in south Korea for over 30-40 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter recalled that over the last five years Kim Jong Il let them sit on the flower cushions with paternal love as parents would do for their children with whom they reunited after hearing nothing from them and has bestowed the greatest love and solicitude ever known in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Kim Jong Il fully represents their life and future as he provided them with eternal political integrity and a long physical life, the letter said that they would devote themselves to the work to accelerate the building of a reunified great prosperous powerful nation, keeping pace with the general march for the Songun revolution, true to the Songun idea and leadership of Kim Jong Il to the end.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This proves that the U.S. has no intention to negotiate with the north. The U.S. is, therefore, to blame for having scuttled the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its wild design to seize the whole Korean Peninsula and withdraw its forces and weapons of mass destruction from south Korea all at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was a clear message to the Bush administration which hurt the dignity of the DPRK by terming it an \"outpost of tyranny\" after labeling it part of \"an axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people standing for justice will certainly defend their option and interests in the international arena in which the U.S. high-handed practices have become all the more undisguised. They will do so because they are holding Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Songun, in high esteem as their leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor was also taken by Oleg Shenin and Mikhail Tsitarenko. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
