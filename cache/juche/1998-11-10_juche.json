Joint manoeuvres of the U.S. forces and the Japanese \"self-defence forces\" are in full swing throughout the Japanese islands.\r\n   As a consequence,  U.S. military bases in Japan and the training places of the \"SDF\" are clouded with powder-smoke, filled with deafening gun reports. Blockade of non-military roads and low-altitude flight of warplanes do damage to the livelihood of the residents, causing negative impact.\r\n   Publications of the U.S. forces described the frantic manoeuvres as a \"large-scale war game on the ground, in the sea and the sky.\" a local assembly of Japan expressed deep concern at the \"large-scale manoeuvres being staged under the simulated conditions of the event of contingency on the Korean peninsula,\" saying that the \"manoeuvres seem to be staged throughout Japan.\"\r\n    The developments prove that the U.S. and Japan are carrying into practice  the \"guidelines for Japan-U.S. defence cooperation\" that they revised for the purpose of provoking another Korean War and realising their wild ambition for domination over Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n   What is particularly dangerous is that the U.S.-Japan joint military manoeuvres began on the back of the Foal Eagle war exercises of the U.S. and South Korea, tightening the \"tripartite military alliance\" of the U.S., Japan and South Korea.\r\n   All this clearly shows that with a view to stifling the DPRK by force of arms the U.S., Japan and the South Korean authorities are expanding and strengthening the undisguised and reckless war exercises for aggression on the DPRK through the medium of the tightened military tie-up, while describing the DPRK's launch of artificial satellite as \"missile threat\" and using it for justifying  massive arms buildup. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Chilbo in Korea.\r\n   The letters represent the loyalty and filial piety of the Korean people who want to hand down to posterity the exploits General Secretary Kim Jong Il performed during his personal guidance on the mountain.\r\n   Mt. Chilbo is reminiscent of the glorious revolutionary activities of Kim Jong Il, who is working hard to provide the people with better conditions for their cultural life and entertainment.\r\n   Kim Jong Il went there in June Juche 85 (1996) and told how to turn the mountain into better cultural pleasure ground for the people.\r\n   During his long journey from inner Chilbo to outer Chilbo and sea Chilbo in November Juche 85, he told how to develop the mountain and took a concrete step concerning the building of hotels for visitors and public service facilities and preservation and management of the scenic spot.\r\n   Mt. Chilbo (659 metres above sea level) is on the east coast in the northern part of Korea. It has been called \"Hambuk Kumgang\" from ancient times.\r\n   The mountain covers an area of about 250 square kilometres.\r\n   It boasts of superb scenic beauty because Mt. Obong, Mansa Peak and other strangely-shaped peaks, Kumgang and Kuryong ponds and other ponds, waterfalls, natural caves, the peak of ten thousand forms and seascape along the coastline of about 40 kilometres are in good harmony.\r\n   It is furnished with all facilities for the convenience of tourists. \r\n\r\n"
