It urged Bush to make a formal apology to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Bush listed the DPRK and other countries as members of the \"axis of evil\", the central committee of the Communist Party of India (Marxist) in a statement on Feb. 5 said it is one of the adventurous and desperate moves of the U.S. administration for the world supremacy, a challenge to all the sovereign states of the world and an extension of the U.S. war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon all the sovereign states to set out to denounce the U.S. threat of war against the independent and sovereign states and oppose the U.S. administration's war racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Peruvian Communist Party in a statement on Feb. 5 resolutely rejected Bush's utterances threatening some countries including the DPRK, acting like the \"international gendarme\" again.    \r\n\r\n"

But this is a foolhardy  ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The  DPRK-U.S. relations are overshadowed by their vicious moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their rash acts are hamstringing the settlement of issues related to the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. evermore undisguised moves will only put Washington in a more difficult position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the trend of the times and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
