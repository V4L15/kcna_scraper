This reveals once again that the U.S. information is based on fiction and fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The American history has been that of aggression, war and plunder and fabrication of information and plot-breeding are the trite method peculiar to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The White House committed the invasion of Iraq on the basis of the fraud information premeditated and fabricated by it beforehand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is peculiar in the U.S. fabrication of information and plot-breeding is that it uses  dissident forces, those opposed to the political system in those countries incurring its displeasure and political exiles  to fabricate sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the U.S. has taken Iran's construction of an atomic power station under an agreement on nuclear energy between Iran and Russia as a good opportunity to intensify its hostile policy toward Tehran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to imagine what the U.S. has sought when it spread a story about Iran's secret nuclear test and forced Tehran to open it to the public and dismantle uranium enrichment facilities and accept IAEA's inspection of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces try to apply this method to the DPRK. The hard-line conservatives of the U.S. have noisily talked about \"suspicious underground nuclear facilities\" in the DPRK in a bid to spy out military secrets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is gravely mistaken if it thinks that its clumsy fabrication of fraud information may work everywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressors resort to the gangster-like logic that strength only wins justice. \r\n  Those countries which value sovereignty and strive for national dignity and prosperity should heighten vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' more pronounced cruel fabrication of sheer lies and plot-breeding and channel due efforts into strengthening their self-reliant national defence capacity to cope with the moves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It trained many famous figures and intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung conducted his revolutionary activities while studying at the school from January, Juche 16 (1927) to Autumn, Juche 18 (1929). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president was admitted to the second year class of the school on January 17, Juche 16 (1927). Elected chief of the school library twice, he studied hard Marxist-Leninist classics such as \"The Capital\" and read many revolutionary novels including \"Mother\" and \"Blessing\" and progressive novels based on the reality in those days, sitting up all night. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made a deep inquiry into new strategic and tactical problems related to fulfilling the historic mission of the working class through his energetic study. This course meant the course in which he brought to maturity the guiding idea, theory and method on the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party and government of China decided to name the classroom where the President studied a \"room dedicated to the reading of Marshal Kim Il Sung\" in 1953 and then a \"room dedicated to the reading of Comrade Kim Il Sung.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last more than half a century since then, officials of the Chinese party and government, party and power organs of Jilin Province and Jilin City and teachers, staff members and students of the school and Koreans in China have done the work to repair and take better care of the room on several occasions including 1985, 1997 and 2003.\r\n This year the People's Government and different organs in Jilin City and Koreans in China paid deep attention to the work of keeping the room in its original state, attaching utmost importance to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to their efforts, the floor and walls of the room were arranged in their original state and the room was equipped with modern facilities for permanently preserving the revolutionary historic materials of the President and gifts sent by him and leader Kim Jong Il to the school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the room arranged in its original state thanks to the sincere efforts of the peoples of the DPRK and China is a precious historic site associated with the revolutionary feats of the President, a room good for the education in the revolutionary tradition and patriotism, a centre for moral education in Jilin Province and a holy place for glorifying the Sino-Korea friendship, the officials of the school are taking care of the room with all sincerity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The room which will always stand in the flower garden of the Sino-Korea friendship is now visited by Chinese from all walks of life and foreigners.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
