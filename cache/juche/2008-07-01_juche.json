The outcome of the additional negotiations, a product of the huddle held by the puppets with the U.S., failed to provide any guarantee for the lives and safety of the people and protect the \"right to quarantine\". It was the outcome of another treacherous dealing to bring profits to the American beef businesses only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reshuffle made by Lee inside \"Chongwadae\" was nothing but a reshuffle for form's sake from A to Z as he fired several goons who had been criticized by the public and replaced them with pro-U.S. elements and ultra-right conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is the sinister aim sought by traitorous Lee group in making much ado about the \"change in the pure nature of the candlelight demonstrations.\" Its ulterior motive is to threaten and blackmail those standing up against it and mercilessly crack down upon their candlelight demonstrations under the absurd pretext of liquidating \"the forces behind the candlelight demos\" in a bid to bar their actions from developing into an all-out anti-\"government\" struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n With neither deceptive artifice nor fascist crackdown can Lee break the will of the south Korean people in their just struggle.

Without help of modern science and technology can any country and nation not develop the economy suited to the tendency of development in the present century nor enjoy rich material and cultural life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Backwardness in science and technology serves as the root of the imperialists' exploitation and plunder and economic domination and subordination over the developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists have enforced the persistent sanctions and blockade against the DPRK, getting so hell-bent on the anti-DPRK campaign. But it has accelerated the building of a great prosperous powerful nation without any vacillation, victoriously advancing along the road of socialism. The credit for this progress goes to its solid independent national economy and scientific and technological forces. The experience of the DPRK clearly proves how important and significant the independent development of science and technology is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries should hasten their economic development in the new century by directing efforts to the independent development of science and technology on the basis of the successes and experience gained by them in building a new society. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Ceaseless Aerial Espionage Committed against DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists committed more than 100 cases of aerial espionage against the DPRK and the south Korean puppet armed forces at least 70 cases in June, and this brought the total number of cases of espionage to more than 1,000 in the first half of the year, according to military sources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 29, U-2 belonging to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea made a shuttle flight all day long in the air over the areas of Tokjok Islet, Phochon and Sokcho to perpetrate air observation and electronic reconnaissance against all areas of the DPRK. This spy plane perpetrated 25 cases of espionage during the month and more than 160 cases in the first half of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists periodically let overseas-based RC-135 make high-altitude flights in the air over the area of south Korea for the purpose of spying on the strategic targets of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They let three or four RC-12s and RC-7Bs fly in the air over the forefront every day to commit espionage against the DPRK in June, bringing the number of cases of espionage perpetrated by such planes to more than 560 in the first half of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when the madcap \"Key Resolve\" and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises for aggression and joint air military maneuvers were under way, the U.S. imperialists in a coordinated operation with the puppet armed forces mobilized 15 strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes on a daily average and 21 at maximum and Japan-based E-3 to spy on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  RC-800 and RF-4C belonging to the south Korean puppet armed forces flew in the sky over the areas along the Military Demarcation Line every day to perpetrate madcap aerial photographing and electronic reconnaissance against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Espionage against the rival side is bound to get pronounced on the eve of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aerial espionage frantically escalated by the U.S. imperialists and warmongers of the south Korean puppet armed forces keeping pace with their espionage by use of satellites patently proves that they are further stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero, los paises atrasados economicamente no podran defender su dignidad y la soberania nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa emulacion economica que se libra hoy a escala mundial es precisamente la competencia cientifico-tecnica. Sin contar con la ciencia y tecnologia modernas es imposible construir la economia avenida a la tendencia de desarrollo del presente siglo y disfrutar de una rica vida material y cultural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl atraso cientifico y tecnico de los paises en desarrollo es la fuente de la explotacion, el saqueo, el dominio y la subyugacion economicos de los imperialistas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBajo la sancion y el bloqueo de los imperialistas que arman tan obstinadamente alboroto anti-norcoreano, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea no se deja cohibir en lo minimo acelerando la construccion de gran potencia prospera y avanzando victoriosamente por el camino socialista gracias a contar con la poderosa economia nacional independiente y las fuerzas cientificas y tecnicas propias. Las experiencias de nuestro pais abogan firmemente por la importancia y el valor del desarrollo de la ciencia y tecnologia propias. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPara acelerar el desarrollo economico del nuevo siglo, los paises en vias de desarrollo deben dedicar gran fuerza al desarrollo de la ciencia y tecnica propias a base de los exitos y las experiencias acumulados ya en la construccion de la nueva sociedad. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
