            "content": "Servicepersons and Pyongyangites Hail Successful Nuclear Test \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 20 (KCNA) -- More than a hundred thousand servicepersons and citizens from all walks of life at a Pyongyang city army-people rally held at Kim Il Sung Square Friday hailed the historic successful nuclear test.\r\n The rally was attended by party, army and state cadres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternative member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, speaking on behalf of the WPK, hailed the successful nuclear test reflecting the unanimous feelings of all the party members and other working people of the country and warmly congratulated scientists, technicians and workers on having successfully ensured the nuclear test with ardent patriotism and loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent nuclear test was a quite just decision to defend the supreme interests of the state and the security of the nation from the U.S. imperialists' threat of aggression, avert a new war and defend peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The nuclear test was a great deed of national significance as it strikingly manifested to the whole world the revolutionary faith and indomitable will of the army and people of the DPRK to resolutely foil the U.S. imperialists' heinous moves to bring down the socialist system centered on the popular masses and firmly defend the ideology and system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to manufacture nukes by the U.S. nuclear threat, sanctions and pressure, and the nuclear test was an exercise of the independent and legitimate right of the DPRK as a sovereign state as it was a positive countermeasure to defend the sovereignty of the country and the life and the security of its people.\r\n The nuclear test was a great deed as it greatly contributed to defending peace and stability not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia. However, the U.S. instigated the UN Security Council to adopt an anti-DPRK \"resolution,\" unreasonably terming it a \"threat\" to international peace and security. The DPRK vehemently condemns and strongly rejects it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the party members, servicepersons and other people should devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and wage a dynamic struggle for the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche, fully confident that they will always win victory as long as they are led by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Gak, vice-minister of the People's Armed Forces, addressing the rally on behalf of the Korean People's Army, said that the successful nuclear test was a historic event as it instilled matchless strength and stronger courage into the servicepersons and the people who have wished to see tremendous self-defensive military capability and dealt a telling blow at the U.S. imperialists and their followers keen to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This great event is a precious fruition of the great Songun policy, he said, and went on:\r\n The nuclear deterrent in the hands of the People's Army, a revolutionary army fighting for freedom and happiness of the people and justice, serves as a powerful defensive means for protecting the stability on the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity.\r\n The speaker strongly warned in the name of all men and officers of the KPA that if the U.S. imperialists persist in their reckless provocations, this will be nothing but a suicidal act of precipitating their miserable end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists and other forces favoring the U.S. imperialists' moves should stop running amuck, well aware that they will never escape a stern punishment by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK should they go reckless under the signboard of the UN Security Council \"resolution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speaker manifested the firm determination of the People's Army to firmly guarantee the accomplishment of the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms, true to the Songun revolutionary leadership of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il.\r\n Candidate Academician, Prof. and Dr. Jang Chol, speaking on behalf of the scientists, said that the country succeeded in the nuclear development by bolstering the defence capability with its belt tightened at the crossroads: To remain an independent people or to become slaves of imperialism. The DPRK has thus acquired the status of a full-fledged nuclear weapons state after going through the most just and fair processes, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scientists and technicians who succeeded in the nuclear test under secure conditions, basing themselves on their own wisdom and technology, are not only intellectuals but unassuming heroes in the era of Songun who devoted their all to the Party, the country and the people. It is a great pride of the country and the nation to have such scientific and technological personnel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He declared that the scientists and technicians would always share destiny with the headquarters of the revolution, holding aloft the banner of Songun in order to firmly defend and further glorify socialism of Juche, their life and soul.\r\n Then the floor was taken by representatives of the workers and farmers, youths and students.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Guarantees Nation's Dignity and True Life \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 20 (KCNA) -- Independence of the Korean nation with a time-honored history, culture and wisdom has been infringed upon for a long period due to the occupation of south Korea by U.S. imperialist aggressor troops for over 60 years, notes Rodong Sinmun in an article Friday.\r\n Saying it is national disgrace that can be tolerated no longer, the author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea is a prerequisite to the independence of the south Korean society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independence of the south Korean society is a desire of the century related to the dignity and destiny of the whole nation, not to speak of the south Korean people. The dignity and true life of the nation can be brought into bloom only in a land of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have suffered from all sorts of misfortune and disgrace with the national dignity and sovereignty violated by imperialist aggressor forces for more than a century owing to the 60-odd-year long military occupation and rule of the U.S. imperialists following the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. This is the worst tragedy in the history of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea is the most urgent requisite to peace of Korea and the cause of its reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is advertising its troops present in south Korea as an \"apostle of peace\" and \"war deterrent.\" But this is a sheer lie. The U.S. troops are the root cause of a war on the Korean Peninsula and a cancer-like entity in the matter of reunification.\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in south Korea perpetrated repeatedly such mean acts as lowering the check-bar to inter-Korean economic cooperation based on the June 15 joint declaration under unreasonable pretexts. Moreover, they have desperately spoiled the atmosphere of inter-Korean reconciliation and reunification by staging provocative war drills against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality prove that peace in the country and its reunification can never be achieved unless the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops are driven out of south Korea.\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and abroad should further intensify the nation-wide struggle to put an end to the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops' occupation of south Korea at an early date and thus write finis to the history of misfortune and disgrace resulting from the presence of the aggressor troops in this land.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a result, arms served as a powerful weapon for revolution along with a clear fighting strategy and transparent faith from the very start of the Korean revolution. Herein lie the originality of the idea of attaching importance to arms set out and applied by the President and its invincible might.\r\n The programme of the DIU was a basis from which to kick off the Songun cause as it provided fundamental idea and principle of the revolution to be carried out with arms.\r\n The socialist idea that guided the DIU became a basic idea of the Songun cause of Juche and the principle of independence, anti-imperialism and uninterrupted revolution advanced by the DIU has served as a basic principle firmly guaranteeing the final victory in the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DIU was a \"pedigree\" organization as it trained staunch organizational hardcore of the revolution to be carried out with arms and a vanguard organization for the Songun revolution because it brought up the first generation of the Korean revolution. It was the hot-blooded members of the DIU that established the tradition of the transparent revolutionary outlook on the leader and the tradition of perfect unity in thinking and purpose, set an example of the indomitable revolutionary spirit and provided a strong organizational backbone of the Songun revolutionary ranks for the first time in the history of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideological and moral wherewithal provided by the DIU constitutes the most valuable legacy as it gives steady continuity to the Songun revolution and a precious asset guaranteeing the glorious tradition not only for the present generation but for posterity and representing the eternal future of the Songun cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
