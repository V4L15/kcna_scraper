This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Friday.\r\n This is a fascist action against democracy and human rights as it infringes upon the south Koreans' freedom of speech and deprives them of even their right to enjoy the civilization offered by the IT age and a treacherous action aimed to incite the inter-Korean standoff, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said actions are as rude as blindfolding people's eyes and stopping their ears and mouths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities have a will to achieve reconciliation and improve the relations between the north and the south of Korea there is no reason for them to overlook the security authorities' fascist suppression, a provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the treacherous and fascist actions against reunification are allowed to go on in south Korea as now quite contrary to the trend of the times and the desire of the Korean nation, this will further bedevil the inter-Korean relations which remain at a stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should not give lip-service to the \"improved inter-Korean relations\" but show their will to do so by lifting the treacherous action taken to cut off any access to the DPRK Internet homepages and unconditionally releasing all those put in custody on charges of the violation of the fascist evil law.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokeswoman for the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union warned this Friday in a statement in connection with the fact that the Japanese reactionaries' suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan has reached its height.\r\n Every action taken by the reactionaries of the island country against Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan is so dastardly and wicked that it stuns the world people, the statement noted, vehemently denouncing the authorities of the island country for their unjustifiable human rights abuses. The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past Japan violated the sovereignty of Korea and usurped its territory and deprived the Koreans of even their names and spoken and written languages in a futile bid to exterminate the Korean nation. Now the outrageous Japanese reactionaries are trying to realize this wild ambition by suppressing Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. It is nothing but a daydream for these Japs to exterminate the Korean nation, their centuries-old design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For all the desperate efforts on the part of the Japanese reactionaries Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan will as always advance along with the dignified and powerful DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
