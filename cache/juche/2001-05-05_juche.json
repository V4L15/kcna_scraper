            "content": "U.S. talk about cutdown of conventional forces slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 5 (KCNA) -- The U.S. ruling quarters have invented a new pretext for the permanent presence of its forces in South Korea in pursuance of their hostile policy towards the DPRK to stifle it.\r\n This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hawkish forces of the bush administration are trying to raise the issue of \"reduction of conventional military forces\" in the DPRK as an outstanding issue related to the DPRK-U.S. relations, groundlessly asserting that \"huge armed forces\" of the DPRK deployed along the front are the source of tensions on the Korean peninsula and a hurdle in the way of realizing disarmament there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It dismisses the U.S. loudmouthed \"reduction of conventional military forces\" as a brigandish logic as it is aimed to disarm the DPRK and put it in a defenseless state in a bid to seize it with ease any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertion is a crafty and sinister plot to permanently keep the U.S. troops in South Korea under the pretext of the \"threat\" of DPRK's conventional military forces. The far-fetched insistence made by the bush ruling quarters on the \"cutdown of conventional forces\" in the DPRK is little short of admitting themselves the fact that there is no more ground for them to keep their forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, regarding the policy of strength as a main strategy for world domination, has chosen the Korean peninsula as an operational theatre of its major offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops in South Korea are the main forces to keep its military and strategic edge in East Asia. For this reason the united states is working hard to keep South Korea under its military occupation at any cost and inventing absurd pretexts to justify it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose forces' assertion is as preposterous as forcing a house owner to meekly obey an intruder into the house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the wrong doing by the biggest rogue state in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither brigandish logic nor high-handed method can work on the DPRK. The United States had better quit South Korea of its own accord before being driven out of it.    \r\n\r\n"

It made a great contribution to rallying broad masses around the organization, defeating the Japanese imperialist robbers and liberating the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After liberation such political meetings as the joint conference of political parties and public organizations of the north and the south were held and programmes and line for national unity including the ten-point programme for the great unity of the entire nation and the five-point policy of great national unity were set forth in Korea. As a result, a united national front was formed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For national reunification it is necessary to achieve great national unity among other things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation should preserve the tradition and draw on the experience whereby it achieved liberation with the might of the united national front to foil the outsiders' moves for aggression and achieve national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main aim of the Korean nation's struggle at present is to foil and check the U.S. imperialists' moves to obstruct Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should oppose and reject the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK and anti-reunification moves with the viewpoint that the nation's destiny and future hinges on how to conduct an anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the  south and abroad will wage a joint struggle rallied close under the banner of national independence to foil the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and interference and surely accomplish the cause of country's reunification as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n"
