            "content": "U.S. Escalated Arms Buildup Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will further increase its physical deterrent force to cope with the U.S. increasing threat, stated a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in an answer given to the question put by KCNA on Dec. 27 as regards the U.S. more undisguised moves to bolster the military equipment of the U.S. forces in south Korea.\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. keeps reinforcing and updating the military hardware of its forces present in south Korea, while massively shipping high-tech weapons into the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the outset of the year the U.S. additionally inducted over 10 fighter bombers and U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes into its forces in south Korea and Japan and deployed carrier \"Carl Vinson\" in the waters off the Korean peninsula. It let six F-117 stealth bombers and a wing of F-15E fighters and one battalion of a mechanized unit stay in south Korea after participating in \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise and RSOI &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also deployed in south Korea a Shadow 200 unmanned tactical plane, which, equipped with military hardware, is capable of providing information gathered through aerial espionage and new PAC-3 interceptor missile system capable of striking ballistic and cruise missiles and planes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the \"arms buildup plan\" announced by the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea in May last, the U.S. will spend 11 billion U.S. dollars for beefing up the military hardware of its forces there for 3 years till 2006. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such arms buildup is casting a darker shadow on the prospect of solving the nuclear issue as it is quite contrary to the present process of dialogue to seek a peaceful solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not confined to this only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to turn its forces in south Korea into a \"Northeast Asian regional force\" targeted not only against the DPRK but against the countries surrounding the Korean peninsula, is rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula and in the region more unstable and tenser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. calculates it can bring the DPRK to its knees through aggression and military threat as it did other countries, it will bring about grave consequences.       \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

They also successfully carried out the work for reinforcing the farm's equipment to modernize its operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il was greatly satisfied to see a modern stock farm, saying that its appearance has changed beyond recognition in four months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He learned in detail about live-stock products and their processing, going round various places such as goat, pig, rabbit and other domestic animal barns built in peculiar styles at the branch farms nos. 1 and 2 and the modern milk processing factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly pleased to see another edifice of eternal value completed to be handed down to posterity, saying that the Kyenam Stock Farm is a very promising farm as it is equipped with all facilities for putting the breeding of goats, pigs and other domestic animals on a scientific and technological basis and it has large-size and modern milk processing equipment for steadily boosting the live-stock products. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After going round the farm, he set forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in managing and operating the farm and increasing the agricultural production in the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need to direct primary attention to intensifying the research and development of highly productive and healthy animals of good stock and applying them to production, true to the Party's policy of bringing about a radical turn in raising breeding animals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After hearing a report about this year's farming in the province, he praised the agricultural workers there for their strenuous efforts made to carry out the Party's agricultural policy while playing a pacesetter's role in two-crops-a-year-farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the primary task before the province which has a big share in the country's agricultural production is to do farming well, underlining the need to steadily carry on the work to increase the agricultural production and concentrate efforts on it.\r\n He called for planting more fruit trees around cozy dwelling houses and directing sustained big efforts to the road management and other work for land administration  to turn all the villages into a land of bliss in the era of the Workers' Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe was accompanied by First Vice Department Director of the C.C., the WPK Ri Yong Chol and Generals of the Korean People's Army Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greeted on the spot by Kim Un Gi, chief secretary of the South Hwanghae Provincial Committee of the WPK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
