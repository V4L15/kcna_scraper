Herein lie the danger and aggressive nature of the measure taken by the Japanese reactionaries to simplify the system whereby to issue an order for intercepting missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military measures taken by Japan under the pretext of someone's \"missile threat\" are, in essence, aimed at realizing its criminal scenario to establish military supremacy in Asia-Pacific and put into practice its wild ambition for reinvasion.  The DPRK is made its primary target. Such military moves as the forward-deployment of \"SM-3\" and the above-said simplifying measure stepped up by the Japanese reactionaries are designed to make a preemptive missile strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better drop its foolish ambition to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" through overseas military invasion.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
