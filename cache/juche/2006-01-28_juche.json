Korea Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities were so subservient to the U.S. as to agree to the issue of \"strategic flexibility\" of its aggression forces in south Korea raised by it again at the recent south Korea-U.S. strategic dialogue for partnership within the framework of their alliance held in Washington. This has sparked off deep apprehension and bitter wrath among the domestic and foreign public.\r\n A spokesman of the Committee for Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement on Jan. 26 urged the south Korean authorities to give up at once sycophancy and servility towards the U.S., bearing deep in mind that to support the U.S. in its policy of domination, interference and aggression is a treacherous act of bringing unspeakable misfortune to the nation and little short of digging their own grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long touted the issue of \"strategic flexibility\" of its forces in south Korea which is designed to realize its ambition for military domination over the DPRK and the rest of Northeast Asia and, furthermore, the whole of Asia, the spokesman said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have been subject to all sorts of humiliation and maltreatment by the U.S. as its colonial servants for more than half a century. It seems that they have not yet awakened as they continue flattering submissively the outsiders who are posing a grave threat to the destiny of the nation even in this June 15 era. This is mean and despicable treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans value the dignity and sovereignty of the nation more than their lives and punish aggressors without mercy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better clearly understand this spirit of the Korean nation and opt to withdraw its aggression troops from south Korea to the last man, in stead of talking about the \"strategic flexibility.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves escalated by the U.S. for a war of aggression against the DPRK, keeping its forces in south Korea, would only compel the latter to further bolster up its deterrent for self-defence under the uplifted banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The Information Department of the Central Committee of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front on Jan. 21 made public an open questionnaire addressed to the Grand National Party of south Korea, according to the Internet site Kuguk Jonson. It lashed out at the GNP for having staged a fascist charade aimed at deceiving the popular masses under the motto of \"defence of liberal democratic system,\" going under the masks of \"protector of human rights\" and \"champion of democracy\" as a successor to the ill-famed \"Yusin\" dictatorship.\r\n The \"liberal democratic system\" which the GNP claimed would defend at the risk of its life means the revival of the \"Yusin\" dictatorial system, the questionnaire noted, and continued: The GNP, the most savage violator of democracy in the world, the descendant of the fascist dictator and the successor to the \"Yusin\" dictatorial regime and the \"Republican Party\", should tell the people what is its real intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP never misses the chance to trumpet about \"political coloring\" such as \"communization\" and \"crisis of security\". This is nothing but a political farce intended to fool the people for the purpose of usurping power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is raising the same hue and cry over the \"crisis of security\" as the \"Yusin\" dictator did. This is nothing but a sinister design to seize power by fanning up confrontation and an atmosphere of war among Koreans in utter disregard of the interests of the country and the nation.\r\n The rowdyism kicked off by the GNP outside the building of the \"National Assembly,\" chanting \"Repeal revised law on private schools\" is nothing but an arrogant and high-handed act of ignoring and threatening the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the law that passed through the \"NA\" with an approval of the overwhelming majority of the people and by the agreement of the ruling and opposition parties should be regarded as a \"law railroaded through it in a brigandish manner,\" how should one call the \"bill on the constitutional revision allowing the election for the third-term \" and the \"Yusin constitution\" which were cooked up by the \"Yusin\" dictator by setting the CIA in motion without any approval from any opposition parties or people? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak Kun Hye should think twice over the mounting criticism voiced even by members of the GNP that \"its representative's ideological prejudice is a hereditary disease\" and \" confrontational ideological framework is the only thing one can say of her leadership ability\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is made up of descendants of cruel torturers, murderers and law-enforcement agents in the era of military dictatorship who are now working with bloodshot eyes to return to power. They are now busy whitewashing the past crimes, not uttering even a word of apology to so many guiltless people who were executed and those who suffered mental and psychological pain after being branded as \"spies\" and \"families of Reds\" for half a century. How can this group talk about human rights? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that it is impossible to expect any genuine democratization of society nor is it possible for the people to get rid of political instability and confusion in living nor is it possible to achieve inter-Korean reconciliation and unity and the country's reunification as long as there remain the descendants of the dictatorship such as the GNP.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the Bush administration pursued it with increased zeal last year, blocking the way of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations and rendering the situation extremely tense.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. From the very day of its appearance the second-term Bush administration revealed its intention to escalate the policy under the motto of \"hard-line,\" the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces said that it is difficult to push forward dialogue without discussing the issue of the DPRK's abandonment of its nuclear program before anything else. Clear is the aims sought by the U.S. through this. It seeks to project the above-mentioned issue as a pending issue related to the DPRK-U.S. relations, complicate the dialogue with the DPRK and indefinitely drag on it, using it as a pretext. Another design sought by it is to keep its forces in south Korea for an indefinite period, aggravate the military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula and weaken the deterrent of the DPRK and thus swallow it up with ease any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers declared the DPRK an \"outpost of tyranny\" and a \"criminal state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ceaselessly took issue with the DPRK over the issues of \"democracy\", \"human rights\" and \"religion\" and imposed even sanctions on the DPRK.\r\n The U.S. imperialists attempted to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK with their forces in the mainland, the Pacific and south Korea, the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" and the south Korean forces involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, no hard-line policy of the U.S. imperialists could work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has invariably maintained the revolutionary line of Songun, closely watching the undisguised moves of the enemies for a new war.\r\n The important lesson the Korean people drew again last year is that they should maintain the highest degree of vigilance against the cunning double-dealing tactics of the Bush administration over the issues of the six-party talks and the DPRK-U.S. relations and that they should decisively counter the U.S. imperialists' hard-line policy with the toughest policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any concession in the acute standoff with the U.S. imperialists invites a ruin. A concession will result in a hundred concessions and finally invite death and national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable stand of the DPRK to respond to favor with favor and a hard line with the toughest stand.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He appreciated the efforts made by commanding officers and their families, saying that the food vividly represents their warm love for the soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on the commanding officers to do their best to improve the soldiers' living, always bearing deep in mind the President's teaching that supply service precisely means a political work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spared time to watch an art performance given by servicepersons of the sub-unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They presented the chorus \"Let's Sing of Our Pride in Being under the Guidance of the General\", poem and song \"We Will Always Remember That Glorious Day\", poem and chorus \"For the Motherland\" and other songs representing the strong longing of the servicepersons of the KPA for Kim Jong Il.\r\n He had a photo session with servicepersons of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Ri Yong Chol, member of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and first vice department director of the WPK Central Committee, and Hwang Pyong So, vice department director of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
