The soldiers and people all over the country have grown to be true heroes of art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBusy as he was in Songun leadership, he appreciated performances given by art groups of servicemen's families and pushed wives of servicemen to the foreground as second ranks of Songun buglers who have created the model of mass art in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder his loving care servicemen's wives have lifted the mass art of the Songun era to a new height by their revolutionary and militant performances. And, in this course, they have grown to be admirable \"composers and scriptwriters\", \"instrumentalists\" and \"actresses\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean people eloquently displayed to the world the validity and vitality of the policy of the Workers' Party of Korea for popularizing art, drawing the masses into it, notably through the grand mass gymnastic and artistic performance \"Arirang\". \r\n\r\n\r\n"

All Koreans should struggle dynamically to achieve independent reunification and peace and prosperity through national cooperation while rejecting foreign forces for aggression, holding aloft the banner of \"By our nation itself\" as indicated by those declarations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should not tolerate any slightest anti-reunification move to negate the said declarations and stem the trend of the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The truth and vitality of the three principles of national reunification are being proved with added clarity day by day.

The U.S. can never cover up its true colors as the mastermind of the global arms race and the harasser of global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. justify its moves to build the missile defense system (MD) and its rhetoric about them is not worthy of even a passing note. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is clear is that the U.S. is keen to build missile shields against other countries, prompted by its wild ambition for supremacy, and this is sparking off a global arms race. The U.S. deserves to come under world public fire at all times for being a mastermind of a global arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature the U.S. is under the unavoidable biggest obligation to prevent the global arms race. It fostered and escalated the arms race in the era of the Cold War in a bid to put other countries under its control with a nuclear edge and gravely threatened and wrecked peace. With the Cold War coming to an end and the U.S. finding no military rival, it should not have pursued the arms buildup. There is the danger of new arms race, nuclear confrontation in the world and the situation is getting tenser due to the U.S. imperialists' policy for beefing up nuclear armed forces and expanding armament.\r\n The U.S. should abandon its wild ambition to seize other countries and dominate the world through its highhanded military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces will not escape international isolation and self- destruction, should they persistently pursue arms buildup and a war of aggression, going against the trend of the present times toward disarmament and peace and the wishes of humankind. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
