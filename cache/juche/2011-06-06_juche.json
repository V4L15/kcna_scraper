He cited facts to prove their criminal acts. \n\t\t\t\t\t  Bunjiro Koto, geographer paid by the Japanese imperialists, in the \"theory on the system of Korea\" published in 1903 deliberately denied the Paektu range asserted by the successive Korean geographers, the article said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, he groundlessly described the shape of the Korean map as a rabbit in favor of the Japanese imperialists' Korean aggression and colonial domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His sophism was floated after being reflected in a lot of geography books and literary and art books published in Japan after 1903. And this got pronounced before and after the Russo-Japanese War and Japan's occupation of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists sought a sinister aim in massively floating the above-said sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through this they sought to convince the Japanese that the Korean nation had such gentle animal property as that of a rabbit which is apt to be caught by another animal in a bid to infuse \"the sense of being superior\" into the Japanese and stoke among them  the consciousness of invasion and domination over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People of different countries at that time interpreted the main mountain ranges of the Korean Peninsula and the situation there quite contrary to Japanese' assertion, thus inciting anti-Japanese feelings. Under this situation the Japanese imperialists tried to calm them down and impose national nihilism and servile submission upon the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people considered the Korean map as a symbol of the historic and national tradition in protest against the above-said move of the Japanese imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A painter described the Korean map as a symbol of a brave Korean tiger as the Koreans idolized the Korean map and as an animal reflecting the staunch spirit of the nation from the period of Tangun Korea as one can see in \"the drawing on the spirit of a fierce tiger of Korea.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon occupying Korea, the Japanese imperialists forced primary and middle schools to teach the Korean map which looked like a rabbit at history and geography lessons in a bid to deprive Koreans of their national self-respect and inject the idea of slavery into their minds.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the Japanese imperialists desperately worked to eliminate even the symbol of the Korean map in a bid to achieve their purpose of aggression and domination over Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The right-wing conservative forces of Japan revealed their sinister intention to stage a comeback to Korea in the historic textbooks published in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is part of the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion and a version of the lie that the Korean map looks like a rabbit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to make a sincere repentance and thorough reparation for their past crimes, cooling their heads overheated with zeal for reinvasion."
