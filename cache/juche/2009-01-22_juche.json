This is an unpardonable pro-Japanese behavior of the traitor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as Aso is concerned, he is a descendant of the family that drafted and kidnapped many young Koreans to Japan and bled them white during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and the guy that whitewashed the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists over Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee, when meeting with Aso, was busying currying favor with the latter, asserting that \"let bygones be bygones\" and he would \"pursue a \"stable preservation and development\" of the relations with Japan  instead of holding Japan accountable for its past crimes and denouncing its moves for reinvasion. When Aso raised \"the north's nuclear issue\" and \"the abduction issue\", Lee echoed his words by promising \"support\" and \"cooperation.\" Not content with this, Lee went the lengths of uttering that he would join the new Administration of the U.S. in making \"joint actions and responses\" over the matters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By pleasing Aso Lee sought to garner support for his moves to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen rejected at home and abroad and thus get rid of his serious ruling crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  How miserable Lee is as he invited Aso, the prime minister likely to be replaced any time, to visit south Korea and accorded him a red carpet treatment in a bid to weather the crisis with his help. If one depends on foreign forces with one's back turned on the nation, one is bound to do the same folly as Lee did. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What do the \"talks\" held between Lee and Aso show?  This goes to prove that Koreans can never protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, improve the inter-Korean relations and escape from disasters as long as the Lee group is allowed to run riot to do harm against the compatriots in collusion with foreign forces."
