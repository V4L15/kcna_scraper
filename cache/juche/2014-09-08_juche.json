            "content": "Portavoz del CRPP urge poner fin a la ocupacion de EE.UU. sobre el Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 8 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Con motivo de que pasaron 69 anos desde cuando el imperialismo norteamericano ocupo ilegalmente el Sur de Crea, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria hizo publica el dia 7 una declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento senala que el 8 de septiembre de 1945, Estados Unidos ocupo el suelo surcoreano bajo el pretexto de \"desarmar al ejercito japones\", lo cual fue el inicio de coloniaje mas astuto y brutal en sustitucion al imperialismo japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la ocupacion del Sur de Corea por EE.UU., la nacion coreana se vio obligada a sufrir las desgracias causadas por la division en el Norte y el Sur sin precedentes en la historia y hasta los desastres de guerra desatada por los yanquis, recuerda la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el dominio y ocupacion de EE.UU., el Sur de Corea se convirtio en su base militar para la agresion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y Asia, la hegemonia mundial y para la guerra nuclear y nuestra nacion vive con el permanente peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no desea la reconciliacion, unidad y reunificacion de nuestra nacion, sino instiga a los titeres surcoreanos a hostilizar a la RPDC y pelear entre los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se tolera la ocupacion militar de EE.UU. sobre el Sur de Corea, no se puede pensar en el desarrollo de relaciones intercoreanas, la paz y reunificacion del pais ni en la prosperidad de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs urgente poner fin a la ocupacion del imperialismo norteamericano, causa de todos los sufrimientos y calamidades de nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa paso mucho tiempo desde que EE.UU. fingia ser \"protector\" y \"ayudante\" del Sur de Corea y nadie desea que las tropas agresoras yanquis se mantengan en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes de ser expulsado del territorio surcoreano por la rebeldia mas fuerte de la nacion coreana y sufrir la destruccion final por el despiadado ataque de las fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de la RPDC, EE.UU. debe regresar a casa junto con sus tropas agresoras abandonando la anacronica politica de ocupacion del Sur de Corea y la politica hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no deben suplicar la presencia permanente de las tropas agresoras de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el \"poder\" actual del Sur de Corea desea de veras el mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas, tiene que renunciar la politica proyanqui y la de servilismo a las potencias, cesar todos los ejercicios de guerra anti-RPDC y tomar la decision de evacuar del suelo surcoreano a las tropas norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui la clave fundamental para la paz y reunificacion de la Peninsula Coreana y el mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas."
