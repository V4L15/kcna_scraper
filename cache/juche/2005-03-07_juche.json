In other words, they try to dramatize the issue in a bid to totally blockade the DPRK under that pretext.\r\n They are busy calling for establishing a cooperation system with the U.S., as regards the measure for applying economic sanctions against the DPRK, and soliciting south Korea for its cooperation with them. This reveals their sinister intention to blockade the DPRK and lay a siege to it and render these actions more effective in a bid to bring down the socialist system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lie the reactionary nature of the measure taken by the Japanese reactionaries and the gravity of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will employ every possible means and way to strongly react to their smear campaign to destroy its dignified socialist system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

That is why it is so keen to maintain the Cold War structure in Northeast Asia come what may, afraid of its collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seeks to use Japan, blinded with the ambition to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\", as a shock force for materializing its strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to implement the above-mentioned aggressive strategy the U.S. has deliberately strained the situation on the Korean Peninsula, raising a hue and cry over \"the threat from north Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. set it forth as its policy goal to bring down the political system in the DPRK, no more than a daydream, and has since hamstrung the process to improve the inter-Korean relations by hook or by crook, persistently working to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has gone the lengths of pressurizing the south Korean authorities to stop even the cooperation between the north and the south in the issue of humanitarian aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the above-said U.S. strategy not only runs counter to the common interests of the countries in the region but is a basic factor of scuttling the six-party talks and making it impossible to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face to the reality with a cool head and dismantle the Cold War structure in Northeast Asia as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
