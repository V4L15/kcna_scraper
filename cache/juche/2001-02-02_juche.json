            "content": "Japan's bid for UNSC permanent membership rejected \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- Japan is wooing the United States from the onset of the New Year in a bid for a permanent membership of the UN Security Council.\r\n Some time ago, the Japanese foreign minister visited the U.S. and had talks with his U.S. counterpart, at which he conveyed Japan's stand toward the reform of the UNSC and asked for the u.s. help in its bid for UNSC permanent membership. the chief executive of Japan, too, will reportedly tour the U.S. to request the U.S. administration's cooperation for that purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is accustomed to meeting its interests with the help of a big country. This bad habit prompted the Japanese authorities to stage such mean solicitation diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's bid for UNSC permanent membership is intended not for global peace, stability and development but to hold a position of a political power and behave itself as a \"superpower\" to dominate other countries by abusing the authority of a UNSC permanent member. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gone never to return are the times when the world's politics and international problems were decided by any specified country. Unbiased opinion asserts that if major international political issues are to be settled on a fair basis, permanent membership of the unsc should be taken by countries with independent view, judgement and say and developing nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this context, no country will like Japan busy entreating for other's help without its own view and independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has to do something before seeking a permanent seat of the UNSC. There is order of priority in anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities must redress the crime-woven past above anything else and strive to gain trust from the world community. Without doing so, Japan should not even think of sitting on the UNSC.    \r\n\r\n"
