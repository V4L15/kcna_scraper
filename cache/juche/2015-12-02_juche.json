It is kicking up a whirlwind of wholesale seizure and search operations and arrest against not only the chairman of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) and its other leading members but also its headquarters and trade union organizations under it under the absurd pretext that they spearheaded the all-people rallies held in Seoul recently. Meanwhile, courts are demanding heavy penalties for pro- democracy and reunification figures already arrested and detained.\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the south Korean chief executive cried out for \"severely punishing the backstage forces according to the law and principle\", likening the people of various circles who rose up in the action to terrorists of the \"Islamic State\". Chiming in with her outbursts, the gentries of the \"Saenuri Party\" are working hard to fake up \"a law on combating terrorism\", a new fascist law, and \"a law on prohibiting the wearing of masks\" in a bid to stamp out the progressive democratic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative group, in particular, is issuing everyday orders to indiscriminately crack down on the people of various circles who declared their plan to hold the second all-people rallies against the authorities' fascist suppression by mobilizing the \"field arrest group\" just like the \"Paekgoldan\" dating back to the period of the military dictatorship, creating a horror-ridden atmosphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea issued a statement on Wednesday in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The waves of the horrible repressive campaign sweeping south Korea are an unpardonable fascist action against democracy and human rights and a blatant challenge to the public aspiring after justice, patriotism and genuine life, the statement noted, and continued:.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The actions of the people from all walks of life being staged in south Korea everyday are an eruption of their grudge and resentment against the conservative group which trampled down the justice and truth and drove the people's living and rights into darkness and distress by pursuing sycophancy and treachery, escalating the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north, reviving \"yusin\" dictatorship and enforcing an unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the south Korean workers and other people to turn out in the dynamic struggle for defending their rights to existence and democracy, unable to tolerate the conservative ruling forces' treacherous rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is stunning people all the more is the fact that the fascist dictatorial forces including the Intelligence Service fabricated such confrontational and conspiratorial case as what they called \"case of reverend\" and are linking it with the DPRK in a bid to intensify the crackdown on the just struggle of the south Korean people of various circles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stereotyped method of the south Korean conservative group to crack down on the pro-democracy and reunification forces by fabricating security cases and stir up the confrontation with the DPRK whenever it is driven into a serious ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative authorities' smear campaign against the DPRK and brutal fascist tyranny only reveal their true colors as traitors forsaken by the people and their miserable position in which they are floundering in the worst ruling crisis after being marginalized by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative authorities should stop at once their fascist crackdown upon the people, drawing a lesson from the miserable end of the preceding dictators who faced a stern judgment by history for desperately enforcing the fascist rule and ratcheting up the confrontation with the DPRK."
