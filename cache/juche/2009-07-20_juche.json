            "content": "Hay que tomar precaucion de la farsa anti-piratas de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 20 de julio (ATCC) -- Si bien la sociedad internacional debe tomar precaucion de la pirateria, no ha de estar menos alerta a los reaccionarios japoneses que actuan demencialmente para agredir a ultramar pretextando las \"medidas anti-piratas\".\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi destaca el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual publicado este lunes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, el segundo contingente de las \"Fuerzas Maritimas de Autodefensa\" de Japon partio al mar frente a Somalia pretextando la \"prevencion de pirateria\", senala el comentarista y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe supone que esas filas arribaran a su destino a finales de este mes cuando entrara en vigor la \"ley anti-pirateria\" aprobada en la Dieta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, los reaccionarios japoneses intentan enviar sucesivamente a sus efectivos al mar frente a Somalia y otras partes del mundo, para lo cual dieron ya la condicion legal: la ley arriba mencionada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon ya ha enviado a sus \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" al Oceano Indico bajo el rotulo de la \"cooperacion en la guerra antiterrorista\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque Japon no se cansa de hablar de la \"aniquilacion de los piratas\", nadie puede asegurar que este pais con el antecedente de haber agredido a otros paises no repetira su pasado criminal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo descarado del caso es que los reaccionarios japoneses adornan el envio de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" a ultramar, encaminado a la agresion a ultramar, con las palabras de \"contribucion internacional\" y \"prevencion de pirateria\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Intentan ampliar el permiso dado a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", que cumplen la mision de mantenimiento de la paz, para el uso de armas para que ellas puedan emplear hasta las armas pesadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El hecho comprueba con toda claridad que el \"mantenimiento de la paz\" y la \"contribucion internacional\", de que habla tanto Japon, no pasan de ser una artimana para preparar el trampolin de la agresion a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si los reaccionarios japoneses emprenden de nuevo el camino de nueva agresion olvidando su amarga derrota sufrida en el siglo pasado, seran ahogados de modo insalvable junto con su fantasma militarista."
