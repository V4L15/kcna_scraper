Only three countries including the U.S. voted against the resolution for which more than 100 UN member nations voted. \r\n The fact clearly proves that the U.S. is clean indifferent to the fair settlement of the human rights issue and pursues only a sinister purpose under the pretext of the human rights issue, observes Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is wantonly violating human rights and keen on crackdown on religion not only at home but also in the international arena. The U.S. talk about human rights itself is an insult to human rights and a mockery of humankind, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the human rights abuses. Its  \"war on terrorism\" is an infringement upon sovereignty and human rights abuses committed under the ostentatious pretext of \"combating terrorism.\" The sovereignty of legitimate sovereign states is recklessly violated and the innocent people are ruthlessly killed owing to the U.S. imperialists' brigandish state-sponsored terrorism. More than 650,000 civilians lost their lives in Iraq since the U.S. imperialists' invasion of it. The U.S. veto on the resolution denouncing Israel's massacre of Palestinian civilians at a UN Security Council meeting clearly betrays its true colors as the world's biggest human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not a religious judge but a criminal which should stand a religious trial as the principal criminal who is to blame for cracking down upon and stamping out religion.  In the U.S. the slander of Islam is frantic and hatred for Islam has grown higher than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the case, the U.S. is openly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the pretext of \"human rights\" and \"religious issue\" only to reveal its arrogance and shamelessness.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Suppression of People's Struggle under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 4 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities should stop at once the suppression of people and organizations struggling against the conclusion of the unequal and submissive treacherous \"Free Trade Agreement\" and immediately discontinue their moves for its conclusion, as unanimously demanded by all the fellow countrymen. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n Terming the reckless suppression a vicious anti-national folly as it is intended to obliterate the just struggle of the people for the national dignity, interests and sovereignty, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The protest against the conclusion of the south Korea-U.S. FTA is now growing stronger in different parts of south Korea. It is a manifestation of the south Korean people's staunch will to protect the national dignity, sovereignty and vital rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The FTA is a noose of the U.S. domination and subordination over south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to check the conclusion of this treacherous agreement the south Korean people have waged massive and vigorous struggles such as 12 million-people signature campaign for checking the conclusion of the FTA, tour to the U.S. to stage protests, and demos in front of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, the U.S. embassy and the U.S. chamber of commerce and industry after inaugurating various organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadfast is the will of the south Korean people not to allow the conclusion of the aggressive, predatory and humiliating \"agreement\". This is very just and can never be criminalized.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
