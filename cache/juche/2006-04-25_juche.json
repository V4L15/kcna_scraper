But their behavior is too shameless.\r\n Underlying this despicable folly of the fanatics of pro-U.S. flunkeyism is the sinister intention to carry the split of south Korean society to a greater depth and capitalize on it for their return to power. What the traitors of the Grand National Party seek in wirepulling such ultra-right organizations as the \"friendship society\" to stage the pro-U.S. farce is to divide south Korean society into anti-U.S. and pro-U.S. sections and achieve the tie-up of the conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-U.S. treacheries will bring nothing but misfortune and pain of national division and catastrophic disasters of war to the whole nation.

It is no exaggeration to say that they represented an official stand of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the world public censured the U.S., saying what Hill uttered is different from its previous stand that financial sanctions are an issue separate from the nuclear issue but related to the U.S. financial interests only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inconsistent assertions and statements recently made by U.S. officials over its financial sanctions against the DPRK and its double standards in dealing with the nuclear issue reveal the reactionary nature of the U.S. foreign policy characterized by lies and deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking once again, financial sanctions against the DPRK are an issue directly related to the six-way talks for a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue surfaced due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, a policy aimed at denying its ideology and system and imposing Washington's ideology and system upon it. It is, therefore, the key to its solution for the U.S. to renounce its hostile policy and opt for coexistence with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is hard to expect any solution to the nuclear issue unless the U.S. makes a policy switchover. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. financial sanctions against the DPRK are an obstacle to the resumption of the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground for the U.S. to refuse lifting the sanctions, if it truly hopes for the six-way talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Typical of them are the families of Pak Yong Chol and his seven brothers, Om Pok Sun, Ri Chong Song and his four brothers, Ri Jong Un and his five brothers, and Ri Jang Ung and his seven brothers and sister. \r\n There are families whose members of three generations are all soldiers. Among them are the family of Ri Chi Son residing in Tongmun-dong No.1, Taedonggang District, Pyongyang and that of Jo Kwan Hwi residing in Kwangsong-dong, Sariwon City, North Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kang Kum Hui working in the Ranam Coal Mining Machine Complex and Han Mi Suk living in Hamhung City, South Hamgyong Province have reared many orphans in their families and tens of them joined the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are beautiful stories about twin and triplet and sister and brother soldiers and couple officers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The origin of the soldier family is the revolutionary family of the three generals of Mt.

Paektu who defended the headquarters of the revolution with arms in the anti-Japanese warfare and gave birth to and brought up the future Songun brilliant commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il is the legendary brilliant commander of Songun who has strengthened the Korean People's Army into invincible revolutionary armed forces and is giving full display to the dignity and might of the DPRK with his Songun revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has been developed to be the army of the Party and the leader, a-match-for-a-hundred strong revolutionary army and covered a proud path replete with heroic struggle and merits over the last 70-odd years.
