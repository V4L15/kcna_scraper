If the world's biggest possessor of offensive nuclear weapons the U.S. has a \"missile shield\" in place, it will create conditions decisively favourable for its preemptive nuclear assault. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is another aim of the U.S. to get Russia and China embroiled in an arms race and draw European countries closer to its fold. If this aim is achieved, the European countries' attempted build-up of their independent defence forces will completely misfire and find no alternative but to act under its pulls and pressures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. \"NMD\" is a product of its dominationist ambition to contain other big powers and thus conquer the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The point is that the feasibility of the \"NMD\" deployment for action has not yet been verified as it involves spending of a colossal amount of fund and has no sufficient technical guarantee.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that the U.S. keeps clamouring about \"threat of missile\" from the DPRK in a bid to woo other big powers to chime in with its moves to justify the \"NMD\" and bar them from preempting any more effective measures to develop and deploy new types of missiles than Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This crafty method of the U.S. will only strip bare its wicked nature.     \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is, in the final analysis, entirely responsible for the provision of the light water reactors to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the problems arising in the implementation of the agreed framework, including provision of light water reactors, should be solved through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. from a to z. so, KEDO is not entitled to say this or that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has already raised the matter of compensation as one of the pending issues of keeping the agreed framework workable at the DPRK-U.S. talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the DPRK's proposal is feasible and reasonable, the U.S., therefore, fully admitted the need for compensation and agreed to continue debates on it at the future talks. It is preposterous, indeed, for the KEDO to negatively respond to the DPRK's proposal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As clearly stated, if the issue of compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the indefinite delay of the U.S.-led construction of light water reactors fails to find a smooth solution, the DPRK will have no option but to turn out electricity by graphite moderated reactors depending on its rich natural resources and its own technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It stands to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should choose one of the two options: to make compensation for the loss of electrictiy power or allow the DPRK to produce electricity by its own efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
