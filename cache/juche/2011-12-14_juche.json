            "content": "Entidades femeninas llaman a abrir era de paz y reunificacion \r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 14 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Las direcciones femeninas de los Comites del Norte y el Sur de Corea para la Ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio publicaron el dia 14 la siguiente resolucion conjunta: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el decurso de la historia de la ocupacion del territorio nacional por parte de los imperialistas japoneses, la division nacional, la guerra y la guerra fria, tambien nuestras mujeres coreanas han experimentado los sufrimientos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese proceso nos damos clara cuenta de que la paz es la vida y es una cuestion importante relacionada con el destino de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras tomar parte en el simposio sobre la paz de Asia y el papel de la mujer, efectuado en medio de la division nacional, las mujeres de ambas partes coreanas sembraron la paz mediante la cooperacion en la solucion del problema de ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones y otras diversas actividades para la ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio e hicieron todo lo posible para el respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias se empeoran las relaciones intercoreanas, debido a lo cual se interrumpio el intercambio entre las mujeres Norte-Sur y se agrava cada dia mas la tension militar en el Mar Oeste de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas mujeres coreanas desean ardientemente la paz en este territorio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsperando que 2012 se haga el ano de esperanza para abrir una nueva coyuntura de viraje de la paz y la reunificacion, las mujeres de ambas partes coreanas deciden como lo siguiente: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, nosotras, siendo protagonistas de la reconciliacion y la unidad nacionales, la paz y la reunificacion, haremos ingentes esfuerzos por frenar la guerra y lograr la paz en este territorio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaremos todo lo posible por eliminar la fuente raigal de la confrontacion y la guerra en esta tierra patria y legar a las generaciones venideras la paz duradera y la patria reunificada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElevaremos nuestro papel para rechazar todas las barreras institucionales y las teorias conflictivas que impiden los viajes, los contactos y los encuentros por la reunificacion entre el Norte y el Sur y crean el antagonismo y la desconfianza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, nos levantaremos activamente en la ejecucion de la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe aqui la paz del pais, la radiante perspectiva de la reunificacion y el porvenir de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa unica salida para eliminar lo mas pronto posible la coyuntura de confrontacion de hoy y abrir una nueva fase de la paz y la reunificacion reside en la ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur, lo cual contribuira a la paz del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnarbolaremos la bandera de la Declaracion Conjunta N-S y rechazaremos estrictamente todos los actos conflictivos que obstaculizan las actividades de las entidades de las mujeres y de distintos sectores del Norte y el Sur para llevarla a efecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFortaleceremos mas las actividades solidarias de las mujeres de ambas partes para convertir en el mar en paz el Mar Oeste de Corea que contiene el peligro de conflictos armados y la guerra entre ambas partes coreanas, segun indica la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, Consolidaremos la solidaridad para la resolucion del problema de ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones y la proteccion de los derechos humanos de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema de ex consoladoras esta definido por la ONU como un crimen antihumanitario y los paises damnificados demandan al gobierno japones la disculpa y la indemnizacion por el respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mitin de miercoles en el Sur de Corea para demandar la reflexion, la disculpa y la indemnizacion del gobierno japones por el problema de ex consoladoras acoge el 14 de diciembre de este ano la milenaria ceremonia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy lamentable que no se hayan logrados los esfuerzos de las mujeres Norte-Sur por conmemorar en conjunto el 1000o mitin de miercoles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves de los testimonios y simposios sobre el caso de ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones, cobraremos sin falta la disculpa y la indemnizacion por los crimenes antieticos y los actos hostiles de toda indole perpetrados por Japon contra la nacion coreana, y en esta lucha solidarizaremos ampliamente con la ONU y otras organizaciones internacionales y las entidades ultramarinas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, frustraremos las maniobras de nueva agresion de Japon que pretende volver a danar la soberania de la nacion coreana negando y tergiversando su historia de agresion del pasado e insistiendo en su \"derecho a la posesion del islote Tok\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNosotras que ocupamos la mitad de la poblacion, haremos todos los esfuerzos por lograr la paz y la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReiteramos que seremos protagonistas del radiante futuro de la reunificacion y la prosperidad comun de la nacion."
