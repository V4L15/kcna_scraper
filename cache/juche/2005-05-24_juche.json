Calls for Accelerating General March for Songun Revolution \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The on-going general march for the Songun revolution is a dynamic onward movement started in our era under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il and an all-people movement to bring about a decisive turn in the building of a great prosperous powerful country, says Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed article.\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This march constitutes a great onward movement in our era to occupy a high peak of a great prosperous powerful nation in all fields of politics, military affairs, economy and culture under the banner of the Juche idea, the banner of the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have greeted an exciting era when we are working hard to reach the high eminence of the great prosperous powerful nation on the basis of the solid political, military and economic foundations that have been reinforced despite difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to bring earlier the morrow of a prosperous and powerful nation to the land only when all the people effect a great surge on all fronts of socialist construction with strong patriotic enthusiasm and in the spirit of an indefatigable struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have the Party's correct line and policies for economic construction, a heroic tradition and spirit whereby they pulled through with optimism all sorts of adversities during the \"Arduous March\" and examples of creation and construction instrumental in advancing faster for higher goals. No fortress is unconquerable for us when the might of the single-minded unity and the revolutionary soldier spirit are given fullest play and all the potentials are tapped for economic, scientific and technological development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general march for the Songun revolution is a revolutionary general offensive to achieve a final victory in the stand-off with the U.S. and the struggle to defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have the politico-ideological might and the matchless military muscle consolidated in every way in the course of the Songun revolution and a solid economic foundation, its core being the national defence industry. Only when the whole Party and army and all the people bravely turn out in the revolutionary offensive under the banner of Songun, can they smash the U.S. imperialists' offensive to stifle the DPRK and achieve a shining success in the building of the great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general march for the Songun revolution calls for countering the U.S. imperialists' reckless moves for a war with decisive and merciless military strikes, their political and diplomatic pressure with the toughest counter-action, their attempt at the reactionary ideological and cultural poisoning with a revolutionary ideological offensive and their economic sanctions with a great surge in socialist construction and thus victoriously concluding the struggle to defend socialism from the U.S. Herein lies the great significance of this march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The destiny of our country and nation hinges on this march in the 21st century. Only when all the servicepersons and people dynamically stage this new revolutionary march, full of conviction of sure victory, can they scale the high goal of the great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan has stockpiled plutonium enough to make 4,000 nuclear weapons with the patronage and connivance of the U.S. Israel has made more than 200 nuclear weapons by hastening its nuclear armament in secrecy with the patronage, connivance and cooperation of the U.S. If the U.S. had a fair stand, it should have called in question the nuclear armament of Japan and Israel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the U.S. application of double standards makes it impossible to correctly implement the NPT and impartially settle the nuclear issue. If the U.S. continues to apply double standards, the NPT will be reduced to a square peg in a round hole.\r\n The day will surely come when the world will judge the U.S., the most dangerous nuclear criminal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When the Koreans pool strength and wisdom, it is quite possible to check and frustrate outside forces' moves to provoke a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation, though bisected by outside forces, has already been closely united in idea on the road to peace against war for its common desire for peace. No outside force can match the united strength of the Korean nation all out to defend its life and destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Koreans, who oppose aggressive outside forces and love peace, fight hand in hand, peace on the Korean Peninsula can well be consolidated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever frantically the outside forces may run about to provoke a war on the peninsula, peace can be defended, if the Korean nation, the master of this land, stands against them in unison and fight them with national cooperation. \r\n The reunification of the country can be achieved in the common interests of the nation only when the outside forces are decisively rejected and the compatriots in the north and the south directly concerned with it sit down knee-to-knee and explore the way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However desperately outside forces may interfere, the way will be opened, provided those concerned with reunification pool their will and wisdom and cooperate with each other. This is clearly proved by the brilliant achievements made in the development of the inter-Korean relations and the movement for the country's reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and reunification, the basic conditions for the existence and development of the Korean nation, are firmly guaranteed by the might of \"By our nation itself,\" the basic idea of the June 15 era of reunification. This idea is the most reasonable mode of existence of the Korean nation today when outside forces are past control in their moves of aggression and anti-reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Koreans unite their strength, there is nothing to fear and beyond their reach. All the Koreans in the north and the south should invariably preserve and apply the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" holding fast to it as the motto for shaping the destiny of the nation and the lifeline of the movement for the country's reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They read out a statement strongly demanding an apology of the U.S. for the massacre in Kwangju and then stubbornly waged the struggle for 4 days, chanting nanti-American slogans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their just struggle brought great fear and uneasiness to the U.S. imperialists and marked an important occasion in escalating the anti-American struggle for independence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, said in his report at the meeting that the occupation of the \"American Cultural Service\" in Seoul was an eruption of the pent-up grudge and anger of the south Koreans against the U.S. imperialist aggressors and a great deed which powerfully demonstrated the aspiration and indomitable will of the south Korean students to put an end to the U.S. military presence and win national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imperative to more furiously flare the flame of the anti-American struggle and dynamically wage the nationwide struggle for smashing the Japanese reactionaries' moves to distort history and grab Tok Islet and anti-DPRK racket in order to put an end to the outsiders' aggression, interference, domination and subjugation against the Korean nation and achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter laid stress on glorifying the honour of the standard bearers and vanguard fighters, carrying forward the proud tradition with which the south Korean students demonstrated the resources and courage of youth in the struggle for independence against the U.S., for democracy against fascism and for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the C.C., the Korean Social Democratic Party, and others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
