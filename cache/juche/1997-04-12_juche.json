            "content": "S. Korea should act with prudence\r\n   Pyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppets are now loudly talking about south Korea's participation in the opening and closing ceremonies of the New Delhi conference of foreign ministers of non-aligned countries as a guest of the host nation, as if it attended them in the capacity of a guest of NAM.\r\n   Over its participation in the ceremonies with no proper justification, they are claiming that south Korea's \"diplomatic image has improved\" and its \"participation was of weighty importance\".\r\n   South Korea, totally subordinated by the imperialists in political, economic, military and all other domains, is ruled by tens of thousands of U.S. occupation forces. Its \"government\" is nothing but a colonial puppet regime.\r\n   It is ridiculous for the puppets, with neither political sovereignty nor operation control of the \"army\", to argue about \"diplomatic image\" and NAM.\r\n   NAM is a progressive movement rejecting all manner of domination and subjugation and aspiring after independence and is also a powerful revolutionary force of the present era standing opposed to imperialism.\r\n   It is only too natural that such a movement has no room for the puppets of the imperialists.\r\n   Following the policy of the imperialists and the dominationists for obliterating the characteristics intrinsic to NAM and disintegrating it, the puppets are trying to poke its nose into the movement.\r\n   They are also seeking to court its master's good faith, improve its image and get out of the serious political and economic crisis and the plight of an international orphan by joining NAM. But the sacred principles and idea of NAM will never tolerate the vicious subversive acts and base goal of the imperialists, dominationists and their puppets.\r\n   South Korea would be well advised to stand condemned by the people for their crimes against history and the nation, instead of resorting to vain efforts to join NAM. \r\n\r\n"

Now that the U.S. conservative hardliners continue revealing their brigandish ambition to encroach upon our sovereignty, we can never remain an onlooker.  The Korean people have a strong sense of independence and will always decisively and mercilessly smash anyone who tries to trample underfoot their sovereignty and dignity. \r\n   The brigandish design to conquer Korea with arms can never be realised.\r\n   The United States must not resort to the brigandish logic but immediately withdraw its troops from the Korean Peninsula and its surroundings. The U.S. conservative hardliners had better act with discretion, clearly seeing the strength and will of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

If it is in concord with the matter of our security, we will accept it and if not, we will have no interest in it.\r\n   If they think that the food problem decides whether we accept the \"talks\" or not, it would be a serious mistake.\r\n   Now our food problem is very serious. But it is foolish to expect our system to be seriously affected by the problem.\r\n   Our revolution has advanced over the past decades, undergoing greater trials than what we are suffering now.\r\n   Our people well know that the food shortage has been caused entirely by devastating natural disasters, particularly by foreign hostile forces' protracted economic sanctions and blockade. So, our people have harboured bitter grudges against them.\r\n   A row has been raised around Korea over \"emergency in the peninsula\" and \"response to it\", making our army and people Keep utmost vigilance.\r\n   All the steps we may take over its possible consequences will be only too natural. \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
