This was a test offensive operation for mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK, to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is seeking to turn the south Korean puppet army into an independent war force under the pretext of \"transferring the right to command wartime operations\" and use it as a shock force for starting a war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost, while boosting the maneuverability of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea and their offensive capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is in pursuance of this scenario that the U.S. warmongers are persisting in their dangerous war exercises with the south Korean puppet army, massively reinforcing the armed forces in south Korea these days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' reckless military rackets patently prove that the U.S. imperialists remain unchanged in their wild ambition to stifle and dominate the DPRK by force of arms. The present reality clearly shows once again how just the DPRK was when it bolstered up its war deterrent to cope with the moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A war has been averted and peace preserved on the Korean Peninsula so far because the DPRK has bolstered the self-reliant defence capability under the banner of the Songun. Songun guarantees the DPRK's sovereignty and the defence of peace. The DPRK is convinced of this through life experience. The DPRK will further increase its war deterrent as long as the U.S. imperialist warmongers continue pursuing the policy for stifling the DPRK.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves for Overseas Expansion under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago the Japan Ministry of Defence asked its government and Diet to approve the defense budget for the new fiscal year amounting to 4 840 billion yen (44.4 billion US dollars) or 2.2 percent bigger than that for fiscal 2008. It is said it is the first time in seven years that the ministry asked for an increase in the defense budget. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary: It is the assertion of the Japanese reactionaries that the defense spending should be duly increased as the sphere of the \"Self-Defence Forces\"' overseas activities gains in scope and the substance of their operations gets diverse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the long-harbored sinister intention of the Japanese reactionaries to turn their country into a military power and thus rush headlong into overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary cites facts to prove that the issue of ensuring the SDF's overseas military activities is now handled as the most acute and important political matter in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's history has no such precedent that the Japanese political circles handled the issue of the SDF's overseas military activities as an important state affair. This indicates that the Japanese reactionaries have openly pushed forward their militaristic policy for overseas expansion at a national level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is already long since Japan's militaristic moves for overseas expansion went beyond the danger level and these are posing a serious threat to the peace and security in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reckless moves to realize the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" are touching off the unanimous hatred and vigilance of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to halt their anachronistic and foolish moves at once, cogitating about the serious consequences to be entailed by their policy for overseas aggression. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
