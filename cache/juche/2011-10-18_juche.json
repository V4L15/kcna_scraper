            "content": "Leader Kim Jong Il Enjoys Art Performance of KPA Company Soldiers\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, together with servicepersons enjoyed an art performance given by soldiers of the Kamnamu (persimmon tree) company of the KPA honored with the title of the Thrice Three-Revolution Red Flag.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe numbers of various styles included chorus \"Glory to Our Great Party\", narration and chorus \"Persimmon Tree at Military Post\", vocal solo \"The Country I Am Defending\", accordion quartet \"Thunder over Jong Il Peak\", chorus and tale \"Girl with Arms in the Era of Songun\" and choral recitation and chorus \"Song of Coastal Artillery Women\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe performers emotionally represented their honor of spending days of worthwhile military service under the paternal love of the Supreme Commander and the days of their yearning to meet him again at their post and make a show of them who have grown to be a-match-for-a hundred combatants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe performance, full of revolutionary zeal, militant spirit and rich emotion, gave a deep impression to the audience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, was greatly pleased to see the good performance interwoven with works truthfully reflecting the military service of the company soldiers full of militant fighting spirit and optimism. He gave a high appreciation of the performance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that he wanted to see the company soldiers badly as there was a season when persimmons were ripening and that he was glad to see all of them conducting training and performing activities well in good health.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe asked about the servicepersons of the company whom he had met on his field inspection way and hoped that the company soldiers would register successes in their future combat and political training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccompanying him to see the performance were Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the WPK Central Committee, KPA Generals Pak Jae Gyong and Hyon Chol Hae, and Lieutenant General of the KPA Ri Tu Song."
