This means the power and victory of the DPRK. Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in an editorial article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity of the DPRK has a long history and it has steadily grown stronger in the annals of the revolution, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean revolution has always emerged victorious thanks to the unity of the Korean people in thinking and purpose and moral obligation based on the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il. The single-minded unity has grown exceptionally strong as it helped the entire party, army and people turn into a harmonious whole based on the monolithic ideology, faith and comradely love and sense of obligation in the era of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The harmonious whole of the leader, the party, the army and the people serves as a basic cornerstone of the state political system in the DPRK, basic roots of its society and a source for all the victories and miracles. The single-minded unity of the DPRK is the strongest revolutionary unity in history and an all-powerful treasured sword for winning only victory in any adversity. The invincible spirit of Songun Korea lies in that all the servicepersons and people form a community in which they share the common destiny with the leader and carve out a future of prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity of the DPRK is growing stronger in the historic advance for building a great prosperous and powerful nation of Juche under the uplifted banner of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This solid unity is based on the perfect unity among the leader, the army and the people in thinking and faith and has its source in the ardent longing and fascination of the army and people with the leader and it has become unbreakable despite the tempest of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The single-minded unity of the DPRK has demonstrated its might in the general advance to open the gate to a thriving nation under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"When Korea Is Determined, It Can Do Anything!\" The shout of this slogan now heard from every worksite for building a thriving nation represents the firm faith of the army and people of the DPRK that they have nothing to fear and can do anything as long as they are led by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is sure to always emerge victorious as it has the single-mindedly united ranks heroically advancing, performing matchless miracles and exploits in hearty response to the patriotic call of the leader."
