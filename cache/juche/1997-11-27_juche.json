            "content": "CPRF spokesman on anti-DPRK confrontation moves of south Korean puppets\r\nPyongyang, November 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland made public a statement on November 26 to denounce the puppet Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) of south Korea for announcing a fabricated \"case of a spy couple from the north\" on November 20.\r\n   It said:\r\n   In the \"announcement\", the ANSP alleged that \"resident spies\" and \"suspects\" connected with the \"spy couple\" amount to more than 200 at home and abroad, among them renowned professors, government officials, politicians and pressmen.\r\n   Synchronising with this, the south Korean puppets held a \"citizens' meeting\" in Taegu to intensify the anti-DPRK smear campaign. Worse still, subsidized publications have been set in motion to draw the public opinion to the case.\r\n   The anti-DPRK racket by the ANSP in south Korea is nothing but the last-ditch efforts of the south Korean puppets to escape from the crisis of ruin.\r\n   Whenever \"elections\" were held in south Korea, the puppets rigged up \"spy cases\" and forced \"elections\" in a terror-ridden atmosphere to prolong their fascist dictatorship, which is their trite method.\r\n   What they seek in the recently-announced \"spy case\" is to extricate themselves from the crisis of ruin and maintain their colonial fascist dictatorship.\r\n   The CPRF vehemently denounces the vicious anti-DPRK smear campaign in south Korea as a prelude to the fascist reactionary offensive to suppress and obliterate pro-reunification, democratic forces with the \"election\" as an occasion and a premeditated move to create a new \"security-oriented political situation\" and carry the \"election\" with violence, fraud and swindle.\r\n   The south Korean puppets must not resort to the anachronistic anti-DPRK smear campaign but stop at once the anti-national and anti-reunification moves of laying grave obstacles to the reconciliation and unity of the nation and the peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n   We will never pardon any anti-DPRK confrontation move of the south Korean puppets.\r\n   We will make the provokers pay dearly for their acts.    \r\n\r\n"
