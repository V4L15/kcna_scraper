It also said that it would hold in Seoul on Dec. 10 a prayer meeting urging the \"north to improve its human rights record\" with 100,000 Christians attending. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Network for Democratization\" and other anti-north organizations announced that from the beginning of December they would set \"a week of human rights\" aimed at slandering the north and stage such ridiculous farces as an \"international meeting of university students\" and \"photo exhibition\" and even hold a \"candlelight demonstration\" against the north together with U.S. conservative anti-DPRK human rights organizations.\r\n Meanwhile, the \"Grand National Party\" is getting more frantic in its anti-north human rights racket, much upset by its failure to pressurize the authorities to \"vote\" for the \"UN resolution on human rights issue in the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and even some ultra-right conservative religious organizations in south Korea are taking the lead in their malignant smear campaign against the north over its \"human rights issue.\" This is intended to realize the U.S. intention to escalate their anti-north campaign to stifle it under the pretext of its \"human rights issue\" in addition to its nuclear issue, deter the inter-Korean relations from favorably improving since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and seek a \"regime change\" through the next \"presidential election\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can never be such a thing as \"human rights issue\" under the socialist system in the north chosen by its people as it is the most genuine society centered on the popular masses where everything serves the people and the people have become its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea keep mum about what their American master has done in flagrant violation of vital and other rights of Koreans, occupying south Korea for six decades but are playing the role of a shock brigade in supporting his smear campaign over its non-existent \"human rights issue\" in the north where the people are proud to be independent and dignified. This lays bare their true colors as despicable pro-U.S. sycophantic traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never pardon those who try to defame the north's dignified political system and pursue the north-south confrontation and war but force them to pay a high price for their crimes through merciless retaliatory actions.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

History has no precedent in which aggressors escaped their defeat. The U.S. is keen to establish the American-style domination and order in the world and act an emperor, going against the trend of the times. This is, however, as foolish an act as digging its own grave.     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

This laudable change represents a feat which can be performed only by the KPA which has rendered its services for the prosperity and development of the country, upholding the Party by the sweat of its brow with ardent patriotism.\r\n He had a photo session with the servicepersons of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Ri Myong Su and Pak Jae Gyong and Hwang Pyong So, vice department director of the Central Committee of the WPK.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It branded Bush as a warmonger who disturbs the life of the world people and threatens peace, noting that women's organizations would hold a women's conference in Pusan in protest against Bush's visit to south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Members of women's organizations called press conferences in Pusan and Jinju, South Kyongsang Province, on the same day to denounce Bush's visit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Sanctions and Blockade Policy towards DPRK under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Department of Treasury recently made public a decision calling for freezing overseas assets of the DPRK trading companies dealing with economic institutions of the U.S. and including on the list of targets of its sanctions even those companies and individuals of third countries making deals with the DPRK companies under the absurd pretext of \"suspected proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and their delivery means.\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a signed article in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, this is part of the U.S. extremely provocative hostile policy to stifle the DPRK as it reveals its attempt to lay an \"international siege\" to the DPRK which has already been put into practice under a carefully worked-out plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of economic sanctions against the DPRK and its blockade operation against it are a prelude to a war aimed to have a firm grip on a strategic stronghold in Northeast Asia &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. economic sanctions against the DPRK presuppose military aggression and are aimed at achieving its strategic aim to carry out it with ease. Through economic sanctions and blockade the U.S. seeks to isolate the DPRK as thoroughly as possible and neutralize it economically and militarily and contain it by force in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It even urged the DPRK's neighboring countries to reduce economic ties and trade with it and apply sanctions against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At its instructions the Japanese reactionaries participated in the multi-national joint military exercises of intercepting and seizing DPRK airliners and ships and perpetrated such mean acts as restricting and barring the DPRK-flagged ships from entering their ports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but a folly for the U.S. imperialists and its followers to try to browbeat the Korean people through \"sanctions\" and \"blockade\" and attain their political and military purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people value peace and do not want a war. But they will never allow the enemies to infringe upon the sovereignty of their country and try to conquer their inviolable territory by force. They will mobilize all potentials and strongly react against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should draw a serious lesson from its past unsuccessful moves to blockade and apply sanctions against the DPRK and properly judge the strength and staunch fighting spirit of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. imperialists and international reactionary forces dare violate the sovereignty and right to existence of the Koreans through vicious blockade and sanctions and come in attack to destroy the socialist system by force, the Koreans will deal thousand-fold retaliatory blows at them. The U.S. had better properly understand the strength and will of the Korean people and stop its sanctions and blockade policy aimed to launch a war against the DPRK.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Withdrawal of U.S. Forces from S. Korea Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 19 (KCNA) -- 30 years have passed since the adoption of the resolution on the issue of Korea by an overwhelming majority vote at the 30th UN General Assembly on Nov. 18, 1975.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Saturday carries a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But still today, the U.S. imperialists have kept their aggression troops under the helmets of \"UN Forces\" along with the \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea, forcing the Korean nation to suffer the endless tragedy of division and gravely threatening the peace on the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. This is a shameless criminal act which can never be justified with any reason or pretext and proves that the U.S. is an empire of ferocious aggressors who blatantly defy the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though 50 years have passed since the ceasefire of the Korean war, the U.S. has persistently worked to maintain the titular \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea, while letting its forces there go under the helmet of \"UN Forces.\" This is in pursuance of its policy of aggression against the DPRK.\r\n The root cause of the constant danger of war to the Korean Peninsula lies in the presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea and their moves for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At this moment, too, the U.S. is busy with the transfer and reorganization of its aggression troops, while shipping ultra-modern assault weapons and other war equipment into south Korea. These are premeditated military moves. It is by no means secret that these moves are fraught with the great danger of invading the DPRK and containing China by using south Korea as an advance base and mounting even a military attack upon it if necessary.\r\n The U.S. war-mongers are trumpeting about \"regional security\" and \"war deterrent\" in a bid to justify their military occupation of south Korea. This is, however, nothing but sophism which can convince no one. The continued presence of the U.S. aggressor forces in south Korea is an unpardonable crime against humanity as it is aimed at perpetuating the bitter pain and tragedy resulting from the territorial division the Koreans have suffered.\r\n There is no reason for the U.S. to refuse to pull back from south Korea its troops, the cancer-like entity standing in the way of peace and reunification of Korea, if it truly wants peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. justify the presence of its forces in south Korea and there is neither ground nor pretext for the U.S. imperialist aggression troops to stay there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the trend of the times and roll back at once its hostile policy toward the DPRK, disband the \"UN Forces Command\" and withdraw its troops from south Korea without delay.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
