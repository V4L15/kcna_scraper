This was a historic event which made the Korean people and the world know about the might of the local industry and science and technology of satellites the DPRK has independently developed without boasting of it.\r\n   Candidate academician, Prof. and Dr. Han Hae Chol, Kim Haeng Gyong and other scientists, who were involved in the launch of the artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong No. 1,\" referred to the purpose of the launch:\r\n   First, it is to master the technology of putting a satellite correctly into orbit with a multi-stage carrier rocket.\r\n   Second, it is to perfect the structural engineering design of a multi-stage carrier rocket and its control technology.\r\n   Third, it is to study the circumstances of the space and verify if electronic devices correctly operate in the space.\r\n   Fourth, it is to complete the observation system of the carrier rocket and satellite.\r\n   For this purpose, necessary observation devices were installed at the carrier rocket and satellite.\r\n   With the successful launch of the satellite, necessary tests were made in the space and a solid foundation was laid to launch a practical satellite. It also provided a turning-point for establishing satellite observation and telecommunications systems in the DPRK.\r\n   The scientists chose the sky above Tsugaru strait between Hokkaido and Honshu, Japan,  as the trajectory of the recent artificial satellite launch. The carrier rocket was equipped with a device with which to lead the rocket to a safe area and explode it in case the flying rocket is deviated from the expected trajectory.\r\n   Through the recent success the scientists are  convinced of the  reliability of the carrier rocket before anything else. The success demonstrated the perfect efficiency of the multistage carrier rocket.\r\n   A scientist Kim Haeng Gyong who had participated in the launch said the carrier rocket correctly flied along the theoretically expected trajectory and that all the apparatuses of the artificial satellite are working properly after it was put into orbit.\r\n   Scientists said scientific foundations were laid for the immediate launch of practical satellites and the development and use of telecommunications satellites have been made possible.\r\n   The artificial satellite moving along its own orbit sends them survey data, including temperature, pressure and conditions of power source, they said.\r\n   The sketch map of the test launch of the carrier rocket of the artificial satellite shows where the carrier rocket was separated stage by stage and where the separated parts of the rocket dropped.\r\n   It shows that the first stage was separated from the rocket 95 seconds after the launch, in the air 35.9 kilometres high and 19.5 kilometres  off the launching station, that the second stage separated itself from the rocket in 266 seconds, in the air 204 kilometres high and 450.5 kilometres off the launching station and that the artificial satellite was put into orbit in 293 seconds, at the speed of 8,980 metres per second, in the air 239.2 kilometres high and 587.9 kilometres  off the launching station.\r\n   It also shows that the first stage separated from the rocket fell 253 kilometres off the launching station, that is 40 degrees 51 minutes north latitude 132 degrees 40 minutes east longitude and that the second stage fell 1,646 kilometres off the launching station, that is 40 degrees 13 minutes north latitude 149 degrees 07 minutes east longitude. \r\n\r\n"
