In this regard the Air Force Command of the Korean People's Army issued the following report on Monday:\r\n At around 12:05 on June 12, an overseas-based strategic reconnaissance plane of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces infiltrated into the sky above the waters of the DPRK east of Chongjin and Hwadae and made a shuttle flight there for hours to spy on its strategic targets.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such ceaseless illegal infiltration and aerial espionage are arousing a bitter indignation from the officers and men of the KPA Air Force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an indigenous disposition of our revolutionary armed forces to mercilessly punish the aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA Air Force warns again that the U.S. imperialist warmongers will be buried in the East Sea of Korea if they continue running amuck without discretion despite our warnings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I paid the first visit in March 1952 in the thick of the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time I was a member of an investigation group of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers for delving into the brutalities of U.S. troops in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days Korea was utterly reduced to debris in the war provoked by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bombs exploded without letup on the ground. But we appreciated a performance by artistes with Pyongyang citizens at the underground theatre in the city and could see a general plan for the rehabilitation and reconstruction of Pyongyang City. This plan convinced us that the Korean people were waging a winning war and the U.S. would be defeated by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current visit has left deep impressions upon me. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I fancied I was having a dream, looking over Pyongyang which has changed beyond recognition today with grand monumental edifices, modern high-rise buildings and rows of apartment houses that sprang up on the ruins to which everything had been reduced in U.S. bombings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these are a brilliant fruition of the devoted efforts of the Korean people under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yesterday and today of Korea caught me up in a flood of thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While staying here, I could witness the indomitable fight of the Korean people to defend and glorify their idea and system, not yielding to the maneuvers of the imperialist allied forces to crush the country, and directly feel the breathing of the heroic people advancing vigorously for the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, closely united around the great leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely win in their struggle for justice, peace and socialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
