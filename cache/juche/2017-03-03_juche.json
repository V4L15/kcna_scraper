He said they would recollect today, seeing the trees that grew tall when they visit this place as adults.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enjoying a bird's-eye view of the school clad in thick verdure, he said that the school has a thick woodland and now there may be no space for planting trees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told officials to let the students visit the places associated with the immortal leadership exploits of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il including the Kumsusan Palace of the Sun and plant trees there, and tour modern Tree Nursery 122 of the Korean People's Army so that they may learn the scientific way of planting trees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He urged the students who are growing, drinking water and breathing air in Mangyongdae to set an example in the forest restoration campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth tasks which would serve as guidelines for the school's upbringing and education and management and operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the students of the school.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So and Kim Yong Su."
