This is no more than nonsense talked by a psychopath.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unpardonable is that Park openly revealed her wild dream for \"unification through absorption\", not content with crying out for getting rid of \"terror\" for peace on the Korean peninsula and the future of the nation. She was so impudent as to ask others to join in \"the effort for ushering in the era of unification\" desired by her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she, a traitor barely prolonging her remaining days by kowtowing to the U.S., pursues the wild dream of \"unification through absorption\", daring seek to topple down the DPRK, the DPRK will clearly show her what style reunification it will achieve to realize the desire of all Koreans for reunification before the end of her dirty life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a tragedy and disgrace to the nation that such hideous confrontation maniacs as Park go with impunity only to bring misfortune and disaster to all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If such traitors as Park go scot-free, misfortune and pain of the south Korean people will get worse and all compatriots will never evade the disaster of a nuclear war, and when the outside forces and pro-U.S., pro-Japanese traitors are eliminated at an early date, the day of the complete liberation of the country-the independent reunification will be hastened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the conclusion drawn by the DPRK again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park should bear in mind that her desperate moves to escape ruin through awful tongue-lashing and reckless confrontation will only precipitate the miserable end of her fate, cursed and censured by all Koreans."

Pero, ella debe saber que nadie sera enganado por tales sofisterias de la marioneta, quien no puede hacer nada sin permiso de su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye, autora quien convirtio toda la extension surcoreana en el lugar carente de la democracia, los derechos y la vida de los habitantes, difamo con maldades a la RPDC donde se florecen plenamente los suenos e ideales del pueblo gracias a la materializacion de la idea de dar prioridad a las masas populares, lo que no pasa de ser un delirio de la psicopata.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas intolerable es que Park, al hablar de la necesidad de eliminar un supuesto \"pavor\" para la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y el futuro de la nacion, expuso abiertamente el sueno irrealizable de la \"unificacion mediante la absorbicion\" y pidio que \"se esforzaran juntos por abrir la era de unificacion\" que ella desea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi esta traidora, que mantiene a duras penas su vida restante bajo el amparo de su amo norteamericano, persigue el sueno de la \"unificacion mediante la absorbicion\" codiciando atrevidamente a la RPDC, le mostraremos correctamente antes de que ella diera ultimo aliento la reunificacion realizada a nuestro estilo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tragedia y la verguenza de la nacion son precisamente el hecho de que esta viva todavia Park Geun-hye, diabla conflictiva sin par quien impone a los coreanos las desgracias y las calamidades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi dejan intactos los traidores a la nacion como Park, se recrudeceran las desgracias y las penalidades de los habitantes surcoreanos y toda la nacion coreana no podra evitar la calamidad de guerra nuclear. Solo cuando eliminen cuanto antes a los traidores pro-yanquis y pro-japoneses, se adelantara el dia de la liberacion completa-reunificacion independiente de la patria. Esto es nuestra conclusion que volvemos a tomar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Park debe saber que cuanto mas se desespera para liberarse del abismo de la destruccion soltando las sofisterias y alborotos conflictivos, tanto mas adelantara el destino tragico bajo el repudio y la condena de todos los coreanos."
