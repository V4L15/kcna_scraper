In this course the political circles and munitions industry have been tied closer and politicians are playing into the hands of munitions enterprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the munitions industry gets weak, the overall economy is shaking to its very foundation. If politicians are out of favor with munitions monopoly businessmen, their fate becomes just like a dog without master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. administration is keen to help the munitions enterprises explore overseas markets in a bid to tide over the economic crisis and bring greater profits to munitions monopoly businessmen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is expanding arms sale not merely in quest of its economic interests. It is chiefly aimed to make the buyers of U.S. made arms dependent on it militarily and put relevant regions under its military control. Herein lies the danger of the U.S. moves for arms sale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThrough arms sale the U.S. is barring its buyers from attaining self-reliance in national defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch moves of the U.S. are sparking off worldwide arms race. Many countries are allotting not a small part of state funds as military spending for keeping military balance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is, indeed, a special-class war criminal state having a bad habit of drawing water to its mill by inflicting pain upon the world people through the escalation of the tension and wars of aggression. It will have to pay a dear price one day for its dangerous arms sale."
