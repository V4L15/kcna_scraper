            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Politically-motivated Suppression of Chongryon Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Korean Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries issued a statement Monday to denounce the Japanese reactionaries for searching houses of the chairman and the vice-chairman of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) by mobilizing dozens of policemen and even an armored car on March 26.\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman and the vice-chairman are deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK and leading officials of the dignified overseas Koreans' organization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is under legal and moral obligation to defend the rights and look after the life of the Koreans in Japan who are victims of its past crimes, and guarantee the activities of Chongryon as it enforced medieval colonial rule over Korea for over 40 years after illegally  occupying Korea, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries, however, viciously committed anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon acts, persistently evading the redemption of the past crimes although 70 years have passed since Japan's defeat. Their recent raid into the houses of the leading officials of Chongryon proves what extent their hostility toward the DPRK and the Korean nation has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Japanese police authorities conducted the search while deliberately linking Chongryon with suspicious involvement in a case without any legal validity and scientific ground, not only the Japanese legal circle and media but also people of other social standings in Japan have denounced the recent action as an illegal investigation in violation of the Japan Constitution and the criminal procedure law, abuse of rights of Koreans in Japan and national discrimination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Society for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries vehemently denounces the Japanese reactionaries' search as a wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK, reckless politically-motivated suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and an anachronistic confrontational act of inciting hostility between the peoples of the DPRK and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Society, availing itself of the opportunity, expressed the belief that Japanese from all walks of life and the broad masses of the world that value justice and human rights would become increasingly vocal in rejecting and denouncing the Japanese reactionaries' anachronistic anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon acts of pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to rock bottom and fanning up mistrust and antagonism between the peoples of the two countries."

Economic losses of Lithuania reached 230 million euros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t150,000 workers in member states of EU lost their jobs. 25,000 workers in Poland became jobless and 21,000 in Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was reported by the German government that the country would lose 300,000 jobs in case its trade relations with Russia collapse in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EU will reportedly suffer losses amounting to 50 billion euros (62 billion US dollars) this year due to the countermeasures taken by Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the amount of the losses suffered by the U.S. for imposing sanctions upon Russia is almost negligible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article titled \"sanctions have not caused big damage to the U.S.-Russia trade\" posted on the Russian internet news service Inosmi. Ru on Mar. 18 noted that the volume of the U.S.-Russia trade was not so big from its beginning and it is difficult to estimate the impact of the sanctions on it as most of the U.S. companies have not stopped their cooperation with Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to information announced by a relevant U.S. agency, the volume of the U.S. export to Russia from March to December, 2014 was 8.94 billion US dollars, which was less than 9.4 billion U.S. dollars in the same period of 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Russia is an \"inseparable neighbor\" of EU in the light of geopolitics as their interests are complicatedly intermingled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The annual volume of trade between EU and Russia amounts to about 460 billion US dollars but that between the U.S. and Russia is just 40 billion US dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, there is division among the EU member states over the issue of the U.S. call for slapping tougher sanctions against Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pan-Europe TV channel Euronews on Mar. 4 reported that the possibility of collapse of the euro zone is increasing. 38 percent of the European investors predict that the euro zone may be divided in a year to come and this possibility will reach an all-time high as compared with that in the past 2 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The division of EU and the danger of the euro zone's collapse are something which the U.S. desires.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. act of plugging EU into imposing sanctions upon Russia is aimed to bring down EU together with Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. works hard to slow down its decline even a bit at the sacrifice of its allies including the European countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stark reality brings shame to European countries."

Korean Puppet Group's Anti-DPRK Charades\r\n Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the south Korean puppet minister of Unification and the representative of the \"Saenuri Party\" insisted that the Cheonan warship was \"torpedoed by the north,\" citing the \"results of international joint investigation.\" They even talked about \"merciless provocation\" and \"the same lie as the one in the past.\"  \n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet minister of Defense and other war maniacs went so ridiculous as to cry out for taking \"perfect posture\" and meting  out \"resolute punishment\" and the like, making much fuss about \"torpedo attack by the north\" and \"its responsibility.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive of south Korea at the \"memorial service\" held on Mar. 26 five years since the warship sinking case pulled up the DPRK, talking such rubbish as \"it should stop its reckless provocations, drop its thought that nuclear weapons can protect it and take the road of true changes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary in this regard:  The south Korean puppet group is kicking up again confrontation hysteria against the DPRK, making much fuss over the warship sinking case which has nothing to do with it and going the lengths of malignantly hurting its line and policies.

By doing so, it also seeks to quell the voices of people from all walks of life calling for lifting the \"May 24 step\" and removing other hurdles lying in the way of achieving reunification under the signboard of \"adherence to principle,\" invent a pretext for provocation and continue using the case as a card for escalating confrontation with the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The behavior of the puppet group is nothing but the desperate frenzy of the criminals whose true colors as cruel murderers and confrontation maniacs have been brought to light. This reminds one of the adage that the thief is afraid of his own shadow. But liars have short wings."
