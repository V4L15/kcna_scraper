            "content": "New Documentary Film Previewed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 22 (KCNA) -- A preview of the documentary film \"Great Turn Brought about with Songun Revolutionary Leadership\" was held at the People's Palace of Culture on December 20 on the threshold of the 12th anniversary of leader Kim Jong Il's assumption of the supreme commandership of the Korean People's Army.\r\n The film comprehensively deals with the immortal leadership exploits Kim Jong Il has performed by turning the \"Arduous March\" into a cheerful and victorious march despite all sorts of difficulties and trials before the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The film impressively tells that, tightly holding the arms of the revolution in hand already in the early period of his activities, Kim Jong Il has trained the KPA as an army of devotedly-defending the leader, an ideologically strong army and a matchless revolutionary one replete with the spirit of becoming human bullets and bombs, thereby bringing about a proud victory in the political and military confrontation with the U.S. imperialists and the KPA is performing labor achievements in socialist construction, too, paving a wide avenue for building a great prosperous powerful nation. It convinces the audience that his Songun revolutionary leadership serves as an all-powerful treasured sword to defend the red flag of socialism and vigorously advance Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also shows Kim Jong Il visiting Jagang Province to let the revolutionary soldier spirit created by the People's Army prevail throughout the country and praised the fighting spirit displayed by the people in the province as the Kanggye Spirit. \r\nThe film contains scenes showing him giving field guidance to factories, cooperative farms, sites of land realignment and construction to bring about a great revolutionary surge in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The film has scenes proving that the Pyongyang meeting, the first of its kind in 55 years of division, provided by Kim Jong Il with his noble idea and will for reunification and a bold decision and the publication of the north-south joint declaration, its result was an historic event proving the validity of the independent Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the audience were senior officials of the Party and the state, officials of commissions and ministries of the Cabinet and national institutions, officials of the Party and power bodies and working people's organizations and working people in Pyongyang.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The declaration denounced the south Korean authorities for deciding at \"a meeting of ministers of unification, foreign affairs and security\" held in Chongwadae to send 3,000 additional troops to Iraq and lay the \"motion of troop dispatch\" of this scale before the \"National Assembly.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Demanding the \"government\" authorities totally withdraw the plan of troop dispatch, rejecting the U.S. unjustifiable pressure for troop dispatch and lending an ear to the people's voice at an early date, it set forth the following action program: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case the \"motion of troop dispatch\" were carried through the \"National Assembly\", students would immediately launch into a hand-in-hand belt action in front of its building to show their will against troop dispatch.

As facts show, it was not that there were no materials on the Japanese imperialists' anti-human crimes, but that they have all along concealed them. The newly published list of over 420,000 forcibly drafted Koreans, too, had been concealed by Japan as top secrecy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than half a century has passed since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. But there is no change in their wrong stand and attitude toward their past crimes. Herein lie the shamelessness and craftiness peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying Japan's wrong approach to the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity is the impudent idea of looking down upon other nations, the idea that \"the Yamato nation\" may rule the Asians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's wrong attitude toward its past crimes is based on the aggressive idea to repeat the history of crimes. It clearly shows that there is no change in its aggressive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is resorting to every conceivable ruse to cover up its past crimes without repentance. But it can never evade compensation for its grave crimes against human rights.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Laid before the tribunal by a joint international investigation group was an indictment which classified into 13 major categories the crimes committed by the United States on the Korean peninsula over the past one century or more such as the provocation of the Korean war, massacre of civilians in the wartime, barbarities of chemical and germ warfare, human right abuses in south Korea and nuclear crimes. And a stern judgement was passed on all the reactionary and inhuman policies and crimes of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the international conference staged a solidarity demonstration and held a solidarity rally, at which they unanimously adopted the Pyongyang manifesto of international democratic organizations and organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people calling upon the world peaceloving people to wage an extensive protest movement against the U.S. hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In September, many delegates of foreign organizations and figures visiting the DPRK held a joint meeting of organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Messages and letters of solidarity were sent to Kim Jong Il on every occasion such as the 3rd anniversary of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the June 25-July 27 month of anti-U.S. joint struggle by international organizations, organizations for peace against war and foreign organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people, political and public figures and people of various social strata.

What a high role an army can perform depends on its transparent will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary army equipped with the immutable idea and faith of its leader, supreme commander can play the role as the vanguard defending the gains of the revolution and bringing about social changes, and as a strong champion of the people's interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If an army is to be true to the idea and faith, it should become a perfect personifier of the idea and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History and reality go to prove that the army strong in ideology and faith alone can preserve its class nature and creditably perform its role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This army strong in ideology and faith means a mighty political force and a main force of the revolution pushing forward the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and faith serve as a basic source enabling our army to become the main force of the revolution. Our revolutionary army is an army strong in ideology and faith, as it is equipped with the immutable Songun idea and faith of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This kind of army is built and glorified only by a great illustrious commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has been trained as an army strong in ideology and faith as it has firmly established a system of revolutionary commandership and militant traits and all its servicepersons have formed a harmonious whole centering around the Supreme Commander. This is a brilliant result of the primary efforts our Party has consistently exerted for augmenting the political and ideological might of our revolutionary armed forces in its leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution was pioneered and is making a victorious advance thanks to the army strong in ideology and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army regards the Songun idea and faith of Juche as its life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea and faith of Juche means the idea and faith of    Kim Jong Il, the illustrious commander born of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army has fully embodied the Songun idea and faith of Juche, demonstrating its invincibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The transparency of our army's Songun idea and faith of Juche is clearly proved by the revolutionary soldier spirit created and highly displayed among the servicepersons of the KPA under the leadership of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit is based on the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and carrying out his instructions and the heroic self-sacrificing spirit. This spirit means the revolutionary do-or-die, persevering and indomitable spirit. It is in this spirit that the soldiers of the KPA unhesitatingly devote their youth and lives to the Party and the leader, the motherland and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army is strong as it cherishes absolute loyalty to its supreme commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA soldiers' absolute loyalty to their supreme commander is the noblest revolutionary spirit displayed in the do-or-die struggle and the immutable thought and feelings manifested in their life and practice every moment. Our revolutionary practice shows that profound trust and love and absolute loyalty exist between the supreme commander and his fighters, who form an inseparable harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is a strong army in which revolutionary traits prevail as all its servicepersons act as one by an order of the supreme commander.\r\n The militant traits of the KPA are revolutionary ones established and consolidated with the transparent faith and will whereby it knows nothing but the orders and instructions of its leader, supreme commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traits of the KPA mean the steel-strong discipline and order whereby all its servicepersons think and act as one according to the orders and instructions of its supreme commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army remains a strong army because it devotedly carries out the orders and instructions of its supreme commander through thick and thin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA devotedly implements the orders and instructions of its supreme commander in practice under any circumstances, standing in the van of our revolutionary ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sure guarantee for victoriously steering the era of Songun to give fuller display to the might of the idea and faith of the People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should vigorously make a long journey of the Songun revolution with the Songun idea and faith of the Party as guidelines in our life and struggle, single-heartedly upholding Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should model the whole society after the Songun idea and put the single-hearted unity of our revolutionary ranks on a new higher stage and effect a fresh surge in the socialist economic construction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
