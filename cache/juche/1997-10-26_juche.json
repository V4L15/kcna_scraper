In view of its size and character, the maneuver is a war exercise for a preemptive attack on the northern half of Korea. It is an open menace to us and a declaration of war as well.\r\n   \" Foal Eagle\"  maneuver is fraught with unprecedented danger.\r\n   There is no guarantee that the Kim Young Sam group of traitors who are bereft of reason in the face of total destruction and collapse shall not unleash a war.\r\n   We will take a serious view of the \"Foal Eagle\" maneuver of the bellicose elements at home and abroad and take a step corresponding to it. If they dare to ignite a war, we will fire back at them. \r\n   If the U.S. and the south Korean stage the foal eagle joint maneuver, they will be held responsible wholly for the grave consequences arising therefrom. \r\n\r\n"
