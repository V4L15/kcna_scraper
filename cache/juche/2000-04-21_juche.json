An important way of finding solution to it is to improve the layout of the fields and thus increase the area of cultivated land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grain production will sharply go up and the Korean farmers' age-old desire to farm joyfully with ease with the help of machines come true when the entire party and army and all the people turn out in the land leveling and rezoning in hearty response to the call of the WPK and energetically push ahead with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The stirring realities today when land leveling and rezoning is progressing apace deepen the Korean people's conviction that when they uphold the guidance of Kim Jong Il, they can work any miracle and build an economically powerful nation by their own efforts without fail no matter how hard their conditions may be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson calls on all the officials and working people to turn Kim Jong Il's long-term plan for land leveling and rezoning into shining reality to radically change the appearance of all the fields of the country as befitting the land of socialist Korea, the genuine socialist state, and thus greatly contribute to the building of a powerful nation of Juche. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Mass movements staged for building new society \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) staged vigorous mass movements in the early period of the building of a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Right after the country's liberation a lot of Korean people were not freed from the outdated ideological survivals and custom left over from the colonial society of the Japanese imperialists. Some officials did not believe in the people's strength as they indulged in bureaucracy and were affected by flunkeyism. All this adversely affected the building of a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was against this backdrop that the President Kim Il Sung initiated the general ideological mobilization movement for building the country, considering ideological remolding as a key issue in the nation-building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The movement was aimed to instill ardent patriotism into the people and rouse them to building a new country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK organized \"operative groups for the general ideological mobilization movement for building the country\" to increase their role. Many propagandists were sent to conduct ideological education among people from all walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, at least 18,700 peasants participated in the patriotic rice-donating movement in the agricultural field only at the end of December Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A vigorous emulation drive for increased production was also under way for the prosperity and development of the economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This movement which was aimed at boosting production and educating the working people was greatly helpful to the rehabilitation and construction of factories and enterprises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through this emulation drive the Korean workers successfully completed the rehabilitation and readjustment of not a few factories and enterprises in the power, coal, mining, iron and other industrial fields to start production in Juche 35 (1946). 822 industrial establishments, including the Kangson Steel Works, the Songjin Steel Works, the Nampho smelter and the Sohung mine started operations in that year. At least 14.5 million Sok (one Sok equals 150 kg) of more grain was produced in 1946 than 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And the campaign to abolish illiteracy was waged as a movement involving all masses and the whole society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As of Juche 34 (1945) there were over 2.3 million illiterates in North Korea. At least 16,170 adult schools were built and operated in the country in 1946 to abolish illiteracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, more than 90 percent of the illiterates became able to read and write as of March 1948. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such mass movements were instrumental in remolding the people's mental aspects in a short span of time after the liberation of the country and achieving great successes in the building of a new democratic Korea. \r\n\r\n"
