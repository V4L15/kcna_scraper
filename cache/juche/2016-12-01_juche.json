They are Ri Un Gyong, Han Haeng Bok, Ri Son Mi, Ri Ji Ye, Ri Pom, Kim Hye Song, Ryu Song Yong, Jon Ok Hyang, Ji Jong Hwa, Pak Ok Byol, Kim Sol Gyong and So Kyong A.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before long, we will be seeing in the new year, promising a new hope, expectation and happiness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it really breaks our hearts to celebrate a new year without even knowing what is happening to our dear daughters. While we are writing this letter, tears are streaming down our faces as we are worried sick to see them, with no one telling us when they will come back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to take this opportunity to remind you of the fact that immediately after the south Korean authorities had committed this heinous crime against humanity, we wrote a letter to you, asking for your help in returning our daughters to their home and asked several times for your reply. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is, however, a great pity that no information has been provided on their status and treatment, far from their return to their home. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are writing once again, hoping that our daughters might return one day if the United Nations human rights mechanisms make continued efforts, true to their principles of justice, truth as well as promotion and protection of human rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already mentioned in our previous letter, all of our daughters led a happy and carefree life, giving full play to their talents under the warm care of the socialist system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As such, they have no reason to abandon their homeland and parents. This is a well-accepted fact that no one can deny. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group abduction of the 12 innocent girls committed in a third country by the south Korean intelligence service is the worst-ever heinous crime against humanity that outperforms the abduction by the fascist dictator of an opposition party politician in Tokyo, Japan in the 1970s. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this moment the gangsters of the south Korean intelligence service are in a frenzy to brainwash our daughters while holding them incommunicado and not letting them sleep even a single minute after sensationalizing the abduction as the \"group defection\" and the \"effect of the sanctions\" and the like. They are beasts, not human beings. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our unanimous demand that such beasts must not remain unpunished since they have rejected outright the request of the south Korean civil society organizations for contact with our daughters so as to obtain information about their status, let alone our repeated calls for the south Korean authorities to grant us a contact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that no one has seen or met our daughters as yet in contradiction to the announcement of the south Korean authorities that they had let them live a normal social life a couple of months ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, this announcement is yet another falsehood of the south Korean authorities who are experts in telling lies. It is also a way of their existence to go to any lengths to pursue confrontation with their fellow countrymen with the inveterate repugnance against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the recent revelation that the south Korean chief executive completely severed the relations with the DPRK and, in particular openly incited in October this year \"defection from the North\", dancing to the tune of a female shaman that the DPRK will collapse within a couple of years, establishes that this group abduction is a collaboration between the inexperienced shaman and the chief executive, a proof of their complicity in this incident. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that right at this moment, our daughters are shouting to us for help, eagerly wishing to come back to us, parents, because they can no longer endure the cruel and inhuman treatment of the intelligence service in south Korea without anyone to turn to for help. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are pursuing a vicious political end by separating the girls from us through the group abduction, while turning a blind eye to the division of the nation and territory caused by the outsiders that have inflicted indescribable pain and suffering on our nation. This shows that they are the worst-ever ring of terrorists and demons in history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such terrorists and devils must be brought to justice. Our patience has gone beyond its limit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cruel atrocity committed by the south Korean authorities deserves denunciation and due punishment of the justice-loving mankind and the international community, including the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are sure that our daughters in south Korea are waiting for the hands of rescue while struggling against the coercion, lure and brainwashing of the barbarous criminals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We acknowledge that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council play significant roles in helping our daughters return to their homeland. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are well aware that it is the mission of the United Nations human rights mechanisms to conduct an exhaustive investigation into this thrice-cursed crime against humanity committed by the south Korean authorities and bring those perpetrators to justice and facilitate the reunion of the parents and daughters as soon as possible. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will definitely continue to struggle until the day when our beloved daughters come back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are convinced that the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Human Rights Council will, true to their mission, remain calling into question this crime against humanity committed by the south Korean authorities and demand an unconditional and immediate repatriation of the victims, thus realizing our reunion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We strongly believe that you will not disappoint us. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yours Sincerely."

It is working hard to build public opinion in a bid to create impression that the ever-mounting all-people resistance is now under way under \"the north's wire-pulling,\" asserting that \"it is resuming even broadcasting service for giving cipher instructions to spies dispatched to the south and issuing orders for all-out action.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, gentries of the ultra-right conservative organizations are spreading misinformation that the people's actions for forcing Park to resign are related to \"the attempts of the left forces following the north to overthrow the state\" and \"the main force is the 120,000-strong spy group following the north.\" They went the lengths of floating false rumor through internet that \"a certificate of the Workers' Party allegedly lost by a spy of the north was found at Kwanghwamun Square, the venue of rallies.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the National Reconciliation Council in a statement on Thursday said all \"north wind\" rackets of the puppet group and every form of false propaganda conducted by them against the DPRK are faked up in such way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits attention is that such \"north wind\" charade is conceived by the lackeys of Chongwadae under the command and manipulation of Park Geun Hye who is breathing the last breath and orchestrated by the gentries of the \"Saenuri Party\" and ultra-right conservative organizations under the instructions of Chongwadae, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people of all social standings should heighten vigilance against the venomous serpent-like disposition of Park and her crafty deceptive artifice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days when the conservative group used to deceive the south Korean people and tide over the crisis through the fabrication of the despicable \"north wind\" and the campaign for eliminating the \"followers of the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more ignorant and ridiculous attempts than the efforts of the conservative group to prolong its remaining days while pinning hope on such bankrupt \"north wind\" farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group's foolish bid to find a way out through the fabrication of the \"north wind\" would only touch off stronger resentment of the south Korean people."

            "content": "Padres de 12 muchachas secuestradas envian carta a altos funcionarios de la ONU\r\nPyongyang, primero de diciembre (ACNC) -- Los padres de las 12 muchachas norcoreanas, que fueron seducidas y secuestradas colectivamente por las autoridades surcoreanas, enviaron el 28 de noviembre una carta al Alto Comisionado para los Derechos Humanos y al Presidente del Consejo de DDHH, de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto completo de la misiva sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSomos padres de las 12 ciudadanas que en abril pasado, fueron raptadas colectivamente en Ningbo de la provincia china de Zhejiang y fueron llevadas por la fuerza al Sur de Corea por los gangsteres del Servicio de Inteligencia instigados por las autoridades surcoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa pasaron mas de 7 meses desde cuando las autoridades surcoreanas nos quitaron nuestras queridas hijas Ri Un Gyong, Han Haeng Bok, Ri Son Mi, Ri Ji Ye, Ri Pom, Kim Hye Song, Ryu Song Yong, Jon Ok Hyang, Ji Jong Hwa, Pak Ok Byol, Kim Sol Gyong y So Kyong A. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPoco despues, acogeremos el Ano Nuevo 2017 que prometera a todos la esperanza, la aspiracion y la felicidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no podemos contener la pesadumbre por acoger el Ano Nuevo sin saber lo que pasa a nuestras queridas hijas, victimas del incidente de secuestro colectivo. Nos ahogamos en las lagrimas y se rompe el corazon anorando a las hijas que no sabemos cuando regresaran. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta oportunidad, recordamos que inmediatamente despues de ocurrido este inaudito crimen de lesa humanidad, ya hemos enviado a ustedes una carta solicitando esforzarse por que las autoridades surcoreanas devolvieran pronto a las victimas al regazo de los padres y hemos preguntado reiteradamente el resultado del respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, sentimos lastima porque no han regresado nuestras hijas ni se ha confirmado siquiera la vida o muerte de ellas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEscribimos esta carta con un hilo de esperanza de que si se esfuerzan las organizaciones de DDHH de la ONU, que consideran como su vida la justicia, la veracidad y el fomento del bienestar y de los derechos humanos, podriamos encontrarnos con nuestras hijas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo hemos dicho en la carta anterior, nuestras hijas nacieron en el regazo de la RPDC y crecieron felizmente estudiando a sus anchas sin envidiar nada en el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo queremos repetir mas que ellas no tienen ninguna razon de abandonar la tierra natal y a sus queridos padres y hermanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA instigacion de las autoridades surcoreanas, los gangsteres del Servicio de Inteligencia, secuestraron a plena luz del dia a las 12 muchachas inocentes en el extranjero. Este crimen antietico es mas brutal que el incidente ocurrido en la decada de 1970 por el dictador fascista surcoreano quien llevo al Sur de Corea a un politico opositor secuestrado en Tokio, Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Como podemos considerar como seres humanos a los gangsteres del Servicio de Inteligencia del Sur de Corea que insatisfechos con el secuestro colectivo a nuestras queridas hijas, hablan de la \"fuga colectiva\" y la eficiencia de la ejecucion de la \"sancion\" y encarcelan en las celdas individuales a las secuestradas y se entregan al lavado de cerebros?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsistimos unanimemente en que no deben dejar intactos a los barbaros que negaron nuestra reiterada demanda de permitirnos ver, aunque sea una vez, a nuestras hijas y hasta la peticion de las entidades civiles surcoreanas que desean el contacto con las secuestradas para confirmar su vida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas dicen que ya terminaron la \"investigacion\" necesaria y permitieron hace unos meses a las secuestradas salir a la \"sociedad\". Pero, hasta la fecha no hay ninguna persona que ha visto a ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, es una pura mentira inventada por las autoridades surcoreanas que suelen convertir lo blanco en lo negro y muestra el modo de existencia de la mandataria surcoreana que con el veto a la RPDC se vale de todos los medios y metodos para la confrontacion fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mandataria surcoreana se hace objeto de burla por todo el mundo por haber llevado a la ruptura total las relaciones intercoreanas confiando a ciegas la mentira de una hechicera que dijo que la RPDC \"se arruinara dentro de dos anos\". Y a principios de octubre pasado, instigo abiertamente la \"fuga del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTeniendo en consideracion tales hechos, el presente caso es indudablemente el producto conjunto de la bruja y la mandataria surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe oyen hasta ahora los gritos sangrientos de nuestras hijas que demandan volver lo mas pronto posible al regazo de sus padres y hermanos por no poder resistir nunca mas a los maltratos inhumanos y crueles de los gangsteres del Servicio de Inteligencia en el suelo surcoreano donde no hay ni un pariente consanguineo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon la horda de terroristas y bribones las autoridades surcoreanas que cometieron el secuestro colectivo persiguiendo el malsano designio politico sin hacer caso de los incontables desgracias que sufre durante mas de medio siglo la nacion coreana por la division nacional causada por las fuerzas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales terroristas y demonios deben ser llevados a la justicia. Nuestra paciencia sobrepaso su limite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La atrocidad cometida por las autoridades surcoreanas merece las denuncias y el castigo de la humanidad y la sociedad internacional, que aman la justicia, inclusive la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estamos seguros de que nuestras hijas en el Sur de Corea esperan las manos de rescate luchando contra la coercion, la seduccion y el lavado de cerebro de los criminales barbaros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Reconocemos que es importante el papel de la Oficina de Alto Comisionado para los Derechos Humanos y el Consejo de Derechos Humanos en ayudar a nuestras hijas a volver a la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tenemos bien entendido que es la mision de los aparatos de DDHH de la ONU realizar una investigacion consecuente sobre los escalofriantes crimenes de lesa humanidad cometidos por las autoridades surcoreanas, llevar a sus ejecutores a la justicia y facilitar lo antes posible el encuentro entre los padres e hijas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Seguiremos luchando hasta el dia en que vuelvan nuestras queridas hijas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estamos convencidos de que la Oficina de Alto Comisionado para los Derechos Humanos y el Consejo de Derechos Humanos, fieles a sus misiones, continuaran cuestionando este crimen de lesa humanidad cometido por las autoridades surcoreanas y demandaran la repatriacion incondicional e inmediata de las victimas para realizar nuestro encuentro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Queremos creer que ustedes no nos van a decepcionar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Atentamente."
