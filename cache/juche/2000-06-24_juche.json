This shows that he is persistently clinging to the line of north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By nature Jo made outbursts getting nerves on the north and vitiating the atmosphere of inter-Korean summit talks after the publication of the April 8 north-south agreement only to stir up furore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In late may, too, he went to Japan where he clamored about \"cooperation\" with the United States and Japan and \"military cooperation and exchange\" with them in a bid to cope with the inter-Korean summit talks, thus throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere of the talks. This fact goes to prove that he is a military gangster ignorant of the trend of the times and the desire of the people at home and abroad and, at the same time, a person whom the nation found undesirable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such anti-reunification element as Jo Song Thae should be thrown overboard to achieve the reunification of the country, the supreme desire of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should ponder over the adverse impact the outbursts of such anti-national, anti-reunification elements as Jo will have on the development of the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will certainly make such fanatics advocating confrontation with the north as Jo Song Thae pay for their crimes. \r\n\r\n"
