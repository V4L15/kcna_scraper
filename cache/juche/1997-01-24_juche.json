Recently, the \"civilian fund\" backed by the \r\nJapanese government suddenly paid \"lump sum\" to former \r\n\"comfort women\" of south Korea and Asian countries in a \r\nsecret way.\r\n   Such an act is an unbearable insult to the Korean people \r\nand all other victims in Asia and is also another crime \r\nagainst them.\r\n   The measure committee made it clear long ago. At the end \r\nof last year it sent a letter to the Japanese Prime \r\nMinister urging Japan to renounce the \"civilian fund\" policy \r\nand fully discharge its state responsibility for the \r\n\"comfort women\" issue.\r\n   But the Japanese government, instead of acceding to our \r\njust demand, is justifying the revival of militarism and \r\nJapan's past crimes. This indicates that it has a sinister \r\nintention to make no settlement of the past and repeat such \r\ncrimes when an opportunity presents itself.\r\n   Japan has been trying to make impressions that it has \r\ndone all for the post-war settlement by making public a \r\n\"statement\" 50 years since the end of World War II. But it \r\nmust clearly know that as long as it refuses to liquidate \r\nthe past crimes, the post-war settlement will remain \r\nunfinished and Japan can never win confidence from the \r\nKorean people and other Asian people. \r\n\r\n"
