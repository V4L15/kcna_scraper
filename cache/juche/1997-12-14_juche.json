That is why the word \"election\" fund might create a situation unfavorable for it.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean ANSP to stamp out Pomchonghakryon denounced\r\n  Pyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- The north headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) issued a statement on December 13 denouncing the Agency for National Security Planning for its frantic moves to obliterate the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon).\r\n   According to the statement, on December 9 former south side delegates of the joint secretariat of Pomchonghakryon called a press conference and released a strange \"statement\",in which they, taking issue with the lines and struggle of Hanchongryon, the south headquarters of Pomchonghakryon, cried for the \"dissolution\" of the organisation and said that they would \"close\" the joint secretariat and resign the position of the south side \"delegates\" of the joint secretariat.\r\n   Their unreasonable remarks are the same as those let out by some dishonest elements of South Korean universities and colleges when they groundlessly slandered Hanchongryon, declared their defection from the organisation and their seeking for a \"new student movement\" in accordance with the scenario of ANSP, the statement says, and goes on:\r\n   It does not deserve even a passing note.\r\n   Hanchongryon already gave a serious warning to the former south side \"delegates\" of the Pomchonghakryon joint secretariat in Berlin for their disobedience to the instructions of the organisation and suspended their activity.\r\n   Aware that the crooked tentacles of  ANSP reached some impure forces in Germany, Pomchonghakryon moved the joint secretariat to another place under the agreement with Hanchongryon. The joint secretariat is now conducting more energetic activities than before.\r\n   The clamour about \"resignation\" and \"closure\" is of no use.\r\n   The ANSP should admit that their third-rate trick does not work.\r\n   Pomchonghakryon marked the fifth anniversary of its inauguration in august. It still remains alive and will develop into a more powerful organisation in the future.\r\n   The flag of Pomchonghakryon is soaked with the precious sweat and blood of the youths and students for accelerating the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through the unity of the young people and students in the North and South of Korea and abroad.\r\n   The days of ANSP which is hell-bent on destroying Pomchonghakryon  are numbered.\r\n   The north headquarters of Pomchonghakryon will hold higher the flag of Pomchonghakryon, the banner of struggle and victory, together with the youth and students under Hanchongryon, the south headquarters of Pomchonghakryon, and its overseas headquarters and push ahead with the sacred struggle to accelerate the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- Papers here today denounce the speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, Newt Gingrich,  for his allegation that the U.S. should \"become a world leader in the 21st century\" and \"U.S. troops will remain in south korea.\" \r\n   His remarks came during his visit to Britain.\r\n   His allegation cannot be the revelation of his own thought and stand, the news analyst of Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\r\n   Lurking behind his allegation is the U.S. policy of strength towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   His remarks betray the U.S. intention to run into an anti-DPRK military adventure with the South Korea-based U.S. troops as the main task force.\r\n  As long as the U.S. military presence in South Korea continues, the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. at war will not be improved and the Korean Peninsula will remain a Cold War area.\r\n   Now that the U.S. has kept its troops in South Korea and committed war provocations against the DPRK more frequently than before, the DPRK cannot but attach importance to military affairs and increase the defence capabilities of the country to cope with them.\r\n   To do so belongs to the sovereignty of the DPRK from A to Z.\r\n   If the U.S. truly wants peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, it should not seek its permanent military presence, but immediately pull its troops out of South Korea.\r\n   Minju joson in a commentary says that if the U.S. misjudge our will and dare to test it, the U.S. will get nothing but destruction.    \r\n\r\n"
