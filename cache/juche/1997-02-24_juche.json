The white paper says:\r\n Kim Yong Sam enforced a medieval fascist rule,corrupt\r\npolitics.\r\n   Under the cloak of Reforms, he set up a civilian\r\nveiled fascist dictatorial system which is more vicious than\r\nthe former military fascisy dictorial systems.\r\nA total of 45 cases, of railroading of bills through\r\nparliament unilaterally by ruling parties have been\r\nrecorded in south Korea since the second National assembly\r\nof 1952. 23 cases, more than a half of the figure,have been\r\ncommitted since Kim Yong Sam merged his party with the\r\nruling party for it's  chairmanship\r\n   KIm Yong Sam promised that he would eliminate the fusion\r\nbetween the gorverment and business ,liquidate \r\nirregularies and corruption and thus enforce clean\r\npolitics. However,he betrayed his commitment and turned\r\nsouth Korea into a hotbed of irregularies and corruption\r\nin four years of his office.\r\n   He raked up more money by dint of power. As a result,in\r\none year after his assumption of office ,he became one\r\nof the richest men in south Korea. It is told that now\r\nKim Yong Sam ranks first in the richest men in south Korea.\r\n   In four years of Kim Yong Sam's office,the south Korean\r\neconomy has gone bankrupt.It is now on the verge of a total\r\nbunkrupcy, wiht the snowballing trade defict and foreign\r\ndebtts.\r\n It's trade defict in 1993 was dlrs 1.56 billion,\r\nwhich increased to DLRS 6.3 billion and 10.061 billion\r\nrespectively in 1994 and 1995.In 1996,it ran into dlrs\r\n20.379 billion, which shows that south Korea's trade deffict\r\nhas increased almost 13 times in four years since he seized\r\npower. However,his promise proved to be an empty talk.\r\n   At present, 1,760,000 people live poverty=their\r\nearnings area less than one fourth of the  minimum living cost\r\nor nothing at all.\r\n   Debts for each worker amount to 9,750,000 won.\r\n   56,000 children  are wandering about in stress as\r\nbeggars.\r\n   An increasing number of people commit suicide, cursing\r\nsouth Korean society which throws them into destitution\r\nand deprives then of their right to learn. South Korea  \r\nplaces first in suicide cases in the world,with over 48.7\r\nper every 100,000 persons committing suicide.\r\n   Crimes and accidents increased in number after Kim Yong\r\nSam's assumption of office.\r\n   The collapse of the Sampoong Department Store and Songsu\r\nBridge were extra -large disaters unprecedented in the\r\nworld. 8 accidents including them left nearly 2,500 people\r\ndead.\r\n Last year he declared the Inter-Korean closed-door\r\npolicy, which was a challenge to the fellow countrymen, who\r\nwant detent, peace and reunification.\r\n   He has stepped up war preparation against the Northern\r\nHalf Of Korea.\r\n   8 large-scale military manoeuvres against the Northern\r\nHalf Of Korea. The War experiences increased to 16 Jun 1993\r\nwhen Kim Yong Sam took office,37 in 1995 and 88 in 1996.\r\n   Military expenditures are on a ruse every year.\r\n   The white paper says in four years after his assumption\r\nof office the traitor Kim Yong Sam has turned south Korea\r\ninto a more fascist,corrupt society where social vices hold\r\nsway,resorted to a campaing of confornation and war\r\npreparations against the Northern Half Of Korea,bringing\r\nthe situation on the Korean Peninsula to the worst phase and\r\nblocked the road of reunification,far from becoming a\r\npartner of dialogue.                                                                \r\n\r\n\r\n"
