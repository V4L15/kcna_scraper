The South Koreans strained every nerve to\r\ncreate new mistrust between  the north and the United States\r\nand begged the U.S to put bigger pressure upon the  north\r\nwith the incident as an occasion.\r\n  But,the U.S. Administration dispatched democratic member \r\nof the house of representatives Richardson to the as a \r\nPresidential envoy to make an dfficial apolpgy to the north\r\nand take Hanziker back to the U.S.\r\n   Hanziker confessed in the north that he was an agent of\r\nthe agency for national security planning of south Korea\r\nand ,back home,he did not slander the north but spoke good\r\nof the north,which infuriated  the south Korean authorities.\r\n   Judging from this, the U.S investigation authorities\r\nsuspect that Chongwade instructed it's intelligence agents\r\nin the U.S to kill him.\r\n   According to their initial investigation,on December 5\r\nlast year a week after Hanziker returned to the United\r\nStates a telephone order for arranging the day of killing\r\nHanziker came to an ANSP agen at the south Korean Embassy\r\nin Washington from Seoul.\r\n   The agent mailed a letter to Hanziker in name of\r\nHanziker's maternal uncle,so that Hanziker went to a hotel\r\nin seattle.\r\n   A hotel clerk confirmed that a strange man and woman of\r\nsouth Korea took a room next to Hanziker's and had access to\r\nHanziker. Witnessed said the car in which the couple\r\ndisapperared after the shooting incident belonged to the\r\nsouth Korean Embassy. The south Korean  Embassy in Washington,\r\nafraid of a big trouble which will affect the relations with \r\nthe United States in case the incident turns out to have been \r\nmade by the ANSP,is making a fuss to mislead the U.S.\r\ninvastigation.     \r\n\r\n"
