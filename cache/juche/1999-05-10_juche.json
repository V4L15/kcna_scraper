What they are seeking is an overseas aggression, not peace.\r\n   It is the Japanese reactionaries' wild ambition to realize the dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" in the 21st century which they failed to do in the 20th century.  Their mere talk about \"peace\" is an insult to peace.\r\n   Ridiculously enough, Japan is loudmouthed about \"global partnership\" even before settling its past and getting rid of the disgraceful name of enemy state.\r\n   Peace and prosperity on the lips of the Japanese authorities precisely mean overseas aggression and economic plunder.    \r\n\r\n"

I was prepared for death. \r\n   Fortunately fishermen in the north saved me. I was given hospital treatment and cordially received in the north.\r\n    I settled in the north of my own accord to live under the benevolent system.\r\n   The defectors said there is no one to be \"exchanged\" for the north-orgin unconverted long-term prisoners in the north, and urged the South Korean authorities to unconditionally send them back to their hometowns at an early date.    \r\n\r\n"
