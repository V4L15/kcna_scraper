The governor of Shimane Prefecture asserted at a recent session of the prefectural assembly that \"Takeshima (Tok islet) is an inalienable part of Japan's territory in view of historical facts and international law.\" This touched off bitter wrath among the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are becoming increasingly assertive for the claim to Tok islet despite the fact that the Tok islet is marked as a territory belonging to Korea in Japan's historical materials and in the past the Japanese authorities admitted themselves that the islet belongs to Korea. Lurking behind their persistent claim is a black-hearted intention to put the islet under its control and stage a comeback to Korea at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves to usurp the islet are part of their premeditated moves to check Korea from becoming a reunified powerful country, afraid of it. This can not but be interpreted as a fit of those obsessed by guilty conscience and a ridiculous folly of political dwarfs forsaken by history and the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is intolerable for Japan which occupied Korea and inflicted unspeakable misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people in the past to give its eye-teeth for the inviolable territory of Korea instead of admitting those crimes and making an apology for them. Japan is well advised to behave with discretion and drop its claim to Tok islet. \r\n\r\n"

This is evidenced by the U.S. imperialists' large-scale airstrike against Iraq and moves to establish the \"National Missile Defense\" system (NMD), etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People can never be safe  nor can achieve peace unless the imperialists' moves for aggression and war are checked and frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in the struggle of the people for peace is not to allow hegemonism and high-handed policy of the imperialists under any circumstances but put collective pressure upon them and shatter them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressives should brand imperialists' hegemonism and high-handed policy as acts of infringing upon sovereignty and harassing world peace and put up strong opposition to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the guarantee of the world peace, it is necessary to decisively foil military interference and aggression committed by the imperialists under the signboard of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this the world people should heighten vigilance against the \"establishment of a democratic order\" and the \"protection of human rights\" touted by the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should not overlook the imperialists' aggression against other countries,  regarding it as aggression against their own countries. under no circumstances they should allow themselves to give assistance in the imperialists' military invasion or get involved in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding that the U.S. moves for establishing the NMD are a main factor of disturbing global strategic stability and security at present, the article calls for scotching the imperialists' development of new type weapon systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace should be won through struggle, the article notes, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressives should make the 21st century a century of peace in name and reality through the intensified struggle for peace.    \r\n\r\n"

It was mostly a gathering of neighbours.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hyangdo gatherings were set on promoting harmony through discussions of communal affairs and dinner pastimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It laid a special stress on financial assistance in case of happy and, particularly, unfortunate events. The members united to criticize any breach of promise or ethics and help the sinners out of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fine custom was motivated by desire for mutual help, harmony and unity and a concept of value that stressed morality at the expense of power and wealth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation has lived in harmony for thousands of years until the mid-20th century when it was bisected by foreign forces.

Monggumpho, as the name goes, is said of a fine scenery which can be seen in a dream.\r\n It is also called a \"ten-ri golden beach\" whose name was derived from the sand of weathered quartzites at the foot of the Pultha range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is 7 to 8-metre-high elephant rock floating above the sea. according to a legend, a mammoth elephant came here from the tropics to see the sights of Monggumpho and was turned into a rock, carried away by its scenic beauty. At high tide it looks like an elephant dipping its lengthy trunk into the sea water to drink water, and at low tide exposing its full body on the tidal flat. Viewed from the rock downward, one can see the full spectacle of waves beating upon the curious-looking rocks lying like a folding screen to form the cloud of mist, and presenting a view of wonderful cliffs and rocks, its beauty similar to rock mass in sea kumgang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are also many rock reminding one of a \"sentry\" standing guard over Monggumpho and Imdangsu which is said to be associated with the Korean classical tale about Sim Chong, a filial daughter who threw herself into the sea after having been sold for 300 Sok of rice for the sake of her blind father. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Natural wealth is found in abundance here. The sand is in wide use not only as a raw material for glass but casting along with that in Kumipho. It abounds in effective medicinal herbs including parsnip. Sea shores teem with pacific sand launce, sea cucumber, anchovy, oyster, lobster and kelp. The swimming beach surrounded by recreation parks is crowded with holiday-makers in the summer season.    \r\n\r\n"
