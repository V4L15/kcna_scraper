            "content": "Important Steps Declared as Regards Kaesong Industrial Zone\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- Kim Yang Gon, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, issued the following statement on Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula has been put in the state of war due to the serious anti-DPRK moves of the U.S. and south Korean authorities and their moves for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with escalating military tension together with the U.S., the south Korean conservatives, in particular, are running the whole gamut of intrigues to find a pretext for igniting a war against the DPRK after reducing the Kaesong Industrial Zone to a theatre of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Defying the repeated warnings of the DPRK, the south Korean confrontation maniacs are letting loose a string of invectives hurting the dignity of the DPRK, talking about \"source of money\", \"detention\" and \"hostages\". South Korean Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin revealed his sinister intention to introduce a special unit of the U.S. forces into the zone, vociferating about an operation for \"rescuing hostages\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the south Korean warmongers seek to turn the zone into a hotbed of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By origin, the zone was built as a symbol of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification after the DPRK granted a privilege to Jong Ju Yong, honorary chairman of Hyundai Group of south Korea, valuing his patriotic will for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's offer to south Korean enterprises a vast area near the Military Demarcation Line where armed forces of the north and the south are standing in acute confrontation was a bold decision based on ardent love for the nation and compatriotism and a manifestation of the firm will for independent reunification, peace and prosperity based on the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When traitor Lee Myung Bak did serious harm to the inter-Korean relations in all aspects, getting hell-bent on confrontation after coming to power, the zone remained unaffected by it thanks to the desire and will of all Koreans in the north and the south for reunification and kept its operations for common prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the zone is now in the grip of a serious crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The zone, a product of the June 15 joint declaration, has been reduced to a theater of confrontation with fellow countrymen and military provocation, quite contrary to its original nature and mission due to such hideous confrontation maniacs as Kim Kwan Jin. This situation can no longer be tolerated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean conservative forces claim that the DPRK will never give up the zone as it benefits from the industrial zone, but it gets few economic benefits from the zone while the south side largely benefits from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK provided an area of military strategic importance to the south side, in particular. This meant a big concession. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a tragedy that the industrial zone which should serve purposes of national reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification has been reduced to a theatre of confrontation between compatriots and war against the north. The existence of such zone is no better than nothing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is compelled to make an important decision related to the issue of the industrial zone now that the south Korean authorities abuse the generosity and compatriotism of the DPRK for their hostile purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon authorization, I declare the following important steps as regards the crisis in the Kaesong Industrial Zone:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The DPRK will withdraw all its employees from the zone. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. It will temporarily suspend the operations in the zone and examine the issue of whether it will allow its existence or close it as the south Korean authorities and military warmongers seek to turn it into a hotbed of confrontation between compatriots and war against the DPRK, hurting its dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General Bureau for Central Guidance to the Development of the Special Zone will be responsible for the working matters related to the important steps including the withdrawal of the employees and the temporary suspension of the operations in the zone. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How the situation will develop in the days ahead will entirely depend on the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

            "content": "White Paper Reveals Danger of US-S. Korea War Drills\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Monday released a white paper revealing the gravity and danger of the war drills being held by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean regime to prove who is the provoker increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korea have kept up staging war drills against the DPRK for six decades since the ceasefire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and south Korean warmongers waged more than 18,000 north-targeted war drills and military trainings in south Korea since the ceasefire. It is the number that was officially made public. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills have been staged every year in south Korea, involving hundreds of thousands of troops including the U.S. aggression troops in south Korea, south Korean puppet army, U.S. forces from its mainland, Pacific region and Japan and even troops of its allies such as Britain, Australia, Colombia, Canada and Denmark. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the war drill Ulji Freedom Guardian activated more than 400,000-500,000 troops including the U.S. aggression troops in south Korea, U.S. reinforcement troops, the three services of the south Korean puppet army, those concerned of the south Korean \"government\" institutions and local autonomous  bodies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that the U.S. and south Korea mobilize huge forces enough to conduct a total war in the north-targeted war exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also involved in the north-targeted war drills are latest war hardware and means. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korea recently laid out a \"plan to jointly cope with the provocation of a local war\" the keynote of which is for the U.S. to automatically get involved in case of the military conflict between the north and the south and jointly counter it together with the south Korean puppet army. The on-going war drill against the north is just aimed to put the plan into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-targeted war exercises staged by the U.S. together with the puppet army in south Korea are a heinous nuclear war rehearsal to bring a nuclear holocaust to the Korean Peninsula, Northeast Asia and other parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the cease-fire, the U.S. loudly spoke in public that \"it suffered a defeat in the Korean War because it did not use A-bombs\". It drew up all kinds of scenarios of nuclear war including 8-53 and the \"9-day heavy strike strategy\", which called for using nuclear weapons in case of the second Korean war, and has gone desperate in waging military drills according to the scenarios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. officially made public to the world in July 1957 that it started the work to arm the U.S. forces present in south Korea with nuclear weapons and massively introduced nuclear weapons including tactical nuclear missile Honest John and 280 mm atomic artillery pieces into south Korea to hurl them into Focus Lens, Focus Retina and other north-targeted war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear war provocation against the DPRK has become evermore undisguised in the Team Spirit joint military drills which it staged together with the puppet army in the 1970s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drills involved F-16 fighter bomber, B-1B long-distance strategic bomber and nuclear submarines. There were even the drill of using atomic artillery pieces and the drill of launching Lens nuclear missile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the early 1980s there took place in the underground operational room of the White House a mock exercise for commanding a nuclear war to strike all parts of the DPRK all at once in the presence of the U.S. president and over 1,000 nuclear warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. staged a drill for mount a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK after introducing the nuclear-powered aircraft carriers Enterprise and Midway into south Korea during the Team Spirit of 1983.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 1985, it introduced the Blue Beret special unit armed with backpack nukes into south Korea to conduct evil drills of sabotaging the rear areas of the DPRK. From 1987 it activated the nuclear war-commanding plane to wage reckless war drills under various codenames to attack areas of the DPRK with nukes on the ground and seas and in the air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the RSOI in 1994 it rehearsed a nuclear war with the involvement of up-to-date strike means after drawing up such nuclear war scenarios as OPLAN 5026, OPLAN 5027, and the plan for bombing Nyongbyon that envisaged mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2002 the U.S. worked out a \"nuclear posture review\" and a \"national security strategy report\" in which it put the DPRK on the list of preemptive nuclear attack. In March 2005 it advanced a \"joint nuclear operational doctrine\" and, pursuant to this, staged madcap drills for preemptive nuclear attack during RSOI, Foal Eagle, Ulji Focus Lens and other joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since 2008 the U.S. has hurled all ultra-modern nuclear attack means including the largest-ever nuclear aircraft carrier and strategic bombers into Key Resolve, Foal Eagle and Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t B-2A flew into the sky above south Korea from the U.S. mainland for the first time in U.S. history to stage a mock drill for dropping nuclear bombs as part of Key Resolve and Foal Eagle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t John S. McCain and Decatur, Aegis destroyers carrying interceptor missiles, and SBX-1 were dispatched and two nuclear carrier flotillas were deployed in the waters off the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, military drills being staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet warmongers under various codenames, claiming they are for \"defensive\" and \"annual ones\" are, to all intents and purposes, premeditated provocations to launch a war on the Korean Peninsula and nuclear war maneuvers to preempt a nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that they are the arch criminals escalating tensions on the Korean Peninsula and provocateurs, aggressors harassing peace and increasing the danger of war. -0-"

En marzo de 2005, presento la llamada \"doctrina de operacion nuclear conjunta\", segun la cual se llevaron a cabo los simulacros de ataque preventivo nuclear, tales como \"ejercicios combinados de refuerzo en tiempo de guerra\", \"Foal Eagle\" y \"Ulji Focus Lens\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde 2008, en las maniobras \"Key Resolve\", \"Foal Eagle\" y \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" participaron superportaaviones de propulsion nuclear, bombarderos estrategicos y otros armamentos nucleares sofisticados de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ultima edicion de \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\", se traslado por primera vez al firmamento surcoreano el bombardero estrategico Stealth B-2A desde el territorio estadounidense y ejecuto el simulacro de lanzamiento de bombas atomicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY se despacharon con urgencia a las aguas cercanas a la Peninsula Coreana los destructores Aegis equipados con misiles interceptores, John S. McCain y Decatur, la plataforma maritima autopropulsada SBX-1 con radares anticoheteriles y 2 flotillas de portaaviones nucleares \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos simulacros de toda clase, que los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos desarrollan bajo el vistoso rotulo de \"defensa\" y \"anualidad\", constituyen la provocacion premeditada para desatar la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana, especificamente, atacar preventivamente con armas nucleares a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos delatan que EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos son los que agravan la tension de la Peninsula Coreana destruyendo la paz y trayendo el peligro de guerra."
