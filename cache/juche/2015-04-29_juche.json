This can be done only by hooligans devoid of morality and human conscience and psychopath bereft of elementary normal sense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Abe's reckless remarks that shielded the hideous crimes against humanity in disregard of the international community strongly urging Japan to make an apology and reparation for its past crimes including the issue of sexual slavery vividly showed the moral vulgarity and impudence of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe reportedly said Japan would donate funds to the UN for the protection of women's rights. This is also a base act of making mockery of mankind as it means bargaining on inviolable human rights with a petty amount of money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Japanese authorities persist in putting under the carpet the past crime-woven history of Japan and repeating it, it will never escape destruction more shameful than its defeat in the past war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe-led Japanese authorities should drop their anachronistic way of thinking and honestly admit and apologize and make reparation for all the inhuman crimes including the sexual slavery as demanded by the international community."

This clearly proves once again that the U.S. is not a human rights champion but the worst human rights abuser and the cruelest human butcher.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. accuses other countries of their \"human rights issues,\" while shelving its own human rights abuses. This is aimed to calm down the international criticism of the human rights abuses in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop making vain efforts to cover up its crimes and its true colors as the worst human rights abuser through the hypocritical call for \"defending human rights\" and face the world's stern judgment for its human rights abuses."

In a written interview with a Chilean paper in the country she let loose a spate of rubbish about \"dialogue\" unbecoming her position, talking about someone's \"passive attitude\" towards the \"Dresden declaration\" and calling for \"change\". In Brazil, too, she made confrontational remarks, vociferating about the nuclear issue and the \"human rights\" issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These were outbursts let loose by a woman devoid of her own viewpoint as she was accustomed to recklessly accusing others, says Rodong Sinmun. It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should have remained quiet if she had started foreign tour in order to escape the crisis in which she was liable to be impeached more than ten times. She must feel ashamed of talking volumes to slander fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperately the south Korean puppet forces are kicking up a confrontation racket against the DPRK in cooperation with foreign forces, they can never tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK, block all its service personnel and people from dynamically advancing along the road of Juche and Songun and escape the worst crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet chief executive would be well advised to stop groundlessly accusing others only to become a laughing stock, and mind her own business in south Korea which has turned into mayhem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson brands Park as a confrontational maniac without an equal in the world as she made no scruple of hurling mud at the compatriots while making junkets to various countries, utterly indifferent to the angry voices of the south Korean people."
