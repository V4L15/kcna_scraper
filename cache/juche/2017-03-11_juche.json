He guided the layout for internal remodeling several times and settled all matters arising in the project to modernize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon being told that the institute was successfully remodeled, he sent it modern designing means recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to the history of the institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at the historical data and relics showing the history of the leadership provided by leader Kim Jong Il for the development of Juche-oriented architecture, he looked back with deep emotion on the proud path covered by the institute. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various places of the institute such as the exhibition of architectural sci-tech achievements, the room for the study of architectural designs, the designing documents room, the information data study room and the inner court, he learnt in detail about the modernization and the work being done at the institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the designers, architects and researchers of the institute have successfully fulfilled the designing tasks assigned to them by the Party each time a major construction project was to be undertaken in the past, and produced a lot of architectural masterpieces worth national treasures at the highest level, he stressed that it is an able and trustworthy group of designers and an icon and standard of the nation's architectural designing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Learning in detail about the technical features and functions of the equipment newly installed at the institute, he said that it could outpace the world even in creating modern architecture only when it widely introduces advanced scientific and technological achievements in the architectural field to suit the actual conditions of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The institute has a very important duty to perform, he said, setting forth the tasks which would serve as guidelines for its work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the Party shows very deep trust and great expectation for the institute, he expressed expectation and conviction that the officials, designers, architects and researchers of the institute would creditably fulfill their heavy, yet honorable mission and duty in the future, too.

It is the unanimous assessment of the nation that the miserable end of Park Geun Hye is a historic victory of justice brought about by the tremendous might of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time Park was judged and punished by people, not by any specified force or political dissidents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean political history records lots of mass resistance, big or small, but never has there been such a case in which the people defeated injustice with candlelight of justice and won all-people victory by bringing down the pro-American conservative regime which boasted of omnipotent power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. It is our invariable stand that those who betray the nation and get hell-bent on following outsiders and confrontation with the fellow countrymen can not escape a miserable end like Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the divided Korean nation, the best justice represents reunification and absolute truth lies in independence, reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a drop of blood dedicated to the nation out of patriotism is highly valued and remembered long but acts of treachery with one's back turned on the nation and fellow countrymen are bound to face curse and denunciation by the nation for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The U.S. and other riff-raffs who shielded human scum Park forsaken by the public will face the same fate as Park's sooner or later. This is a stern warning of the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What excuses and compensation can the traitors make for the shameful and inglorious nature and blunder which caused such great chaos and utter confusion in south Korea no matter how shameful and regretful they may feel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries which used to utter honeyed words as \"cooperation\" and \"partnership\" just remained a passive on-looker to what was happening in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the wretched end of the stooge whose existence is so worthless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean society now stands at crucial crossroads of great changes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans won a victory in their anti-Park resistance but it is just a beginning in the actions for genuine justice and social progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing will change fundamentally although scarecrow-like Park is brought down, and the new independent politics, new democratic society and new dignified life so much desired by the south Koreans do not come of themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people should totally throw overboard the reactionaries of history with the zeal and courage with which they brought down the citadel of pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese conservative forces with the might of justice and unity and work hard to carve out a bright future of new world and reunification and prosperity where their dreams and ideal come true. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Treachery will end in inglorious death and final victory is always in store for the righteous and brave people."

El fin tragico de Park Geun-hye es la victoria historica de la justicia que trajo la inagotable fuerza del pueblo. Esto es la evaluacion unanime de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye fue enjuiciada y sentenciada no por algunas fuerzas especificas o la fraccion de oposicion politica, sino por el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la historia de politica surcoreana estan registradas no pocas resistencias populares de dimensiones pequenas y grandes, pero es la primera vez que se logra la victoria mas popular en la lucha justa con velas que mediante las fuerzas unidas de las masas populares, trajo la victoria sobre la injusticia y derrumbo el \"poder\" conservador y proyanqui que se jactaba de su omnipotencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Los que traicionan a la nacion y recurren al servilismo a las fuerzas extranjeras y al enfrentamiento fratricida no pueden eludir el destino tragico como Park Geun-hye. He aqui nuestra posicion invariable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la nacion dividida en dos partes, la mayor justicia esta en la reunificacion y la verdad absoluta reside en la independencia, la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sangre dedicada por la patria y la nacion, aunque sea una gota, sera apreciada siempre, pero las huellas de traicion al pais y la nacion seran repudiadas por toda la nacion generacion tras generacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Los fulanos y menganos como EE.UU. que vinieron amparando a la deformada escoria humana Park Geun-hye, abandonada por la nacion, tambien sufriran tarde o temprano el mismo destino de ella. Esto es la severa advertencia de la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ?Como podran ellos corregir su atributo abominable y pagar sus errores aunque se sientan avergonzados y arrepentidos de la caotica situacion del Sur de Corea?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe quedaron con brazos cruzados hasta los paises que decian palabras edulcorantes como \"colaboracion\" y \"acompanante\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el valor de lacaya y su fin tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, la sociedad surcoreana se encuentra en el punto muy importante de cambio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTriunfo la resistencia anti-Park Geun-hye de la poblacion surcoreana, pero esta victoria no es mas que el comienzo de la lucha por la genuina justicia y el progreso social. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa dimision de la traidora titere Park Geun-hye no trajo el cambio radical. Y no se lograra por casualidad la nueva politica independiente, la nueva sociedad democratica y la nueva vida digna, deseadas tanto por los habitantes surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRedoblando el coraje con que destruyeron el bastion de fuerzas conservadoras proyanquis y projaponesas, ellos deben luchar con dinamismo por sepultar a todos los reaccionarios de la historia y construir un nuevo mundo, donde se realicen sus suenos e ideales, y por forjar el futuro de reunificacion y prosperidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl fin de los traidores a la nacion es la muerte mas vergonzosa y la victoria final esta siempre al lado del pueblo justo y valiente."
