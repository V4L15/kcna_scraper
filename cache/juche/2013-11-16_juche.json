            "content": "S. Korean Ruling Party Slammed for Resorting to Arbitrary Practices\r\n Pyongyang, November 16 (KCNA) -- The south Korean internet paper Voice of People on Nov. 13 carried an editorial titled \"Saenuri Party seized with ambition for one-party dictatorship\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial said that the \"Saenuri Party\" decided to examine the issue of referring to the court the \"law on advanced operation of the National Assembly\", citing its illegality. The \"Saenuri Party\" complained that the operation of the NA at present does not accord with the spirit of the constitution and it cannot leave such NA operation as intact, the editorial noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a laughing stock that the party is crying out for bringing the suit over the illegality of the law which the NA passed through its session last year saying it opened up the way of advanced operation of the NA, the editorial ridiculed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the law is revised as pressed for by the party, it will set the stage for the ruling party to handle all the bills unilaterally, it said, commenting it will be a candid attitude to insist on the one-party dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As evidenced by the ceaseless moves to dissolve the trade unions and progressive opposition parties as what was done in the period of the past military dictatorship, the departed soul of the one-party dictatorship is reviving, the editorial deplored."
