They urged the candidate for \"prime minister\" to \"make clear his stand on the issue of improving human rights situation in the north\" and asked him \"if he agrees to the view that the north was behind the 'Choenan' sinking case\", while blaming him for standing against the adoption of \"resolution on improvement of human rights performance in the north\" and approving an \"amendment which deleted the north from the list of backstage manipulators of 'Choenan' case\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even, So Chong Won, who had been ousted from the LKP, called for \"verification of stand to the north\" by the candidate for the director of the Intelligence Service and other candidates who appeared at the conformation hearing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This hideous confrontation farce can be performed only by the conservative forces who pushed the north-south ties into the worst catastrophe as today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the south Koreans want is to immediately abolish all the evils left by the Park Geun Hye regime and to build a new society where the candlelight demonstrators have become key players.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The coteries of conservative group including the LKP, which committed all kinds of crimes, as cat's paws of traitor Park, against the desire and wish of the people, are the hotbed of traitorous policies and corruption and irregularities that should have been thrown overboard together with the top class criminal Park.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is truly detestable to see the remnants of history, sternly punished by the public for their mad-cap confrontation racket, riding roughshod again to incite the north-south stand-off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dreary scene at the puppet National Assembly reminds one of the confirmation hearing during the Park Geun Hye regime in which those blowing louder trumpet for confrontation with the fellow countrymen could please the conservative group and earn posts of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the confirmation hearing the conservative forces offered a pass to Han Min Gu who cried out for \"punishing provocation base and even supporting and commanding forces\" in case of \"provocation\" and Hong Yong Phyo who held that \"north's nuke can not be tolerated\" before others, putting forward them as a shock brigade in executing Park Geun Hye's confrontation policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces' dirty inveterate nature and confrontational frenzy are to blame for the north-south relations which plunged into the worst stalemate today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, they are going reckless like a guilty party filing the suit first only to stun the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces will get nothing but earlier final end, no matter how desperately they may stand against the \"National Assembly\" to avenge their ouster from power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To side with the conservatives' confrontation racket while reading their faces would be little short of pricking one's eyes with one's own hands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans from all walks of life should ressolutely wipe out the remnants of Park Geun Hye challenging the candlelight demonstrators and open up a new chapter for national reconciliation and unity."

It even announced that it would offer such services as English translation for NGOs and individuals willing to submit data about \"human rights situation in the north\" to the UN bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It justified anti-DPRK leaflet scattering-operation as an \"expression of freedom\" and did not hesitate to release \"welcome statements\" whenever the U.S. and its vassal forces fabricated \"north's human rights resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces reduced even the body dealing with their own human rights into anti-DPRK \"human rights\" body and confrontational body. This pushed the north-south relations into the worst phase and the situation on the peninsula close to a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has ample human rights issues, caused by the unpopular rule by the conservative forces, which have to be set right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citizens of the DPRK were abducted in group in broad daylight to be separated from their families against their will. Such crimes against humanity are openly committed in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Human Rights Committee\" has to disclose such serious human rights issues and make efforts to set them right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the demand of the south Koreans and the way of reviving its function.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have to lend an ear to the assertion of the civic and public organizations, media and experts that the first human rights measure to be taken by the present \"government\" is to probe the truth behind \"abduction of 12 women workers of the north\" by the Park Geun Hye conservative forces and send them back to the north, and should not follow in the footsteps of the conservatives."
