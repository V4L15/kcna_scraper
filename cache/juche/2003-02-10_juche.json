But this is nothing but a broad hoax to mislead the public opinion, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This arms buildup eloquently proves that though they pretend to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, they are, in actuality, keen to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once the U.S. imperialists unleash a new war on the Korean Peninsula, it will soon develop into a nuclear war and both the north and the south of Korea will suffer from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are becoming ever more undisguised in their intention to stifle the DPRK by force, while giving lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"diplomatic solution\". And their scenario to invade the DPRK has entered the phase of full-fledged implementation. This reality eloquently proves that the DPRK was entirely just when it has increased the self-reliant defence capacity under the banner of the army-centered policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are well advised to judge who is their opponent and halt their moves for a new war at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they keep working hard to provoke a war against the DPRK despite its repeated warnings, they will be held entirely responsible for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n"

They are desperately working to stifle the DPRK, peddling the fiction about the DPRK \"development of nuclear weapons\" and instigating the International Atomic Energy Agency to put international pressure on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is taking measures to massively bolster its forces in and around South Korea in an undisguised bid to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the DPRK to take the toughest measure to protect its supreme interests under this severe situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should properly understand the stand of the DPRK and stop at once their reckless military threat and pressure.    \r\n\r\n"
