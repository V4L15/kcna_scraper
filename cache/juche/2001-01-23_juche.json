It calls for preserving common denominators between the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed confederation and reunifying the country by means of federacy in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the joint declaration both sides agreed to solve the humanitarian issues as soon as possible and develop cooperation and exchange in the economic, social, cultural, sports, health care, environmental and all other spheres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is an essential prerequisite for creating an atmosphere of national harmony and unity and promoting national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also because the joint declaration is demonstrating its great vitality in practice as a declaration on the independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After its publication the relations between the north and the south of Korea are shifting from antagonism and confrontation to a new relationship of reconciliation and cooperation. Under this situation the attitude toward the joint declaration is a touchstone that shows who truly wants reunification or not.    \r\n\r\n"
