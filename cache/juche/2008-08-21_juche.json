            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman Assails U.S.-S. Korea Joint Military Exercises \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Wednesday as regards the DPRK-targeted joint military exercises being staged by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities launched Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises in all areas of south Korea on August 18.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises they launched under the pretext of \"coping with emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" are a clear proof of the hostile policy toward the DPRK and the north-south confrontational policy pursued by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities as they are war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. changed Ulji Focus Lens, the codename of the joint military exercises it staged every year from the middle of the 1970s, into Ulji Freedom Guardian this year in a bid to create impression that the exercises are \"led\" by the south Korean puppet army, \"supported\" by the U.S. forces.  This is to serve the purpose of the Korea strategy aimed at using south Korea as a shock brigade in invading the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by what the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities said when kicking off the exercises. They blustered that the exercises would help boost the level of the combat capability of the U.S. forces in south Korea and they would conclude the \"war maneuvers through a perfect operation to promptly react to someone's provocation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become clear that the \"contingency on the Korean Peninsula\" touted by the U.S. and its followers precisely means a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. This situation compels the DPRK to heighten vigilance against such unjust demands as the \"verification in line with the international standard\" recently claimed by the U.S. as regards the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase its war deterrent in every way as long as the U.S. and its followers continue posing military threats to it. It will judge all matters on the principle of giving top priority to the security of the country and actively take corresponding practical measures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, thus defending the socialist Korea with credit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung exerted great efforts to the establishment of air force right after the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paying primary attention to the building of the national armed forces along with the building of the Party and the state, he instructed officials to find competent aviation technicians one by one and put under strict control and arrange the airports and aerial equipments and facilities across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president, as the chairman of the Aviation Association of Korea, saw to it that an aviation course was set up in the Pyongyang Institute and the regular flying corps, the first air force in the history of the Korean nation, was founded on August 20, Juche 36 (1947). He wisely led the building and activity of the national air force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Air Force which was reorganized as the regular air force on February 8, 1948 rendered heroic military service by shooting down heavy bomber B-29s that the U.S. aggressors styled as \"air fortress\" with propeller aircraft during the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War. It made a great contribution to defending the country with triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the post-war period, too, it crushed the U.S. high-altitude reconnaissance plane EC-121 at one shot and discharged the internationalist duty with distinguished Juche-oriented air tactics, thus widely demonstrating the might of the heroic air force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Air Force of the KPA has grown in strength politically, ideologically and in military technique under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il only to display its might as the air citadel which firmly protects the socialist cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Pragmatism\" Touted by Lee Myung Bak Termed Confrontational Watchword \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- \"Pragmatism\" touted by traitor Lee Myung Bak is an anti-reunification watchword aimed at severing the blood ties of the nation, escalating the north-south confrontation and perpetuating the national division. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Pragmatism\" is an anti-reunification watchword aimed at turning the north-south relations into those between merchants as it is a replica of the treacherous theory of \"reciprocity.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To improve the inter-Korean relations and accomplish the cause of national reunification is a sacred patriotic cause which should be attained by placing the common interests of the nation above all irrespective of unilateral interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dealing with the issue of inter-Korean relations, taking profits or losses into consideration, does not suit the characteristics of the issue of the Korean nation and, therefore, this can never be a solution to the issue. If the north and the south hold a bargaining over the issue of the nation, the issue of reunification, like dealers, they will only spark off confrontation, much less achieving reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that insistence on \"pragmatism,\" a clear indication of moneygrubber Lee's narrow-minded way of thinking and philistine character, will only foster distrust and confrontation between fellow countrymen, far from helping improve the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee's loudmouthed \"pragmatism\" is nothing but a separatist theory intended to cover up the despicable true colors of his group keen on north-south confrontation and justify its anti-reunification moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief aim sought by Lee in touting \"pragmatism\" is to pursue confrontation, not reconciliation and cooperation between fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"drain on resources\" which the Lee group complained about is a deliberate provocative act to put a brake on the north-south cooperation undertakings that developed after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and bring the inter-Korean relations to collapse. The Lee group has gone so foolish as to describe any favor done to fellow countrymen as \"drain on resources,\" while betraying the national dignity and interests to serve their  U.S. and Japanese masters and leaving the vital rights of the south Koreans to their tender mercies without hesitation.  With nothing can the Lee group hide its true colors as the worst traitors in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality patently proves that what the group has talked about \"drain on resources\" and \"sentiment of people\" under the watchword of \"pragmatism\" is, in essence, nothing but sophism to cover up its true colors as confrontational maniacs keen to drive the north-south relations to collapse.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group should bear in mind that its persistent trumpeting about criminal \"pragmatism\" despite the unanimous denunciation of the whole nation would only lead to disgraceful destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
