And minor power stations are being extensively built in Jongphyong and Yonsan Counties and other areas where streams flow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts are being made to find out various kinds of energy resources and, at the same time, to broaden the renewable energy field from the economic, social and cultural sectors to dwelling houses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, scientists of the Central Heating Institute under the Ministry of City Management succeeded in developing the materials absorbing the solar heat with metal rich in the country and bio-methane is produced and introduced to rural dwelling houses in the Migok Co-operative Farm of Sariwon City and other areas of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wind-driven generators with different capacities are also made and applied so as to fully solve the electricity for home use in rural and mountainous areas. A work for effective use of low-calory and fly-ash coals is being pushed ahead in earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country is putting much effort in a scientific research work for raising the energy development to the advanced level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts are being made not only to conserve the energy resources to maximum but also to keep survey and tunneling ahead of other works for securing more coal fields in the coal mines throughout the country.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But this is an insult to genuine freedom and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Freedom and democracy\" much touted by the imperialists are sham ones and they are nothing but camouflage to hoodwink working masses and cover up the reactionary nature of bourgeois dictatorship and the unpopular nature of the capitalist system, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bourgeois freedom allows a handful of the privileged to exploit and dominate popular masses, absolute majority of population, and lead carnal life.  The Western-style \"democracy\" is the most reactionary and unpopular policy as it ruthlessly defies the desire and demand of the popular masses for freedom and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites practices of American-style \"democracy\" which the paid bourgeoisie trumpeters describe as \"model of freedom and democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists seek to force other countries and nations to follow and introduce the Western-style political mode and way of life. It is high-handed practices aimed to deprive the people of those countries and nations of their option for ideology and ism, and acts of denying and violating democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolhardy of the imperialists and their mouthpieces to try to cover up their unpopular and reactionary socio-political system and justify human rights abuses and crimes of aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If one allows and introduces the deceptive \"democracy,\" being taken in by the U.S. sugar-coated rhetoric, one cannot defend the hard-won revolutionary gains, the sovereignty of the country and the destiny of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All Koreans should focus the struggle for defending peace on the U.S. imperialists and wage a death-defying struggle against the U.S. and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics serves as a patriotic treasured sword of justice as it helps protect the peace of the country and security of the nation from aggression and war.

Such legal measures included \"law on state general mobilization,\" \"order for compulsory people's labour,\" \"revised order for compulsory people's labour,\" \"order for compulsory labour of all middle-aged men\" and \"order for the women volunteers corps labour.\" They thus forcibly drafted Koreans irrespective of occupation, age and sex, forcing them to do slave labor and hurling them into shambles of war. In this way they committed such crimes against humanity as cruelly massacring Koreans and leaving them disabled and sexually crippled. The Koreans who had been forcibly drafted by the Japanese imperialists at that time were found doing slavery labor wherever the Japanese imperialists perpetrated aggression--different parts of Korea, Japanese Islands, the South Sea Islands, Philippines and other places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists shut Koreans up in concentration camps, denying them even elementary freedom and rights and minimum conditions for labor.   Koreans were nothing but \"talking machines\" or \"toiling animals\" in service for the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An ex-intelligence officer of the Imperial Japanese Army stationed in the eastern region confessed that about 2,000 Korean draftees were forced to toil and moil in chains at the underground air-raid shelter of the Matsushiro general headquarters which had been under construction in top secret from April 1945 till the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to data available, more than 60,000 Koreans lost their lives in coal mines of Japan in the period from 1940 to 1944. Under the pretext of \"keeping military secret,\" the Japanese imperialists massacred 5,000 Koreans in Kuril Islands and 2,500 Koreans in Urup Island. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many parts of Japan seem to shake still today with the towering grudge and anger of the great many Korean draftees who died in the alien land, subject to indescribable national humiliation and hardships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better stop playing clumsy sleight of hand to cover up the crimes committed against the Korean people in the past and settle them as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
