He highly estimated the shining successes made by the workers there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having the Rakwon Machine Complex and other machine-building  bases which have been put on a high level of CNC basis, we can manufacture any large-size machines if we have a will, he said, adding that  this stirring reality eloquently proves that the Juche-oriented machine-building  industry of the DPRK has proudly attained the world level of the latest science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the great achievement that the complex laid a firm technological foundation for bringing the hydraulic technology to the world level in a brief span of time, he noted, calling on the people to push back the frontiers of latest science as required by the age of knowledge-based economy when carrying out technological updating just as it was done by the complex. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVery pleased that the workers of the complex have brought about eye-opening miracles and innovations in their worthwhile drive to achieve the prosperity of the country and improve the standard of people's living, he repeatedly appreciated their efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the complex has done a lot of work in recent years, he urged the complex to bring about uninterrupted innovations and advances in the same spirit as displayed by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the officials of the complex to steadily raise the level of their guidance to production so as to minutely manage and operate the complex on the principle of profitability and, at the same time, pay deep attention to the supply service for its workers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He once again set the goal to be attained by the complex in the near future and specified tasks and ways to do so. He showed such great benevolence as unraveling knotty problems. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  On the same day he went round a newly built football stadium in the province. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Looking round the exterior and interior of the stadium built in a peculiar style at the picturesque foot of a mountain, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that it was successfully built as required by the new century. He extended high appreciation and deep thanks to the members of the young shock brigade of the province for building such stadium of eternal value. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need for service persons to widely use the stadium to train their physical bodies, he set forth tasks to be fulfilled to manage and operate it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Phyong Hae, chief secretary of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui and Thae Jong Su, department directors, and Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

It also further raised the international authority and prestige of the country despite complicated world situation and extraordinarily boosted the international solidarity with the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il is a great symbol of the ever-victorious WPK and the destiny of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will consolidate in every way the military base of the country the core of which is the KPA by steadily giving priority to implementing the line of Songun revolution of the party in the future, too, and provide a firm military guarantee for the building of a thriving socialist nation and accomplishment of the cause of national reunification and the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean group of traitors is now getting frantic with its unprecedented conspiratorial moves to escalate confrontation with the DPRK after orchestrating the case of sinking of a warship of the puppet army in collusion with the U.S. imperialists. This has pushed the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse and created such tense situation on the Korean Peninsula that a war may break out right now. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the puppet group of traitors finally ignite a war despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, all its servicepersons and people, their hearts burning with towering resentment and hatred, will courageously turn out in the just struggle to defend the country and deal merciless blows at any act for \"punishment\" and \"retaliation\" and \"sanctions\" encroaching upon its state interests, eradicate the root cause of aggression and war and surely build a reunified thriving nation on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will strengthen unity and solidarity with the progressives in the world, holding high the banner of independence, peace and friendship in the future, too, develop relations with those countries friendly to the DPRK and wage a dynamic struggle for stability on the Peninsula and global peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having Kim Jong Il at the highest post of the WPK, it will always make victorious advance as a party of the President and a force steering the Songun revolutionary cause and its future will always be in safe hands, the reporter concluded."

            "content": "\"Cheonan\" Case Dismissed as Charade\r\n Pyongyang, June 18 (KCNA) -- Foreign media are bringing the truth about the sinking of warship \"Cheonan\" into bolder relief, dismissing it as a conspiratorial farce and charade orchestrated by the United States and the south Korean group of traitors to ridicule the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese Asia-Pacific newspaper posted on Internet an article titled \"Who sank warship 'Cheonan'\" on May 24. It said that there happened strange sinking of a submarine near the waters where \"Cheonan\" sank almost at the same time, noting that the United States and south Korea are busy to keep the sub case into oblivion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the reason the U.S. is linking the case of \"Cheonan\" with the DPRK, the article said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is in fear of having the trumps it is holding in settling the issue on the Korean Peninsula being taken away following the 2012 transfer of the \"right to command the wartime operations\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. munitions enterprises do not want to see the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea leading to the loss of the U.S. supremacy over East Asia but seek to create favorable atmosphere for launching a new war in Korea by taking the advantage of the case of \"Cheonan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent farce, by all accounts, is aimed to deteriorate the inter-Korean relations and keep the U.S. armed forces in south Korea for an indefinite period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Russian History Prospect Fund in commentaries posted on Internet on May 31 and June 1 made concrete analysis and estimation of the falsity of \"material evidence\" presented by the south Korean authorities and impossibility of the \"torpedo attack by the DPRK\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 1 the Russian Internet News Pravaya quoting a U.S. journalist said that the case of \"Cheonan\" sinking was a sheer charade orchestrated by the United States. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The French Internet paper Asia Times in its commentary on June 2 noted that the aim sought by Lee Myung Bak through the case of \"Cheonan\" sinking was to win \"perfect partnership\" with the U.S. and use the UN Security Council as a platform for discussing the Korean issue instead of the six-way talks. It also sought to use the case for arousing public interest in his \"government\" ahead of the \"elections to local self-governing bodies\" and, furthermore, create \"security crisis\" and thus secure a pretext of arms buildup and boost \"strategic alliance\" with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 5 the paper also carried an article dedicated by a U.S. correspondent in Seoul. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said that the conspiratorial nature of the case of \"Cheonan\" sinking is being brought to light with each passing day, proving it to be a farce orchestrated by the south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The majority south Korean people dismiss the \"conclusion\" drawn by the \"investigation team\" as a sheer lie, considering it as part of Lee Myung Bak's hostile policy toward the DPRK, not a case which was caused by a \"torpedo attack\" by it, the article noted, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is also a suspicion that the members of the \"investigation team\" were ordered to keep mum about the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also problematic is why \"Cheonan\" sank at a time when the U.S. and south Korean forces were staging joint military exercises."
