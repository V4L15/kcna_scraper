This clearly shows its arrogant and impudent nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves the validity of the DPRK's army-first policy and the line of attaching importance to the military affairs whereby it has augmented its defence power in confrontation with the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are well advised to drop their foolish calculation that they may go scotfree while sacrificing others under the mask of \"missile shield\" and get rid of their reckless missile hysteria.    \r\n\r\n"
