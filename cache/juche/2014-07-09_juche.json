As many as 26,000 people fall victim to those mines every year. 83 percent of them are said to be civilians. Thrown into a tight corner by the international community's criticism, the U.S. declared that it would prohibit the use of all mines till 2010. But it said it would except the peninsula under the south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defense treaty\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the victims of those mines is on the steady increase in south Korea as it is outside the convention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huge U.S. forces are deployed in south Korea, Japan and other parts of Asia-Pacific. U.S. strategic nuclear striking means including nukes are massed there, and taskforce units are deployed there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. aggressor forces in south Korea have recently been reinforced sharply.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the U.S. forces in south Korea has increased as many as 11,000 as compared with September 2009, according to the \"2012 report on the military base structure\" released by the U.S. Defense Department.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ultra-modern military hardware as new type heavy tanks M1-A2 Abrams, MRAPs and F-16s were additionally deployed in the U.S. forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such massive reinforcement of the U.S. forces in south Korea further escalates the tensions in the region and sparks the arms race and increases the danger of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If peace is to settle on the peninsula, the U.S. must pull out of south Korea at once, taking with it all its military personnel and destructive military hardware."
