            "content": "Bulgarian Political Figure Hails Seventh Congress of WPK\r\n Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- Atanas Ivanov, honorary chairman of the Bulgarian Communists Union, made public a statement \"World looks up to socialist Korea as beacon of hope\" on May 16 to hail the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK).\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said the former Soviet Union and east European socialist countries collapsed and hypocritical politicians took powers and took the lead in restoring capitalism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The banner of socialism was lowered in Bulgaria, too, and it took the road of capitalism and could not but undergo a political upheaval, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the DPRK has invariably upheld the banner of socialism and steadily advanced along the path of socialism with its own independent political line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What I would like to emphasize in particular is that young leader Kim Jong Un is confidently advancing the building of a thriving socialist nation with nuclear treasured sword of justice despite all the moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK, true to the noble intention of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Seventh Congress of the WPK was the historic event which demonstrated to the world the steadfast will of the WPK to accomplish the cause of the Juche revolution down through generations under the uplifted banner of socialism."

            "content": "Direccion Nortena de Jonminthukwi condena preparativos de guerra bioquimica de EE.UU. y Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 22 de mayo (ACNC) -- Recientemente se ha revelado el hecho de que Estados Unidos desarrolla el ensayo de virus Zika en la base militar norteamericana en Ryongsan del Sur de Corea, lo cual causa gran indignacion de todos los estratos surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, se dio a conocer que el Departamento de Defensa definio el muelle 8 del puerto de Pusan como centro de reserva para la aplicacion del \"plan Jupiter\" destinado a elevar la capacidad de guerra bioquimica. En el Sur de Corea ya existen similares bases militares norteamericanas en Ryongsan de Seul, Osan de la provincia de Kyonggi y en Kunsan de la provincia de Jolla del Norte. Esta noticia desagradable provoca las protestas y condenas mas criticas de todos los habitantes surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas intentan encubrir sus crimenes y evadir la condena de la opinion publica del interior y el exterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz de la Direccion Nortena del Jonminthukwi (Comite Pannacional de Averiguacion Especial para Esclarecer Verdaderos Aspectos de Crimenes de Tropas Norteamericanas) publico el dia 21 una declaracion senalando que con tales sofismas pueriles y cobardes, EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas nunca pueden encubrir sus maniobras criminales, y condenando esa artimana de EE.UU. en nombre de toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien en el ano pasado, EE.UU. introdujo los bacilos de antracosis vivientes en las bases militares norteamericanas del Sur de Corea y realizo la prueba de armas bacteriologicas. Y dijo descaradamente que \"los introdujo solo una vez\" y excuso como \"error simple\" aunque en realidad los habia introducido en 16 ocasiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo de males, se ha revelado el hecho criminal de que el imperio norteamericano hizo los preparativos de guerra bacteriologica introduciendo en el Sur de Corea hasta la Yersinia Pestis (bacilo de peste) y la bacteria botulinus.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa esta conocida la verdad de que despues de la guerra coreana, EE.UU. instalo en sus bases militares y otras localidades del Sur de Corea los institutos de bacterias de diferentes generos y trato a los habitantes surcoreanos como objeto de la prueba de armas biologicas que transmiten las enfermedades contagiosas de alta mortalidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos testimonian claramente que los imperialistas norteamericanos son la pandilla de salvajes que convirtieron el Sur de Corea en el infierno para exterminar a la nacion coreana, y la horda de asesinos que se dedican con frenesi a los preparativos de guerra bioquimica sin hacer caso de la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tragedia esta en que el imperio continua cometiendo sin vacilacion tales pruebas antieticas solo en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nacion coreana no puede vivir tranquila si deja a los asesinos norteamericanos, que trazan las artimanas para la guerra nuclear y la bioquimica contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, y a los traidores proyanquis que obedecen a ciegas a su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los habitantes surcoreanos deberan levantarse como un solo hombre en la lucha por frustrar las maniobras criminales de los imperialistas yanquis y sus lacayos tendentes a convertir el sagrado territorio patrio en la ruina catastrofica de la guerra nuclear y la biologica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben reflexionar en serio sobre las consecuencias catastroficas que se emanen de sus imprudentes artimanas criminales y abolirlas de inmediato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la nacion coreana frustrara categoricamente los preparativos de guerra bioquimica de los yanquis y sus lacayos."
