Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 21 (KCNA) -- Various citizens and public organizations and personages in South Korea are becoming bitterly critical of the Japanese prime minister, charging that he once again made mockery of Koreans with word jugglery without honestly redressing Japan's past, when he merely uttered the word \"apology,\" \"expressing sympathy to Koreans' sufferings\" on Oct. 15 during his junket to South Korea, according to the newspaper Hangyore.\r\n Upon hearing this news the headquarters of the movement for correcting the distortion of Japanese history textbooks released an urgent commentary in which it noted that \"Koizumi once again uttered only customary glossy words of apology and Koreans cannot trust him unless he puts those words of apology into specific practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director of the council of measures for the issue of the \"volunteers corps\" said that in view of the Japanese government's behavior and attitude, his \"apology\" is very likely to end in a wordplay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Society for the Study of Tok Islet in a statement dismissed his remarks as a deceptive political farce. It urged the South Korean government to drop its humiliating diplomacy toward Japan and conduct strong independent diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, over 100 citizens and public organizations including the \"national people's solidarity for national independence, democracy and people's right to existence,\" the council of measures for the issue of the \"volunteers corps\" and the headquarters of the movement for correcting the distortion of Japanese history textbooks staged rallies and demonstrations in more than ten places in Seoul protesting Koizumi's South Korea junket.     \r\n\r\n"

This is an intolerable challenge to world progressive humankind and unprecedented gangsterim and an anachronistic rash act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent incident helped the world realize once again what extent the Japanese reactionaries' moves to turn Japan rightist and fascist have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and other progressive people of the world will never pardon the Japanese reactionaries challenging the just cause of the era for independence. \r\n The Japanese authorities should severely punish those responsible for the incident and honestly apologize to the Korean people and the world's progressives for it.     \r\n\r\n"

Under this situation the U.S. has newly forward-deployed its air task force and military hardware in South Korea allegedly to \"fill up a military vacuum,\" badly getting on the nerves of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such reinforcement is not for filling up any \"vacuum\" but intended to attain the u.s. sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK repeatedly clarified its principled stand to oppose all forms of terrorism as regards the recent terrorist attacks on the u.s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is additionally deploying its combat forces in South Korea under the pretext of \"military vacuum\" to aggravate the tense situation, not squarely seeing the nature of the situation and the reality. This is an undisguised revelation of its unchanged design to dominate the Korean peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' \"military vacuum\" theory and arms buildup can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will cement its revolutionary position in every way to actively cope with any situation and sharply watch the developments in full combat readiness.    \r\n\r\n"
