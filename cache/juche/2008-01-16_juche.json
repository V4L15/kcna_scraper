He joined the Korean People's Army during the Fatherland Liberation War. His illness forced him to remain in an enemy-controlled area during the period of the KPA's strategic temporary retreat. He was arrested by the enemy while fighting as a Jirisan guerilla. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He remained true to his revolutionary faith as a member of the Workers' Party of Korea despite brutal torture and operation to force conversion on him behind bars for several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After coming into the care of the DPRK 8 years ago, he devoted his energy and wisdom to building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and achieving the cause of national reunification till the moment his heart stopped beating.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a trend of the times and history that can never be checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Koreans there are the most just and realistic line and policy on national reunification and the June 15 joint declaration, a reunification programme common to the nation, and the October 4 declaration, an embodiment of the former declaration. All Koreans are filled with the unshakable will to implement the October 4 declaration to the letter under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" and the national unity is getting consolidated in the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should bring early the day of national reunification by dynamically struggling full of firm confidence and optimism under the slogan \"Open up a new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity by pooling the efforts of our nation!\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Monroe Doctrine advocated by the U.S. till now has been completely abandoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Movements have become brisk in the Latin-American region once called \"tranquil backyard\" to establish the relations of diversified political and economic cooperation with various countries in line with the worldwide trend of multi-polarization, free from the sphere of U.S. unchallenged domination. This has brought the trend towards independence and socialism against the U.S. to spotlight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is noteworthy is the fact that it is not the Latin-American region only where the U.S. influence is sinking. The world public is unanimous in the view that the U.S. is gradually losing its \"unchallenged authority\" and \"influence\" in the international arena at the hands of its rivals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. worked hard to seek a way of demonstrating its strength and dominating the world by beefing up its military muscle. But it is a stark reality that its strength is steadily waning and its influence gradually dwindling in the international arena quite contrary to its will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can rule the world with a stick. The stick policy enforced by the U.S. more desperately would only trigger off the stronger resistance of the international community against it and stoke anti-Americanism worldwide, throwing it into a deeper political quagmire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as a pikestaff that the \"U.S. century\" is bound to come to an end due to its military arbitrary actions just as violence and tyranny drove so powerful ancient Roman Empire into the abyss of ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
