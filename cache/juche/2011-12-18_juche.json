            "content": "Pomminryon Issues Joint Resolution\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- The north, south and overseas headquarters of the Pan-National Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon) issued the following joint resolution on Sunday on the 21st anniversary of its formation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToday we significantly greet the 21st anniversary of the formation of Pomminryon, keeping deep in mind the cherished desire of all Koreans to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country as early as possible by national independence and great unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe formation of Pomminryon was a historic event as it helped the forces for national independence at home and abroad unite and set out on the unified patriotic movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBy its formation the Koreans' movement for national reunification developed into a permanent three-way organized joint movement and the Korean nation has been able to work and struggle jointly while ensuring solid unity under the banner of the Three Charters for National Reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks to the three-way solidarity of Pomminryon and the banner of \"By our nation itself\" in the June 15 era, All-Korean Committee for Implementation of June 15 Joint Declaration could be formed and the reunification movement could turn into a nation-wide movement involving people from all walks of life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the spirit of reconciliation and unity ran higher and the whole land of Korea was replete with patriotic emotion and will for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut, no sooner had the Lee Myung Bak anti-reunification forces come to power than they totally denied the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. And they advocated \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\", \"unification by absorption under liberal democratic system\", \"May 24 measures\", \"new establishment of tax for unification\", etc., in a desperate efforts to turn the north-south relations advancing toward peace and unity back to the state of severance and confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven they cooked up the case of sunken \"Cheonan\" warship during the Foal Eagle joint military exercises aimed at preemptive attack on the north in collusion with the imperialist warlike forces. Then they sparked off the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, driving the situation of the Korean Peninsular to the brink of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey totally banned visits, meetings for reunification and activities for national unity between people of different strata in the north and the south, which had been conducted legitimately in the June 15 era, and stopped all the north-south cooperation programs including tour of Mt. Kumgang, Mt. Paektu and historical relics in Kaesong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the anti-reunification security authorities have suppressed at random the just struggle of Pomminryon and other progressive and patriotic organizations for national reconciliation, peace and independent reunification, branding them as \"enemy benefiting\" on charges of \"receipt of instructions\" and \"infiltration and escape\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe cannot but bitterly denounce this as a heinous treacherous crime to gag the overwhelming majority of popular masses desiring the implementation of the historic north-south joint declarations, bind them hand and foot and revive the Cold War era and ensure the stay in power of the separatist treacherous forces at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration are the landmark for national reunification and guide common to the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will push ahead with the cause of building a prosperous and powerful, independent reunified country in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" as we have paved the road for reunification despite harsh trials and difficulties in the way of the grand march for national independent reunification over the past 21 years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuppression invites struggle and victory is in store for the struggle for morrow of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north, south and overseas headquarters of Pomminryon will support and promote the devoted efforts of the people from all walks of life for implementing the north-south joint declarations. We resolve as follows, with the steadfast and unanimous will to carry out the important task for building up the driving forces of the nation invariably under the banner of the Three Charters for National Reunification; \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. We will strictly preserve and implement the historic inter-Korean declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImplementation of the declarations ensures the rosy future of national reunification, and it represents genuine patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to thoroughly defend and implement the declarations, it is unavoidable to struggle against the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad obstructive to this movement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe, as befitting Pomminryon, invincible vanguard for reunification, will invariably take the lead in holding higher the banner of \"By our nation itself\" and firmly defending and enlarging the shining achievements made for national independence and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.  We will fully display the fighting spirit of Pomminryon to further strengthen the will of Koreans to open the gate to reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo prevent visits and contacts between people of different strata and antagonize fellow countrymen will  spark confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to open the gate to reunification, Pomminryon will conduct stubborn activities to pull down all barriers of confrontation including the \"May 24 measures\" and achieve the national reconciliation and reunification and, with the indomitable fighting spirit, resolutely stand against the security forces' anachronistic oppression being perpetrated by dint of the \"National Security Law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn particular it will take strong counteractions to hold in check such war and confrontation moves as the joint military exercises with the outside forces and arms buildup being intensified day by day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We will resolutely adhere to the tripartite solidarity and further strengthen the unity of the patriotic forces for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe solidarity of Koreans in the north and the south and overseas is the lifeline of the reunification movement and the solidarity and unity of all patriotic pro-reunification forces is a treasured sword for victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPomminryon will hold a tripartite solidarity rally together with all political parties, organizations and personages at home and abroad with August 15 as an occasion starting in 2012 to further promote the nation-wide reunification movement and thus stand in the van of the struggle to open the gate to reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe will always put main stress on the viewpoint and attitude toward the north-south joint declarations in realizing the wide-range solidarity and unity and ensure cooperation for respect and unity, not for rejection and competition so that everyone can play the role of the true master of the tripartite solidarity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. We will further expand Pomminryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2012 is a year which will witness miracle and great change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe old should be removed and a fresh trend should appear to bring the future of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe are sure that the \"meeting for marking the 21st formation anniversary of Pomminryon and vowing to win in the two elections in 2012\", held in the south today, will further strengthen the unity of the progressive forces and the solidarity and alliance of the patriotic forces aspiring reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe two elections, presidential and parliamentary elections to be held in south Korea, will be an important turning point in legitimating the reunification movement and bringing earlier the reunification under the June 15 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPomminryon, as an engine for great national unity and the vanguard in the movement for national independent reunification, will devotedly work hard to let the people desirous of independence and progressive reforms win in those two elections to be held in the south next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rosy future will be brought by unity, and when one stands in the van of struggle, the masses will follow one with trust and hope.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet all of us turn out in the plaza of struggle in the June 15 era for the victory of independent reunification with the indomitable mental power and ardent patriotic zeal by inheriting the historic resolution and spirit of the day when Pomminryon was formed and the glorious traditions of struggle established over the past 21 years."

So the work to confirm the facts is reportedly under way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this regard the government started negotiations in secrecy while making haste with report on them to the IAEA in a bid to avoid the accusations of the international community, the paper said."
