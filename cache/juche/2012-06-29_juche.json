All brass hats of the units deployed in the areas along the 38th Parallel above divisional commanders took part in a \"ball\" held at a club of the puppet ground force in Seoul on that evening.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut Ri Song Ga, commander of the 8th Division of the south Korean army deployed in the eastern sector of the front at that time, testified to the fact that all the puppet forces in the area along the 38th Parallel were on combat alert after being ordered not to leave their barracks on the eve of June 25 and launched an attack at dawn.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith nothing can the U.S. cover its true colors as a war provocateur. It can never escape a severe punishment by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is instigating the south Korean puppet forces and the Japanese reactionaries to ignite the second Korean war, a nuclear war, instead of drawing a due lesson from its bitter defeat in the last Korean war,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the belligerent forces of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces dare provoke another war, oblivious of the lesson taught by history, they will face a strong counter-action of the army and people of the DPRK and meet a miserable end.

Korea as Arch Criminal Escalating Tension on Korean Peninsula\r\n Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Friday runs an article \"Who is the provoker escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula\" by its commentator. The following is its full text: \n\t\t\t\t\t The situation of the Korean Peninsula is arousing great concern at home and abroad these days. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless moves of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group are driving the inter-Korean relations into a more serious catastrophe and escalating the military tension as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Large and dangerous war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK are being staged in the West Sea of Korea and the waters off Jeju Island with the U.S. nuclear-powered carrier George Washington involved. The nexus for aggression is being tightened among the U.S., Japan and south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Undisguised international confabs take place to insult and violate the dignity, sovereignty and legitimate rights of the DPRK and the campaign for \"sanctions\" and threat have reached a grave phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these moves for confrontation and war driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war are staged under the absurd pretext of \"provocations from the north\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean authorities are hell bent on the anti-DPRK confrontation moves and plot-breeding operations, branding the DPRK's access to nukes, launch of satellites for peaceful purposes and counter-measures against their war moves as \"provocations\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Who is the real provoker aggravating the tension on the peninsula and where is the root cause of straining the situation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of course, it is the trite method of the imperialists to invade other country after branding it as provoker. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical examples of it were the last Korean War and the Vietnamese War, both ignited by the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its trumpeting about \"provocations from the north\" is part of these war moves for aggression and a product of its persistent anti-DPRK campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue is the matter over which the U.S. and south Korea pull up the DPRK, citing it as a \"provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are much upset by the fact that the DPRK declared itself as a nuclear weapons state and codified it in its Constitution. They are making much fuss, labeling the exercise of its legitimate right to nuclear development as \"a provocation\" in every case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a brazen-faced provocation as it amounts to falsifying facts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has consistently advocated the denuclearization of the peninsula. Then why did it have access to nuclear weapons?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Where does a nuclear threat come from and who is threatening whom?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the last Korean War the U.S. imperialists took a large number of people in the north to south Korea through A-bomb scare, causing a great national tragedy of \"10 million separated family members\".  The Korean people still clearly remember this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which introduced nukes into south Korea first and turned it into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the world. It is again the U.S. which has been hell bent on the nuclear war exercises for several decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It openly cried out for \"a preemptive nuclear attack\" on the DPRK and disclosed its sinister scenario for nuclear attack, releasing \"nuclear posture review\" and talking about \"extended nuclear deterrence\". The U.S. worked out operation plans related to the scenario and frantically stepped up the moves for a nuclear war, staging war exercises under the simulated conditions of an actual war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the demise of the era of the Cold War, nuclear powers decided to reduce nukes and refrain from leveling them at each other. But, the U.S. more desperately brandished its nuclear stick against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For how long the DPRK has to remain exposed to the nuclear threat of the U.S.?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the U.S. lent an ear to the earnest call of the DPRK for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula even a bit, the nuclear issue at present would have not surfaced. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous for the U.S., the chieftain of nuclear threat and nuclear superpower, to vociferate about \"nuclear threat from the north.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime has neither justification nor qualification to pull up the DPRK over its nuclear deterrence as it offered south Korea as an advanced nuclear base of the U.S. and has faithfully served the U.S.  as a servant and shock brigade in the U.S. master's nuclear war moves. It should be punished by the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The satellite launch is another issue over which the U.S. and the south Korean authorities pull up the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They persistently termed the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes long-range missile launch. They are raising a hue and cry over \"provocations,\" citing the nuclear issue and the satellite launch as pretexts for derailing the DPRK-U.S. negotiations and six-party talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another shameless provocation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Space development is a right recognized by international law and, accordingly, various countries are launching satellites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To insist that only the DPRK should not be allowed to launch satellites is brigandish sophism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before launching satellites, the DPRK strictly observed the relevant international law and took such a measure as an exception as inviting foreign experts and reporters to visit the satellite launch station, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purpose was objectively confirmed, making it hard for them to find any excuse to find fault with it, they claimed that even if what the DPRK is supposed to launch  is a satellite, it should not be allowed to do so because ballistic missile technology is applied to the launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What a far-fetched assertion it is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to their logic, Japan's satellite launch was aimed at ballistic missile development and the satellite the south Korean puppet forces are so anxious to put into space with the help of the third country despite repeated failures is also aimed at missile development, and they all should be called into question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, it is illogical for the U.S. to loudly talk about \"missile threats\" from the DPRK even though it launches dozens of satellites every year and frequently carries out up-to-date missile test-fire and interceptor missile tests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet group are calling the countermeasures taken by the DPRK to cope with their provocations \"provocations\" and \"threats\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is sheer sophism and a grave provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. and south Korea which stage hundreds of anti-DPRK war drills including Key Resolve, Ulji Freedom Guardian and Foal Eagle, firing at the flag of the DPRK and fanning up war atmosphere crying out for \"occupation of Pyongyang\" and \"strike at the window of office\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also openly disclosed their attempt at confrontation between social systems and conducted frantic anti-DPRK psychological campaign as evidenced by scattering of leaflets and \"anti-DPRK broadcasting\" with the use of even human scum, while citing \"emergency situation\" and \"unification under the liberal democratic system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They provoke the DPRK first and when the DPRK takes countermeasures, they call them \"provocations\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is universally known that the warship sinking case orchestrated by the puppet forces of south Korea and Yonphyong Island shelling preempted by them in 2010 only backfired.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet group blame the deteriorated north-south ties and the tensions mounting on the Korean Peninsula on \"Cheonan\" sinking and Yonphyong shelling but this is just a trick to cover up their crime and shift the responsibility on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deteriorated ties and rising tensions date back to the time when Lee Myung Bak ditched north-south joint declarations and declared an all-out confrontation with the DPRK as his north policy after taking office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Challenging the DPRK's sincere efforts for the improvement of the north-south ties, the Lee Myung Bak group brought to collapse all dialogues and cooperation between the two sides and slandered the social system of the DPRK and even the dignity of its supreme leadership by making all kinds of provocations, thus plunging the ties into an uncontrollable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that had the north-south joint declaration been implemented it would have helped improve the inter-Korean relations, the West Sea of Korea turned into the sea of peace and such horrible incidents not happened. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is the most heinous and thrice-cursed provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They committed the incident of targeting the supreme leadership in drilling grounds of the puppet army and reserve troops, touching off bitter anger of the army and people of the DPRK and astonishing the world. The incident of insulting photos of peerlessly great persons and slogans about them, the evil doings done during the nation's mourning over the great loss to the nation and smear campaign of slandering the political events of the DPRK are all heinous crimes against humanity unimaginable by human being and the most hideous provocation unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group, obsessed with escalating confrontation, took issue with the non-existent \"human rights\" issue and found fault with the economy and the living of the people in the DPRK. They even defamed the pure feelings and sincere tears the people and children shed mourning the death of their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There cannot be more vicious provocation than this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has made desperate efforts to apply sanctions against the DPRK and isolate, seal off and stifle it by abusing the UN name while carrying a dagger under the coat. The Lee Myung Bak group is rebuffed by the public for its unpopular rule and deterioration of people's living. It is very despicable provocation to talk about \"human rights\" in the DPRK and \"people's living\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. tops the world's list of military expenditure and the puppet group of south Korea pours money collected from people as taxes into war preparations. They have no qualification to talk about \"expenditure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the Lee group's moves for a war of aggression compelled the DPRK to direct its efforts to the building of national defense. But they are taking issue with its economy, people's living, \"human rights\" and even \"expenditure\". This betrays their black-hearted intentions and provocative nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t American-style capitalist society and corrupt society in south Korea, a colony of the U.S., can be heaven to 1 % of population but they are hell to 99%. But in Korean-style socialist society centered on the popular masses, people form a big harmonious family, helping and leading each other forward as masters of the country and enjoying free medical care and free education. Which society is more advantageous?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The answer of the DPRK people is clear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As we have already increased defence capabilities in every way, we can lead a happy life under socialism with no more to desire in the world if we reach the high peak of an economic power in the wake of a political and military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the people in the DPRK have now turned out in the general charge for final victory full of confidence to bring the day earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those obsessed with the law of the jungle, individualism and the idea that money is everything can never understand why the Korean people value their social system so much and protect it at the cost of their lives, regarding it their greatest happiness to live under it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To slander the Korean people this or that way is a mockery and insult to their unblemished thoughts and feelings and an unpardonable provocation to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that it is the U.S. and the puppet group of south Korea that escalate confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear are the aims sought by the U.S. and the puppet group in raising a hue and cry over \"provocations from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their smear campaign is to tarnish the DPRK's prestige and ward off its influence, much upset by an invincible might of the DPRK shedding its rays all over the world and winning victory day after day as a just mouthpiece, guardian of peace and a socialist stronghold under the uplifted banner of Songun, led by the outstanding and tested leader, the dear respected Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also aimed to pass the buck for the bedeviled inter-Korean relations and escalated tension on the Korean Peninsula to the DPRK and justify their confrontation and war moves in a bid to realize their wild ambition to invade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind their trumpeting about \"provocations from the north\" is a black-hearted intention to chill the daily growing desire to achieve reunification through alliance with the north, destabilize it, break its single-minded unity and bar Koreans from achieving reunification through their concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, the U.S. instigated the puppet group to orchestrate shocking incidents whenever the desire for reconciliation, unity and reunification mounted between the north and the south and desperately blocked them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ignited the Korean War on June 25, 1950 to bar the north and the south from moving toward national reunification and put the whole of Korea under its control. It hurled the Park Chung-Hee's military hooligan into staging the May 16 military coup. When the desire to achieve reunification through alliance with the north grew stronger under the slogan \"Let us go to north, come south, let us meet at Panmunjom,\" the U.S. drove him into dashing it in a sinister bid to perpetuate the nation's division and keep south Korea as its permanent colony. This is not secret.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1970s when the July 4 joint declaration was adopted, the U.S. chilled the south Koreans' desire by establishing the \"yusin\" dictatorial system and intensifying the moves for a war against the north. In the 1980s and the 1990s when multi-faceted dialogues took place and the road was paved for exchange and cooperation, it got frantic with nuclear war racket against the DPRK including the \"Team Spirit\" Joint Military Exercise, putting a check bar on them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The decisive turning point for reunification was brought about on the Korean Peninsula with the publication of the June 15 joint declaration as a momentum. Much upset by this, the U.S. set up the Lee Myung Bak conservative regime and let it rapidly push the inter-Korean relations to collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is just a root cause that drove the inter-Korean ties to a catastrophic phase and deteriorated the situation on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. arrogance, high-handedness and arbitrariness have reached the extreme pitch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conniving at all the illegal actions of those countries obedient to it, the U.S. seeks hard to stifle those independent countries branding their legitimate rights and just assertions as illegal and styling itself \"international military policeman\" and \"world judge\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it feels the need of the UN in carrying out its policy for aggression, it abuses the name of the UN, and if not, it disregards the UN and international law and invades other countries at will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the tragic situation of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are so many countries and nations in the world that fell victim to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the joint declaration was published, the UN fully hailed it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, however, failed to make any statement denouncing the action of the U.S. and the south Korean puppets when they ditched the June 15 joint declaration but sided with their moves for confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, indeed, a deplorable situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an abnormal situation should no longer be allowed to remain intact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will as ever make strenuous efforts in a responsible manner for detente and peace on the peninsula as it did in the past. But if the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group take provocative actions, taking issue with the DPRK without any ground, the DPRK will show no mercy but decisively smash their actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The impartial world media and progressives and south Koreans from all walks of life should properly see who is a provocateur in the peninsula in order to flatly reject the \"theory of the provocation by the north\" much touted by the U.S. and the south Korean forces and raise the voices of support and solidarity for the just cause of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north and the south of Korea will frustrate the criminal \"theory of provocation by the north\" spread by the U.S. and the south Korean puppets group, wipe out the enemies of reunification to the last man on the peninsula and bring about the June 15 era of reunification again without fail by concerted efforts of the Koreans."

It has neither validity nor justification to exist. \n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Friday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the calculation of the U.S. imperialists that if they occupy the Korean Peninsula, they can advance into the continent with the peninsula as a springboard and, furthermore, dominate the world. They set it as their strategy to swallow up Korea replacing the Japanese imperialists at a time when the Second World War was close to its end, and rolled up their sleeves to carry it out, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs it became clear that the U.S. imperialists could not occupy Korea single-handed in face of a rapid speed of attack of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and the Soviet Army which declared a war against Japan, they hatched a plot to find a substantial solution to the issue of occupying south Korea. That was the \"line for sharing duties\" to accept the surrender of troops of the Imperial Japanese Army and disarm them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis proposal was put in a document as \"General Order\" No. 1 soon to be notified to the allied states on August 13, 1945. It was conveyed to MacArthur in Manila on August 15 before being proclaimed on September 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe cunning U.S. imperialists used this document for carrying out their strategy for permanently occupying south Korea and turning it into a colony in a bid to dominate the world. They set this line as the cursed demarcation line which imposed the tragedy of division upon the Korean people. The U.S.-made 38th parallel MDL caused the tragic division of Korea, not a defeated nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists put south Korea, not a territory of an enemy state, under military occupation and enforced military administration under the pretext of \"disarming\" troops of the Imperial Japanese Army. These were illegal and high-handed actions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe history since the fabrication of the 38th parallel MDL goes to prove before the whole world that the U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy of the Korean nation as they imposed only division and war on it."
