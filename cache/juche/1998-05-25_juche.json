This is the greatest achievement made by Chongryon and compatriots in Japan.\r\n   Since its formation, Chongryon has developed into an invincible,  patriotic  organization of loyal subjects and become a model of the world movement of overseas compatriots, breaking through manifold difficulties and trials. This is a precious fruition of the outstanding guidance and utmost care of the general, who is exalting the leadership feats of the President.\r\n   Pointing to the tasks facing Chongryon officials and compatriots in Japan today when the movement of Koreans in Japan is entering a new stage of its development, the article continues:\r\n   Chongryon should further strengthen itself into a  patriotic organisation of Juche unfailingly loyal to the General.\r\n   Remaining loyal to him is the way of upholding the President as the sun of Juche forever, further strengthening Chongryon, defending the national rights and interest of compatriots and glorifying their dignity.\r\n   Chongryon should model itself on the Juche idea and prepare all the officials and compatriots to be ardent patriots of Juche type with absolute trust in and worship for the General in keeping with the developments.\r\n   Chongryon officials and compatriots should bring about a new turn in all the patriotic work for preserving the Juche character and the national character  in the movement of Koreans in Japan, defending their national rights to democracy  and interest and  contributing to the prosperity and development of the socialist homeland and the reunification of the country, with a great national pride of being overseas citizens of the homeland of Juche.\r\n   The patriotic cause of Chongryon is just, and there is no force to block the road of Chongryon and compatriots in Japan advancing under the guidance of the General.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"
