They are hell-bent on war exercises targeted against the DPRK, blustering that Japan may fight a war against North Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses their war outcry as a declaration of a war against the DPRK and their saber-rattling as a revelation of their vicious moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing reactionary forces of Japan are raising a hue and cry over the issue of a few kidnapped Japanese while keeping mum about the unprecedentedly hideous state-sponsored crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of redeeming Japan's past should be solved on a priority basis if the DPRK-Japan relations are to be improved and the outstanding issue to be settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of abduction is concerned, it was basically solved when Prime Minister Koizumi visited the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what a sinister aim the right-wing reactionary forces of Japan are seeking in complicating the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are misusing the issue of abduction for pushing the Japanese people's sentiment to extremes in a bid to obstruct the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration. It is their true intention to maintain the abnormal bilateral relations for an indefinite period at the instigation of the U.S. imperialists and other foreign forces and make a showdown with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing reactionary forces of Japan are well advised to stop hamstringing the process of improving DPRK-Japan relations and fostering confrontation while going against the trend of the times and the mindset of the people at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It continues:\r\n The nuclear threat is not posed to the U.S. by the DPRK, a non-nuclear state. On the contrary the DPRK is exposed to this threat posed by the U.S., a nuclear weapon state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Bush bellicose forces came to power in the U.S., they openly listed the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack and adopted it as its policy. As its follow-up measure the U.S. is keen on developing smaller tactical nuclear weapons to attack and destroy the underground facilities in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the DPRK has always been exposed to the nuclear threat from the U.S. the DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence are most seriously threatened by the U.S. nuclear blackmail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such situation compels the DPRK to possess any type of powerful military means to defend its sovereignty and right to existence from U.S. moves to blackmail and stifle it with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by its peace-loving stand, tolerance and good will, the DPRK recently proposed the U.S. to settle the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula on the basis of the U.S. recognition of the DPRK's sovereignty and the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning down the DPRK's constructive proposal for peace, the U.S. kicked up a new anti-DPRK \"nuclear racket\", sparking the second \"nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream of the U.S. to try to bring the DPRK to its knees and stifle it through its moves for nuclear confrontation with the latter.    \r\n \r\n"
