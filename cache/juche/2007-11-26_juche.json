These practices should be categorically rejected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to coordinate the activities among the member states of the IMO for ensuring safe navigation and increase its efficiency and protecting the sea environment and boost the technical cooperation of the organization in this field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for the IMO to more energetically push forward the technical cooperation with developing countries in order to help them respond to the new technological changes and successfully deal with the maritime issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Re-clarifying the DPRK government's principled stand of opposing all forms of terrorism, he reiterated its will to further international cooperation in the struggle against the piracy and armed robbery.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu has been put on a new look. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A historic ground-breaking ceremony for the construction projects of the Mt. Paektu area was held on November 24, Juche 89 (2000). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The entire people turned out as one in the construction of the sacred land with the revolutionary spirit of Paektu but the projects were not smooth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the beginning of the new century, aggression and war against sovereign states were incessant in the international arena and the DPRK-U.S. nuclear confrontation aggravated tension in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The temperature around 40 degrees below zero and blizzard in the area made the construction more difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the constructors completed within seven days the waterway project that would take several years in ordinary times. They wrought many similar miracles to turn the Mt. Paektu area into a socialist fairyland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They chiseled the frozen ground to build a road and the 1,570 meter-long stone steps from the top of Mt. Paektu to Lake Chon. And they paved the road leading to the top of Mt. Paektu with more than 437,500 trimmed stones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only in recent years they built over 1,400 housing blocks for over 5,000 families and constructed or repaired on an expansion basis hundreds of cultural and public buildings with a total floor space of more than 255,700 square meters. They also built power stations to create lots of generating capacity and planted millions of trees to add beauty to the Mt. Paektu area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those years the Korean people have trained themselves as stalwarts who will protect the leader at the cost of their lives and firmly carry forward the traditions of the Juche-based revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The construction fully demonstrates the unshakable faith and will of the Korean people to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. much touted \"threat to security\" from the DPRK is nothing but a far-fetched assertion intended to slander the DPRK's independent foreign policy and steps for increasing its self-reliant national defence capacity and a ruse to justify the moves for aggression against the DPRK. It is the intention of the U.S. to destabilize and destroy the socialist system in the DPRK and thus eliminate socialism from the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be neither the improved DPRK-U.S. relations nor a durable peace on the Korean Peninsula unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is one of the fundamental conditions for peace on the peninsula to replace the armistice agreement by a peace agreement. When this happens, it will make it possible to remove the military confrontation on the peninsula and automatically help build confidence between the two countries. The U.S. stand and attitude toward the issue of replacing the armistice agreement by a peace agreement would, therefore, serve as a yardstick showing whether it wants peace on the peninsula or seeks a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to terminate the hostile relations between the two countries and promote confidence. This is urgently required not only for ensuring peace on the peninsula but for normalizing the bilateral relations and improving the U.S. image. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is one of the important conditions for ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula for the U.S. to stop its moves for turning Japan and south Korea into its military bases and withdraw its aggression forces from the peninsula and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To this end, it is necessary to steadily push forward the work to revolutionize and working-classize the intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intellectuals should have their homeland and faith, although science and technology do not know boundary. The faith to be cherished by revolutionary intellectuals means an iron will to dedicate their knowledge, technology, wisdom and talents to the people's cause of independence and the cause of socialism despite whatever difficulties and a do-or-die spirit to share their destinies with the party, the leader and socialism to the end no matter what trial they may face and no matter how the situation may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fate of socialism precisely means that of intellectuals. As proven by what happened in the former socialist countries, the intellectuals who abandoned the working class party and socialism could not escape a miserable position no better than orphans as they were subject to humiliation, maltreatment and a tragic lot only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intellectuals in the DPRK have become genuine revolutionary comrades who share their destinies with their leader and formed a harmonious whole with him as they also share idea and intention with him with unshakable faith under whatever difficult situation. They are dynamically advancing along the glorious path of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, highly proud of playing an important role in the Songun revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
