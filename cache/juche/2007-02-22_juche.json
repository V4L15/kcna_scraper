But the DPRK has developed its national language in combination with the Juche, national and modern characters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government of the DPRK has persistently pursued the correct linguistic policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on preserving and carrying forward the national language for over 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Right after the liberation of the country, the government took measures to use the Korean language as its official language, liquidate illiteracy, the outcome of the Japanese imperialists' colonial policy of keeping the Koreans in ignorance, remove Japanese words in the native language and abolish the use of Chinese characters. And it directed primary attention to creating the social conditions and linguistic environment for the development of the national language including the strengthening of the education in the national language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such standing linguistic institutes as the Society for the Study of Korean Language (1947), Terminology Assessment Committee (1949) and the Korean Linguistic Institute (1964) were formed to give a scientific guarantee to the development of the national language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Along with this, the government has pushed ahead with a nation-wide work of arranging vocabularies and establishing correct trait of linguistic life in order to fully display the national characteristics of the language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than tens of thousands of common vocabularies and terminology have been purified from Chinese and foreign words. A lot of inherent Korean words have been discovered and arranged and the Korean written and spoken language has developed into a new system with inherent Korean words as the main. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the government has formulated the Pyongyang language as the cultured Korean language and pushed forward the work of giving full play to its advantage, with the result that the Pyongyang cultured language serves as a great wherewithal for the unified development of the Korean language.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
