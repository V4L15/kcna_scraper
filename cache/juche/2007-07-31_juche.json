They, however, connive at or patronize their allies or the countries obedient to them even when they cause troubles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States divided the world into two categories to meet its interests, conniving at the terrorist acts perpetrated by certain countries or blaming some other countries after absurdly labeling them \"sponsors of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It overlooks and supports the pro-U.S. forces and allies' development and access to nukes while kicking up rackets of pressurizing those countries incurring its displeasure under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue,\" proceeding from a unilateral and biased stand. This goes to clearly prove the unfairness and injustice of its policy of double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding that there should be only one principle of justice to be applicable to all countries on an equal footing as far as the settlement of international issues is concerned, the article stresses that the imperialists' unfair policy of double standards will prove futile only when the world people who love peace and aspire after independence positively strive to solve the international issues on the principle of impartiality and equality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
