            "content": "DPRK NDC Policy Department Issues Statement\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK released the following statement Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\tAn acute situation that has persisted on the Korean Peninsula since the end of last year is now putting the peninsula on the verge of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuch upset by the development, U.S. President Obama on April 11 reportedly stated in public of his intention to seek a negotiated and diplomatic settlement of the situation, saying that he does not want a war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe chief of Chongwadae of south Korea, who is accustomed to currying favor with her master, let the \"minister of Unification\" make public a \"statement\". She even loudly spoke of \"the authorities' proposal for dialogue to tide over the situation\", a U-turn from her previous attitude of stoking confrontation. She used to say that there can be neither dialogue nor dispatch of a special envoy at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe rhetoric about dialogue raised by the master and the stooge almost at the same time is a political decision made by them out of their calculation that they can never bring the DPRK into submission with military threats and \"sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt will be very much gratifying if they took a proper political decision to bring under control the grave situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula with true interest in dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut matter is that the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime cried out for starting dialogue in an appropriate environment, in an appropriate time and under appropriate condition despite their loud claim that the U.S. and south Korea made a U-turn toward dialogue and negotiations. The preconditions for dialogue raised by them include a stop to \"provocative\" remarks which the DPRK has so far been engaged in and demonstration of its intention to realize denuclearization and suspend missile launch. These are absurd ones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and south Korea are opt-repeating \"provocation\" and \"threats\" from the DPRK, describing them as a stumbling block in the way of dialogue hoped for by them, while making the story of \"north-south dialogue first and north Korea-U.S. dialogue next\" an established fact as if the north had agreed to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this regard, the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK brings to light the nature of the prevailing situation and clarifies once again the principled stand of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is a Korean saying which goes \"Thief calls stop thief\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and all kinds of hostile forces following it are the very ones who pushed the situation on the Korean Peninsula to such a grave phase as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the masterminds of the tense situation are portraying the DPRK as \"provoker\", while describing them as victims. It appears that they are not afraid of divine punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"provocation\" charge brought against the DPRK by the U.S. has become undisguised since they called the DPRK's legitimate and peaceful satellite launch as a \"missile launch\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's working satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 was confirmed to be going around its orbit by the North American Aero-space Defense Command. Russia and several other countries also admitted this and shortly ago a scientific and research institute of south Korea photographed the DPRK's satellite and made it public. But with their eyes shut to this stark fact, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime are stepping up provocations against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo wonder, the world public has now become increasingly vocal, condemning the U.S. and its allies' vicious provocation of getting the UN Security Council pass the \"resolution on sanctions\" and calling the satellite launch a \"missile launch\" as a \"deception that disgraced justice and conscience\" and an \"act of blind men unable to discern skirt from trousers\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UNSC's \"resolution on sanctions\" following the DPRK's legitimate satellite launch was a prelude to an open provocation by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime to inveigle all the forces following it to the worldwide campaign for isolating and stifling the DPRK. The nuclear war exercises being staged against the DPRK for nearly two months is a vicious, all-out military provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. even brought to south Korea and to waters off it super-large nuclear-powered carrier task force equipped with nuclear warheads, B-52, B-2 and other nuclear strategic bombers, nuclear-powered submarines capable of launching cruise guided shells and guided shell destroyers and even F-22 Stealth fighter formation to be used for making maiden strikes at the targets of the DPRK's army in the early days of war. They have stepped up the military provocation in an all-round way which now has reached the most dangerous phase of nuclear blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has never termed the U.S. satellite launches missile launches and attempted to urge the UN to adopt resolutions on sanctions under that pretext. It has never threatened and blackmailed the U.S. by deploying its elite armed forces in waters off the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are not wolves in human form, they should properly understand the word provocation and feel ashamed of their brigandish behaviors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is another provocation against the DPRK that the U.S. urged the former to show the \"will for denuclearization\" as a precondition for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDenuclearization of the Korean Peninsula remains the unshakable will of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe joint declaration on denuclearization adopted by the north and the south early in the 1990s was a gain common to the nation as it was initiated by the DPRK with such will. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., however, introduced nuclear weapons into south Korea and its vicinity in league with puppet forces and began to escalating threat and blackmail against the DPRK, bringing this precious gain to naught.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to cope with the U.S. escalating hostile policy and nuclear blackmail against the DPRK, it was compelled to have access to just nuclear force for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, nothing is more foolish and brigandish than pressurizing the DPRK to show its \"will for denuclearization\" first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear force of the DPRK will always remain in the hands of its army and people as the most powerful means to protect the sovereignty of the country and its supreme interests and deal a retaliatory blow at the strongholds of aggression against it till the world including the U.S. is denuclearized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNot content with terming the DPRK's toughest countermeasures \"provocations\", the U.S. and south Korean puppet regime went the lengths of ceaselessly hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK are demonstrating their just will to stand up against the enemies' moves to isolate and stifle it and nuclear war moves against it. They are, however, describing this will as one for \"consolidating the heir's system\", \"enhancing image\" and \"rallying unstable ranks\". This is the thrice-cursed politically-motivated provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is nothing but rigmarole let loose by the imbeciles who know nothing about the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe bad-tempered U.S. and south Korean puppet regime can never imagine the tears of emotion shed by artillery women when the Supreme Commander took them to his arms and the warm feelings of service personnel and people shouting \"hurrah\" after jumping into cold sea waters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as they persist in all sorts of provocations against the DPRK, its army and the people will steadily escalate the tough political and military counteractions as the days go by.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime should make a bold decision to take the following practical measures if they want to shirk off the historical responsibility for the prevailing grave situation on the Korean Peninsula, escape sledge-hammer retaliatory blows of the army and people of the DPRK and if they truly stand for dialogue and negotiations:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirst, they should immediately stop all their provocative acts against the DPRK and apologize for all of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs the first phase, they should take the measure of retracting the UNSC's \"resolutions on sanctions\" cooked up under absurd pretexts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should bear in mind that doing so would be a token of good will towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet forces should promptly halt all their anti-DPRK rackets, not linking their own mishaps such as Cheonan warship sinking incident and the \"March 20 hacking case\" to the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecond, they should give formal assurances before the world that they would not stage again such nuclear war drills to threaten or blackmail the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDialogue can never go with war actions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequent nuclear war maneuvers will only strain the situation and totally block the way of dialogue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will not be taken in by sophism that the nuclear war drills being staged under its very nose are annual and defensive military actions for defending the U.S. and guaranteeing the security of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThird, they should make a decision to withdraw all nuclear war means from south Korea and its vicinity and give up their attempt to reintroduce them as their immediate duty. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should bear in mind that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can begin with the pullout of the nuclear war means introduced by the U.S. and this may lead to the global denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe chief of Chongwadae should not forget that the prospect of south Korea may be rosy when the north's nukes are considered as a property common to the nation but south Korea is bound to go to ruin when it remains under the U.S. nuclear umbrella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe situation on the peninsula is directly linked with peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK together with the world peace-loving people who sympathize with justice and value conscience will closely follow the future behavior of the U.S. and its followers."

            "content": "DPRK's Principled Stand on Inter-Korean Dialogue Remains Unchanged: CPRK Spokesman\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- There will be neither dialogue nor improved relations between the north and the south as long as south Korea persists in such hostile acts as enforcing sanctions against the DPRK, taking part in the acts to stifle it, deliberately accusing it of its space development and bolstering of its nuclear force and staging war exercises after massively introducing sophisticated war hardware into south Korea, declared a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in a statement issued on Thursday.  \n\t\t\t\t\tRecently the south Korean authorities expressed \"regret and disappointment\" at the DPRK's rejection of their proposal for dialogue, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey went the lengths of making impudent remarks that \"the north should make a right choice\", jabbering that \"it chilled the atmosphere and overturned the table\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHad they have a true will to have dialogue, they should have halted all acts of hurting the dignity of the DPRK, stopped the north-targeted war exercises and smear campaign and given assurances to the nation that they would not resort to such hostile acts in the days ahead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, a spate of invectives slandering the celebrations of the Day of the Sun was let loose and such thrice-cursed crime as infringing upon the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK was committed in the heart of Seoul in broad daylight at the tacit connivance of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuppet minister of Defense Kim Kwan Jin and other warmongers kicked up confrontation hysteria, crying out for \"a total war, strong counteraction and stern and decisive punishment.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the chief of Chongwadae let loose a whole string of jargons seriously hurting the dignity of the north. She blustered that \"it is necessary to terminate the vicious cycle of renegotiating and assisting the north when it poses a threat and perpetrates a provocation and that such threat and provocation would isolate the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these facts prove that the south Korean authorities were compelled to propose dialogue under the pressure of the public, having no sincere heart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey clearly indicate that the proposed dialogue is nothing but a deceptive artifice to cover up their act of having pushed the situation to a state of war, tide over the crisis and mislead the public opinion in a bid to shift the responsibility onto the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities are employing sleight of hand as regards the issue of the Kaesong Industrial Zone but the crisis there most vividly reflects the present state of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey, along with their American master, are still talking such nonsense as \"denuclearization\" in the north in a bid to make a bargain over its nukes. They would be well advised to drop such daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a matter of fact, the DPRK was technically at a nuclear war with the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has posed a threat to the DPRK with all its ultramodern nuclear strategic weapons and hardware.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis showdown was sparked by the U.S. and other hostile forces as they took issue with the DPRK over its legitimate satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe confrontation maniacs should properly understand that the principled stance of the DPRK will never change, warned the statement."

            "content": "S. Korean, U.S. Media Accused of Passing Buck for Crisis in Korea to North\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA)-- An article titled \"Media are to blame for straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula\" contributed by a south Korean media man was posted on Voice of People, an internet broadcasting service of south Korea, on April 13. \n\t\t\t\t\tDrawing attention to the fact that news reports released by media of south Korea and the U.S. on the situation on the peninsula do not help correctly grasp what is truth, the article added that this is because they do not properly introduce the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMedia of south Korea and U.S. are faithfully playing the role of a weapon attacking the north, it charged, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said media are shifting all the blames for the crisis on the peninsula onto the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey accuse the north of a satellite launch, without taking into consideration at all the fact that such launch pertains to sovereignty under international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOver the last half century since satellite launch began, it was only the north that was subject to international sanctions for its satellite launch. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSpace industry is directly linked with the future of a state and its economic development. To deter advance into space is little short of blocking the state's development and threatening the right to exist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. examined the use of nukes during the Korean War and since the middle of the 1950s it has pushed forward a military strategy, drills, etc. presupposing the use of nukes on the peninsula, and posed a threat to the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt present, too, the U.S. is demanding the north side drop its nuclear weapons, making its provision of a nuclear umbrella to the south side an established fact. This lacks persuasive power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSouth Korean media do not seriously deal with this point.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey almost fully speak for the U.S. as regards the north's satellite launch and nuclear test, the UN \"sanctions against the north,\" Key Resolve maneuvers, the north's nullification of the Armistice Agreement, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs regards the Kaesong Industrial Zone, some media and political camp of the south asserted that the north has gained a fabulous amount of foreign currency and that money is being diverted to the purpose of the north's nuclear test, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSome media recently floated the story that the north is sparking off a crisis with the KIZ, its alleged source of money, left in tact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KIZ may be explained from various angles. It is the military aspect of the KIZ that the south Korean conservative forces never mention when referring to the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe conservative forces' mum about this point is little short of making a mockery of the KIZ.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMost media of the south only release news reports about the north's \"provocations\" without clarifying at all what is the core of the crisis on the peninsula and what is a fundamental solution to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven against the backdrop of the world's strong criticism the south's media are free to release reports terming the U.S. a perfect military patron of south Korea but describing the north as a diehard \"enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are busy reporting about ceaseless drills of U.S. sophisticated weapons from the U.S. eyes. They play the role of hyping the effect of the U.S. \"demonstration of forces\" against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMedia of the south are bound to the \"Security Law\" suppressing the freedom of thinking."
