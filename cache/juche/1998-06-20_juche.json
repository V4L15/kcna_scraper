In other words, the South Korean authority intends to deprive the people of all human rights and freedom and reduce not only prisoners of conscience but all other South Korean people to slaves of modern version and human dregs without any idea and conscience, the information bulletin said, and continued:\r\n   In a nutshell, by the \"standard\" he means that as long as the prisoners of conscience maintain their ideas and conscience and refuse to adapt themselves to the flunkeyist, separatist and fascist rule, they will be kept in prison and persecuted.\r\n   The \"standard,\" which criminalizes those who desire alliance with communism and the north and national reunification, is an undisguised provocation against and challenge to the north.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must unconditionally release all the prisoners of conscience as unanimously demanded by people at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n"

Opening the fact to the public, the then u.s. Joint chiefs of staff chairman implied that even the U.S. President was aware of the use of the poison gas.\r\n   His remarks made clear that the nerve gas was used by the U.S. Forces in the war with the approval and connivance of the U.S. government.\r\n   At that time, the Nixon administration officially declared the policy of no first use of b.c. weapons.\r\n   The fact is enough to show the U.S. double-dealing policy and its shamelessness and ferocity.\r\n   During the Korean War (June 1950-July 1953), too, the United States massively used b.c. Weapons against the Korean people.\r\n   It has not only kept many b.c. weapons in stock but shipped such weapons to South Korea and its vicinity, threatening the DPRK with them.    \r\n\r\n"
