            "content": "Kim Jong Il Gives Field Guidance to Agricultural Field in North Phyongan Province \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave field guidance to the agricultural field in North Phyongan Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first leg of his guidance was the Unhung Co-op Farm in Thaechon County where Handre Plain, one of the nine scenic spots of Songun, is located. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Feasting his eyes on the modern cozy houses standing in rows at the foot of a mountain, the hill at the back of the village clad in the thick verdure of fruit trees of various species and the vast expanse of fertile fields of standardized shapes, he said that he could not find any traces of patches of paddy fields and peasant houses that stood here and there among dry fields. He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the appearance of the village changed beyond recognition in less than a decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The officials and working people of the farm overfulfilled their production plan every year and, at the same time, completed so vast construction project by their own efforts, turning the village into a paradise and a socialist land of bliss in the era of the WPK, he noted, highly appreciating this as an admirable success and extending warm greetings to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning in detail about the farm work this year, he instructed the Unhung Co-op Farm to set an example to be followed by all other farms of the country in grain production by thoroughly meeting the requirements of the Juche methods of farming and set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met with farmer Om Jong Sil in a field of the farm and had a cordial talk with her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning in detail about her work and life, he said it is very commendable that she has devoted herself to the agricultural production since she volunteered to work on the farm. He highly appreciated the patriotic deed of Om Jong Sil and her parents who fully supported the determination of their daughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When young people in other countries are nervous about getting the right of citizenship of the capital, youth in our country unhesitatingly leave the capital city dear to them and volunteer to work in fields, coal mines and in the places to be developed, he said, adding that this is the genuine appearance of our youth who are boundlessly faithful to the party and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Phyongbuk Pig Farm newly built in North Phyongan Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the pig farm before a huge painting showing a panoramic view of the farm, he went round the outside and inside of the pig farm to learn in detail about the construction and management and operation of the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly satisfied to learn that North Phyongan Province successfully built a big modern pig farm with great capacity by its own efforts. He highly appreciated the feats performed by its builders and set forth the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he moved on to the Thaechon Youth Rabbit Breed Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made rounds of the renovated rabbit-hutches and other places of the farm to learn in detail about the production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the farm was a significant farm personally established by President Kim Il Sung during the hard-fought war for the diet of the people in the province, he stressed the need to always remember the great loving care of the President and steadily increase the production of young rabbits and add luster to his leadership exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said what is important in raising rabbits is to set up the system of breeding and supplying rabbits of good stock, take measures for ensuring the supply of feed, establish an anti-epidemic system and properly solve scientific and technical problems and proposed the tasks to be fulfilled by the farm and ways to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day he acquainted himself with afforestation brisk in North Phyongan Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that long-term plan for afforestation is seen at all factories and rural villages of the province and all the units and all the people work hard to materialize them full of enthusiasm, adding that this fact suffices to show the transparent stand and attitude of the officials and working people of the province to implement the party policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If all the people promptly accept the party line and policies and work hard to implement them just as the people of the province do, the country will turn into a more beautiful paradise of the people good to live in, its mountains and fields thick with green foliage, he emphasized the need to learn from their fighting spirit and work style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said the determination of the people in the province to take the lead in opening up the gate to a great prosperous powerful nation is very strong and expressed the conviction that the province would play a pioneer's role in agricultural production, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Chief Secretary Kim Phyong Hae of the North Phyongan Provincial Committee of the WPK.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is tightening its military nexus with the south Korean puppet armed forces, a proof that the U.S. has not given up its hostile policy towards the DPRK but is keen to plug south Korea deep into its strategy to establish a military domination over Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula is the biggest hot spot in carrying out the U.S. strategy to dominate Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the peninsula is so dangerous that it may develop into a crisis all of a sudden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Exactly in this region the U.S. seeks to destroy the foundation of peace, which has been barely maintained, in other words, to upset the military equilibrium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the scenario of the U.S. military warlike forces to carry out without fail their strategy for preemptive attack on the DPRK by fully securing the military superiority of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet armed forces to the military strength of the latter, deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is in pursuance of this aim that the U.S. has recently made an agreement on jointly establishing a missile defence system with the south Korean puppet government and zealously helped it in its moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization process is now making progress on the Korean Peninsula and it is hailed by the international community as it has a positive impact on the situation in Northeast Asia and the overall world situation. Obviously, the U.S. clarified its stand of hailing the measure taken by the DPRK for denuclearization, though the former's real intention is yet to be confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this backdrop that the U.S. is holding confabs to thrust its dagger into the back of its dialogue partner behind the scene. The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Gone are the days when empty talks could be made about the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. double-dealing tactics can never work on the DPRK and such practice will only push the above-said denuclearization process to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly stands for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it should behave properly to be trusted by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK at once. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
