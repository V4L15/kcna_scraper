Dazzling successes made by North Korean scientists who, imbued with the Juche idea, possess missile and nuclear technologies struck many world people with admiration, said the paper.   It further said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Socialist Korea follows  the victorious course of its own choice despite dramatic changes in the world political arena following the frustration of socialism in some countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All that happened in the DPRK is considered to be miracles in the history of world politics.   General Secretary Kim Jong II is not daunted at all when confronted with the United States, which boasts of being the only \"superpower,\" and anybody else.   He, guided by an idea that a country without  its own army goes to ruin, gives priority to beefing up army.      The world often admires his well-calculated, bold decision. \r\n\r\n"

The poem sings of enduring feats of General Secretary Kim Jong II, who has devoted his all to the happiness of the people, without celebrating even his birthday, February 16.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It says that though the February holiday is celebrated by the whole world, only Kim Jong II spends the day as a usual one of the year.   Reflected in the Korean people's happiness achieved with a lot of sacrifices is deep love for the people of Kim Jong II, who has never devoted even a single day to himself in his 57 years, says the poem.   It also says that as he brings happiness to the people with great love, February which started on Mt. Paektu illuminates the century and February of the sun ushers in a new century.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The poet, who is well known in Korea, dedicated \"Comrade Kim Il Sung, our immortal leader,\" \"Pyongyang time will be everlasting,\" \"May Kim Il Sung's homeland prosper\" and other poems to the first three anniversaries of the death of Kim Il Sung. \r\n\r\n"

The popular uprising was an inevitable result of the vicious colonial rule of Japanese imperialism.   The uprising, which had flared up in Pyongyang on March 1, Juche 8 (1919) as a massive anti-Japanese demonstration, spread in an instant to all parts of the country as well as to overseas Koreans to become a nation-wide resistance.   It was mentioned at the seminar that the uprising was a praiseworthy action of the nation, which powerfully demonstrated the Korean nation's spirit of independence at home and abroad and an eruption of the pent-up rage and resentment of the nation at the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was stressed at the seminar that the uprising taught the immutable truth that for the Korean people to win victory in the anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation they should have an outstanding leader and wage an organized struggle with correct tactics and strategy under the guidance of a revolutionary party.    It stressed the need for the Korean people to preserve the  patriotic tradition, which was formed through history, and for all the Koreans in the north, south and overseas to firmly unite under the banner of great national unity and vigorously struggle to reunify the country without fail under the leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong II. \r\n\r\n"

Commenting on his remark, Rodong Sinmun today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The \"policy,\" rejected by the entire nation, is designed to \"induce\" the north to \"reform and opening\" through \"reconciliation and cooperation.\" It is a policy of confrontation with the north, which denies ideology and social system of the north and seeks to \"invade the north to unify.\" it is also a policy of permanent division, not reunification, because it runs counter to the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity and the basic idea of the inter-Korean agreement.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying it is his intention to turn inter-Korean relations into those of confrontation between the systems.\r\n   His remark prompted by such an intention is an unbearable challenge and provocation which insults and defies the faith of the Korean people.\r\n   His identifying the \"policy\" with that of the U.S. which led to the collapse, \"reform and opening\" of a certain country is a revelation of his ulterior intention to do harm to and stifle the north at any cost with the backing of outsiders.   His repeated talk about the \"policy\" following the statement that there will be \"no unification during his term of office\" proves that he has no will for reunification. \r\n   \r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes his remarks provide an evidence that the U.S. forces present in South Korea and Japan are aggression forces for the second Korean war and a shock brigade in the pursuance of the U.S. military strategy for domination over the Asia-pacific region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S. intends to make a preemptive attack on the North Korea with the U.S. task forces in South Korea and Japan as a shock brigade and turn it into a full-scale war.   His statement that the Japan-based U.S. forces are on \"standby for immediate reaction\" and intensifying maneuvers indicates that the U.S. forces are ready to make a surprise attack on Korea.   The DPRK and the U.S. are technically in a state of war. So a war may break out any moment. There is no institutional mechanism on the Korean peninsula to prevent a war between the two countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For prevention of war and preservation of peace and stability in the peninsula the U.S. forces should be pulled out of South Korea and a peace accord should be signed between the two countries.   Only then is it possible to remove the chief source of war and set up a mechanism for peace.   Whether war is prevented and peace and stability preserved or not depends on the U.S. attitude.   The U.S. should get rid of the anachronistic viewpoint, rectify Korea policy and work towards peace and stability in the Asia-pacific region. \r\n\r\n"
