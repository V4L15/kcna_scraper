This feat deserves admiration by humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the hostile forces including the U.S. are going desperate to apply fresh sanctions and pressure on the DPRK while branding its successful H-bomb test as \"threat\" to peace and security and \"challenge\" to UN \"resolutions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Utterly disgusting is the despicable behavior of the Japanese reactionaries and the south Korean puppet forces taking the lead here.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee clarifies the following principled stand under the prevailing situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The U.S. should stop rash act and not run wild, with deep consideration of the position and weight of its rival Juche Korea that have undergone change after its access to H-bomb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. adheres to sanctions and pressure, not properly judging the great significance and the stern warning given by the success in the H-bomb test of Juche Korea, it will face unprecedentedly resolute counteraction it can not hold control of.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. Japan should clearly understand its position and stop indecent deed of acting as the U.S. cat's paw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK with pent-up wrath against the Japanese reactionaries are waiting for a moment to settle accounts with the present Japanese authorities who have taken the lead in tightening sanctions against the DPRK pursuant to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should bear in mind that it is near the DPRK, world-level military power possessed of diversified A-bomb, H-bomb and rockets of deadly striking power and hit effect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The south Korean authorities should not spout \"strong military counteraction\" for which they can not be responsible, a bluff unbecoming for their have-not position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stooges moving at the beck and call of others, being subject to sycophancy and submission should not go unreasonable as to call for slapping \"painful sanctions\" and \"pressure\", and should stop provoking laughter of people with their such clumsy counteraction as \"joint strike\" reminiscent of children's playing at soldiers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 4. The world including the neighboring countries needs to have proper understanding of the nuclear issue of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear blackmail and threat the U.S. has posed to the DPRK so far have been a wrong option against the rival of wrong choice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will more keenly realize what a special event the DPRK's possession of H-bomb becomes in terminating the U.S. and other big powers' high-handed and arbitrary practices and establishing a fair international order.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking this opportunity, we appeal to the world conscience to turn out in the action to set right the biased international order ruled by the U.S. and the misguided trend in which injustice prevails over justice."

            "content": "CCPAP declara posicion de principios frente a nuevas maniobras de sancion y presion anti-RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 7 de septiembre (ACNC) -- El portavoz del Comite Coreano por la Paz de Asia y el Pacifico (CCPAP) publico el dia 7 una declaracion denunciando las nuevas maniobras de sancion y presion de las fuerzas hostiles contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias al exito en la prueba de la bomba H realizada por la RPDC se ha detenido mucho el peligro de guerra nuclear causado por EE.UU. en la region del Extremo Oriente incluyendo la Peninsula Coreana y la de Asia-Pacifico y preparado la garantia confiable para asegurar la paz y la seguridad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene la proeza historica a ser elogiada por todo el mundo, senala la declaracion y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles hacen esfuerzos desesperados por dar la nueva sancion y presion a la RPDC volviendo a cuestionar el acontecimiento historico arriba mencionado como la \"amenaza\" a la paz y seguridad y el \"desafio\" a la supuesta \"resolucion\" de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, llegan a la etapa intolerable las conductas bochornosas de los reaccionarios japoneses y los titeres surcoreanos que estan al frente de esas maniobras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con la situacion creada, el CCPAP aclaro la posicion de principios como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. EE.UU. debe tratar con seriedad la posicion y el peso de su rival, Corea del Juche, cambiados por su posesion de la bomba H y dejar de actuar imprudentemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU., preso por su meditacion vieja, recurre a la sancion y presion sin juzgar bien el enorme sentido y la severa advertencia que contiene el exito de la Corea Juche en la prueba del arma termonuclear arriba referido, EE.UU. se enfrentara con la insuperable reaccion rotunda. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Japon debe dejar de actuar groseramente como sirviente fiel de EE.UU. entendiendo bien su situacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo con arraigado rencor a los reaccionarios japoneses estan esperando el momento de saldar la cuenta estricta con los crimenes de las autoridades japonesas en actual mandato que obedeciendo a ciegas a EE.UU. vinieron sumandose al frente a la campana de sancion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe estar muy consciente de que esta mas cerca de su pais la RPDC, potencia militar de talla mundial con bombas atomicas, bomba H y cohetes diversificados con gran poderio y efectividad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Las autoridades surcoreanas, que no tienen nada, deben dejar de actuar imprudentemente hablando de la \"fuerte represalia militar\", disparate irresponsable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSiendo lacayas acostumbradas al servilismo y subyugacion a grandes potencias, no deben soltar los disparates insolentes como \"sancion dura\" y \"presion\" sobre alguien ni causar la burla de la gente hablando de la supuesta reaccion miserable como \"ataque conjunto\" semejante a un juego militar de los ninos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t4. Los paises vecinos y los demas del mundo deben comprender correctamente el problema nuclear de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl chantaje y amenaza nucleares impuestos hasta la fecha por EE.UU. contra la RPDC devienen una opcion erronea contra el rival mal elegido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA medida que pasan los dias, el mundo experimentara mas claramente la significacion especial de la posesion de la bomba H por la RPDC que se mostrara en la lucha por acabar con el despotismo y las arbitrariedades de EE.UU. y otras potencias y establecer un imparcial orden internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechamos esta oportunidad para exhortar una vez mas a la conciencia del mundo que se levante en la lucha por corregir el desigual orden internacional dominado por EE.UU. y la corriente erronea en que la injusticia prevalece sobre la justicia."
