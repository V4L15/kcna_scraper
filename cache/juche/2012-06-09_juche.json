Korea\r\n Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Scandals in which traitor Lee Myung Bak, Chongwadae and his families and relatives, confidants and clan of the \"Saenuri Party\" were involved are being disclosed one after another in south Korea these days, touching off astonishment and anger of all people.  \n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea on Saturday released information bulletin No. 1 000 in this connection. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 4, Pak Hui Thae, former speaker of the puppet \"National Assembly\" of south Korea, was sentenced to one year in prison after admitting his distribution of enveloped money among members of the former \"Grand National Party\" (GNP) during its congress in 2008. On June 5, two secretaries of a lawmaker from the GNP were sentenced to 7 years in jail for conducting a Ddos attack on the homepage of the Central Election Committee at the time of the October 26 by-election last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, Choe Si Jung, former chairman of the \"Broadcasting and Communication Committee\" of south Korea, and Pak Yong Jun, former vice-minister of Knowledge-based Economy, who were top-aides of Lee Myung Bak, were detained for suspected use of illegal election fund for Lee's election as \"president\". Choe was reported to have received 800 million won from a business group and Pak Yong Jun more than 160 million won from the same group from 2006 to 2008. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, aides of Lee Sang Duk, Lee Myung Bak's elder brother, are now under investigation for the reception of a huge amount of money from SLS Group of south Korea and on the suspicion that the illegally laundered money went to the Lee Sang Duk's safe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the successive puppet regimes were involved in scandals without exception. But, none of them was involved in such endless hideous scandals as what Lee Myung Bak and his families, relatives and closest confidants committed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye of the \"Saenuri Party\" is also deeply involved in the Pusan Savings Bank case and Park Chung Hee-Ryuk Yong Su Foundation case. Recently, there is a suspicion that Park Geun Hye is directly involved in the Samhwa Savings Bank case in which her sister and her husband were involved. This is sparking off people's uproar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The scandals of the Lee group are serious enough to develop into an issue of impeachment of \"president\" if they had occurred in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Democratic United Party and other opposition parties and people of different social standings brand Lee Myung Bak and Chongwadae as chief culprits of scandals and strongly demand a thorough investigation into officials up to the top echelon of power. They are threatening to leave no means untried to probe the scandals including inspection of state administration and \"National Assembly\" hearing, unless a strict investigation is made. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the conservative group set in motion security organs including prosecution for investigation but they dragged on the investigation under the pretext of \"lack of evidence\" in a bid to cover up the truth. The group simply detained a few yes men in an effort to hide its crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the group forced media to limit news coverage of the scandals as much as possible in a bid to bar them from sparking social furor. The group is, at the same time, working hard to lead elsewhere public attention by creating a terror-ridden atmosphere under the pretext of security through its despicable coloring offensive and a campaign for \"eliminating forces following the north.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A gimlet in the bulging bag is bound to protrude and a corrupt thing is bound to smell stinking and rancid. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crafty moves on the part of the conservative group to cover up its scandals would only spark off bitterer resentment among the people."
