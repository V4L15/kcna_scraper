            "content": "Conclusion of Peace Agreement Called for: KCNA Commentary \r\n Pyongyang, July 27 (KCNA) -- 58 years have passed since the Armistice Agreement (AA) was signed on July 27, 1953. \n\t\t\t\t\t The fragile state of armistice has always barred the peaceful solution of the Korean issue and seriously hamstrung the efforts to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula for several decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When a historic review is made of the agreements related to armistice, all the agreements concluded among countries during World War I were replaced by peace agreements in a matter of six months to two years and those signed as regards the end of World War II were also replaced by peace agreements (peace treaties) in a matter of several years or within ten years at the longest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the AA, the leftover of the Korean War, has lasted for nearly six decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The state of armistice is like a time bomb threatening the security in East Asia and the rest of the Asia-Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nowhere else in the world such region fraught with danger where huge strategic armed forces are deployed and military actions such as joint war exercises are daily occurrences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The perilous nature of ceasefire on the peninsula is evidenced by hundreds of meetings of the Military Armistice Commission held to handle hundreds of thousands of cases of violation of the AA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The touch-and-go situation always prevailing in the Asia-Pacific region, the strategic center in the new century, neither conforms with the trend of the era towards peace nor does anyone good.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This abnormal situation should not be allowed to go on in every aspect. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to end the ceasefire between the DPRK and the U.S. and establish a peace-keeping mechanism in order to put an end to the confrontation and conflicts and ensure durable peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, the biggest hotspot of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Concluding a peace agreement may be the first step for settling the Korean issue including the denuclearization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A series of negotiations including the six-party talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula underwent twists and turns in the past due to the failure to properly understand that the establishment of a peace-keeping mechanism is essential for settling the Korean issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impossible to wipe out the mutual distrust nor is it possible to achieve a smooth solution of the issue of denuclearization as long as there persists the hostile relationship between the DPRK and the U.S., the signatories to the AA, the relationship in which they level their guns at each other. This is the lesson drawn from the process of the six-party talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the keynote of the DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace agreement to scrap the armistice mechanism which has systematically deteriorated the hostile relations between the two countries, build confidence and step up the process of denuclearization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being a curtain-raiser to confidence-building, the conclusion of a peace agreement will provide an institutional guarantee for wiping out the bilateral distrust and opening the relations of mutual respect and equality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No country has heavier responsibility than the U.S. in replacing the AA by a peace agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The AA is the leftover of the Cold War through which the U.S. sought to impose the American-style view on value and system on other countries. The U.S. has so far interfered in the internal affairs of Korea as the direct party concerned of the AA and exercised the right to military control over south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should fulfill its historic responsibility for ensuring peace on the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peninsula is now standing at the crossroads of detente and vicious cycle of escalating tension. This situation requires the parties concerned not to miss the opportunity of dialogue but make a bold decision to deal with the fundamental issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of ensuring peace on the peninsula will find a smooth solution if the U.S. properly judges the changed situation and the trend of developing history and make a bold political decision to bring about a switchover in its DPRK policy to meet its interests and the aspiration of the world peace-loving people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Doing so is not an issue of one party giving any benefit to the other party or making reward to it. This would be a fruitful political issue of doing the DPRK and the U.S. and the international community good and making a substantial contribution to the development of peace in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How to approach the issue of concluding a peace agreement will be a touchstone showing whether the U.S. styling itself an Asia-Pacific nation has the will to play a responsible role in solving urgent pending political problems in the region including the denuclearization of the peninsula or not."

The world history of war has never known such an outstanding strategist and invincible and iron-willed commander as the President. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the President led the war to victory the Korean people could defend the precious country that was liberated through the hard-fought struggle and demonstrate the dignity of the heroic people who defeated the imperialist allied forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of war victory attained by the President has been successfully carried forward generation after generation thanks to Kim Jong Il, peerless and brilliant commander of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his outstanding wisdom and commanding art, the Korean People's Army has grown to be the invincible revolutionary army, the single-minded unity of the people has been strengthened thousand-folds and the country had access to strong war deterrence and turned into an impregnable fortress. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says it is a great pride of the army and people of the DPRK to have the shining history of war victory gained under the leadership of the great leader and the great party. The DPRK under the banner of Songun will always emerge victorious, it adds."

Lo comprueba el hecho de que se ha convocado en cientos de ocasiones la reunion de la Comision Militar de Armisticio para tratar cientos de miles de casos de violacion del acuerdo de armisticio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la region de Asia-Pacifico, centro estrategico del nuevo siglo, existe permanentemente el peligro de guerra, lo cual no conviene a la corriente principal de la epoca a la paz ni beneficia a nadie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No se puede tolerar mas tal estado anormal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para poner fin a la confrontacion y conflictos y preservar la paz duradera y la seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana, punto mas candente de la region, es preciso acabar con el estado de armisticio entre Corea y Estados Unidos y establecer el sistema de paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La concertacion del convenio de paz sera el primer paso para la solucion del problema de la Peninsula Coreana, incluso la desnuclearizacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En los tiempos pasados, una serie de negociaciones como las conversaciones a 6 bandas para la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana, resultaron fracasadas porque no se supo que la clave de la solucion del problema de la Peninsula Coreana es el establecimiento del sistema de paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mientras que Corea y EE.UU., firmantes del acuerdo de armisticio, esten enfrentados con armas, no se podra eliminar nunca la desconfianza ni realizar sin complicaciones la desnuclearizacion. Esto es la leccion que ensenan las conversaciones a 6 bandas que sufrieron fracasos repetidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El punto esencial de la propuesta de la RPDC sobre el convenio de paz es acelerar la desnuclearizacion mediante la creacion de la confianza reciproca y la eliminacion del sistema de armisticio que fija y empeora institucionalmente las relaciones hostiles Corea-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La concertacion del convenio de paz es el inicio de la creacion de la confianza. Pues, sera una garantia institucional para eliminar la desconfianza y preparar las relaciones de respeto mutuo e igualdad entre ambas partes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En esta labor EE.UU. es el mas responsable que otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El acuerdo de armisticio es el residuo de la guerra fria que persiguio EE.UU. con el fin de imponer a otra nacion la concepcion de valor y el regimen al estilo norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hasta la fecha, como firmante de ese acuerdo, EE.UU. interviene en los asuntos coreanos y ejerce el control militar sobre el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. debe cumplir con toda su responsabilidad historica en la preservacion de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La situacion actual de la Peninsula Coreana en la encrucijada de distension o agravacion de tension demanda a los paises interesados que tomen la valiente decision de tocar el problema esencial aprovechando la oportunidad de dialogar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El problema de paz de la Peninsula Coreana se resolvera facilmente cuando EE.UU. evalue correctamente la situacion cambiada y la tendencia de desarrollo de la historia y tome la decision politica de modificar con audacia la politica sobre Corea, de acuerdo con los intereses propios y la aspiracion de los pueblos pacifistas del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Este problema no se trata de hacer favor o recompensar por una parte a la otra, sino un tema politico fructifero que conviene por igual a la RPDC y EE.UU. y a la sociedad internacional y contribuira sustancialmente al desarrollo pacifico del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La actitud y la posicion sobre la firma del convenio de paz determinaran si EE.UU., autodenominado como pais de Asia-Pacifico, tiene o no la voluntad de cumplir el papel responsable en resolver los urgentes problemas politicos de esta region, incluso la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
