Side Headquarters\r\n Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- July 9 marks five decades since the Park Chung-Hee group of traitors fabricated humiliating and unequal \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) together with the U.S. despite unanimous opposition and rejection of the south Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the North Side Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Massacres in a statement on Saturday denounced the SOFA as a modern-day slavery agreement that justified the U.S. imperialist aggressors' presence in south Korea and granted them unrestricted privileges in all aspects including jurisdiction and use of land and facilities, and as a humiliating and treacherous agreement unprecedented in the world as it left the sovereignty of south Korea to the tender mercy of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the last five decades, the U.S. imperialist aggressors, styling themselves a de facto ruler and occupier of south Korea and an entity with extraterritoriality under the pretext of the agreement, inflicted all unspeakable misfortune and pain on its people, the statement said, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The outrageous arbitrariness and crimes the U.S. imperialist aggressors committed in south Korea is a tragic product made by their presence in south Korea and the unequal and humiliating SOFA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is too natural that the south Korean people reject the \"SOFA as a traitorous document proving south Korea to be a colony of the U.S.,\" \"agreement on impunity for U.S. forces\" and \"document allowing murder\", and struggle for its abolition and the pullout of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces out of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Park Geun Hye group is actively backing the unequal and humiliating SOFA and begging for the presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea for an indefinite period while offering a large amount of fund collected from the people as taxes as the upkeep for the U.S. forces, and is running amuck as a shock brigade in executing the U.S. nuclear war moves against the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as such pro-U.S. group is left intact, the south Korean people can never be freed from all sorts of misfortune and disgrace, and the Korean nation can never be in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which has inflicted misfortune and pain upon the Korean nation for over seven decades after dividing the Korean peninsula into two, has to understand the strategic position of the DPRK demonstrating its dignity and might as a nuclear power in the East and face up to the trend of the times and drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately withdraw its aggressor forces from south Korea."

The Foreign Ministry also seriously warned that in case the U.S. denies this, all diplomatic contact spaces and channels between the DPRK and the U.S. will be shut off and the toughest measures for counteraction will follow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a declaration of the will of the army and people of the DPRK to take merciless retaliation and annihilate the U.S. which does not hesitate to dare find fault with the supreme leadership of the country which represents dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and their own destiny.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. hostile moves against the DPRK are inching close to a dangerous phase day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is zealously stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK while getting frantic in its war drills and arms buildup and getting engrossed in base attack and invectives against the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that it recently staged open drill of \"beheading operations\" with a sordid aim to do harm to the supreme leadership of the DPRK and now it is resorting even to dirty political conspiratorial act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that the U.S. attempt at stifling the DPRK has now reached an extremely reckless phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile act against the DPRK is just a last-ditch effort aimed to check the victorious advance of the DPRK which is bringing about amazing miracles and innovations day by day despite its vicious nuclear blackmail and political and economic \"sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can browbeat the DPRK with the unprecedented vicious hostile act against the DPRK such as finding fault with the supreme leadership of the DPRK, and attain its hegemonic purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  We have the illustrious Songun commander holding sway over the imperialists' group, possessed of matchless pluck and far-reaching wisdom and outstanding commanding art, and powerful army and people who have formed a thousand-fold fortress around him to devotedly safeguard him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is going busy to put sanctions and \"pressure\" on the DPRK, taken aback by the might of H-bombs, strategic submarines capable of launching missiles underwater and surface-to-surface medium long-range strategic ballistic rockets.

Korea Military Nexus\r\n Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is stepping up its moves to form the triangular military alliance with Japan and south Korea in real earnest.\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 28 the U.S. staged a missile alert drill together with Japan and south Korean puppet forces in the waters off Hawaii under the pretext of coping with \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The commander of the Third Fleet of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces, commenting on the drill codenamed Pacific Dragon, claimed that the drill not only marked an occasion in bolstering the ballistic missile defense capability but also made a big stride in tightening alliance of the three nations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Wall Street Journal and other U.S. media were busy commenting that the drill sent a strong message to China and Russia that the U.S. would never step back in Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance is being knocked into shape to contain these powers by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t NATO and the triangular military alliance in the making in Asia-Pacific are tools of the U.S. to carry out its strategy for dominating the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington has long dreamed of securing its hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region which has tremendous human and material resources and marketing conditions favorable to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But this is bound to lead to conflicts with such regional big powers as China and Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. seeks to hold an unchallenged edge in the military confrontation with the regional big powers by establishing the triangular military alliance involving Japan and south Korea and developing it into a military bloc like NATO.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. is directing its primary efforts to making an institutional mechanism to set up a system of mutual cooperation between south Korea and Japan, the final phase of forging the triangular military alliance, on the basis of the already rounded off system of military cooperation with its allies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the same time, it is busy staging joint military drills for bolstering the alliance's capability for executing aggressive operations, while conducting propaganda to conceal the criminal nature of the triangular military alliance which is bound to be revealed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Precisely for this reason the U.S. staged the above-said missile alert drill with Japan and south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, the above-said joint rehearsal was aimed to invent a pretext for justifying the criminal U.S.-Japan-south Korea joint military drills and making them routine ones by billing them as ones to cope with the \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the above-said muscle flexing it pursued a sinister aim to bolster the capability for executing a war including the tripartite military cooperation and to lay a framework for forming the triangular military alliance by plugging south Korea into the U.S.-Japan joint missile shield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means accidental that many experts in the world analyzed the drills and commented that the drills meant the official operation of the tripartite missile defense cooperation system and the system would precisely serve as catalyst to spur the establishment of the triangular military alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S., Japan and south Korea are having real-time share in information concerning missile defense, according to the agreement made in December last year. They have conditions and circumstances for operating the alliance as a result of the negotiations held between Seoul and Tokyo over the issue of sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army under the U.S. pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The emergence of the triangular military alliance for containing the regional powers is looming.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the situation military experts of China and Russia are becoming vocal demanding strict measures for keeping sharper vigilance and coping with the establishment of the joint missile shield of the U.S., Japan and south Korea, which will inevitably lead to the formation of the triangular military alliance. This hints that confrontation will escalate between the regional powers China and Russia on one hand and the U.S., Japan and south Korea on the other in the Asia-Pacific, due to the hegemonic moves of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, the chief architect of fierce arms race and confrontation in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community will never overlook the risky hegemonic moves of the U.S."
