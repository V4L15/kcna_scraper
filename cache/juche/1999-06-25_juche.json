Earlier, on Thursday two battleships of the \"ROK army\" invaded our territorial waters ten times, but ran away, frightened at the imposing appearance of KPA navy patrol ships.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSynchronizing with this, scores of F-4 and F-16 fighter bombers of the \"ROK\" army repeatedly made circuitous flights above Tokjok Islet so that they could support their battleships any time.   Frantic military provocations being committed by the South Korean authorities every day under the manipulation of the U.S.  remind one of the eve of June 25, 49 years ago.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The more frantically the South Korean authorities drive the situation to the brink of war, the higher the fighting spirit of the People's Army soldiers to annihilate the aggressors is running.   The navy of the Korean People's Army warns the South Korean authorities that if they continue infiltrating their battleships into our inviolable territorial waters in defiance of our repeated warnings, they will not escape from annihilating blows. \r\n\r\n"

On this day papers here come out with editorials.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An editorial of Rodong Sinmun says:   The U.S. imperialists made desperate efforts to destroy the DPRK in its cradle by mobilizing over two million strong armed forces including their aggressor forces, the \"ROK\" army and troops of its 15 satellite states. But under the outstanding and tested leadership of the great leader Kim Il Sung, the Korean people and the people's army inflicted an ignominious bitter defeat upon them and firmly defended the country's independence and national sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are now smashing all the moves of the imperialists and reactionaries to stifle the DPRK and firmly defending the dignity and honor of the socialist fatherland.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to convert armistice into durable peace and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country the Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government have put forward most reasonable and realistic proposals and policies and made every sincere effort for their realization since truce. But none of them has been realized due to the anti-peace, anti-reunification moves of the United States and the South Korean ruling quarters, the editorial says, and goes on:    The United States is pursuing its \"policy of strength\", a leftover of the Cold War era, while talking about \"end of the Cold War\" and \"detente\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its \"operation plan 5027-98\" is a dangerous war scenario and war document for surprise preemptive strikes at the north.   The Balkan War started by the U.S.-led NATO was a preliminary war, a test war to undertake the second Korean war.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists threatened \"chastisement\" after floating fictions about someone's \"suspected underground nuclear facilities\" and \"threat of missile\" behind the curtain of the \"four-way talks\".   The situation urgently demands the establishment of a new peace-keeping mechanism between the DPRK and the United States to prevent another war and ensure durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present South Korean \"regime\" under the mask of \"people\" is increasingly depending on foreign forces and zealously pursuing confrontation with the north, paying no heed to the DPRK's sincere efforts and the desire of the fellow countrymen for national reconciliation and unity and peaceful reunification of the country.  It is leading the situation in Korea to the brink of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The triangular military alliance of the United States, Japan and South Korea has been put into motion to start a war against the north and the Japanese reactionaries keen on reinvasion have become more undisguised in their anti-DPRK hostile acts.   If the United States and its followers finally ignite a war, defying our repeated warnings, the Korean people will wipe out the aggressors to the last man by mobilizing all potentials built up for scores of years and achieve the historical cause of national reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson in an editorial says that only victory and glory are always in store for the Korean people who are dynamically advancing to build socialism and achieve national reunification under the leadership of the great leader Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

Looking back on the disastrous war provoked by the U.S. , the Korean people cannot repress surging indignation against them.   It was part of the U.S.'s old ambition for world supremacy to destroy the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its cradle and turn Korea into their advanced base to execute their Asian strategy.   Ever since their occupation of South Korea in September, 1945 the U.S. have been bent on preparations to invade the north.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A proof of this was their plan to \"invade the north.\" It was planned to simultaneously launch the invasion of the north on all fronts along the 38th parallel in around July or August, 1949.   The U.S. ordered the South Korean Army to make every effort to carry out this plan for aggression.  Under the plan several ports including naval bases in Inchon, Pusan, Ryosu and Jinhae turned into \"temporary mobile bases\" for the U.S. pacific fleet and the construction of many air bases was pushed ahead.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, aggressor armed forces were massively reinforced in the areas along the 38th parallel where the north and the south were in confrontation and armed assault was frequently committed against the north. The number of cases of armed provocations reached more than 2,600 in the year of 1949.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S.'s war moves reached the climax entering the 1950s.   Notorious war-monger Dulles flew into South Korea as a special envoy of U.S. president Truman on June 17 to examine the South Korean Army's war preparations and finally okayed the operation plan to invade the north at the end of his inspection of the area along the 38th parallel.   On the basis of these long preparations for invasion, the U.S. and the Syngman Rhee  clique started an all-out armed invasion against the DPRK at dawn of June 25, 1950.  \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tour has been suspended owing to misdeeds of the South Korean authorities who seek a sinister political purpose. In this regard, the spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) released a statement today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:   As already known,  the South Korean authorities on June 20 included such ill-intentioned elements as Min Yong Mi in the Mt. Kumgang tour, which had been arranged by the KAPPC and Hyun Dai Business Group out of warm compatriotic feelings, in an attempt to tempt northerners to defect to the south.  Worse still, they openly conducted a smear campaign against the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an unpardonable intentional anti-north misbehaviour made by the South Korean authorities for the purpose of laying obstacles in the way of non-governmental activities sponsored by the KAPPC and the Hyun Dai Business Group and thus frustrating the Mt. Kumgang tour.   According to results of an investigation by our competent organ, Min Yong Mi admitted that she preached \"defection\" during her Mt. Chumming tour and begged for lenient forgiveness for her criminal act.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Her crime should have been judged according to the DPRK law, but the KAPPC decided to send her back to South Korea in consideration of desires of the South Koreans to visit Mt. Kumgang as early as possible and of its relations with the Hyun Dai Business Group. This represents our magnanimous compatriotic measure.\r\n   It is also thanks to sincere efforts of the Hyun Dai side that min can return home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will warmly welcome South Korean tourists of Mt. Kumgang with compatriotic feelings but will not pardon anyone  involved in the anti-north plot of the South Korean authorities as evidenced by the recent case.   The South Korean authorities should immediately give up a sinister political attempt to use the Mt. Kumgang tour for an anti-north purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This time, too, the South Korean authorities had been engaged in smear campaign against the north like a thief crying \"stop thief \"  they went the length of alleging that it is a calculated provocation based on leading the examinee to answer questions. We warn once again that they should clearly know they will get nothing from the moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never tolerate any attempt of the South Korean authorities  to attain their ulterior political purpose by poking their noses into the non-governmental tour of Mt. Kumgang which is pushed ahead by the KAPPC and the Hyun Dai Business Group out of warm compatriotic feelings.  \r\n\r\n"
