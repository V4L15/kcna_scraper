Korean Warmongers' Scenario for Preemptive Nuclear Attack\r\n Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- Frightened by the rapid development of the nuclear force of the DPRK, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group were closeted again recently over the issue of carrying out the \"three-phase tailored deterrence strategy\" for taking what they called a \"high-profile action to cope with the nuclear issue of the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says that their open talk about the implementation of the above-said strategy is, in fact, little short of a declaration of a nuclear war against the DPRK with all type war means including nukes involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The essence of the above-mentioned strategy to be carried out under the pretext of \"proactively coping with the nuclear crisis\" is to mount a surprise preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They classify \"the nuclear crisis\" into three phases: \"threatening phase,\" \"phase of impending use of nukes\" and \"phase of their actual use.\" In case the second phase is judged, it calls for making a preemptive nuclear strike. Herein lies the danger of this war scenario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The second phase seems to be very ambiguous as it is bereft of any objective standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that nuclear mushroom clouds may gather in the air over the Korean peninsula anytime due to the slightest misjudgment of the warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation eloquently proves once again that it was absolutely just when the DPRK has bolstered up its nuclear deterrence in every way under the banner of the line of simultaneously developing the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those warlike forces would be well advised not to misjudge the tremendous military muscle of the DPRK with nuclear force as its pivot strong enough to blow up the whole of the American empire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strategy touted by the trigger-happy forces will serve as a prelude to the nightmare of reducing the White House and Chongwadae to ashes."

On the other hands, they nearly dissolved the mechanisms for north-south cooperation which had remained in their names only.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the restructuring of mechanisms, the Park Geun Hye group of traitors definitely turned the puppet Ministry of Unification into the one for confrontation against reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows their reckless frenzy that has reached an extreme phase in doing harm to the fellow countrymen in the north and in escalating confrontation with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By kicking off the \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK, they are working hard to put a stumbling block in the way of the DPRK which is advancing like the wind along the wide avenue of Songun for a sure victory.
