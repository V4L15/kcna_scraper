            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Sinchon Museum\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 25 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, supreme leader of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, gave field guidance to the Sinchon Museum, an epitome of history showing the brutality and cruelty of the U.S. imperialists and class enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he came to the museum to arouse the servicepersons and civilians of the country to an all-out anti-U.S. struggle by intensifying the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. education and class education among them in keeping with the requirements of the prevailing situation and the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling the day in November 1998 when he visited the museum in company with Generalissimo Kim Jong Il, he went round its main building and tombs of 400 mothers and 102 children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The massacres committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in Sinchon evidently showed that they are cannibals and homicides seeking pleasure in slaughter, he said, adding that the Korean people would never forget the brutal atrocities committed by the U.S. murderers and class enemies in Sinchon and many other areas of the northern half of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said that illusion about the enemy just means death and any slightest illusion about the enemy may lead to the renunciation of the revolution and eventually spoil it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. imperialism is the arch-villain of aggression which came into being and got fattened with aggression and plundering, he pointed out. Its nature and brutality as an aggressor remain unchanged forever, and if there is any change today, it has got more insidious and crafty in the method to satisfy its greed for aggression, he said, stressing that to intensify the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. education and class education at present is vital to the prospect of the Korean revolution and the destiny of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He further said: To intensify the class education is more urgent today when the younger generation, who experienced neither exploitation and oppression nor the stern trials of war, have emerged the driving force of the revolution. The class education should not be delayed or neglected for a moment though time passes and generations are replaced, but it should be intensified in depth and on a permanent basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As fish cannot live without water, it is impossible to think about sovereign life of people and dignity and value of human beings without anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. education and class education, he said, stressing that victory of the revolution and socialism mainly depends on how to conduct such education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to deeply implant the DPRK army and people with the strong anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. class consciousness and the outlook on the principal enemy so as to firmly defend the stronghold of the revolution and class position and achieve the final victory of the Korean revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He urged the party and working people's organizations to intensify the class education among the party members and other working people, well aware of why the Workers' Party of Korea attaches importance to the class education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said if the class education is to be intensified, it is important to build up the Sinchon Museum and other class education centers across the country and deepen the education through them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sinchon Museum should be rebuilt into a model of class education centers and data and evidence pieces be displayed well in a scientific way there, he said, adding the museum should be equipped with all facilities for convenience of visitors to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Visit to the museum should be organized under a meticulous plan and the efficacy of revenge-vowing meetings at the powder depot, tomb of 400 mothers and tomb of 102 children in Pamnamu (chestnut) Village, which testify to the enemy's atrocities, should be raised to make the visitors nurse surging hatred and revenge upon the enemy, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The supreme leader stressed the need for lecturers at the museum to enhance their responsibility and role in ensuring the class education. Those lecturers are core of the WPK and career revolutionaries as they always stand at the outpost of class education, no matter whether they are recognized or not, implanting the class consciousness into the party members and other working people and servicepersons, he said, adding that deep attention should be paid to their living conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He met Ju Sang Won, who survived at the powder depot of Pamnamu Village, used as a killing place by the U.S. imperialist aggressors during the Korean War, and has served at the museum for decades, and Pak Yong Suk who has been active as a lecturer of the museum for 23 years, and gave pep talks to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un had a photo session with the officials and employees of the museum, expressing belief that they would creditably discharge their heavy yet honorable duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Kim Ki Nam, Han Kwang Sang, Ri Jae Il, Kim Yo Jong and Pak Myong Chol."
