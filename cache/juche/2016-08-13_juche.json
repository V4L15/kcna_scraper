He was pleased to see the mass production of not only paints of diverse colors for exterior and interior walls as well as metals and wood but also Terracottem, substance for ameliorating soil and supplementing moisture, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that by putting the production of acrylic paints on a normal footing it has become possible to supply quality paints to different fields of national economy, he sent thanks to the officials, scientists, technicians and workers of the Ministry of Chemical Industry, the Sunchon Chemical Complex, the Namhung Chemical Designing Institute and Kim Chaek University of Technology in the name of the Party Central Committee for their big contribution to the building of the precious production process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need to direct sustained big efforts to developing the chemical industry on the basis of the success achieved, he specified tasks and ways for putting the production of chemical goods on Juche-basis at a high level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present when the imperialists are becoming ever more undisguised in their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK as they do not wish to see us be well-off and thrive, we can count only on our own efforts and nobody is willing to help us, he said, noting that if one believes in one's own strength, even a thousand miles looks very short but even a mile looks a very long distance if one believes in other's efforts and only when we display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance, can we achieve the greatest success even under the worst conditions and vigorously advance our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the officials and workers of the Complex would dynamically take the lead in the drive for implementing the decision of the Seventh Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea. Then he had a photo session with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Premier Pak Pong Ju and Ri Mu Yong, vice-premier and minister of Chemical Industry."

Traitor Park has left no means untried to introduce THAAD into south Korea by deceiving the public at any cost though she knows that it is good for nothing. Lurking behind this is her ill-minded intention to make all Koreans fall victim to the U.S. policy of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD is not for protecting the lives of the south Korean people but for shielding the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea and a source of trouble that will only serve the purpose of the U.S. policy of seeking to dominate the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia. This fact can by no means be covered up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park would be sadly mistaken if she calculates she can calm down the enraged public including the inhabitants of Songju County with the above-said rhetoric. She cannot but be called a wicked traitor without an equal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only solution to the controversial issue of THAAD lies in scrapping the decision to deploy THAAD bringing a nuclear disaster to the south Korean people and in resolutely eliminating the group of traitors that created such danger on behalf of all Koreans, not in \"examining the third place.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north, the south and abroad desirous of peace against war will have to stage a more dynamic struggle to foil the reckless moves of the Park group to deploy THAAD, the thrice-cursed crime challenging the nation and history."
