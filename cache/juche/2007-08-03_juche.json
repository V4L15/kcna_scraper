The last more than decade was a glorious period in which the trust of the army and the people in the party have grown incomparably deeper and the single-minded unity of the party, the army and the people stronger than ever before.

It is based on the principle of national independence reflected in the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence serves as a fundamental principle of national reunification as it is most just and realistic and has tremendous vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle originated from the intrinsic requirement for settling the issue of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation was split into two by foreign forces and is still suffering from the division. If the foreign forces are allowed to interfere in the issue of Korean reunification, the issue can never be settled as they are hell-bent on the moves against reunification in a bid to pursue confrontation between the north and the south of Korea and seek the permanent division of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be impossible to achieve national unity and reunification without independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence is based on a scientific clarification of the role to be played by a driving force in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force for national reunification is none other than the Korean nation itself. It is the Koreans who have undergone pain and misfortune resulting from the division of the country and it is again Koreans who ardently desire for national reunification and wish to live in the reunified land. Therefore, no others can be responsible for the issue of reunification but the Korean nation which has vital interests in the movement for the reunification of the country and no one can replace the Korean nation in the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should be responsible for the movement for national reunification and play such role. This means letting the Korean nation take the initiative in settling the issue of reunification, not allowing any foreign forces to interfere in the internal issue of the Korean nation but settling all matters of the nation by its concerted efforts. In other words, it is the Juche-oriented role to firmly maintain the independent stand and adhere to the principle of independence in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence reflects the noble and patriotic idea and mentality of the members of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This principle is most scientific and just one for reunification as it is based on the intrinsic requirements for settling the reunification issue and the role of the driving force in the movement for national reunification and reflects the patriotic idea and feelings of the Koreans, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
