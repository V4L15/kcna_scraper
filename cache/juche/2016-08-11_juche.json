It had better bear in mind that its peddling \"threat from the north's nukes\" here and there would get it nowhere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that the whole of south Korea is bound to turn into a theatre of a nuclear war to be launched by the U.S. and the south Korean people will be put at greater peril as long as top-class pro-U.S. lackey Park Geun Hye stays in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans are called upon to resolutely bury Park Geun Hye group, disgrace to the nation and troublemaker of the international community, to defuse the ever-increasing danger of U.S. nuclear war against the DPRK and preserve peace on the peninsula and in the region."

It also serves as a touchstone to distinguish the pro-reunification forces from the anti-reunification forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why all Koreans at home and abroad and the international community expressed positive support and response to the proposal and have made efforts to make it successful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is only the ruling forces of south Korea that are swimming against this trend.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye regime has flatly turned down the proposal, describing it as a \"strategy for the united front\" and \"bogus peace offensive.\" It has got desperate in blocking the activities of people of various circles in south Korea including the South Headquarters of the Pan-National Alliance for Korea's Reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the vicious obstructions of the puppet regime, the preparatory work for the joint conference has faced serious difficulties and the formation of the pan-national joint preparatory committee has been delayed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves that the puppet regime is working hard to chill the desire of the fellow countrymen to the last by pursuing the wild ambition for \"unification of social systems\" and \"unification through absorption.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known to everybody, the proposal of the DPRK was prompted by its single patriotic desire to defuse the decades-long north-south confrontation and antagonism, distrust and hostility and to write a new history of independent reunification by joining hands with each other and through bold practice. There is no reason for any member of the nation to refuse to respond to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is unjustifiable anti-national and anti-reunification act for the puppet regime to turn down the just proposal of the DPRK and obstruct the preparations of political parties, organizations and individual personages in south Korea for opening the joint conference\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with making the June 15 national joint event abortive, the Park regime is getting desperate in its moves to disturb the preparations for the joint conference. The regime is, indeed, a group of traitors who are utterly indifferent to the interests of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group, seized with sycophancy towards the U.S. and the wild ambition for achieving \"unification through absorption,\" is ceaselessly introducing nuclear war hardware including THAAD into south Korea, rendering the situation extremely tense, and desperately resorting to risky moves to do harm to the lives and security of all Koreans, playing the role of a shock brigade of the U.S. in carrying out its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the group persistently toes the U.S. policy and escalates the confrontation with the compatriots in the north in disregard of the strong desire of all Koreans for reunification, it will never be able to escape isolation, ruin and stern punishment by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can ever check the dynamic advance of all Koreans to achieve independent reunification by rejecting outside forces and pooling their efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great national conference for reunification is sure to open."
