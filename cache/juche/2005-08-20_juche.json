This is a blatant provocative act prompted by a sinister intention to put the whole of Korea under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to awake from a day-dream.\r\n If they opt for reinvasion of Korea, seized by militarist zeal for reinvasion, they will only suffer a defeat much more miserable than what they did 60 years ago.\r\n They should face up to the reality and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
