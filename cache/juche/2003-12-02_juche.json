            "content": "U.S. Urged to Accept Simultaneous Action and Package Solution \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- The denucleariation of the Korean peninsula must be realized not by action to words but by action to action according to the proposal for a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous action. This is the essential principle and method of the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula and the stand and attitude the DPRK and the U.S. should take at the six-way talks.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary, the gist of which reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's proposal for a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous action elaborates on the blueprint of a package solution and the order of simultaneous action to comprehensively and fairly settle the nuclear issue including the U.S. switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the DPRK's renunciation of its nuclear program and opening of diplomatic relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula cropped up when the U.S. shipped nuclear weapons into south Korea. The U.S., a possessor of nuclear weapons, compelled the DPRK to leave the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty by failing to honor its commitments and obligations as regards the fundamental settlement of the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK and infringing upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. The self-defensive measure was taken by the DPRK as the U.S. totally scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To shun the package solution based on the principle of simultaneous action means adherence to the demand for \"renouncing the nuclear program first\" and to the scheme to stifle the DPRK. This is, to all intents and purposes, opposition to the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. The U.S. demand that the DPRK drop \"the nuclear program first\" means that the DPRK should lay down arms and work for the U.S. as a servant. The DPRK can never accept it. It would rather die than having peace in exchange for slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's blueprint of a package solution is simple, clear-cut and fair. It is the DPRK's stand that both sides should lay down arms at the same time and co-exist in peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should make the bold political decision to accept the proposal for a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous action at an early date.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- 55 years have passed since the fabrication of the \"security law\" (SL), an anti-national and anti-reunification fascist law in south Korea.\r\n In this connection Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed article: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The existence of such a medieval evil law as the SL, which has done harm to the nation and people, is quite contrary to the trend of the times and the demand of the nation. The abolition of the SL is an urgent demand of the times and the nation and an essential task the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SL was enacted by pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese elements and other traitors to the nation including Syngman Rhee under the pretext of the so-called \"state security\" on December 1, 1948. It is a fascist and anti-reunification evil law aimed at suppressing the patriotic and democratic activities of the south Korean people and blocking national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive chief executives of south Korea have used the SL or fascist leverage to pursue their confrontation with the north and anti-reunification policy and a legal tool to keep their power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in south Korea and all other compatriots have waged an incessant struggle for the abolition of the SL since it was fabricated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification to keep the SL any longer now that the north and the south are in the relationship of achieving mutual reconciliation and cooperation for independent reunification in the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abolition of the SL is a touchstone distinguishing reunification or division, reconciliation or confrontation democracy of fascism, and patriotism or treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole nation should wage a vigorous nation-wide struggle to get the SL repealed at an early date and ensure that no fascist evil law exists on this land any longer.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Not Qualified to Participate in Six-way Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- Japan is working hard to include the \"abduction issue\" in the agenda of the six-way talks.\r\n Abe, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, and other heavyweights of Japan on various occasions worked hard to galvanize public opinion saying that the \"abduction issue should be discussed in the six-way talks\" and \"it is necessary to comprehensively settle abduction, nuclear and missile issues\" in reference to the agenda of the next round of the talks. They are busy with diplomacy to solicit support of different countries for its claim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an improper act intended to use the talks for attaining Japan's sinister aim and deliberately creating an obstacle in the way of the talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, Japan is not interested in the earlier negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. It is related to the sinister political and military purposes sought by the ruling circles of Japan at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has worked hard to turn the domestic political trend to the right and step up its militarization under the pretext of the nuclear issue on the Korea peninsula. It is its contention that a solution to the nuclear issue and the defusion of the tension there would make the theory of a \"threat from north Korea\" no longer sound plausible as Tokyo has used it as a good excuse for executing its strategy to emerge a military giant including nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That's why Japan is paying attention to the \"abduction issue\" only while deliberately ignoring the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"abduction issue\" much publicized by Japan is concerned, the issue is an abnormal one raised amidst the long-standing hostile relationship between the DPRK and Japan as the latter has pursued a hostile policy toward the former for over half a century while refusing to redeem the crimes committed by the latter against Koreans in the past. This issue had already been settled with the adoption of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration as a momentum and therefore, there is no ground whatsoever for Japan to link this issue to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the U.S. is backing Japan in its moves to include the \"abduction issue\" in the agenda of the six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact that U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld, U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Kelly and others recently visited Japan one after another and asserted that the U.S. would support Japan in raising abduction cases. \r\n This can not be construed otherwise than a revelation of a sinister intention of the U.S. to deliberately create an obstacle in the way of the next round of the talks by placing the issue on its agenda just as it did at the previous Beijing talks during which it further complicated the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue, a thorny one, by raising Japan-proposed \"abduction issue\" at them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not be allowed to participate in the talks as it is persistently trying to bring up the \"abduction issue\" for discussion at the talks, backed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan abducted and forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million Koreans in the past. Pretending not to know about this hard fact it is vociferating about the abduction of a few Japanese in a bid to poke its nose into the talks and create a complication there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis behaviour has deprived Japan of any qualification to be a trustworthy dialogue partner.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
