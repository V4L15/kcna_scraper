This is aimed to make \"nuclear and missile threat from North Korea\" a fait accompli and support its assertion that its moves to establish the \"missile defense\" system is a \"measure necessary\" to cope with this \"threat.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. seeks through the \"missile defense\" system to deploy missiles in its mainland and different regions and countries of the world in a bid to have a military edge over other powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the same time, it tries to draw world public attention to the DPRK and divert elsewhere watchful eyes focussed on Washington. But this can not go down with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the nuclear and missile threat. It is the U.S. which tops the list of nukes and missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is in the belligerent relationship with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has neither declared a halt to providing nuclear umbrella to South Korea nor shown any willingness to withdraw its troops from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its nuclear weapons and missiles, wherever they are deployed, will be targeted at us. \r\n  The U.S. should stop its reckless moves to establish the \"missile defense\" system and drop its wild dream of world domination. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Recent collections of cultural relics \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean Folklore Museum now displays a recent collection of cultural relics from Koryo (918-1392) and the Ri dynasty (1392-1910). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The collection gives a glimpse of Korean customs and craftsmanship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among them, the finest articles of academic interest are a celadon tray with relievoed child figures, a celadon bowl, a brass mirror with a relievoed twin-dragon design, a brass kettle, as well as women's padded jacket, padded pajamas and footware. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The celadon tray with relievoed child figures, 18.5 cm across and 6.8 cm tall, is elegant in shape, color and design. It gradually becomes wide slanting from the bottom that joins the wide-flung top at a nearly vertical angle, the whole effect reminiscent of a full-blown flower. The jade-green tray has a relievo of three adorable children capering in the grapevines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The celadon bowl, 14.5 cm across and 6 cm tall, is an enticing jade green, coated with transparent glaze. It is a major source of knowledge about early-Koryo celadon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The brass mirror with a twin dragon relievo is a round, relatively large mirror, 23.7 cm across that is preserved in perfect original state without any trace of damage. The front side is smooth and well polished enough to mirror any object, while the back side has a hook for a string in the middle, the hook surrounded by two flying dragons in bold relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The brass kettle, 23.5 cm tall, has a round body with a long thick neck and a spout and handle on opposite side, thus giving an admirable symmetrical effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The women's padded jacket and sleeping-gown from the Ri dynasty were collected from Singwang-ri in Haeju city, South Hwanghae Province. Made of silk, the jacket is 66 cm long and larger-sized than others of its kind. It is believed that these relics belong to the later 15th and early 16th centuries, in view of the age of the tomb from which they were discovered and their styles. This fashion of dress is visible only in the tomb murals of Koguryo (277 bc-ad 668), but these dresses are the only real mementos ever discovered, therefore of academic value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A pair of shoes was also unearthed at Singwang-ri, the first ever kind of footware from a Ri-dynasty tomb. This confirms that the dead were apparently provided with necessary objects such as shoes in the early period of the ri dynasty. Through this an idea of every phase of life in those days can be gained. \r\n\r\n"

Korean rulers hit for their move to erect Syngman Rhee's  bust \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the central committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement today in connection with the furore caused by the recent passage of the \"bill on erecting\" a bust of Syngman Rhee through the \"National Assembly\" of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Originally the South Korean rulers tried to pass the \"bill\" through the \"National Assembly\" in 1998 which marked its 50th anniversary. They failed to do so in face of strong opposition from public circles of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This time they decided to erect Syngman Rhee's  bust at the building of the \"National Assembly\" by railroading the \"bill\" in the absence of 118 \"assemblymen\" from the ruling and opposition parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is clear evidence that the present \"people's government\" of South Korea is following in the footsteps of the Syngman Rhee pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous regime as such move is intended to openly call back the departed soul of the traitor who met a miserable end, sternly judged by the South Korean people for his hideous crimes against the country and the nation, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It must not go unnoticed that such move was taken by them at a time when public circles are becoming more critical of the present chief executive who initiated to build a \"memorial\" for Park Chung-hee, a pro-Japanese, pro-U.S. stooge,  and held the post of the \"honorary chairman\" of the \"memorial society for Park Chung-hee\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland brands these base moves of the self-proclaimed \"people's government\" rulers as an intentional anti-national criminal act to call back the departed soul of the pro-U.S., pro-Japanese ringleaders and  virulent challenge to the aspiration and desire of all the fellow countrymen for independence, democracy and reunification, and bitterly denounces them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Today the South Korean rulers are keen on eulogizing traitors to hurt public feelings. They seek in this to curry favour with the pro-U.S., pro-Japanese forces and garner \"votes\" from them in the \"National Assembly election\" slated for April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should know well what a miserable end their predecessors met and discontinue at once such a despicable farce as erecting Syngman Rhee's  bust and building \"memorial\" for Park Chung-hee. \r\n\r\n"

To create a favorable atmosphere for the negotiations as well as for successful high-level talks between the two countries, the DPRK took an initiative of declaring moratorium on missile test-fire in September last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the U.S. conducted the test of missile interceptor this time. It is one more grave challenge to magnanimity and good faith shown by the DPRK in its efforts to settle the outstanding issues through negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. behavior has compelled the DPRK to take our moratorium into a serious consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will make an appropriate decision, watching its future movement. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
