The chief executive of south Korea in a recent meeting of puppet ministers of foreign affairs and security made much fuss, taking emergency measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Minju Joson Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sovereignty and dignity of the countries and nations are useless if they have not powerful deterrence for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the vital issue directly linked with the destiny of the nation and the greatest state affair for the DPRK to bolster up nuclear deterrence for self-defence as it has made the revolution and construction despite the U.S. imperialists' nuclear and threat for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence serves as the almighty treasured sword greatly contributing to peace and security not only on the Korean peninsula but in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that it is irrefutable that if the ballistic missiles from strategic submarines are to go on a serial production and be deployed in a near future, peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia will be consolidated so much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's talking about emergency measures and \"responding proposals\" is nothing but a poor trick to invent a pretext and excuse for igniting a nuclear war against the DPRK in league with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel and people of the DPRK will never pardon such attempt of the warmongers but continue developing Korean-style powerful deterrence for self-defence and deal a deadly sledge-hammer at the provocateurs and aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group would be well advised to act with discretion, bearing deep in mind that the military nexus with the U.S. will bring a final ruin."

Korean Puppet Forces' Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights\" Racket\r\n Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The south Koran puppet group in a recent UN \"seminar on human rights in north Korea\" in the U.S. malignantly slandered the dignified social system of the DPRK. Meanwhile, it is working hard to railroad the \"bill on human rights in the north\" through the \"National Assembly\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday in an article says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket is a criminal act of treachery to realize the ambition of \"unification of social systems\" while standing against the national reconciliation, unity and independent reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also a total denial of the idea and social system of the DPRK and a vicious politically-motivated provocation against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the people-centered socialist system of our own style is the most advantageous, we do not force it on south Korea and have never done so. If one's own idea and social system are to be forced on the other, it will bring about confrontation and war only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the DPRK urged the south Korean authorities not to seek the \"unification of social systems\" fanning up distrust and conflict between the north and the south and stop insulting the social system of the other party and asking other countries to do harm to the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities, however, are working hard to stifle the DPRK in league with foreign forces, malignantly slandering the idea and social system of the DPRK under the pretext of \"human rights\". This is a mockery and insult to the genuine human rights and a total denial and challenge to the dignified socialist system of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces' anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket is unworkable and will bring them ruin."
