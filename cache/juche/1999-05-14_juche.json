Under his leadership Korea, which suffered an eclipse on the world map, could put an end to the history of the nation's ordeals forced by the Japanese imperialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He loved the people most, always considering them as heaven and set up the best country of Juche in the world, the socialist system centering on the popular masses.\r\n   All the popular policies in Korea could be pursued only by the respected  Kim Il Sung who made it a maxim to believe in the people as in heaven and by the great leader Kim Jong Il.    Kim Il Sung is highly praised by all people for devoting his whole life to the happiness of the people and global independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Inspecting the international friendship exhibition, I more deeply felt his greatness in my heart. As he performed great exploits for the era and humankind the mind of humankind following and revering him is so strong.\r\n   The mind of the world people yearning after him will be invariable even after the lapse of long time and he will always live in the hearts of all people as the sun.  \r\n\r\n"

The U.S.-led NATO forces are now making indiscriminate air raids on Yugoslavia for the mere reason that Belgrade refuses to accept brigandish demands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While unhesitatingly committing military terrorist acts against a sovereign state, the U.S. is trying to list the DPRK as a \"sponsor state of terrorism.\" this is a brigandish and dastardly misbehaviour.   The United States is a hotbed, organizer, executor and sponsor of terrorism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, the U.S. is impudently hurling mud at other nations over terrorism.   Its refusal to exclude the DPRK from the \"list of terrorist states\" reveals its intention to intensify its hostile policy toward the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Motivated by an ulterior intention to commit a new state terrorism against the DPRK, the U.S. has staged joint military exercises together with Japan and South Korea, reinforcing its armed forces in and around South Korea.\r\n   Falsity is always exposed by truth.\r\n   The United States had better mind its own business. \r\n\r\n"
