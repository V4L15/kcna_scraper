It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 26 the Park Geun Hye group blustered that it would opt for \"stronger pressure\" to \"allure the north to change\", revealing independent \"financial sanctions on the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though the DPRK government in a statement clarified the will for improving the inter-Korean relations, the puppet group is keen to intensify military tie-ups with the U.S. and Japanese masters, while vociferating about \"nuclear threat from the north\" and \"human rights issue\" almost every day. The puppet group including Park Geun Hye, the puppet prime minister and the foreign minister claimed that \"north's nukes will bring isolation and sanctions only\" and it is \"anachronistic\", malignantly slandering the DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the June 25 Korean war as a momentum, the puppet military warmongers once again test-fired ballistic missile aimed at \"striking the whole of the north\" and introduced U.S. nuclear submarine Michigan to Pusan, opening its interior. Recently, they dared bluster that they would turn \"concept for operating military muscle\" into the orientation to mount preemptive strike at core facilities of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such confrontational racket kicked off by the Park group is a heinous one blatantly challenging the principled stand of the DPRK and a treacherous crime driving the north-south relations into the uncontrollable worst phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is reaching a hair-raising crisis of war due to the reckless moves of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will not pardon the provocative moves of the Park group deliberately foiling the inter-Korean relations and inciting a war fever in order to attain its despicable political purpose but sternly punish it in the name of the entire nation. Provokers will face merciless punishment and miserable ruin."

            "content": "MINREX denuncia difamacion anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos\r\nPyongyang, 27 de junio (ACNC) --  A la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC formulada en relacion con que ultimamente, el Departamento de Estado norteamericano volvio a difamar la digna RPDC al publicar el llamado \"reporte anual de DDHH\", el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio la vispera la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 25, el asistente del secretario para democracia, derechos humanos y trabajo del susodicho departamento hablo del \"cambio\" de la RPDC cuestionando con malignidad el llamado \"problema de DDHH\" de ella en una rueda de prensa especial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSus palabras revelaron una vez mas el malsano intento de EE.UU. de lograr, cueste lo que cueste, su ambicion de derrumbar el regimen socialista a estilo coreano centrado en las masas populares bajo el vistoso rotulo de la \"defensa de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo le agradaria a Estados Unidos preso del arraigado veto y la hostilidad a la RPDC, el verdadero aspecto del socialismo mas ventajoso en este mundo en que todas las personas llevan una vida dichosa gozando a sus anchas de la libertad y derechos politicos verdaderos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pais norteamericano esta sonando con que podria ocurrir algun \"cambio\" en el interior de la RPDC, lo cual significa coger con la mano la nube.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe intensificara por todos medios el poderio militar de la RPDC y el pueblo coreano gozara de todas las felicidades del socialismo. Esto sera el cambio que experimentara el pais norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que EE.UU. sigue recurriendo a la politica hostil anti-RPDC, esta tambien tomara las contramedidas intransigentes para frustrarlo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera claramente como la RPDC frustra las maquinaciones de aislamiento y aplastamiento anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos."
