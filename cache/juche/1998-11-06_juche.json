Kumgang runs into some trouble in waters of the north is under \"consideration between the north and south.\"   \r\n   This campaign of the South Korean authorities against the north is an intolerable provocation to the north as well as another drama directed by the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" against the north in a bid to foil Mt. Kumgang tourism, part of cooperation between civic bodies in the north and south.\r\n   We make it clear that the South Korean authorities' remarks about \"north-south joint rescue zone under consideration\" are groundless. \r\n   Parties that discuss and push ahead with the issue of Mt. Kumgang tourism are civic bodies in the north and south.\r\n   It is needless for authorities to poke their nose into the work between civic bodies.\r\n   Worse still, the \"chief of the naval general staff\" openly cried for the commitment of their forces to waters of the north, talking about somebody's \"terrorism,\"  \"kidnapping,\" \"gun firing and demonstration of armed forces\" upon  the tourist ship to Mt. Kumgang.\r\n   Terrorism, kidnapping and gun firing have nothing to do with us.\r\n   These are the practices used by the South Korean authorities.\r\n   Underlying their campaign is an ill-intentioned purpose to hinder the tourism by drumming terror and unrest into the people, foil the tourism by inventing a shocking accident and, in other case,  wedge \"ANSP\" agents and military gangsters into the area of the north to incite confrontation against the north  under the pretext of \"rescue of tourist ship\" \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In actuality, the DPRK and other countries are targets of activities of the U.S. troops present in east Asia.\r\n   The position and importance of the Asia-Pacific region are being stressed in the world.
