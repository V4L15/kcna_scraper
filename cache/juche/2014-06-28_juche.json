Ahora el Oceano Pacifico se convierte en el campo de competencia de las potencias mundiales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. concede gran importancia a la nueva doctrina de combate con el fin de convertir favorablemente las correlaciones de fuerza en la region y ampliar su dominio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aplicacion de AIR-SEA BATTLE en la Peninsula Coreana parte de su posicion geopolitica en la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. vino \"reestructurando\" sus tropas terrestres ocupantes del Sur de Corea, y al mismo tiempo, aumentando en gran medida las fuerzas navales y aereas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl introducir muchos armamentos ultramodernos y destacamentos de flor y nata, convirtio el suelo surcoreano en el mayor arsenal del Extremo Oriente y base avanzada para el ataque nuclear preventivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMediante la aplicacion de AIR-SEA BATTLE, el imperio pretende ubicar sus tropas estacionadas en el suelo surcoreano para favorecer el cumplimiento de su estrategia sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese contexto, los cazas A-10 y F-16 ya desplegados en el Sur de Corea seran sustituidos por los F-35.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a ello, se torna mas grave la maniobra hegemonica de EE.UU. para aplastar a la RPDC, mantener a rayas a las potencias y tomar el control politico y militar sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico mediante las acciones militares colectivas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aventura militar de EE.UU. hace mas tensa la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y se crea la crisis que puede extenderse a la guerra en cualquier momento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas circunstancias demandan fortalecer mas el disuasivo de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, gracias a la capacidad de autodefensa nacional que ha construido ya, la RPDC defiende con firmeza los intereses fundamentales de la revolucion y la dignidad del pais haciendo frente rotundo a la campana anti-RPDC de los imperialistas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que EE.UU. se obstina en atropellar con armas a la RPDC sin renunciar la politica hostil, la segunda seguira realizando grandes esfuerzos por defender la soberania nacional."
