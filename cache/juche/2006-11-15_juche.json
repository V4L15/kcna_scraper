Thousands of species of beautiful and rare flowers and plants were presented to the expo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent expo was different from those held before in the manner of show. The participating organizations laid up gardens reflecting the characteristic feature of their countries and nations in the designated portions of land and built structures and annexes of diverse styles that match their gardens on the basis of their horticultural technique and standards, while putting on display their typical flowers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials and floricultural experts of the Korean Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia Committee exhibited Kimilsungias and Kimjongilias at the \"Rose Garden\" which had been specially provided by the sponsor side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They built the \"Korean Garden\" in a peculiar and splendid manner to meet the need of architecture of Korean style and the principle of laying out parks with the help of creators and designers of the Mansudae Art Studio and the Paektusan Architectural Institute. As a result, the \"Korean Garden\" attracted the attention of world horticultural experts from the first day of the expo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organizing committee of the expo awarded gold prizes, the top prize of the expo, and diplomas to Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia each. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also presented the best prize (cup) of the expo, diploma and honorary certificate to the \"Korean Garden,\" gold prizes and diplomas to the festive gate and group sculpture of children of the \"Korean Garden,\" silver prizes to the pavilion and fountain and a bronze prize to the Korean wing of the expo. The DPRK thus received eight prizes something unprecedented in the history of world horticultural expo.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland urged this in a statement on Nov. 13.\r\n It went on: The \"National League of New Right,\" a new umbrella organization of pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea, held a \"ceremony to mark its first anniversary\" and \"a plenary meeting of its members\" on Nov. 9. Speakers there cried out for \"forming all-people alliance\" to seize \"power\" through the next presidential election. The so-called presidential candidates from the Grand National Party of south Korea in their \"congratulatory addresses\" openly disclosed their wild ambition to grab \"power.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is part of the premeditated moves to set up a pro-U.S. conservative regime by forming an alliance of pro-U.S. conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"All-people alliance\" much touted by them is a political collusion to grab \"power,\" going against the trend of the June 15 era, and a sinister treacherous, undemocratic and anti-reunification alliance of pro-U.S. conservative forces to put again the south Korean people under the dark dictatorial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is as clear as noonday that if the pro-U.S. conservative forces are allowed to come to power under the manipulation of the U.S. they will halt the process of independence and democratization in south Korea, scrap the June 15 joint declaration and bring disasters of a nuclear war to all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP and the \"National League of New Right\" and other pro-U.S. conservatives are working hard to win the favor of people in a bid to gratify their greed for \"power\" but they can never cover up their true colors as a group of stooges of the U.S., a wicked enemy of peace and reunification, a principal enemy of democratization and a group of quislings. They are fated to meet only shameful destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It noted that the U.S. oppression and sanctions against the north and the drive for implementing the \"Proliferation Security Initiative of Weapons of Mass Destruction\" are putting a block on the way of resumption of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean \"government,\" aligning itself with the U.S. hostile policy towards the north, has driven the south-north relations into catastrophe, the release said, stressing: If the U.S. really wants peace in the Korean Peninsula through dialogue, it should lift all sorts of sanctions against the north at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is their calculation that this would help them realize their wild militarist ambition left unaccomplished for several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese chief executive, when interviewed by CNN a few days ago, expressed Japan's intention to revise the constitution during the tenure of his office. And the director general of the Japan Defence Agency cried out that now is the time to rewrite Article 9 of the constitution which stipulates the war renouncement, etc. All these outcries let loose by the Japanese reactionaries were promoted by their calculation that the time has come to achieve their militarist aim unhindered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If their militarist moves are overlooked, this will not only seriously endanger the peace and stability in Northeast Asia but allow Japan to repeat such tragic history in which the Japanese imperialists ignited a war of aggression against Asian countries scores of years ago, murdering civilians and destroying everything, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed article. Citing facts, the article notes that the above-said development is clearly proved by the brigandish acts of the U.S. \r\n The U.S. imperialists are working harder than ever before to realize their wild ambition for world domination. To this end they are putting spurs to arms expansion and war preparations, prioritizing the pursuance of the policy of strength as a main lever for realizing the ambition. They are stretching their tentacles of aggression even to outer space. The spearhead of their aggressive and reactionary world strategy is directed to the anti-imperialist and independent countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' ambition for aggression finds its vivid manifestation in its policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are attaching great military and strategic importance to the Korean Peninsula in executing their policy of strength to dominate the world. They are set to use south Korea and Japan as springboards from which to fight a war against the DPRK and other countries and strongholds to maintain their system for dominating the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is the fact that the U.S. is contemplating the modification of \"CONPLAN\" called \"OPLAN 5029\" as a \"military operational plan\" to cope with a contingency on the Korean Peninsula and blustering that it is ready to carry it out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that the U.S. is poised to ignite a war in Korea and launch a world war with it as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are the aggressors who interfere in the internal affairs of Korea and war fanatics keen on provoking a new Korean war to realize its ambition for aggression against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
