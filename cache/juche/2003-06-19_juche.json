The Iraqi war proved that disarmament leads to a war. Therefore, it is quite clear that the DPRK can never accept the U.S. demand that it scrap its nuclear weapons program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already declared that it would regard any sanctions to be applied against it as a declaration of a war. The hard-line measures are not a monopoly of the U.S. If the U.S. takes the three-phase hard-line measure, the DPRK will strongly react to it from its first phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has the right to build up a nuclear deterrent force for self-defence, the commentary says, contending that it would exercise all its rights to avert a war, protect the sovereignty and security of the country and the destiny and dignity of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

The whole society is now replete with these spirits. As a result, the Korean people, united closely in ideology and purpose, are striving hard to build a great socialist country, prosperous and powerful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In five years when the country was in hard time, the Korean people, with confidence in sure victory and optimism, realigned over 236,360 hectares of land to suit the features of the socialist society and built many monumental edifices including the Kaechon-lake Thaesong Waterway, Hungju Power Station and Academy of Koryo Medicine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now the entire Korean people are pushing ahead with the socialist cause with the might of ideology under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"

Japan is getting more zealous than any other countries though it committed crimes against the Koreans in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, such plot and blockade will never work on the DPRK as it has a great Songun policy and the strong single-hearted unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, no country in the world so strictly bans the drug smuggling, counterfeiting of money, human traffic and other unethical acts as the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any contention that the DPRK may secretly sell nuclear substance and missiles to terrorist groups is a mockery of its firm stand against terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government's policy on arms export allows only strictly legal deal in weapons to meet proper requirements of sovereign states for defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless false propaganda against the DPRK is to serve the sinister political aim to justify its listing of those countries that court its displeasure as members of an \"axis of evil\" and seek any justification for its attempt at the \"regime change\" in the countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about multilateral talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is becoming clear that the U.S. loudmouthed multilateral talks are not aimed to settle the nuclear issue peacefully but to cover up its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and pressure can never go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has reached its height, it is using the multilateral talks as a smokescreen to cover up a war without gunfire and Washington is defying the unanimous demand of the international community that the U.S. and the DPRK refrain from provoking each other, a demand raised after the Beijing talks held in April last, thus unilaterally straining the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compelled the DPRK to discard any expectation for multilateral talks proposed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK once again clarifies that it has the right to immediately retaliate against any physical hostile act regarded as an act of ditching the armistice agreement and a declaration of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will put further spurs to increasing its nuclear deterrent force for self-defence as a just self-defence measure to cope with the U.S. strategy to isolate and stifle the DPRK the danger of which is increasing with each passing day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a shining exploit he performed in paving the unique way for building the revolutionary party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our single-hearted unity is a weapon of the revolution more powerful than a nuclear weapon and the strength of the party, the army and the people rallied close around the leader with one will and one purpose is invincible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the party members, officers and men of the KPA and people should unite closer around Kim Jong Il, strengthen their single-hearted unity around the headquarters of the revolution in every way and firmly consolidate the revolutionary ranks as the pure Songun revolutionary ranks that share idea, intention and destiny with him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadily strengthening the KPA politically and ideologically and in military technique provides a sure guarantee for our people to always emerge victorious in the fierce political and military showdown with imperialism and firmly defend the country, the revolution and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the domains and units should exert primary efforts to strengthen the KPA and consistently carry through the party's policy of putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should implement to the letter the party's line of giving priority to the development of the national defence industry as required by the Songun era in a bid to build up a powerful military deterrent force that protects the security of the country and the people and cement the defences of the country as firm as an iron-wall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are acting arrogantly to realize their ambition for world supremacy in defiance of human conscience, justice and international law. They are now becoming more undisguised in their military threat to the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will of our army and people that those who shake their fists should be brought under control with fists. \r\n Recalling that the army and people of the DPRK have firmly consolidated the anti-imperialist military front as an impregnable fortress under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il, the reporter stated that if the U.S. bellicose forces ignite a war of aggression against their country, they will destroy the citadel of the aggressors and win a final victory in the battle against the U.S. and thus vent the nation's pent-up grudge and take revenge upon the enemy a thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence, peace and friendship are the invariable idea of our party's foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party will as ever develop friendship and cooperation with the people of all countries of the world on the principle of independence, equality and mutual benefit and firmly unite with all progressive forces in the efforts to build an independent, peaceful and friendly new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were senior officials of the party, the state and the army.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And this time it went to the lengths of groundlessly charging the DPRK with \"flesh traffic\" in a bid to defile its system and increase pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is one more despicable charade which can be orchestrated only by the U.S. ruling quarters steeped in the hostility towards the DPRK to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature \"flesh traffic\" is something that can occur only in the American society where the fin-de-siecle tendency based on the money-is-everything principle and the jungle law prevails. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on human history, the United States is the country with the poorest human rights record as it has grown rich because of slave trade for several centuries after it was built as a result of genocide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, the height of folly for the U.S. to talk about a sort of \"flesh traffic\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such social ills are unimaginable under our socialist system under which the whole country has become a big family and the leader, the party and the masses are singleheartedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. fabricated the issue of \"flesh traffic\" to attack the dprk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an indication that the anti-DPRK racket kicked up by the U.S. while internationalizing the nuclear issue and putting its \"blockade operation\" against Pyongyang into practice has reached a senseless and reckless phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is an increasing number of refugees and flesh traffic and all other crimes and social evils are rife in various dispute-torn regions of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a product of the policy of war pursued by the Bush administration against humanity in a bid to realize its wild ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an already known fact that the U.S. intelligence bodies made sustained sinister attempts to kidnap inhabitants in border areas of our country and take them to neighboring countries and they are under open debate even at congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Desperate efforts of the U.S. to topple our social system will only touch off stronger resentment at the Bush group and harden our people's determination to resolutely defend our socialist system.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
