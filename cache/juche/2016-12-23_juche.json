Korea Released\r\n Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea released the 2016 report on human rights abuses in south Korea Friday to disclose the worst ten of many crimes committed by the south Korean Park Geun Hye regime of traitors in 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t Dealing with the thrice-cursed group abduction by the regime, the report says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime perpetrated an unheard-of high-profile crime by abducting a group of more than 10 women citizens of the DPRK working abroad to south Korea on April 5.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with it, the puppet authorities conducted a cruel and hideous \"operation to pressurize them to defect\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Censuring the regime's moves to deploy \"THAAD\" only to destroy the cradle of south Koreans, the report goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD, a U.S. lethal weapon for a nuclear war, is termed a \"weapon system with critical defects\" even within the U.S. military for transmitting strong electromagnetic waves and generating deafening engine noise that hugely affect not only human lives but also the environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Detailing the hideous human rights abuses in south Korea that plunged its people's living into destitution, the report notes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime's irregularities and corruption and incompetence crippled the economy and deteriorated the already worsening people's living in south Korea this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"State debt\" of south Korea hit an all-time high of 1.17 trillion U.S. dollars and the number of big businesses on the verge of bankruptcy at present has increased 37 percent over that in 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 2 000 minor businesses involved in the production of goods for export went bankrupt one after another. This spilled over into the whole manufacturing sector, causing at least 90 000 manufacturing companies to go bankrupt.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of the unemployed has reached more than 4.5 million or a 23.3 percent increase, compared with that three years ago. The number of the under-unemployed reached 10 million and the young jobless rate hit an all-time high of 34. 2 percent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime wantonly infringed upon the vital rights of many businessmen and workers of south Korea by totally shutting down the Kaesong Industrial Park overnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report refers to the murder of peasant Paek Nam Gi caused by fascist violence and to the disaster caused by damper germicide that gave rise to the horror of death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The damper germicide-related disaster was caused as foreign multinational businesses and puppet conglomerates put on massive sale germicide containing toxic chemicals under the pretext of killing germs in the room air, thus causing huge casualties, it notes, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of direct victims of damper germicide from January to August this year stood at 3 204 and the number of deaths showed a drastic increase to 693. The potential victims are estimated to be 290 000 at least and 2.27 million at most.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report also reveals a \"blacklist\" denounced as modern-day version of \"burning books on the classics and burying Confucian scholars alive\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hankook Ilbo of south Korea on Oct. 12 reported that Chongwadae worked out the \"blacklist\" in the field of art and literature and sent it to the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism and organizations under it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"blacklist\" reportedly contain the names of persons of culture who either signed a declaration demanding the abrogation of the \"government's enforcement ordinance\" related to the special law on the ferry Sewol disaster or supported a declaration on the situation over the disaster and of those who voted for candidates from opposition parties and independent candidates during the \"presidential\" election and Seoul mayoral election, 9 473 in all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report identifies uninterrupted child abuses in south Korea and human rights abuses within its puppet army and censures the Park Geun Hye group of traitors for their moves to nullify of the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The criminal acts of the Park Geun Hye group which rubbed salt into the wounds of the victims of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army and insulted the dignity and self-respect of the nation are thrice-cursed crimes tantamount to those committed by the \"five traitors of 1905\" who sold off the country to the Japanese imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Blasting the detestable farce for \"bill on human rights in the north\" staged by the human rights abusers, the document says that even though the Park group of traitors are working hard to tarnish the image of the DPRK by use of the worn-out bill, it will only disclose their human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report stresses that the hideous human rights abuses committed by the south Korean puppet group in 2016 would be recorded as the most cursed crimes in history."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Censures Japan's Impudent Act to Evade Responsibility for Redressing Past Crimes\r\n Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- Japan has become frantic in kicking up an anti-DPRK human rights racket over the \"abduction issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t There was a \"seminar on human rights\" under the sponsorship of the government on the pretext of \"rescuing victims abducted by north Korea\" in Kurume City, Fukuoka Prefecture on Dec. 16.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Three days later, the Japan chief Cabinet secretary announced that the Japanese government would expand from 2017 the band of shortwave radio broadcasting for the Japanese \"abducted to north Korea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an impudent act to conceal the abduction crimes rampant in the Japanese society, sweep under the carpet the hideous abduction and forcible drafting committed by Japan in the past and use the \"abduction issue\" that had already seen a solution as an excuse for evading its redemption of the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of impudence for Japan to cite \"abduction\" to ratchet up the racket for human rights against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year alone, several missing persons who had been claimed to have been \"abducted\" by the north were identified and a month ago another person who had been reported missing the blame for which was placed on the north was found out, making Japan a laughing stock of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June a police in Fukui Prefecture clarified that Kazuya Miyauchi (32 at the time of missing) who was claimed to be definitely possible to have been abducted by the north in 1997 was identified in the country and on December 1 the security department of Tokyo Police Agency clarified that Masanori Katsuki, 68, (36 at the time of missing) whose possibility of having been abducted by north Korea was acknowledged to be undeniable after he went missing in Edogawa District, Tokyo Metropolis in February 1985 was identified in the country in the latter half of November this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is the hotbed of abduction and the hideous human rights abuser and a country bereft of elementary qualifications to mention \"human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past it forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to force them into medieval sexual slavery or to be cannon fodder and mercilessly killed over one million Koreans.  What's worse, it reduced 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery, trampling down their youth and chastity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yet, the Japanese reactionaries have the face to describe themselves as \"victims of abduction\" and assert that \"liquidation of past can not be made without solution to the abduction issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has taken the lead in the moves against the DPRK by extending every year the measure for sanctions on the DPRK which it started under the pretext of \"abduction issue\". It has lent a deaf ear to the international voice calling for the redemption of its unprecedented crimes against humanity in the past and has dodged apology and reparation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by Japan in touting the \"abduction issue\" is to divert world attention to the DPRK and sweep under the carpet its own human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is now going so foolish. The liquidation of the past is not an issue of such nature which may be done or may be evaded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately Japan tries to deny the past crimes and sweep under the carpet the stark history of aggression and plunder committed by it, the more glaringly it will reveal its morally vulgar and brazen-faced nature before the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan had better face up to the trend of the times and stop such a clumsy farce aimed at evading the liquidation of the past."

            "content": "Publicado informe de investigacion sobre la violacion de DDHH en 2016 en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 23 de diciembre (ACNC) -- La Sociedad de Medidas de DDHH en el Sur de Corea de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publico el dia 23 el informe de investigacion sobre la violacion de DDHH en 2016 en el Sur de Corea para denunciar 10 de un sinnumero de los crimenes de ese tipo, cometidos por la horda traidora de Park Geun-hye en el ano en curso. \n\t\t\t\t\tAnte todo, el documento revelo el abominable secuestro colectivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 5 de abril pasado, mas de 10 ciudadanas norcoreanas, quienes trabajaban en el extranjero, fueron raptadas y llevadas en contra de su voluntad al suelo surcoreano, recuerda el informe y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, las autoridades titeres surcoreanas libraron una brutal \"operacion de sumision\" contra las secuestradas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, las tentativas de despliegue de THAAD estan acabando con la cuna de vida del pueblo surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl THAAD, arma mortifera de guerra nuclear del imperio norteamericano, emite fuertes ondas electromagneticas y ruido ensordecedor del motor que hacen tremendo dano a la vida del ser humano y al ambiente ecologico. Por esta razon, hasta el circulo militar norteamericano lo evalua como \"sistema con defectos fatales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos crimenes anti-DDHH llevaron a la quiebra la vida poblacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste ano, debido a los actos corruptos y la impotencia de la camarilla de Park, la economia surcoreana cayo en el estado moribundo y la vida del pueblo llego al nivel deplorable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"deuda estatal\" llego a un billon 170 mil millones de US$, cifra record de la historia, y el numero de las grandes empresas surcoreanas a punto de bancarrota se incremento 37% en comparacion con el ano 2012. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMas de 2 mil empresas pequenas y medianas, que se dedican a la produccion de mercancias exportables, se colapsaron en colectivo produciendo el efecto domino en la industria manufacturera en general donde ya se dieron a la quiebra mas de 90 mil entidades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl numero de desempleados llego a mas de 4 millones 500 mil,  23. 3% mas en comparacion con 2013. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el Sur de Corea hay nada menos que 10 millones de subempleados y la tasa de desempleados jovenes marco 34.2%, record de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa medida de la camarilla de Park que cerro brusca y totalmente la Zona Industrial de Kaesong violo flagrantemente el derecho a subsistencia de muchos empresarios y obreros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl asesinato del campesino Paek Nam Gi fue producto de la represion violenta y fascista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe ha desatado el panico a la muerte en el Sur de Corea debido al incidente de esterilizante humidificador.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de exterminar las bacterias existentes en el aire de la habitacion, una empresa multinacional extranjera y los consorcios surcoreanos vendieron gran cantidad de esterilizantes que contienen sustancias quimicas toxicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde enero hasta finales de agosto de este ano, el numero de victimas directas y muertos por el incidente se incremento a 3 mil 204 y 693, respectivamente. A esa cifra, se anaden las victimas potenciales que llegarian a 290 mil por lo menos y a 2 millones 270 mil al maximo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 12 de octubre pasado, el periodico surcoreano Hankook Ilbo dio a la publicidad que Chongwadae ha elaborado la \"lista negra\" de las figuras del circulo de literatura y arte y la remitio al Ministerio de Cultura, Deporte y Turismo y a los organos adscritos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esa lista estaban incluidos 9 mil 473 nombres de los literatos y artistas, quienes suscribieron la declaracion en demanda de la abolicion del \"proyecto de ejecucion\" del gobierno referente a la ley especial de la tragedia del ferry Sewol o apoyaron la declaracion sobre la situacion referente al mismo incidente, y de los otros que votaron a favor de los candidatos de la oposicion e independientes durante las pasadas elecciones presidenciales y las del alcalde de Seul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn suelo surcoreano se reportan sin parar los maltratos a la poblacion infantil y los actos violadores de DDHH en el ejercito titere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl hacer nulo el crimen de esclavitud sexual para el viejo ejercito japones, la banda traidora de Park hirio doblemente a las victimas y mancho la dignidad y orgullo nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste delito jamas tolerable es comparable con los crimenes cometidos por \"5 traidores de Ulsa\" que vendieron el pais a los agresores japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fabricar la abominable \"ley de DDHH del Norte\", cuya aprobacion habia sido suspendida en los anos anteriores, los partidarios de Park tratan de manchar la imagen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, esa ley repugnante no da otro resultado que revelar los crimenes anti-DDHH de ellos mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl expediente criminal anti-DDHH de este ano de los titeres surcoreanos sera registrado en la historia como la verguenza mas grande."

Asesino salvajemente a mas de un millon de coreanos y convirtio a 200 mil mujeres coreanas en esclavas sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Japon se describe como \"victima de secuestro\" y dice sin vacilacion alguna que \"no puede liquidar el pasado sin resolver el problema de secuestro\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, prorroga cada ano las medidas de sancion anti-RPDC, iniciadas bajo el pretexto del \"problema de secuestro\", y elude pedir disculpas e indemnizar sus inauditos crimenes de lesa humanidad del pasado desoyendo la demanda de la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses arman escandalo con el \"problema de secuestro\" para enfocar a la RPDC la atencion mundial y ocultar sus crimenes de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa liquidacion del pasado es el problema que debe ser resuelto sin falta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas intente Japon negar sus crimenes del pasado y dejar en el olvido de la historia sus actos de agresion y saqueo, tanto mas conocera la sociedad internacional su fachada inmoral y descarada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe ver correctamente la corriente de la epoca y parar ahora mismo sus acciones mezquinas para eludir la liquidacion del pasado."
