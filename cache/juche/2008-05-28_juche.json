            "content": "KCNA Flails Japan's Evermore Shameless Moves to Grab Tok Islet \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- Japan has become all the more brazen-faced in its moves to seize Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In February the Japanese authorities marked this islet as part of Japan's territory on the homepage of its Foreign Ministry and in May they announced their decision to designate the islet as such in \"the manuals explaining the new study guidelines\" for primary and middle schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology justified this, openly claiming that it was to help \"the younger generation who would shoulder upon themselves the future of Japan to have a correct understanding of the territory of Japan.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' intensified education in the \"dominium over Tok Islet\" proves that their criminal moves to teach young Japanese distorted history and instill territorial ambition into them in a bid to realize their sinister intention to grab Tok Islet have reached an extremely reckless phase in all aspects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years Japan made sure that the islet was described as \"part of Japan's territory\" in the textbooks for middle and high schools, openly disclosing its attempt to seize the islet, an inalienable part of Korea's territory. But it is the first time that it marked the islet as part of its territory even in the \"study guidelines\" and \"manuals\" for schools. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet has been an inalienable part of territory of Korea since the time of its ancestors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are sadly mistaken if they think they can grab Tok Islet by tampering with their history and unilaterally insisting on their assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan asserted Tok Islet's coming under the jurisdiction of Shimane Prefecture in 1905 as a \"legal ground\" for its \"dominium over Tok Islet\". But the assertion has already been proven to be hypocritical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that Tok Islet was marked as part of the territory of Korea in a textbook which was used as a teaching material for schools ranging from primary to high schools not only in Japan but in Korea and Manchuria during Japan's colonial rule over Korea was recently brought to light. There are many other data proving the injustice of Japan's \"dominium over Tok Islet\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's territorial claim to Tok Islet is a declaration of its moves for reinvasion of Korea and the revival of imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should heighten vigilance against Japan as it goes arrogant, seeking territorial expansion again against the backdrop of worldwide problem of natural resources, economic fluctuation and \"war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are greatly angered at the Japanese authorities' crafty moves to realize their ambition to grab the islet by egging the pro-Japanese sycophantic traitors in south Korea on to work harder to usher in a \"new era of Japan-south Korea relations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities had better behave with discretion, bearing deep in mind that any encroachment upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation may bring unpredictable catastrophic consequences to Japan. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are noisily advertising that the adoption of the above-said law is a measure to cope with the \"threat\" from someone in an effort to cover up the sinister aim sought by it, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country in the world poses any military \"threat\" to Japan at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries seek to realize their ambition for turning their country into a military power and their scenario for overseas expansion by hastening the space militarization under the pretext of \"threat\" form someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, they are working hard to increase the military operation capability of the SDF and build a missile shield. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves for the space militarization are a link in such chain efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are hastening the space militarization under the pretext of \"defense\" in an effort to boost the capability to make preemptive strikes at other countries including the DPRK and hold an unchallenged military edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have long advocated the military use of the space, talking about the \"right to self-defense,\" and frantically stepped up the preparations for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In collusion with the U.S. they have accelerated the moves to establish a missile defense system while giving spurs to the development and launch of spy satellites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves for space militarization are wrecking world peace and stability and sparking off an arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better stop at once the reckless moves for the space militarization, mindful that the moves will only lead to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But Japan is attributing this distrust of the international community to its \"diplomatic shortcoming\" instead of finding the reason in its refusal to liquidate its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can be said that Japan's foreign policy is characterized by its servility to the U.S. and diplomacy to win clout through the offer of money. The bid made by Japan to take a responsible post at the United Nations through subservience to the U.S. and money-manipulated diplomacy, putting the liquidation of its past on the shelf, cannot be construed otherwise than a move to emerge a political power and repeat the crime-woven history under the signboard of the UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is employing sleight of hand to get its past crimes buried into oblivion with the passage of time, but it is nothing but a folly which can be perpetrated by the politically amaurotic persons who cannot look ahead into the future even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be forced to pay for such hideous abuses of human rights as sexual slavery imposed by the Japanese imperialists against Korean women, their forcible drafting of Koreans and massacres of them, etc. under any circumstances. Japan will meet a stronger protest and denunciation from the international community and stand further isolated from it if Japan continues dodging the liquidation of its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world conscience is closely following the attitude of Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \"Alliance\" for Aggression\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today calls for bringing down the U.S. and south Korean war maniacs' alliance for a war of aggression against the north in a signed commentary carried on the lapse of 40 years since the start of the south Korea-U.S. annual \"defense ministers' meeting\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the period the name of the meeting changed into an \"annual security consultative meeting\" but its aggressive nature and danger remain unchanged, the commentary says, recalling the fact that the U.S. and south Korean war maniacs \"discussed\" the matter of stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression against the north under the signboard of \"alliance\" every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that this alliance for a war of aggression against the north has been further tightened since the Lee Myung Bak regime emerged in south Korea, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee is now leaving no stone unturned to \"reinforce the alliance\" with the U.S. No sooner had he come to power than he visited the U.S. before any other lackeys of south Korea. He put forward the so-called \"value\", \"trust\" and \"peace-making\" as the \"three principles of alliance\" while talking about the \"strategic alliance in the 21st century\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces are now giving spurs to the preparations for a war of aggression against the north according to the outcome of Lee's junket to the U.S. He is running wild to do harm to fellow countrymen with the backing of his American master while begging the U.S. for \"stronger alliance\". These criminal acts of treachery committed by Lee are escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula day by day and bringing the inter-Korean relations back to those in the past era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its aggressive Korea policy, stop egging the south Korean puppets onto confrontation between the north and the south and withdraw its forces from south Korea. Otherwise, it will suffer such disgrace as being driven out of south Korea by the mounting nationwide anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group would be well advised to ponder over the consequences being entailed by his sycophancy toward the U.S. and its moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and behave with discretion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A particular mention should be made of the recent visit paid by traitor Lee Myung Bak to his U.S. master and the fact that he begged it to \"stop the reduction\" of the U.S. imperialist forces of aggression in south Korea and raise south Korea's status in purchasing weapons. This has brought into bolder relief his true colors as traitor and warhawk hell-bent on aggravating the military tension on the Korean Peninsula and launching a war against the DPRK at any cost in military collusion with the outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is a precondition for implementing the October 4 declaration to eliminate all remnants spawn by the military confrontation and ensure peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  However, the Lee group is denying the above-said precondition and insisting on the illegal and bogus \"northern limit line\", the leftover of the Korean war of aggression ignited by the U.S. imperialists and the inter-Korean confrontation era.  And on this basis it is making ceaseless military provocations in the West Sea, threatening peace and aggravating the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The treacherous group's reckless racket of military confrontation is a revelation of its hostility toward the DPRK and a product of its deep-seated wild ambition to invade it. This is, in essence, an outrageous challenge and the negation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, programme for putting the June 15 joint declaration into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south Korean authorities should admit and respect the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and stop at once the military confrontation racket against the fellow countrymen in order to remove the danger of a war and achieve the development of inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity on the Korean Peninsula at present. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
