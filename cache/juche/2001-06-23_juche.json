With nothing can they justify this criminal act. \r\n The U.S. is keen to provoke a new war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History clearly shows what a miserable end war maniacs met while playing with fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not seek an anachronistic hardline policy toward the DPRK, the policy of war, but replace the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and withdraw its aggression forces from South Korea at once as unanimously demanded by the Korean nation and the world progressives.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK, therefore, can never accept the U.S. demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that as the U.S. raised unpractical agenda items unacceptable to the dialogue partner, success of the dialogue cannot be expected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand suggests that the U.S. is seeking a sinister political purpose in proposing to resume the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's comment on the U.S. strange behaviour that the U.S. tries to shift on to the DPRK the responsibility for the stalemated negotiations and evade the blame for the aggravated bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The top priority in the bilateral relations for the present is for the U.S. to deal with the issue of the delayed delivery of the LWRs in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Talking about the unpractical matters, putting aside the pending basic matters, is, in actuality, waste of time and an escape from the negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should give clear answers to the DPRK's questions as to whether the former will persistently pursue the hardline hostile policy toward the latter, whether the former will make a policy switchover and whether the former has a political will to discuss and settle the compensation for the loss of electricity, a pressing matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will follow the U.S. attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
