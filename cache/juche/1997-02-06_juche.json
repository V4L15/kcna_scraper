That was why officials tried to dissuade General Kim Jong Il from setting sail to the island.\r\n   However, he got aboard a small speed boat, asking them if there had ever been smooth sailing on the inspection trip. \r\nThe boat fought its way through high waves and windstorm.\r\n   Meanwhile, he was standing on the deck, saying with a smile on his face that the west sea was very impressive. He looked determined to weather any windstorm and rough waves.\r\n   He also inspected the Panmunjom mission at the risk of his life.\r\n   Panmunjom on the Military Demarcation Line that divides Korea into north and south is well known worldwide as the hottest spot of fighting between peace and war, between reunification and division.\r\n   Hostile armed forces stand confronted with each other in this small area, where an accident may develop into conflict any moment. However, General Kim Jong Il visited this place, inspected many units for a long time and learned about the activities of the mission and the living conditions of soldiers.\r\n   Looking up to his self-possessed attitude, people felt his matchless courage, iron will and warm affection for his soldiers and people.\r\n   Korea's destiny is under the patronage of his great courage and unshakable resolution.\r\n   The imperialists threatened to unleash nuclear war against the DPRK with their huge uptodate weapons on the waters off its eastern and western coasts at the time of the \"pueblo\" incident and the ec-121 incident in the 1960s= they made an ultimatum at the time of the Panmunjom incident in The 1970s= they staged joint military maneuvers codenamed team spirit 93 with armed forces huge enough to wage a war= and they have left no stone unturned to blockade and stifle the DPRK. All their machinations, however, proved impotent before General Kim Jong Il's great personalities.\r\n   He brings any adversity under control even without a gun report. He is a symbol of victory and glory.\r\n   Led by General Kim Jong il possessed of firm faith, iron will and great courage, the Korean people see the day of National reunification breaking and confidently advance toward the final victory of Juche socialism. \r\n\r\n"
