And he encouraged the relevant field to plan this work in a big way and push forward it boldly, saying that he would personally solve the problems arising in the production of commodities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Yang Gon, Ri Il Hwan, Kim Chun Sop, Jo Chun Ryong, Jo Yong Won, Hong Yong Chil, Kim Yo Jong and Jong Sung Il."

Consequently, it is oppressed by a nightmare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war deterrent of the DPRK has grown so strong as to be capable of reacting to any mode of war desired by the U.S. This made the policy of aggression pursued by the chieftain of imperialism unworkable in the long-run. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is precisely for this reason that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is called an anachronistic and bankrupt policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that the U.S. high-ranking politicians, still pinning hope on it, are fooling around to force the DPRK to disarm itself while talking about the mode of nuclear negotiations with Iran. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are so miserable as to go reckless, failing to face up to the reality in which the structure of the DPRK-U.S. confrontation has undergone a dramatic change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrence can never be a bargaining chip on a negotiating table as it is an indispensable means for defending the country's sovereignty and the right to existence from the U.S. decade-old nuclear threat and hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the Songun politics of the great Workers' Party of Korea that the DPRK could increase the capabilities for self-defence with a main emphasis on a nuclear force while foiling the enemies' aggression moves in the biggest hotspot of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will keep holding aloft the banner of Songun that has recorded only victories and glory and the U.S. can never realize its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those keen on the anachronistic waste are consigned to the garbage ground of history only."
