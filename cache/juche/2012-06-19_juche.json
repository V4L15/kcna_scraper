One of its important aims is to bulge munitions monopolies' purse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sale of munitions has resulted in upsetting the equilibrium of force in various regions of the world and increasing the danger of war. The U.S.-made weapons are being used to kill many people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not fortuitous that the world is cursing the U.S. dollar, saying it is stained with blood of human beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deserves stern punishment of justice as an arch criminal harassing global peace and stability as it dampens the desire of humankind for peace and incites war and confrontation in different parts of the world, the commentary warns."
