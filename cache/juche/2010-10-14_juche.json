The proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo advanced by President Kim Il Sung at the 6th Congress of the WPK is the most patriotic and just proposal which embodied the principle of peaceful reunification. Nothing is better than the federation proposal in realizing national reunification. All Koreans at home and abroad are now making a vigorous struggle to materialize the federation proposal clarified in the historic June 15 joint declaration, zealously supporting it. This goes to prove the validity of the WPK's principle of peaceful reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fundamental principle of national reunification advocated by the WPK to realize the country's reunification by pooling efforts of all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK regarded patriotism and the spirit of national independence as basis for national unity. The 10-point programme of great unity of the whole nation advanced by Kim Il Sung and the five-point policy for great national unity set forth by General Secretary Kim Jong Il on  the sacred road for national unity have served as the banner of national reconciliation and unity and as the guidelines of action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"By our nation itself\", the idea of national unity, became a steadfast idea common to the nation and solidarity and alliance among the Koreans of different strata at home and abroad for national reunification have grown stronger than ever before on a nationwide scale.

These hard facts were again disclosed by the documents on the Korean War recently declassified by the CIA and several other documents including the confidential documents discovered at the U.S. State National Archives.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to these documents, U.S. nuclear weapons were deployed in south Korea in the mid-August of 1950 for the first time. In November of the same year U.S. President Truman blustered at a press conference that the U.S. had always positively examined the use of A-bombs. MacArthur did not hide the fact that the U.S. had a plan to drop 30 - 50 A-bombs in the border areas between the DPRK and China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff issued an order to launch an A-bomb attack on the Chinese People's Volunteers with the approval of Truman in April next year only to cancel it. In September and October of the year B-29s of the U.S. Air Force staged madcap exercises for dropping A-bombs in the sky above Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. imperialists were examining a new offensive in 1953 to recover from repeated setbacks in the Korean War the U.S. Air Force recommended the plan for the use of A-bombs and reported on the progress made in pushing forward the plan from May to July. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the war the U.S. Strategic Air Command sent to its Air Force Command top secret operation plan \"8-53\" on massively dropping A-bombs in the DPRK and China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Air Force side requested the authorities to deploy in south Korea more F-84Gs capable of dropping A-bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. imperialists stockpiled in Okinawa various type nuclear warheads to be used in another Korean War, bringing their total number to 2 600 in 1967.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A particular mention should be made of the fact that in the 1960s the U.S. imperialists ordered the aircraft of the U.S. Air Force in south Korea carrying nuclear bombs to keep themselves ready for emergency sorties so that they might strike the DPRK within 15 minutes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the subsequent period the U.S. military authorities officially admitted the deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea and in April this year the U.S. Secretary of Defense, when briefing on the report on the nuclear posture review, blustered that the \"U.S. had all options on the table\", openly hinting at the possibility of nuclear attack."
