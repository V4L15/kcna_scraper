And the leaflet-scattering operation against the DPRK, kicked off with mobilization of die-hard reactionary organizations, has gone beyond a tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Psychological warfare against the DPRK is, in essence, an open act of war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the General Staff of the Korean People's Army on August 20 sent an ultimatum to the south Korean puppet Ministry of Defense that a strong military action would be launched at once unless it stops the anti-DPRK broadcasting for psychological warfare and remove all psywar means within 48 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean puppet military gangsters getting frantic in provoking the DPRK again invented a case of \"shell fired by the north\" in the afternoon of August 20, Juche 104 (2015) and, under that pretext, fired dozens of shells on the DPRK's inviolable territory, a reckless military action."

Korea Joint Military Exercises\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Institute for American Studies of the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement on Friday exposed the aggressive nature and danger of the large-scale joint military exercises staged by the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces several times every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t Army of any country stages drills but they vary in their nature in the light of their purpose, scenario, place, scale, operation mode and equipment involved, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has never taken a serious note of the military drills staged by the U.S. in its mainland or Pacific, the places which do not pose any threat to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises are different from those drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They pose particularly serious danger unlike ordinary military drills as they are large-scale rehearsals for a war of aggression being staged by the U.S., the biggest nuclear power in the world, in areas close to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 5 000 troops of 11 countries are involved in the \"quick reaction 15\" joint military drill of NATO, the largest-ever since the Cold War, which is now under way in Europe. But at least 30 000 U.S. troops and more than 50 000 puppet troops of south Korea are now involved in the Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises. This clearly proves their dangerous nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clear from the fact that the war drills are focused on landing operations and commando operations aimed at making a surprise attack on the DPRK and \"occupying Pyongyang.\" The distance of the  targets set by the U.S. from theatres of drills clearly proves that the U.S. seeks to bring down the DPRK after throwing away the signboard called \"defensive drill\" in a moment when an opportunity presents itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of war exercises will never decrease when they bring a \"visiting group\" to such terror-ridden theatre of war rehearsals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical for the U.S. to compare the aggressive and provocative joint war exercises it stages together with the south Korean puppet forces with huge armed forces including preemptive nuclear strike means involved in areas very close to the DPRK, its belligerent party,  with the Korean People's Army's independent military drill conducted in its land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. assertion that it cannot stop the joint war exercises as it has staged them for more than 40 years can convince no one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had halted Team Spirit joint military exercises according to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework in 1992, the north-south agreement on non-aggression and a joint declaration on denuclearization were adopted and took effect on the Korean Peninsula that year and the safeguards accord was signed between the DPRK and the International Atomic Energy Agency, making noticeable progress in ensuring peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-contradictory for the U.S. to insist it cannot stop the military exercises as they have long been staged, while ignoring such historical facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government is more strongly opposed to the joint military exercises now because their aggressive nature has gone beyond tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In those days when the joint military exercises were staged at the end of the 1960s the U.S. claimed that their purpose was to conduct drills for hurling its troops in contingency on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such drills have turned into very provocative and aggressive war maneuvers aimed to \"remove the headquarters of the DPRK\" and \"occupy Pyongyang\" after the lapse of more than four decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brought to light its ever more undisguised hostile intent to bring down the social system of the DPRK over the \"human rights\" issue recently and even its president unhesitatingly talked about the \"collapse of the social system.\" Such reality makes the DPRK further raise vigilance against the aggressive and dangerous nature of the joint military drills and hardens its will not to allow such war drills any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation in the area along the Military Demarcation Line has now reached the brink of war due to the military provocations of the south Korean puppet forces. This is a natural product of the hostile policy pursued by the U.S. to fan up the confrontation hysteria of the puppet forces through dangerous war maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To halt the joint military maneuvers, the most vivid manifestation of the hostile policy towards the DPRK, or not will be a touchstone judging whether the U.S. is going to seek a peaceful solution of the Korean issue or not."

It also approved the decision of the KPA General Staff in which it sent an ultimatum to the south Korean puppet Ministry of Defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Supreme leader Kim Jong Un issued an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army that the frontline large combined units of the KPA should enter a wartime state to be fully battle ready to launch surprise operations and the area along the front be put in a semi-war state from 17:00 on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation which has reached the brink of war is now hardly controllable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have exercised our self-restraint for decades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now no one's talk about self-restraint is helpful to putting the situation under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are poised not to just counteract or make any retaliation but not to rule out an all-out war to protect the social system, their own choice, at the risk of their lives."

            "content": "Es irreparable la situacion llegada al borde de guerra, insiste MINREX de RPDC\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 21 de agosto (ACNC) -- Como ya transcendido, el pasado dia 20, los titeres surcoreanos volvieron a perpetrar en alrededores de la Linea de Demarcacion Militar la peligrosa provocacion militar lanzando decenas de proyectiles hacia la zona de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC hizo publica el dia 21 una declaracion que senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con el presente incidente, los titeres surcoreanos dicen ruidosamente de que emprendieron el fuego de respuesta a la RPDC que fue primero en disparar un proyectil. Pero, esta insistencia de la parte surcoreana es una pura mentira y fraudulenta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse dia, nuestra parte no tiro ni un proyectil ni una bala hacia la parte enemiga ni tampoco hubo un disparo accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl canonazo perpetrado unilateralmente por los titeres surcoreanos no es casual ni accidental, sino es una provocacion inventada y calculada bien por ellos mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs el metodo rutinario de los mandatarios surcoreanos precedentes que cada vez que se caen en la crisis trataron de buscar la salida en la fabricacion de un incidente sensacional en el alrededor de la Linea de Demarcacion Militar para inducir al otro la vista del exterior e interior del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente caso tambien constituye una abierta provocacion intrigante para descansar un momento saliendo de la crisis e poner obstaculos en la fiesta del otro exacerbando al maximo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos enemigos inventaron antes que todo el caso de la \"explosion de la mina\" en la Linea de Demarcacion Militar y tomandolo como pretexto reanudaron la radiodifusion psicologica contra la RPDC para incitarla al maximo. Y desarrollaron junto con EE.UU. los ejercicios militares conjuntos de gran envergadura creando asi un ambiente psicologica necesario para que la sociedad internacional pensara como si la RPDC fuera primero en el disparo. Y despues cometieron el canonazo embelleciendolo como un \"fuego de respuesta\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ellos equivocaron gravemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCayeron en la trampa puesta por si mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Estado Mayor General del Ejercito Popular de Corea ya envio a las 17 del 20 de agosto al Ministerio de Defensa Nacional del Sur de Corea el ultimatum de que pasara a la fuerte accion militar si no se interrumpe dentro de 48 horas la radioemision psicologica anti-RPDC ni se retiren todos los medios psicologicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Comision Militar Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea aprobo la decision del EMG del EPC que envio el ultimatum al Ministerio de Defensa titere surcoreano tras examinar y firmar el plan operacional de ataque de la Comandancia del Frente del EPC para pasar a la vez al contragolpe, contraataque, en todo el frente segun la situacion inevitable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal Kim Jong Un dio la orden del Comandante Supremo del EPC de que las grandes unidades combinadas del frente del EPC pasaran al estado de guerra armado por completo que posibilita la entrada en la operacion inesperada y de declarar el estado de preguerra en las zonas del frente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa es irreparable la situacion que se llego al borde de la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVinimos conteniendonos durante decenas de anos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, cualquier palabreria de continencia de alguien no puede ayudar mas al control de la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC estan decididos de hacer hasta la guerra total para defender a riesgo de la vida el regimen optado por si mismos sin recurrir en un simple enfrentamiento o represalia."
