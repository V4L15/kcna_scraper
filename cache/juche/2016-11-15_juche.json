Candlelight rallies of people from all walks of life calling for impeachment of Park vividly show the mindset of the angered south Korean people who have already sentenced the traitors for all ages to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that Park is being condemned not only by the opposition parties but also by conservative forces, she is trying hard to seek a way out in prodding the warmongers into intensifying saber-rattling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is working hard to weather the worst ruling crisis under the pretext of \"security crisis\", talking about \"emergency situation.\" This is what she inherited from her father.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In actuality, the puppet military has declared an \"emergency system\" reminiscent of the situation on the eve of war under the pretext of the crisis of the regime and the \"administration\" vacuum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They simultaneously launched Chungmu drill for the latter half of 2016 allegedly aimed to \"verify the effectiveness of the plan for civilians, officials and service members' wartime preparedness\" and kicked off 2016 Hoguk rehearsal under the signboard of \"coping with the north's provocation of a local war and all-out war\" almost at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also staged a madcap airlifting drill and large-scale joint landing drill, kicking up war hysteria. They went the lengths of conducting a joint exercise with a British air force for the first time in history under the simulated conditions of making \"precision strike\" at the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and its major strategic targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that a south Korean media, commenting on the above-said anti-north war drills which may spill over into an actual war anytime, observed that \"the muscle-flexing is linked with the Choe Sun Sil Gate.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said ceaseless saber-rattling goes to clearly prove that the Park group unhesitatingly resorts to any play with fire which may put the destiny of the nation at peril in order to prolong its remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"emergency system\" declared by the group of traitors is now under strong fire by all compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to bear in mind what miserable end the warmongers met."
