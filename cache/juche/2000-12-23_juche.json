            "content": "Anti-DPRK propaganda in South Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 23 (KCNA) -- South Korean ultra right conservatives recently invited western venal scholars to Seoul to stage an \"international meeting on human rights and refugees of North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its participants talked nonsense that the \"issue of North Korean refugees\" in the northeastern area of China should not be overlooked and it is necessary to \"lodge a protest with the Chinese government\" to prevent them from being deported to North Korea. They went the length of slandering even the political system in the dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their assertions clearly suggest what they sought through this anti-DPRK \"meeting on human rights\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This farce staged by those forces in South Korea since last year by bribing venal scholars of the west is aimed to internationalize the DPRK's \"human rights issue\" in a bid to damage its international prestige and bring the positively improving north-south relations back to the former state of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the fact that the content of the speeches made by those scholars at the \"meeting\" were identical to the anti-DPRK false propaganda conducted by South Korean ultra right conservatives in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what rubbish they may talk, there is no \"issue of refugees\" between the DPRK and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is true that many compatriots travel across the border between the two countries to visit their home towns and relatives as many Koreans live in the northeastern area of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These travelers can never be called \"refugees.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there be any issue of border trespassers, it is the matter pertaining to the sovereignty, of the two countries that should be settled by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the publicly recognized international practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Western non-governmental human rights organizations should not be tricked into the anachronistic anti-DPRK smear campaign of the South Korean ultra right conservatives nor should they serve their sinister political purpose of worsening the north-south relations. \r\n\r\n"
