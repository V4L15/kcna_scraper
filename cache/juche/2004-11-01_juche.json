Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.\r\n Referring to the ever-growing desire in south Korea to put an end to the history of the U.S. military presence and domination over south Korea, the article notes that this is a manifestation of the unquenchable patriotic fever of the south Koreans to terminate the 59 year-long history of the U.S. presence that has brought disgrace to them and a trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once the U.S. forces quit south Korea, the Koreans in the north and the south will be able to live in peace and harmony free from any dispute as they are the same nation, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the root cause of a war is removed by the withdrawal of the U.S. troops, investment will get brisk and economy will be kept alive in a peaceful environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the above-mentioned condition a stronger atmosphere of national unity and cooperation will prevail in the north and the south and a wide avenue will be paved for the uniform development of the national economy. They will be able to make a more effective use of locally available rich resources for developing the national economy by the concerted efforts of the Koreans and then they will have no more to desire in their life. \r\n Without the presence of the U.S. troops the south Koreans would be able to regain usurped sovereignty and dignity and lead a dignified and worthwhile life under the bright sunrays free from oppression, disaster, disgrace and contempt to which they have been subjected for nearly 60 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration ushered in the era of national independence, the era of doing everything by our nation itself free from the U.S. interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for the Koreans to pool their efforts and put an end to the tragedy of national sufferings forced upon them by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should fully settle the issue of relations with the United States in order to protect their dignity and destiny from it and hew the path of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans should discard any illusion about the U.S. and get rid of the shameful idea of being inferior to it, ie worship and flunkeyism toward America and fear and submission to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to stand firm against the U.S. and pave the way for independence, dignity and prosperity in the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation provides the Koreans with a guarantee for leading an independent life on their own free from the U.S. interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article urges Koreans to trust their compatriots, not the U.S. It calls on all Koreans in the north and the south to advance hand in hand through the cooperation between the authorities and between the NGOs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday urges this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now interfering in the internal affairs of other countries under the cloak of \"contribution to peace\" and committing without hesitation armed invasion of sovereign countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since it appeared in the new century, boasting the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. the Bush administration has staged a series of wars of aggression under the pretext of \"establishing peace order\" and \"ensuring freedom and democracy\" despite unanimous opposition and rejection of the world. It has thus disturbed the world peace order and inflicted unspeakable misfortune and disasters upon the civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Big and small disputes and instable situation prevailing in the international arena are products of the U.S. moves to establish domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces are leaving no means untried to internationally isolate and militarily stifle the DPRK over the fictitious \"nuclear and missile threat\" from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey destroyed the groundwork of the six-party talks and put them at a deadlock, thus rendering the prospect of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula dim. If the U.S. has a true will to work for peace on the peninsula, it should withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea, convert the Korean Armistice Agreement into a peace agreement and stop all military actions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. is massively forward-deploying up-to-date war equipment in and around south Korea under the pretext of \"cutting back\" its forces and filling up the \"security vacuum,\" escalating the military confrontation and tensions and pushing the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. regards Iran, an anti-U.S. independent nation, as a thorn in its flesh. It is posing direct military threat to it and menacing it with a preemptive attack. It intends to let Israel wage a proxy war of aggression against Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. remains unchanged in its real intention to dominate and plunder other countries. On the contrary it becomes more crafty and vicious in its moves under the name of \"anti-terrorism war\" and \"contribution to peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces are speaking highly of those countries which blindly meet their wishes and demands and follow the U.S. and drawing them to their fold but are putting pressure upon those independent countries, posing military threat to them and working hard to eliminate them by force of arms after listing them as \"dangerous states\" and \"rogue states.\" Nothing is a more serious act of harassing peace than infringing upon the sovereignty and security of other country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"contribution to peace\" precisely means a version of a war outcry. Peace can be guaranteed only by the united struggle of the people against the anti-peace forces.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Moves to Apply Economic Sanctions against DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The ultra-right conservative forces of the Liberal Democratic Party of Japan at the recent first meeting of a \"team for a mock test on applying economic sanctions against the DPRK\" decided to make public a concrete plan for economic sanctions including a measure to put strict restrictions on \"remittance to the north\" and its effectiveness.\r\n  This has stirred up the Koreans' bitter anti-Japanese feelings as the plan is a declaration of confrontation with the DPRK in breach of the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan organized the team shortly after the new foreign minister asserted that he would not bother to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK. And a guy called the secretary general of the team talked about \"effectiveness of pressurization by sanctions\". This is a product of the Japanese right-wing forces' deliberate moves to further strain the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paragraph 3 of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration stipulates that both sides shall abide by international law and refrain from any act of threatening the security of the other side. Subject to this, Japan would have had refrained from any act of posing threat to the DPRK's economic activities and deliberately hampering them, to say nothing of applying economic pressure and blockade against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By going frantic in its efforts to put sanctions against the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, in disregard of the above-said principles Japan seeks to pressurize the DPRK and wrest a sort of concession from it over the nuclear and \"abduction issues.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries adopted the \"law on economic sanctions against north Korea\" and legally adopted economic sanctions against the DPRK as a state policy, claiming that \"economic sanctions and blockade are effective weapons for bringing the north to its knees\". This meant a declaration by law of an economic war against the DPRK and political and military confrontation with it. Japan has since escalated its undisguised moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Through its recent decision Japan revealed once again that economic sanctions are, in essence, means for putting pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the official media of Japan commented that the recent decision is aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the \"law on foreign exchange\" and the \"special law on banning portcalls of specified foreign ships\" and escalate pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These acts, however, will get Japan nowhere. They only betray Japan's despicable nature and weakness and touch off towering hatred toward Japan among the Koreans.\r\n The DPRK will take a tough countermeasure against those who encroach upon its sovereignty even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should behave itself, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by its moves to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
