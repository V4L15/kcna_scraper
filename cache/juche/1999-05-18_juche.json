Overseas aggression is the invariable ambition of the Japanese militarists.\r\n   The Japanese reactionary ruling quarters needed a pretext to justify their moves for overseas aggression. It is the fiction of nuclear and missile \"threat\" from the DPRK on the lips of the Japanese reactionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are scheming to put a label of \"terrorism\" on the DPRK in a bid to impair its ever mounting greatness and external authority.\r\n   No matter how hard they may resort to double-dealing tactics, the general situation will not change as they want. \r\n\r\n"
