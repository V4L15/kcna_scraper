\"international forum calling for the demolition of the concrete wall\" held here today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal said that humankind has a new hope and expectation for peace and prosperity with the 21st century at hand but an abnormal state persists on the Korean peninsula where the concrete wall still exists,  bringing pain resulting from the division and confrontation to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We confirmed on the spot once again the existence of the concrete wall which was once recognized by the press and even the military of the United States and confirmed by an international fact-finding group with its own eyes on the spot, and keenly realized what bitter misfortunes and sufferings the Korean people are undergoing due to the division and how strong the Korean people's will to pull down the barrier of division and reunify the country at any cost is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the South Korean authorities, under the patronage of the United States, have doggedly refused to demolish the concrete wall despite the protest from all the Korean people and broad international public circles, while further intensifying the confrontation and suffocation moves against the DPRK that has made every sincere effort for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' talk about \"dialogue\" and \"unification,\" while keeping the concrete wall and the \"National Security Law\" which block the reunification of Korea as ever is nothing but empty words to deceive the world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In league with outside forces they are mocking the world community with the outcries for \"sunshine policy\" and \"policy of engagement with the north.\"  Having worked out with the U.S. Even the adventurous scenario for the \"second Korean war\" called \"operation plan 5027-98,\" they are driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war hour by hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The military conflict at the west sea of Korea in June and the concentration of huge U.S. armed forces in the Korean peninsula on this pretext go to clearly prove that the \"operation plan 5027-98\" is entering a specific phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ever deteriorating situation on the Korean peninsula is arousing serious apprehension and concern among the world's peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It should be raised as a pressing problem of the present international politics to bring under early control the grave situation on the peninsula where the national sovereignty of the Korean people is wantonly violated by outside forces and their followers and a war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Once again aware of the urgency to solve the Korean problem and the responsibility assumed by the international community in this regard, we who have striven for the peace and reunification of Korea appeal to the world people who love justice and peace as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Let us raise the existence of the concrete wall on the Korean peninsula as an international issue and wage a more widespread protest campaign of various forms for its earlier demolition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Let us brand the new reckless war provocations of the United States and the South Korean authorities to bring a holocaust of war to the Korean peninsula again, blinded by the extreme logic of \"strength\", as a grave criminal act of disturbing peace in Asia and the rest of the world, and lift up voices denouncing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The division of Korea is a source of the tension in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Korea must be reunified at an early date in order to prevent an outbreak of a new war on the peninsula and ensure a durable peace there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, the proposal for founding the democratic confederal republic of Koryo and the ten-point program of the great unity of the whole nation put forward by the great leader of the Korean people President Kim Il Sung  and the five-point policy of the great national unity advanced by his excellency the respected Kim Jong Il represent a most realistic and reasonable way of smoothly achieving the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Let us extend more positive support and solidarity to the Korean people's cause to reunify the country independently and peacefully in accordance with the three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of great national unity and with concerted efforts of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are firmly convinced that all the peace-loving people of the world will heartily respond to this call. \r\n\r\n"
