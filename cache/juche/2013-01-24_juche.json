            "content": "DPRK NDC Issues Statement Refuting UNSC Resolution\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK issued a statement on Thursday.\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 was a great jubilee in the history of the nation as it placed the nation's dignity and honor on the highest plane and a spectacular success made in the efforts to develop space for peaceful purposes recognized by the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The world people who love justice and value conscience unanimously rejoice as their own over the signal success made by our country, not a big one, by its own efforts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even space institutions of a hostile country accustomed to have repugnancy towards others could not but recognize the DPRK's successful satellite launch for peaceful purposes, from a low-profile stance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the U.S. at the outset of the year termed our satellite launch \"long-range missile launch,\" \"wanton violation\" of the UN resolutions and \"blatant challenge\" to world peace and security in a bid to build up public opinion on this. Finally, it prodded the UNSC into cooking up a new resolution on tightening sanctions against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The keynote of the resolution was worked out through backstage dealing with the U.S. as a main player and it was adopted at the UNSC with blind hand-raising by its member nations. This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered a new dangerous phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows, at the same time, that those big countries, which are obliged to take the lead in building a fair world order, are abandoning without hesitation even elementary principle, under the influence of the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices, failing to come to their senses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, this also indicates that the UNSC, which should regard it as its mission to guarantee sovereign rights and security of its member nations, has turned into a defunct marionette international body on which no hope can be pinned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK National Defence Commission solemnly declares as follows as regards the adoption of the entirely unreasonable resolution on the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. We totally reject all the illegal resolutions on the DPRK adopted by the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe have never recognized all forms of base resolutions tightening sanctions cooked up by the hostile forces to encroach upon the DPRK's sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sovereignty is what keeps a country and nation alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The country and the nation without sovereignty are more dead than alive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The satellite launch was the exercise of an independent right pertaining to the DPRK as well as its legitimate sovereignty recognized by international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the U.S. and those countries which launched satellites before have neither justification nor reason to find fault with the DPRK's satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are making a brigandish assertion that what they launched were satellites but what other country launched was a long-range missile. They are seriously mistaken if they think this assertion can work in the bright world today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly know that the times have changed and so have the army and the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Along with the nationwide efforts to defend the sovereignty, the DPRK will continue launching peaceful satellites to outer space one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. As the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK has entered more dangerous phase, overall efforts should be directed to denuclearizing big powers including the U.S. rather than the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The biggest threat to the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula is the hostile policy toward the DPRK being pursued by all kinds of dishonest forces including the U.S. as well as the U.S. huge nuclear armed forces that back the policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK drew a final conclusion that only when the denuclearization of the world is realized on a perfect level including the denuclearization of the U.S., will it be possible to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and ensure peace and security of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. is taking the lead in encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, its allies are siding with it and the UN Security Council has been reduced into an organization bereft of impartiality and balance. Under this situation the DPRK can not but declare that there will no longer exist the six-party talks and the September 19 joint statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No dialogue on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be possible in the future even though there may be dialogues and negotiations on ensuring peace and security in the region including the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We will launch an all-out action to foil the hostile policy toward the DPRK being pursued by the U.S. and those dishonest forces following the U.S., and safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The UN Security Council resolution on expanding sanctions against the DPRK, which was adopted on the initiative of the U.S., represents the most dangerous phase of the hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain an on-looker to such happenings in which the sovereignty of the nation is encroached upon and the supreme interests of the country are violated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the prevailing situation, the army and people of the DPRK will turn out in an all-out action to defend its sovereignty which is more precious than their own lives and frustrate the moves of the U.S. and its allies to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The drive for building an economic power being pushed forward by the army and people of the DPRK, the effort to conquer space that has entered a new phase and the endeavors to bolster the deterrence for safeguarding the country and defending its security will all orientate toward the purpose of winning in the all-out action for foiling the U.S. and all other hostile forces' maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not hide that a variety of satellites and long-range rockets which will be launched by the DPRK one after another and a nuclear test of higher level which will be carried out by it in the upcoming all-out action, a new phase of the anti-U.S. struggle that has lasted century after century, will target against the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Settling accounts with the U.S. needs to be done with force, not with words as it regards jungle law as the rule of its survival. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will clearly see how the army and people of the DPRK punish all kinds of hostile forces and emerge as a final victor while following the just road of defending its sovereignty, convinced of the justice of its cause."

            "content": "DPRK Citizens Who Had Been Taken to S. Korea Interviewed after Return\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Kwang Ho and his wife and Ko Kyong Hui were interviewed by local and foreign journalists at the People's Palace of Culture here Thursday after their return to the DPRK. They were carried to south Korea after being taken in by the south Korean puppet group's appeasement and allurement.\n\t\t\t\t\t Present at the press conference were journalists of media in the DPRK and journalists of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and foreign countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwang Ho and his wife and Ko Kyong Hui first spoke of the circumstances in which they were taken to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwang Ho, 37, who was born in Yonsu-ri, Yonsa County, North Hamgyong Province, stealthily went to China in August 2009 together with his fiance Kim Ok Sil, 29. During the Arduous March he had illegally crossed the border several times looking for money and had been subject to penalty under relevant law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He testified to the fact that he was taken in by priest called Ri Yo Sep and those aligned with the south Korean puppet forces in China and was taken to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Ok Sil who was born in Sangdam-ri, Paekam County, Ryanggang Province illegally crossed the DPRK-China border together with Kim Kwang Ho. In China they were deceived by stooges of the south Korean Intelligence Service and went to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwang Ho said that south Korea was a dirty society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that he made up his mind to come back to the DPRK in late last year with his back turned on the cursed south Korean society after listening to the news of a press conference given by Pak Jong Suk in June last year upon her return to the DPRK. Pak had been taken to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ko Kyong Hui, 37, who was residing in Kanggu-dong, Hyesan City, Ryanggang Province, said that she illegally crossed the border in March 2011, adding that she was deceived by a man called Director General Ho in Shenyang and was taken to south Korea in June.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She noted: She was spending days and months that were like nightmare. One day she lied she would bring her children in the north and made her way to the homeland through China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They answered the questions raised by journalists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the rackets of \"defectors from the north\" and \"human rights\" being kicked up by the south Korean puppet forces even though they allure and abduct residents of the DPRK in a mean way, Ko Kyong Hui said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of those who went to south Korea fled the DPRK after committing crimes but most of them were taken to south Korea being allured and taken in by the puppet forces in the countries around the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are calling them \"defectors from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The case is the same with me.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  I illegally crossed the border because I was told that I can make money in China. My intention was not to go to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A man called Director General Ho whom I made acquaintance with in Shenyang took me to Beijing, saying that I have to go to Beijing if I want to make money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In Beijing he said that it is hard to find a job because of differing language and control that has become tighter. In the end he suggested my going to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When I opposed, he recommended Canada, saying that in Canada I can make money and it will be possible for me to go back to the homeland once I attain the Canadian citizenship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He further said that he has no other way to help, half-appeasing and half-threatening that if I don't like going to Canada, I may go back  home by myself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later I went to a \"refugee camp\" in Thailand via Kunming, China, following several men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"refugee camp\" was a building for controlling illegal immigrants. Only there I learned that it was a sheer lie that I would be sent to Canada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces prepared a separate room for detaining DPRK residents in the \"refugee camp\" and are plotting to take them to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwang Ho said that the south Korean puppet forces have distributed its stooges in neighboring countries and continue sordid acts to carry DPRK citizens to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean priest Ri Yo Sep whom he met in China was a man engaged in taking DPRK citizens to south Korea while traveling to and from China, he said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Yong Hwa, chairman of the \"confederation for human rights of refugees from the north\" who allured me to south Korea, was doing the same work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He let loose a string of honeyed words that we will be provided shelter and settlement fund in south Korea and that we can be better off if we work hard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  As soon as we were released from \"Hana Center\", the building for temporarily keeping defectors to the south, he called at us and urged me to pay the amount specified in the written guarantee, adding that only then can he bring other people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that even though the south Korean puppet forces loudly speak of \"defectors from the north\", they are, in fact, forcibly bringing DPRK citizens with the use of their stooges whom they distributed in different parts outside south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mentioning their life experience in south Korea, Kim Kwang Ho and his wife and Ko Kyong Hui said that south Korea is a society where money is almighty and an evil society full of extreme individualism and misanthropy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Turning to the anti-DPRK confrontation moves of the south Korean puppet forces, Kim Kwang Ho continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Detective Sim Hyong Gu who was in charge of me came to my worksite one day in 2011 and showed me kindness, offering me seasoned rice rolled in laver and sausages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He asked me what I think about \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When I questioned \"Why do you ask me that question\", he said that he asks all other \"defectors from the north\" the same question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I told him that I think carelessness was to blame and asked if it is possible for a torpedo to get rusty soon after it was shot. I further said people see it as a trick of the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His face turned white with rage and he packed food and went away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He became angry because the thing did not go as he planned. He was going to build up public opinion in the direction of blaming the \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case on the north through the mouths of those who came from the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place in south Korea last September a \"north Korean human rights film festival\" aimed at slandering the DPRK. There was an advertisement that the movies will be shown free.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huge fund was spent for making those films. It did not stand to reason that the films will be shown free in south Korea where even flea's skin will be collected if it is thought to make money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later I learned that the south Korean authorities held the farce by squandering huge funds to instill bitterness to the DPRK in south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ko Kyong Hui said that the south Korean puppet forces are keen on collecting information that can be used for staging smear campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the \"defectors from the north\", the puppet forces are working hard to collect information about the economy of the DPRK and the locations of national institutions, she added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ko Kyong Hui and Kim Kwang Ho said that they were unpunished and leniently treated instead of being punished on their return to the DPRK, stressing that the future of the DPRK is bright as the leader and the people are making devoted efforts for the prosperity of the country in one mind."

Rechazamos tajantemente todas las resoluciones anti-RPDC de caracter ilegal, aprobadas por el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo hemos reconocido desde el principio las sucias resoluciones de sancion anti-RPDC de toda indole, inventadas por las fuerzas hostiles para atentar nuestra soberania. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa soberania es la vida de cada pais y nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn pais y nacion privados de ella son iguales a un cadaver vivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl lanzamiento del satelite artificial es un derecho soberano y legitimo de la RPDC y el ejercicio de su soberania reconocido por el derecho internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor lo tanto, EE.UU. y otros paises lanzadores de satelite artificial no tienen ninguna justificacion o razon para intervenir en esa labor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo claro no se acepta la estupida y gangsteril insistencia en que lo lanzado por si mismo es satelite artificial y lo de otro se trata de un misil de largo alcance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe darse cuenta de que ya ha cambiado la epoca y han progresado tambien nuestro ejercito y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn medio de la lucha pannacional por defender la soberania, nuestros satelites artificiales con fines pacificos se lanzaran uno tras otro hacia el espacio cosmico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Dado que entra en la etapa mas peligrosa la politica hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU., hay que concentrar todas las fuerzas no en la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana sino en la de las potencias, inclusive EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa amenaza mas grave a la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana es la politica hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles y las enormes fuerzas armadas nucleares del imperio que la sustentan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese sentido, nuestro ejercito y pueblo sacaron la conclusion final de que se lograra la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana y se garantizaran la paz y la seguridad de la RPDC solo cuando sean desnuclearizados primera y perfectamente EE.UU. y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se puso al frente de los atentados contra la soberania de la RPDC, y las fuerzas satelites coordinan sus acciones con ese, debido a lo cual el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU se hizo un aparato carente de imparcialidad y equilibrio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estas circunstancias, declaramos a todo el mundo que no existen ya las conversaciones a 6 bandas ni la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn lo adelante, no habra ningun dialogo que discuta la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana, aunque si se abran las negociaciones para la paz y la estabilidad de la region, incluso la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Entraremos en el enfrentamiento total para defender la soberania del pais y la nacion frustrando las maniobras hostiles a la RPDC de EE.UU. y sus satelites malsanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa resolucion de sancion anti-RPDC aprobada por el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU bajo el papel protagonico de EE.UU. es la fase mas peligrosa de la brutal politica hostil a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo no son los que se quedan en la inaccion ante la violacion de soberania nacional y maximos intereses del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDada la situacion de ahora, nuestro ejercito y pueblo se levantaran unanimemente en la batalla de enfrentamiento total para defender la soberania, mas valiosa que su vida, y frustrar las maniobras de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles encaminadas a aplastar y aislar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa construccion de potencia economica, la campana para la conquista del cosmos ya en la nueva etapa y el fortalecimiento del disuasivo para la defensa nacional y la seguridad del pais, que impulsan todos nuestros militares y habitantes, seran orientados y sujetados a la batalla de enfrentamiento total.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esa batalla, nueva etapa de lucha antiyanqui que prosigue de siglo en siglo, no ocultamos que los satelites artificiales de varios tipos, a ser lanzados sucesivamente, los cohetes de largo alcance y la prueba nuclear de alto nivel a ejecutar toman por su blanco a EE.UU., enemigo jurado del pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Con EE.UU. que toma la ley de selva como su modo de existencia, hay que ajustar las cuentas no con palabras sino con fusiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El mundo vera claramente como castigan a las fuerzas hostiles de toda calana y se hacen triunfadores finales nuestro ejercito y pueblo que convencidos de la justeza de su causa, marchan como torrente por la justa senda en defensa de su soberania."

Alli pude conocer que es una pura mentira la promesa de enviarme a Canada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos tenian las habitaciones para encerrar a los norcoreanos y trazaban los complots para llevarlos al Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwang Ho dijo que ahora los titeres surcoreanos despacharon a sus lacayos a los paises vecinos para que cometieran la campana grosera para seducir a los norcoreanos al territorio surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pastor surcoreano Ri Yo Sep con que me  encontre por primera vez en China tambien se entregaba a llevar seducidos a norcoreanos al Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl jefe de la \"alianza de DDHH de fugitivos norcoreanos\", Kim Yong Hwa, me dijo que en el Sur de Corea yo \"podria obtener la casa, el dinero y vivir felizmente si trabajo con afan\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como salieramos del \"Centro Hanawon\", donde se concentran temporalmente los fugitivos norcoreanos, ese tipejo nos exigio pagar pronto la suma de dinero contratada en la nota de aval para que el pudiera recoger a otras personas norcoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien los titeres surcoreanos hablan tanto sobre los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", en realidad seducen a los habitantes del Norte por conducto de sus lacayos enviados a todas partes y los llevan al Sur de Corea en contra de su voluntad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl referirse a sus vivencias en territorio surcoreano, el matrimonio de Kim Kwang Ho y Ko Kyong Hui dijeron que el Sur de Corea es la sociedad del mal donde el dinero es recurso omnipotente y campean el individualismo extremado y la misantropia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwang Ho conto sobre la campana anti-RPDC que lanzan obstinadamente los titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn dia de 2011, el agente de policia Sim Hyong Gu vino adonde yo trabajaba y me invito con \"gentileza\" a unos platos traidos consigo, comenzo el y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnseguida, me ha preguntado como yo pensaba del incidente de hundimiento de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe pregunte por que me ha sacado ese asunto y el me contesto que la pregunta se formula a otros \"fugitivos\" tambien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe dije que ese incidente se produjo por descuido interno del buque y la gente lo considera como una farsa ideada por las autoridades surcoreanas, aduciendo que el torpedo recien lanzado no puede estar tan oxidado como en la imagen presentada por ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCreo que el quiso inventar una opinion de los que residian en el Norte de Corea a favor del rumor de hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\" por el presunto ataque de torpedo norcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl escuchar mis palabras que no le convenian, se puso nervioso y se marcho con platos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe efectuo en septiembre del ano pasado en el Sur de Corea el llamado \"Festival de Cine sobre DDHH del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLuego, fueron pegados los anuncios sobre la muestra gratuita de los filmes proyectados en el festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPosteriormente, me entere de que las autoridades surcoreanas costearon enormes fondos de proyeccion con el unico objetivo de inyectar en los hombres la conciencia hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKo Kyong Hui revelo que ahora los titeres surcoreanos se enfrascan en la recogida de informaciones que puedan ser utilizadas en el complot anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCitando antecedentes, ella preciso que los titeres tratan obstinadamente de obtener en boca de \"fugitivos norcoreanos\" las informaciones sobre la situacion economica y la posicion de los organos estatales de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKo Kyong Hui y Kim Kwang Ho apuntaron que la RPDC les perdono generosamente en vez de castigarles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl final, subrayaron que es maravilloso el futuro de la RPDC donde el dirigente y el pueblo trabajan con abnegacion por la prosperidad de la patria uniendose con la misma voluntad."
