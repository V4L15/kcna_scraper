Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- South Korea has introduced weapons worth 8.97 billion dollars from the united states in more than 5,000 instalments for the last ten years since 1991, Seoul-based Yonhap News reported.\r\n This was disclosed in a paper presented by military critic Kim Jong Dae quoting information of the \"Ministry of National Defence\" at a seminar on \"checking the introduction of U.S.-made weapons and achieving the peaceful reunification of the Korean peninsula\" held in Seoul on July 21 under the sponsorship of non-governmental organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that South Korea has a national defence economy system unilaterally depending on import, he noted that the introduction of U.S.-made weapons accounts for 73.1 percent of the total foreign arms import worth 12.3 billion dollars in the last decade. given this fact, its real scale might be much bigger than this, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increasing proportion of U.S.-made weapons in the arms delivery is attributable to the fact that South Korea is going ahead with arms buildup to meet the requirements of the \"Operation Plan 5027\" according to the proposal of the U.S. side which controls military intelligence, he held.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Higher education at the factory \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) --Ffifty years have passed since factory colleges were set up.\r\n The factory college comes under the category of the study-while-working educational system. In this country there are two methods of participation in the higher educational system, full-time and part-time. This kind of educational system is contributing to turning ordinary members of society into intellectuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Factory colleges have been set up in large factories, other industrial establishments and major industrial districts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Enrolled in these colleges while on the job are those workers who have successfully completed their secondary general education. The courses cover five or six years and the educational curricula, programmes and qualifications are equal to those of regular universities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first factory college was established on July 15, Juche 40 (1951), during the hard-fought Korean War started by the United States (1950-1953). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the introduction of the new educational system, factories, formerly known as mere production centres, were turned into training centres for local worker-cadres to meet the demand for the technical development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another advantage of a study-while-working system is that it does not hinder the development of the country's economy and production activity, but strengthens the material and technical foundation and scientific and technical forces of the factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the first factory college came into being, there were only seven lecturers, two departments and 50 students. But now there are more than 100 colleges functioning in farms and fishing villages. The student body numbers tens of thousands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some 121,000 qualified engineers and management workers have been produced so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At factories with this educational system, a large proportion of management and technical positions are held by graduates of this college. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the past five decades, 80 labour heroes and hundreds of people with academic awards emerged from the graduates of factory colleges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The factory college is playing an important role in the training of technical personnel required by the present-day information industry.    \r\n\r\n"

This will inevitably put spurs to the space militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It merits a serious attention that the U.S. bellicose quarters are describing the ABM treaty as a product of the cold war era and insisting on going ahead with the MD, asserting they are not upset in the least by the objection of Russia, China and others to the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Following their announcement of their plan to deploy \"aegis\" ships in the East Sea of Korea the U.S. warlike forces are now working hard to establish the MD as evidenced by their recent development of an airborne laser weapon to be used above the Korean peninsula under the pretext of a \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. This requires the DPRK to heighten vigilance against their moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These dangerous moves to attack and stifle the DPRK militarily compel the DPRK to take a countermeasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. missile fanatics are well advised to behave themselves.    \r\n\r\n"

It was a true aim sought by Japan in the controversial history textbooks to imbue the young Japanese with the idea of militarist overseas aggression and ambition for it defying whatever criticism of the distortion of history and truth and let them take an active part in a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The distribution of those history textbooks would not help Japan erase its past crime-woven history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to behave with discretion for the sake of the destiny and future of Japan and immediately stop fanning up militarism and hysteria of overseas invasion in society.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs today answered a question raised by KCNA 48 years since the Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA) was concluded.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A danger of war still persists on the Korean peninsula though 48 years have passed since the conclusion of the KAA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is chiefly attributable to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea, which militarily backs the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the conclusion of the agreement the United States  unilateraly derailed the Geneva Conference which was called to seek the pullback of all foreign troops from Korea and has since consistently pursued a policy of military confrontation towards the DPRK, systematically increasing its military presence in South Korea for nearly five decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to this, situation remains so tense on the Korean peninsula in the new century, too that a war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the state of armistice on the Korean peninsula is to be converted into durable peace it is necessary, first of all, to sign a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United States and put an end, on this basis, to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and the presence of the U.S. forces in South Korea which consider the DPRK as their \"principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States is truly concerned for detente on the Korean peninsula, it had better properly know what is the master key to solving the issue.    \r\n\r\n"
