It is totally denying and distorting the history of the monstrous crimes that make even animals blush and persistently evading its responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had insisted that the war for aggression fought to realize the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" was a \"liberation war\" but it is now mulling making compensation to the \"bereaved families\" of the above-mentioned lackeys who met dogs' deaths while participating in the above-said war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist forces seek to realize the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the 21st century at any cost as they have not abandoned even a moment such dream which they failed to do so in the past. Such wild ambition and attempt of those forces are evidenced by the facts that in recent years they have stepped up the joint development of the missile defence system with the U.S., made desperate efforts to build an independent missile shield under the pretext of coping with the \"missile threat\" from someone and gone the lengths of adopting a \"basic law on the space\" in a bid to justify the moves to militarize the space and pursue them as a policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, \"the records of war crimes\" committed by Japan in the past, the history stained with the blood shed by the Korean and other Asian peoples, can neither be written off nor forgotten despite the flow of the time and the tempest of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stand to reason and behave itself.

This is a blatant challenge and provocation against the Korean people and the world progressives desirous of the peace, security and stability on the peninsula. For the detente on the peninsula the U.S. should refrain from any military action that may strain the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue and negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. are aimed at achieving the detente on the peninsula and improving the bilateral ties. But the U.S. trigger-happy forces are working hard to bedevil the bilateral relations and push the situation on the peninsula to an explosive phase by staging saber-rattling intended to escalate tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggravating situation on the peninsula is not beneficial to the U.S., either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither military blackmail nor pressure would help the U.S. war-like forces break or weaken the firm faith of the people of the DPRK.  They would be well advised to give up their foolish attempt to do harm to the DPRK by force of arms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Referring to this, media say that Lee Myung Bak tried hard to elicit support for his \"policy toward the north\" only to become a laughing stock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming this a natural outcome, Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the inter-Korean relations is, in fact, a reunification issue, an internal issue of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the Korean nation that is responsible for the north-south relations and national reunification. No foreign forces can replace the Korean nation in solving the issue of the inter-Korean relations and the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"No nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" advocated by Lee Myung Bak as \"a policy toward the north\" is aimed to aggravate the north-south relations and bring them back to those in the past, far from improving them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side has already disclosed the treacherous, anti-reunification and dangerous nature of his \"policy toward the north.\" Koreans at home and abroad are rejecting Lee's \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars,\" expressing full support and sympathy with the DPRK's reasonable stand. It is against this backdrop that even the conservative ruling forces in south Korea are openly asserting the need to modify the \"policy toward the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clearly proven by reality, Lee's humiliating diplomacy for soliciting approval and support for his \"policy toward the north\" while peddling the issue of the inter-Korean relations outside Korea will bring him nothing but ill-fame and shame as a traitor serving the outsiders with his back turned on the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak had better retract the \"policy toward the north\" rejected by all Koreans and settle his urgent problem.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
