            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Holds U.S. Wholly Responsible for Nuclear Crisis on Korean Peninsula\r\n Pyongyang, June 28 (KCNA) -- It was none other than the United States that spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in the light of its root cause and background against which it surfaced and from the viewpoint of the responsibility for the present situation. Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula is due to the U.S introduction of nukes into south Korea, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government has not ceased even a moment the struggle for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula against the U.S. introduction of nukes into south Korea, regarding the issue of removing the U.S. nuclear threat from the Korean Peninsula as a vital issue related to the destiny of the nation and an inevitable requirement for ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. has reacted to the sincere efforts of the DPRK by pursuing undisguised moves for a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue on the peninsula festered after the appearance of the Bush administration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and its nuclear war moves compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear deterrent for self-defence and bolster it up. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. made much fuss, expressing \"deep concern over north Korea's access to nuclear weapons,\" taking issue with the nuclear test for self-defence conducted by the DPRK to cope with its ever-increasing nuclear threat and its evermore undisguised moves for a nuclear war. It is working hard to create the impression that the DPRK has a \"nuclear ambition\" in a bid to label it a \"nuclear criminal,\" keeping mum about the background against which it came to have access to nukes and its purport and seriously falsifying the essence and truth about it. But this proved futile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's accession to nuclear weapons is not aimed at threatening and pressurizing other countries and mounting preemptive attacks on them unlike the U.S. The DPRK's nuclear deterrent is, to all intents and purposes, of self-defensive nature and has an aim and mission to champion peace. The Korean people are highly proud and honored to defend the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia as it has the full-fledged status of a nuclear weapons state in view of the U.S. moves for a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will bolster up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence in the future, too, in order to cope with the U.S. undisguised nuclear threat and moves for a  nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop kicking up a harmful extreme confrontation racket against the DPRK, cogitating about the nature and essence of the present serious nuclear crisis and its aftermath. This would do the U.S. good."
