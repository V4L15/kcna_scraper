Paektu, bearing in mind that they can not expect a victory in their future combat without sweat in the day-to-day trainings. They rapidly went over to their next combat action and thus carried out the order of the Supreme Commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un highly praised them for having successfully conducted the drill by applying the Juche war method and gave instructions to be fulfilled by the KPA to round off the combat preparations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that an army good at fighting would be unimaginable without drills and that if service personnel neglect training even a moment because there is no gunfire of war, they may bring irrevocable consequences in an actual battle. The KPA should make it part of their life and habit to do exercise, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need to prepare all service personnel as a-match-for-a-hundred fighters who are always ready for all services by thoroughly carrying out the training-first idea of the party, thinking of battles awake or asleep, while bearing in mind that an exercise means army and training is the first task among a hundred military tasks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He put forward a new training method and way which would serve as guidelines for preparing service personnel to be capable of satisfactorily performing their combat duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that the service personnel would firmly guarantee the accomplishment of the Juche revolutionary cause and the building of a thriving socialist nation with arms by making sustained great efforts for stepping up the battle preparations and bolstering up the combat capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ri Yong Gil, Pyon In Son, O Kum Chol, Ri Pyong Chol, Pang Kwan Bok and Jang Tong Un."

Any country has not been subject to all threats of war maneuvers for aggression of more than 18 000 times by the hostile forces against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a lie that Yankees are describing Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises as \"annual and defensive ones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t UFG is aimed to invade the DPRK and realize the ambition for \"change of the north's regime\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces' military exercises in south Korea are assuming more aggressive nature, and their scale, contents and form are going beyond those of military drills staged in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation proves that the DPRK's new strategic line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is, indeed, the only and just choice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fully support the statement issued by the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry which declared that if the U.S. continues staging nuclear war maneuvers to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, its counteraction for self-defense to cope with them will be put on an annual and regular basis."
