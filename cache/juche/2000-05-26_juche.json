It was against this backdrop that the U.S. House of Representatives recently adopted a \"bill\" calling for \"compulsory house and senate approval\" of any U.S. transfer of facilities and technology for atomic energy to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a move to deliberately throw hurdles in the way of carrying out the project that has already been much delayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework adopted in 1994 the United States is committed to complete light water reactors and hand them over to the DPRK by 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the United States has not properly fulfilled it. This has seriously retarded the LWR project and it will most probably be finished much behind the schedule. The United States is to blame for this. The U.S. has dragged on the project under this or that pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The LWR project is not something which the United States may or may not do. This is an unavoidable commitment and responsibility which it is committed to fulfil under the agreed framework and according to its President's guarantee message. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States should make its stand clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has suffered heavy economic losses due to its measure of freezing nuclear facilities. They are increasing due to the delayed construction of light water reactors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Now that United States seeks to delay this project, persistently raising a hue and cry over the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK, the DPRK can not but reconsider a corresponding counter-measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences of its unreasonable stand. \r\n\r\n"

This guarantees all independent and creative activities of man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Juche philosophy clarifies that independence, creativity and consciousness are closely linked with each other and they are attributes which find a common expression in activities of man.  Man has such attributes as people are social beings who form a social collective and live and work in social relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Juche philosophy thus defined the essential qualities of man as a social being with independence, creativity and consciousness.

The proposal is the best way for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea, the article says, clarifying its grounds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal indicates the most reasonable, fair and aboveboard ways of reunification acceptable to all classes, circles, parties and groups--composition of a unified national government, its mission, function and role, the authority and duty of a confederal government and regional governments, the character and name of a confederal state, the article notes, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal clarifies the external position of a confederal state by prescribing it as a neutral state, not joining in any political-military alliance or bloc nor being a satellite country of any powers. \r\n\r\n"

But it is only Japan which acts contrary to this, Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are the biggest victims of the Japanese Asian aggression, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After occupying Korea by force of arms, Japan kidnapped and forcibly took away at least six million Koreans to battle fields and  construction sites and forced nearly 200,000 women to become sex slaves for the \"Japanese imperial army.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese robbed Korea of incalculable quantities of agricultural produce and natural resources and looted cultural relics listed as national treasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hearts of the Korean people are shaking with towering grudge and resentment against Japanese imperialism.. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has persistently pursued a hostile policy toward the DPRK, far from making apology and compensation. Due to this shameless act, the relations between the DPRK and Japan have not improved though more than a half century has passed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no other way for Japan to  improve its relations with the DPRK but to honestly admit all its crimes committed against the Korean people and sincerely apologize and compensate for them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
