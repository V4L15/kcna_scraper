His speech is run through with the idea that the KRA should conduct brisk political and military activities to train core elements, secure weapons, accumulate experiences in military actions and closely rally broad sections of people and thus make full preparations for an organized anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Backbone elements were trained and mass foundation and military preparations made in a matter of two years after the formation of the KRA. Basing himself on this, he founded the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army in Antu on April 25, 1932. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the armed force, the Korean people could win in the national liberation struggle, overcoming unprecedented difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President always paid primary attention to the military affairs in the period following the liberation of the country, the Korean war (June 195    July 1953) and the post-war period, frustrating every aggressive move of the U.S.-led imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea, with which the Korean revolution has emerged victorious over the past 75 years since the formation of the KRA, is being successfully carried forward by Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il, true to the President's will, has creditably defended the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation, smashing the moves of the imperialists to stifle the DPRK.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
