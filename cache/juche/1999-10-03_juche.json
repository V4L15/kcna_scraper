Asserting that this afflicted tremendous damage upon a number of servicemen hurled into southern Vietnam, they demanded the enterprises make compensation to the tune of 5,160  billion won in total. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The victims filed a suit against the self-proclaimed \"government for the people,\" demanding compensation last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They had also brought the U.S.'s crimes to the international criminal court asserting that the production of defoliants is a wanton violation of the international law.\r\n\r\n"

It is not a matter that the South Korean authorities are entitled to poke their nose into, she said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As to the ceremonies and cultural functions they are events of morality and etiquette that all the members of the Korean nation are obliged to concern about and participate in whether they live at home or abroad, as well as political and religious functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is natural for the Chondoists to visit the mausoleum of the ancestral father of the nation and hold memorial services and make it an occasion of promoting trust and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So, it cannot be the target of suppression in any case. \r\n\r\n"

But the former Korean refugees still offer vivid descriptions of what happened there in late July 1950, of being strafed by U.S. planes and then fired on by U.S. soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nChung Koo-Shik, then 16, told the associated press that the planes came, raining down bombs and big bullets and a lot of people died. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOld woman Ri Yu-Ja, then 26, said dead bodies and cows were everywhere, spewing blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nYang Hae-Sook, then 12, said that her mother wrapped her with a quilt and hugged her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She said: It was shooting from both sides. When the bullets came, we could not even raise our heads, so we just dug under dead bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yang said she lost her grandmother, an elder brother and a baby brother and other relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Park Sun-Yong, then 25, said her 2-year-old daughter had already been killed by shooting and her 5-year-old son was hit in his thighs. Both his thighs were torn with bullets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAmerican soldiers wrapped my son in a white bag and buried him, she added. \r\n\r\n"

Hong argued that the \"main position of the government\" is to \"develop missiles\" that can reach all parts of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In other words, jo song thae meant that they would ignite war against the north with the help of their U.S. master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHong Sun Yong's remarks also had the same meaning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Then, why are the South Korean authorities who have no political powers and no military prerogative, resorting to the racket of confrontation and war with the north more viciously? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their argument about \"missile threat\" from the north, their card against the north, has turned out to be utterly false. South Korean people's support for the DPRK's overtures for independent and peaceful reunification has been widened with the August 15 Grand Pan-National Reunification Festival as an occasion. This situation is shaking the rule of the authorities to the very foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn an attempt to find a way out of their crisis, therefore, they try to unleash war against the north in concert with outside forces. \r\n\r\n"

Kim Jong Il defined this as a fundamental issue in strengthening the WPK as the party of Kim Il Sung forever and clarified theoretical and practical matters to that end comprehensively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In a signed article dedicated to the anniversary of the publication of the work, Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work is a historic document that solemnly declared the respected Kim Jong Il's iron will to strengthen the WPK as the party of Kim Il Sung forever. The work is also highly important in that it indicates the path to keep the revolutionary character of the WPK as the party of Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The past four years have witnessed this revolutionary character being safeguarded without deviation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il's leadership to strengthen the WPK as the party of Kim Il Sung is wise in that he consistently pursues Kim Il Sung's idea and line of party building and leads the party to do all work of the revolution and construction as Kim Il Sung did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the history of the world's socialist movement, there has been no other party than the WPK that inherits and implements the founder-leader's ideology, line and leadership method one hundred percent in party building and activity and all spheres of the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il is the supreme incarnation of loyalty and filial piety and the great statesman who has set a model of the times in strengthening the working-class party as the leader's party forever. \r\n\r\n"
