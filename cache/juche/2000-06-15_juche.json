He paid tribute to Kim Jong Il for the great efforts exerted for the preservation of political stability and the development of external relations and the economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said the Korean nation has undergone many ordeals in history and it is high time the Korean nation stopped weeping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said he fully agreed with the statement made by Chairman Kim Jong Il during his recent Chinese visit that the issue of the Korean peninsula should be solved by the Korean people themselves. I am also sure that the destiny of our nation can be carved out by the Korean nation itself, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted he was confident that the south-north summit talks were the starting-point for peace and reunification, the cherished desire of the 70 million Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Yong Nam spoke next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said  the two days spent after the meeting, the first of its kind in 55 years, were meaningful days during which years of too long separation seemed to be forgotten during the too short meeting and talks because of compatriotic feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   President Kim Dae Jung had a historic meeting with leader Kim Jong Il in Pyongyang and held the north-south summit talks. The meeting and talks repeatedly confirmed that the people in  the north and the south are of one and the same blood who should not live separated from each other and compatriots with whom no neighbors can stand comparison, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the first time that the supreme leaders of the north and the south met with each other and earnestly discussed ways of solving the national problem by the efforts of the compatriots and came to understand each other, Kim Yong Nam said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is something to be proud of as it showed a good sign of national unity to the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is most rewarding for the politicians of Korea to devote themselves to the nation and our politicians should not consider national reunification as a job to be done in future but pool all their wisdom and energies to make reunification a work to be undertaken now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed the belief that the Pyongyang visit of Kim Dae Jung would help achieve the country's reunification, the cherished desire of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The banquet proceeded in a cordial atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings.\r\n  \r\n"

Under the system  only director was responsible for the production and management of the enterprise and handled all the problems according to his own decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The President Kim Il Sung grasped the irrationality of the system of economic management and set forth the task to radically improve the guidance and management of the national economy at the second enlarged plenary meeting of the 4th Central Committee of the WPK in December Juche 50 (1961). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He gave on-site guidance to the Taean Electrical Machinery Plant for at least 10 days in December 1961 and acquainted himself in detail with the overall performance of the plant and the specific conditions of the workshops to tackle the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On this basis, he took the step of establishing a new system of industrial management at the enlarged meeting of the political committee of the party central committee held in mid-December of the same year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was the Taean work system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is system of industrial management which consists of a system of managing and operating a factory under the collective leadership of its party committee, a system of intensified technical guidance and comprehensive guidance to production, a materials supply system by which the higher levels directly supply materials to the lower and a supply-service system responsible for the living of the workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The creation of the Taean work system paved the way for overcoming the capitalist remnants in economic management and steadily consolidating and developing the socialist economic system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through the management and operation of the socialist economy under the Taean work system the socialist industrialization was completed in the DPRK in a matter of 14 years and the economy steadily developed at a high rate.\r\n\r\n"
