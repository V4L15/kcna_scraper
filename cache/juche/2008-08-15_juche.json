Paektu of the DPRK has achieved great successes in the comprehensive exploration of Mt. Paektu over the last two decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The comprehensive exploration of the grand nature of Mt. Paektu started early in the 1980s. It entered a new higher stage after General Secretary Kim Jong Il climbed up on the top of the mountain on August 18, Juche 77 (1988) to give historic field guidance to the work of the above-said group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group measured the depth of water in over 12,500 points in the whole area of the lake and in this course it discovered that the topography of the bottom of the lake is like a hollow plate and the deepest point of the lake is 384m. It also made an overall survey and measurement of the shore of the lake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This led to defining the morphological characteristics of the lake and crater and scientifically proving that the lake is the deepest in the world as a lake on the mountain as it lies more than 2,750m above the sea level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It succeeded in discovering the fact that atmospheric precipitation and wells and hot springs are the source of the water of the lake and that Amnok and Tuman rivers have their sources in the water flowing out of underground debouchment except the hole from which water goes out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several years of observation helped discover that 600mm annual precipitation is needed to make up for the loss of water in the lake but the annual average precipitation in the area is 2,269.2mm enough to keep the lake full of clear and clean water in four seasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group also found out that there are 216 peaks more than 20 meters high when one commands a magnificent view of them including 16 main peaks which lie more than 2,600m above the sea level such as Janggun Peak 2,750m high, the highest peak on the grand Paektu mountain range stretching to the southernmost end of Korea, Haebal Peak, Hyangdo Peak, Ssangmujigae Peak, Tangyol Peak, Rakwon Peak, Paekun Peak, Chongsok Peak and Chonmun Peak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group succeeded in discovering ice caves dozens meters to more than 200m long at the foot of the outer rim of Janggun Peak, Haebal Peak and Tangyol Peak in 2006, thus proving that snow always exists in valleys of the body of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group also proved that the lake has preserved in the main the present shape from about 800 years before despite protracted evolution since its appearance and the history of living things in the water is very short. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group observed that the permanent frozen layer on the lake is more than 10m thick and thickness of ice that stays on it for more than 210 days of the year is 1.5m and the ice is nearly twice as strong as that in plain areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The members of the group found out that the maximum wind speed on the mountain is 78.6m/s and observed the extreme values of atmospheric climate on the mountain, while discovering that minimum temperature on the mountain is -47.5 degrees centigrade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also made a scientific survey and analysis of the ecological environment in the water of the lake and, on this basis, bred chars of Tuman River in the water of the lake on an experimental basis before adapting them to its new environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They confirmed that at least 2,260 species of plants including 384 species of plants originating from the shore of the lake as well as more than 1,970 species of animals were distributed in the area and the number of birds habitant there account for 48 per cent of the species of birds habitant in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They collected in the lake Rana temporaries, fresh water tortoises and other species of amphibian and reptiles and observed a moose weighing 200 kg, brown bear, wild boar, raccoon dog, big sea gull from the South Sea of Korea, bald eagle and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The overall survey of the mountain and the lake led to the discovery of such spectacular sceneries as water falls including Sagimun Falls, multifarious snow-covered scenery presented by Piru Peak, mysterious scenery of four seasons one can enjoy at one place, the wonderful scenery presented by water falls from the cliff of the crater at the end of summer rain, Koggul Falls from the cliff of Hyangdo Peak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group thus discovered the secret of the magnificent nature of the mountain that lasted for ages by waging a heroic struggle true to the noble patriotic intention of Kim Jong Il and his wise leadership, making the spirit of the mountain, the symbol of Juche Korea, and its fantastic scenery widely known to the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In August of 1943, two years ahead of their surrender, they also promulgated the \"ordinance on conscription system\" to mobilize more and more Korean people for the war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By it, the Korean adults were obligated to be \"conscripted\" and not only lots of youth and middle-aged people but also children in their teens were dragged out to battlefields only to die a cruel death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to data available, the number of those \"conscripted\" to the army and navy was 240,847, that of \"volunteer soldiers\" for the army 17,664, that of \"student soldiers\" 4,385 and that of civilians attached to the army and navy 154,186, totaling more than 417,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of Koreans who were subjected to the unbearable mental and physical sufferings on the battlefields and backbreaking working sites by the forcible \"army conscription\" and \"labor drafting\" amounted to more than 8.4 millions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over one million Koreans were slain cold-bloodedly by the Japanese imperialists and 200,000 Korean women were forced to serve the aggressor army as sexual slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brutal atrocities of the Japanese imperialists are inhumane war crime unprecedented in the world and are intolerable as thrice-cursed ones which imposed immeasurable sufferings upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the reactionaries of Japan, far from apologizing and compensating for the hideous crimes they had committed against the Korean nation in the last century, are engaged in re-invasion moves such as distortion of the history of aggressive war and attempt to seize Tok Islet while evading the responsibility still in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of Japan must be clearly mindful that no matter how desperately they try to distort the history and cover up crimes, they can not shirk the responsibility for redeeming the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never forget the sanguinary aggressive crimes of the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They launched aggression against Korea and Manchuria and ignited the Sino-Japanese war, the Pacific war and other wars of aggression, bringing so horrible misfortune and sufferings to humankind and plundering various countries of countless treasures and taking them to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shrine bears witness to the monstrous crimes committed by Japan after occupying Korea and other Asian countries in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries justify visits to it, claiming that they are \"an internal affair\" and branding the just demand of the Asian people for a halt to them as \"interference in the internal affairs of Japan.\" This is nothing but an attempt to repeat at any cost the history of aggression and crimes in the past century in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceaseless visits to \"Yasukuni Shrine\" in Japan are a total negation of the Japanese history of aggression and crimes and a version of the policy for \"turning Japanese into subjects of the Japanese Emperor\" and \"keeping people in ignorance\" in a bid to prepare the youngsters and other people as \"a shock brigade\" for reinvasion of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then why is Japan so keen to revive militarism through ceaseless visits to \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and reckless remarks? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most important task facing militarist Japan at present to reinforce the political and military base for continental aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It considers it a primary task to bring up a lot of blindly \"loyal subjects\" capable of undertaking a war of aggression in the future, taking advantage of a new fascist environment growing strong throughout the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This betrays the real aim sought by the Japanese ultra-right forces in persistently trying to legalize and popularize the visit to \"Yasukuni Shrine.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their calculation that they can realize their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" when they make the younger generation believe that a war of aggression they launch is a \"just war\" and bring up them as adherents to militarism and Japan emerges a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese politicians had better bear in mind that a visit to \"Yasukuni Shrine\" leads to militarism and destruction and disgrace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Koreans' movement for national reunification has definitely turned into a nationwide patriotic movement and a massive struggle, irrespective of idea and ism. The national reconciliation and unity have been promoted and the movement for national reunification has made dynamic progress under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" despite the blatant challenge and obstructions of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad. This goes to clearly prove that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" truly serves as a banner for promoting the advance of the June 15 era of reunification and leading it and an idea for all Koreans as it has tremendous vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sure guarantee for ensuring a steady dynamic advance of the June 15 era of reunification to fully support, firmly defend and thoroughly implement the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" the idea of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas will firmly uphold the idea of \"By our nation itself\" despite any difficulties and ordeals and vigorously advance the June 15 era of reunification with its might.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
