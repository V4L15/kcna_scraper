            "content": "Purpose of S. Korea's Delayed Opening to Public of Missile Test-fire Laid Bare\r\n Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces conducted a ballistic missile test-fire in secrecy at the Anhung firing range in Thaean, South Chungchong Province on Mar. 23 and opened it to public more than ten days later.\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean media are loudly advertising that the puppet forces succeeded in the test-fire of a ballistic missile with a range of 500 km by applying foreign technology. They are openly claiming that if these ballistic missiles are deployed to be ready to go into action next year, they can put the whole area of the northern half of Korea except North Hamgyong Province within the striking range.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army gave the following answer to a question put by newspaper Joson Inmingun on Saturday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that the puppet forces are claiming that they did a great job by conducting a test-fire of a ballistic missile with a range of just 500 km. And it cannot but be construed as a comedy that they opened to public the test-fire so late.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, units of the Strategic Force of the KPA successfully conducted their regular rocket launching drills from late February to late March. At that time the south Korean puppet forces made much fuss together with the U.S., creating impression that the rockets launched by the KPA dropped in the heart of Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the south Korean puppet forces which worked more desperately than any others in a bid to slap fresh \"sanctions\" against the DPRK while labeling the launching drills as a \"violation of the UN resolutions\" and a \"provocation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ceaselessly heard from south Korea these days are voices chiding the puppet forces' poor military reaction to the regular artillery naval firing drills of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make matters worse, even drone cases occurred all of a sudden, more badly tarnishing the image of the puppet forces which had fallen to the ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thrown into a pretty fix by the artillery naval firing drills in waters, a hotspot in the southwestern sector of the front, and the drone cases, the puppet authorities urgently required a way to put the situation under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They orchestrated a charade out of agony. It was to open to public in great haste the missile test-fire conducted in secrecy and advertise it as something great and \"big success\" in a bid to calm down the mounting accusation and derision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric could they improve their poor position. This farce only brought disgrace to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People are anxious to know how the U.S. will approach the opening to public of the missile test-fire by the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because what approach the U.S. will take towards the rocket launching drills conducted by the KPA and the south Korean puppet forces' missile test-fire, both of which happened on the Korean peninsula, would help judge again the American style standards and mode of action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the south Korean puppet forces will have no face to find fault with the DPRK over its justifiable rocket launches and its exercise of the right to self-defence any longer no matter how desperately they may wag their tongues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The south Korean puppet forces should properly know that their position is becoming more pitiful as they are hell-bent on the confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., too, would be well advised not to groundlessly take issue with the DPRK over its measures to bolster up its deterrence for self-defence."
