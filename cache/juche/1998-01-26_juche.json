            "content": "Self-reliance, Korean way of revolution\r\n  Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- A national meeting of example-setters in self-reliance is soon to be held in the capital city of Pyongyang.\r\n   The meeting will review the achievements and experience gained during the \"arduous march\" and discuss tasks and ways for accelerating the forced march this year for a final victory by fully displaying  the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.\r\n   Self-reliance has long been the way of revolution and life peculiar to korea. \r\n   In the 1930s anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters, the first generation of the Korean revolution, had to fight against the Japanese imperialists, with neither state-backing home front nor support of a regular army. However, they made \"Yongil Bombs\" with empty hands and wrested weapons from the enemy to win in the war.\r\n   In the '50s the heroic Korean people and army won the war against two million-strong forces including the U.S. and troops from fifteen satellites.\r\n   The three-year war had reduced everything of Korea to ashes. The U.S. asserted that one hundred years would not be enough for korea to rise up again. \r\n   However, steel makers of korea ensured the first tapping 40 days after the war, by giving full play to self-reliance.\r\n   Equipment and facilities were rehabilitated in many industrial establishments in a short period. \r\n   Machine producers manufactured tractors and lorries with their own technology and efforts, while a Juche-based chemical fibre centre was built.\r\n   Among the achievements made by self-reliance are the West Sea Barrage, which was built on a rough sea extending eight kilometres in no more than five years, dressing plant no.3 with an annual capacity of ten million tons at the Komdok Mining Complex and 10,000-ton press weighing several thousand tons.\r\n   In recent years the gigantic Anbyon Youth Power Station took its shape even under the imperialists' economic blockade.\r\n   Korea's industry is unaffected by worldwide upheaval because it basically depends on domestic raw materials.\r\n   The Korean people have so far lived depending on themselves and will do so in the future, too.    \r\n\r\n"
