Korea Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- The United States recently let the U.S. 8th Army Command stationed in south Korea and those \"who claimed to be experts on Korean affairs\" assert that the U.S. forces should stay in south Korea to carry out their duties to deter provocations and strive hard to contain the neighboring powers and preserve peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Some days ago, U.S. President Bush let loose sophism intended to justify the presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. advertisement of its forces in south Korea as \"war deterrent\" and \"forces for peace-keeping\" is nothing but sheer sophism. If the U.S. truly stands for preventing a war on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace in the Northeast Asia, it should make a bold decision to pull its troops out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military occupation of south Korea by the U.S. imperialists was a product of their hegemonic ambition to bring the whole of the Asia-Pacific under its military control by using the Korean Peninsula, the gateway to Asia, as a springboard and thus to dominate the whole world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior intention of the U.S. to carry out its reactionary strategy for invading the DPRK and the rest of Asia by using south Korea as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proved by the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises staged in south Korea recently, the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and their ceaseless large-scale war exercises are the main factors of threatening peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and a most vivid manifestation of the hostile policy of the U.S. toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undisguised attempt made by the U.S. to perpetuate its forces' presence in south Korea at a time when positive developments are taking place in the inter-Korean relations cannot be interpreted otherwise than a dangerous move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea is so urgently demanded by the Korean nation and the times that it brooks not a moment's delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pullback of the U.S. troops from south Korea would help remove the root cause of war, defuse the tension and open a phase decisively favorable for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also beneficial for bringing down the structure of the Cold War in Northeast Asia and preventing military confrontation and arms race in the region, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
