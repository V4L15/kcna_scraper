Yet it has resorted to a despicable trick to twist the nature of the issue while shifting the blame for such deadlock onto the DPRK side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The clandestine nuclear-related experiments disclosed in south Korea this year clearly prove what a serious extent the U.S. prejudiced double standards concerning the nuclear issue have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the U.S. has undisguisedly worked to realize international blockade against the DPRK by plugging other countries into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. expected the DPRK to change its principled stand and yield to the U.S., scared by its international cooperation and blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the .U.S. imperialists faked up the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" under the pretext of the fictitious human rights issue in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year they have left no means and methods untried to isolate and stifle the DPRK but their moves suffered a failure and setback in face of the DPRK's policy of toughest countermeasure based on its powerful military deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula this year again teaches the lesson that the U.S. does not seek a solution to the nuclear issue and the establishment of peaceful relations between the two countries and it is, therefore, necessary to fight against it with arms to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to draw a lesson from the trend of the situation on the peninsula this year and opt for making a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and peacefully co-existing with it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has become the fascist law unprecedented in the world's legislative history, after being changed for the worse again and again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It defines the north of Korea and progressive organizations of overseas Koreans as \"anti-state organizations\" and fellow countrymen in the north and abroad affiliated with them as \"members of anti-state organizations\". It also calls for punishing all those who \"praise, inspire and sympathize with the anti-state organizations\" or \"benefit them\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive rulers of south Korea have used the anti-democratic, anti-human rights and anti-reunification law as means of executing their treacherous and flunkeyist policies and prolonging their days in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They cooked up non-existent \"cases\" and arrested and killed a large number of pro-reunification champions and patriotic students, availing themselves of this law.
