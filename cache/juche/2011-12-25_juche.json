Korea of Barring Mourner Groups from Visiting DPRK\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, December 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Sunday slamming the south Korean authorities for barring south Koreans from all walks of life hoping to pay condolences over the demise of leader Kim Jong Il from visiting the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation and the world are mourning in great sorrow the loss of a peerlessly great man.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Personages of not only those countries which have friendly relations with the DPRK but many other countries, to say nothing of Koreans are expressing deep condolences in bitter grief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Broad south Koreans including those who had been involved in Pyongyang summits and political parties and organizations published condolence addresses, voicing their willingness to dispatch mourners groups.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking the ardent wish of south Koreans into full consideration, the DPRK decided to accept condolatory groups and missions of the south side and opened routes by land via Kaesong and air. It also took measures to provide every convenience to the visitors and guarantee their safety.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, have not only prevented south Koreans from visiting the DPRK to share grief with us but tried to justify their unethical acts talking about \"violation of principle\" and \"occurrence of conflict among south Koreans\" in a bid to quench the hot wind for condolatory visits to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive even let loose sophism of \"separating north leadership from the inhabitants\", indicative of his design to escalate confrontation with the DPRK, in a bid to break the single-minded unity of the people in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities' unethical acts bereft of elementary etiquette and compatriotism have touched off unanimous outrage and wrath among Koreans and all other people of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans still shudder at the treacherous act committed by traitor Kim Young Sam 17 years ago as he hurt the nation which was languishing in bitter grief at the loss of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never tolerate anyone checking mourners, branding them as top class criminals seriously insulting the supreme dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that their obstructions will entail unpredictable catastrophic consequences to the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nation will finally test the morality of the south Korean authorities as well as the sincerity of their call for improvement of the north-south relations."
