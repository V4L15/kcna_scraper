            "content": "Korean Painting with Long History\r\nPyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- The Korean painting is one of national heritages boasting of long history of development. It can be well evidenced by tomb murals of Koguryo (B.C. 277-A.D. 668) and pictures of Dam Jing and Sol Ko, famous artists of Koguryo and Silla.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean painting was further developed in the period of the Feudal Joson Dynasty (1392-1910), clearly showing the characters peculiar to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But at that time, landscapes in ink came to form the main current of the Korean painting due to literary-style painters who had inclined to landscape, depreciating the figure painting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic limitations of the Korean painting could be overcome and the Korean painting step into the phase of fresh development, thanks to President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung had wisely led the work to overcome the tendencies of national nihilism and restorationism, which intend to despise the Korean painting or revive its shortcomings, and to develop the Korean painting as required by the sentiment and emotion of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il saw to it that top priority should be attached to the Korean painting ahead of other forms of fine arts to establish Juche in the field of the fine arts and thus successfully create the socialist national fine arts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the Korean painting is being developed into the main form of the socialist national fine arts."
