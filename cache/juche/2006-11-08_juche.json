This is a clear proof that it is putting spurs to the moves to bolster its modern nuclear force, increasingly depending on nukes in realizing its strategy for world domination.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. new nuclear arsenal project reflects the Bush administration's policy of attaching importance to nukes and it is prompted by its barbarian, brigandish and aggressive design not to bother to use even nukes to achieve its hegemonic and predatory objectives, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists were the first to test the nuclear explosion and use nukes against humanity in the world in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have become all the more undisguised in their attempt at a nuclear war in the new century. The Bush administration considered the strategy of preemptive nuclear attack as the mainstay of its \"national security strategy\" in the 21st century and has since frantically pushed forward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has staged DPRK-targeted nuclear war exercises of various codenames one after another by mobilizing its allies including south Korea, thus bringing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension. Such being a hard fact, the U.S. is justifying them, describing those saber-rattling as one for \"security\" and \"peace.\" With nothing can the U.S. imperialists justify their nuclear war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for posing the danger of a nuclear war to the world. Humanity finds itself in the danger of a catastrophic nuclear war as the U.S. imperialists are increasing the threat of a nuclear war to other countries while frantically stepping up the preparations for a nuclear war after sidestepping nuclear disarmament. The world can never be free from the danger of a nuclear war nor can humankind escape such danger as long as the U.S. keeps pushing forward the preparations for this kind of war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea-U.S. \"Combined Command\" Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Command\", a military mechanism for aggression to carry out the U.S. strategy against the DPRK, should be totally dismantled. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday demands this in a signed commentary carried 28 years since it came into being on Nov. 7, 1978. \r\n Since its inception the command has played the role as a principal mechanism for establishing the U.S. military domination over south Korea and stepping up the preparations for a war against the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' strategy against it, commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The public at home and abroad is becoming increasingly assertive for the disorganization of the above-said command. It is against this backdrop that there is opinion calling for the dismantlement of the command over the issue of \"transferring the right to control wartime operations between the U.S. and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Why does the U.S. intend to give up the command at this moment? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' intention to transfer the above-said right to the south Korean army and disorganize the combined command does not mean their willingness to halt their moves for a war against the DPRK, much less terminating the presence of their forces in south Korea or abandoning their right to command and control the south Korean army. This only reveals their sinister intention to escalate them in a smoother manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the U.S. intention to set up a new operational cooperation headquarters for both peace and war times as a substitute for the combined command in case of transfer of the above-said right.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected new headquarters is different from the existing command in name only because it will play the same function as it has so far done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists went in south Korea under the signboard of the \"UN Command\" when they felt the need to do so and used the signboard of the \"U.S. Army Command\" present in south Korea and the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Command\" when they needed that. Now they are seeking another signboard to achieve their objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts indicate that as long as the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops remain in south Korea and the U.S. persistently pursues its policy of aggression against the DPRK, the U.S. loud-mouthed \"transfer of the right to control wartime operations and disorganization of the \"combined command\" are nothing but charade as they are senseless and spurious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Command\" should be totally disorganized. And this will come true only when an end is put to the U.S. presence in south Korea and its policy of aggression towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
