Kim Jong Il first went to the cattle sheds of the farm which had been in normal operation since its construction 2 years ago. He learned about the management and operation of the farm, inquiring about the feed supply system, veterinary disinfection, weight gaining rate of beef cattle and other matters in breeding.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He noted with great satisfaction that the employees of the farm had produced a large amount of beef in a short span of time since the commissioning of the farm and sent it to soldiers and civilians. He appreciated their exploits.   He went to the cattle sheds and other objects newly built by soldiers within the framework of the second project. And he noted with great satisfaction that the soldiers had successfully completed the vast project on modern lines in a little more than a year.   At the end of the inspection, he put forward important tasks to develop the nation's stock-breeding onto a new stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He recalled that chicken, duck, pig and cattle farms and other solid stock-breeding bases had been built in different parts of the nation and that tremendous achievements had been made in livestock production.   He called for bringing about a new turn in the development of stock-breeding in order to provide the Korean people with best meals.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that in order to enhance the efficiency of investment in stock-breeding, the breed problem should be resolved decisively by nursing excellent breeds suited to the specific conditions of Korea.   He also said that good feed bases should be built, the breeding be put on a scientific and technological basis and veterinary disinfection be ensured.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He earnestly called on the officials, party members and other working people in the sector of stock-breeding to fulfil their tasks and supply larger quantities of meat, eggs and other nutritious non-staple food to the Korean people who devotedly work for the prosperity of the socialist motherland established by the President Kim Il Sung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was accompanied by KPA generals Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and col. general Ri Myong Su.

According to the information bulletin, the South Korean authorities sentenced her to imprisonment on charges of \"praise, encouragement, meeting and communication\" banned by the \"NSL\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a premeditated and intentional repressive action to totally block the reunification patriotic movement of the South Korean students and disorganize and destroy Hanchongryon, a just patriotic organization, by connecting her with the north on the absurd charge of being \"pro-north\" and \"benefiting the enemy\".   Hwang Son's visit to Pyongyang can never be a crime as it was a praiseworthy one for national reconciliation, unity and reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The action taken by the present South Korean authorities clearly proves that they are an anti-reunification group much worse than the preceding military fascist dictators and the \"civilian\"-veiled dictator, though they are giving lip-service to \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They must unconditionally set free all the unreasonably arrested patriotic students and pro-democracy figures including Hwang Son and repeal the \"NSL\", an anti-reunification fascist law, at once as unanimously demanded by the people at home and abroad. \r\n\r\n"

And he took a series of measures to ensure that health care institutions across the country take special care of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Geriatric departments operating at all provincial medical university hospitals regularly register macrobians in their Provinces and conduct medical check-up on them. National hospitals are treating those registered, regardless of their abodes.   The state took a measure to ensure an uninterrupted supply of rice to those of over 90, although the food situation remained very difficult in recent years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The number of macrobians is on a steady increase in Korea thanks to the most popular policy and the best health care system of the Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government. \r\n  \r\n"

Basing himself on the immortal Juche idea, he clarified the most just and reasonable principles and ways of national reunification. Among them are the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--and their embodiment, the proposal of founding the democratic confederal republic of Koryo and the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He founded the Juche idea with an insight into the urgent demand of the times and aspiration of the people and developed it into a guiding idea for the times and the nation through his distinguished ideo-theoretical activities and revolutionary practice.   Under the banner of this idea he waged a hard and bloody fight against the Japanese imperialist aggressors, camping out in the vast Mt. Paektu area so as to liberate the country. He also defeated the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces which invaded the DPRK, and demonstrated the dignity of the independent nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is the eternal sun of independence that freed the Korean nation from the abyss of humiliation and  subordination and made it a dignified independent nation, with his extraordinary leadership ability and politics of independence.   He, the great thinker and theoretician and statesman, put forth the idea of preserving the Juche character and national character for the first time in history and led the cause of national independence to victory by successfully applying it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He is also the sun of benevolent love who regarded as his lifelong maxim the idea \"the people are my god\" and took care of the fellow countrymen with politics based on warm love for the nation and people.   Our anthropocentric society where the people are masters of everything and everything serves them is a brilliant fruition of President Kim Il Sung's popular politics. And the society pervaded with human love, in which all of the people help and lead each other forward like one big harmonious family, is the result of his benevolent politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Indeed, our fatherly leader Kim Il Sung is the sun of love who devoted his all to the people and to the fellow countrymen.\r\n   The cause of national independence, started and led by him, and his enduring feats for the country and the nation are successfully carried forward and defended by the great leader Kim Jong Il to shine forever. \r\n\r\n"

So, I defected to the north, ready to risk my life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Ham Nam Gi, 55, in Sinuiju city, North Phyongan Province, had this to say:    South Korean fishermen could hardly expect any delight in their life.    Fishing often led to death. With warships engaging themselves in military maneuvers fishing was dangerous. Fishermen eked out their living.    On November 30, 1968 I was at sea off Kosong, Kangwon Province, aboard a fishing boat \"Ryongmaeng.\" Availing myself of that opportunity, I defected to the north.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Jong Jang Baek, 50, in Ryongchon county, North Phyongan Province, said:    I kept the pot boiling by fishing aboard a fishing boat \"Changyong.\"    The South Korean fishermen are forced to battle with the wind and waves for the rich.    More fishermen lost their lives than those who survived.    I was determined to defect to the north at the risk of my life rather than keep on such a life.     Ready to die, I got aboard a ship on April 16, 1968 and defected to the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The defectors, who enjoy a happy life under the care of the DPRK government, denounced the South Korean authorities for describing the former as \"those who were taken prisoner or abducted by the north.\"\r\n\r\n"
