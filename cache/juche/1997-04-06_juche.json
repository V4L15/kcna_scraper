He also expounded the ideological basis of achieving the unity based on patriotism and the spirit of national independence and the principle of promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and subordinating everything to the cause of national reunification.  Rodong Sinmun says:\r\n   The 10-point programme, for its transparent patriotic stand and fairness, is the most reasonable and realistic, great political programme for national unity as well as a great charter of national reunification, which is acceptable to anyone who truly loves the country and the nation and wants reunification, irrespective of differences in ideology, idea, systems, residential areas and property. \r\n   All the pro-reunification patriotic forces in the north, the south and abroad should unite close under the banner of national independence and peace, transcending differences in ideology and systems to smash every move of the anti-reunification bellicose forces at home and abroad and open a turning phase for the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\r\n   People from all walks of life in the south should add fuel to the already-kindled flames of the struggle against Kim Young Sam and oust him from power without delay.\r\n   If the United States truly wants peace on the Korean Peninsula, it should renounce its hostile policy towards the DPRK, the leftover of the cold war era, in keeping with the changed international situation, in which the Cold War between the east and the west has ended, and in the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. And it should affirmatively respond to the DPRK's proposal for establishing a new peace-keeping mechanism to replace the outdated armistice system. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Young Sam on verge of ruin\r\n  Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- A public opinion poll conducted by a south Korean organ  among 508 people throughout south Korea over telephone showed that 74.6 percent of pollees said Kim Young Sam is directly or indirectly involved in the Hanbo incident. 77 percent held that the background of the \"Presidential Election\" funds of 1992 must be investigated and 92 percent said that his son Kim Hyon Chol should be brought to court.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The poll indicates that south Korean people brand Kim Young Sam and his son as the principal culprits of the Hanbo financial scandal and call for taking a judicial action against them.\r\n   Kim Young Sam lined his own pocket and fattened comprador businesses by illegally circulating a colossal amount of money amounting to nearly 6 trillion won, putting  the south Korean society in a serious political and economic crisis and the livelihood of the people in a critical condition.\r\n   Kim Young Sam regime is a target of bitter condemnation.  \r\n   No matter how desperately it may try, it cannot escape from the political and economic crisis. \r\n\r\n"
