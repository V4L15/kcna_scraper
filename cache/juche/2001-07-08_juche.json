There he acquainted himself in detail with the land levelling and rezoning and farming conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the plain once dotted with small plots, has been realigned into a vast field of standardized size, he highly estimated the land builders' feats. Then, he met merited driver Kim Pom Ryong of the Jangphung county land construction station and his sons, who have fully displayed patriotism in the land realignment project, to take warm care of their working and living conditions and gave a pep-talk to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also expressed great satisfaction at the fact that the realigned land is greatly paying off. and he urged all the farmers to do farm work methodologically and meticulously, deeply conscious that they are responsible for the nation's granary, and take strict measures for preventing damage by rainstorm and insects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he visited the Jaechon Cooperative Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There he took hands of builders one by one, who performed heroic feats in the worthwhile grand nature-transforming project, and highly appreciated their patriotic deeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After learning about details of the land realignment and farming conditions, he called upon all the provinces, cities and counties to put spurs to the work to give face-lifting to the whole land of the country as soon as possible as befitting the land of socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly satisfied to see the village turned into a socialist paradise, he gave thanks to officials and members of the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also acquainted himself in detail with performance and use of tractor trailers and other farm machines running on fields. And he advanced tasks which will serve as a guideline in accelerating the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Farm machines of various types suited to the countryside of Korea should be produced in larger quantity, he said, adding that officials and workers in charge of farm machine production should pay deep attention to the invention and manufacture of quality farm machines popular among farmers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it is important to raise the rate of use now that a large number of various farm machines have already been supplied to the countryside, he indicated ways to do so.    \r\n\r\n"
