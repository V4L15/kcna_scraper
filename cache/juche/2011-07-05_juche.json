En el periodo de su mandato los titeres han armado de continuo los alborotos anti-RPDC aferrandose solo a la unilateral \"politica sobre el Norte\" caracterizada de enfrentamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Las actuales provocaciones de la banda de Lee parten de la intencion criminal encaminada a justificar la politica conflictiva y llevarla a cabo hasta el fin creando la conciencia de enfrentamiento y el ambiente  hostil contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ahora, la politica traidora del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak tropieza con una fuerte resistencia de los habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La banda de Lee intenta desviar la indignada opinion publica sembrando la conciencia hostil contra sus connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Nadie sabe cuando y como se aventuraria a provocar contra la RPDC la banda de Lee arrinconada por la peor crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Si se permiten tales perversas maquinaciones de provocacion anti-RPDC de la banda de Lee, se desataria en esta tierra la guerra nuclear."
