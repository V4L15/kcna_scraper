Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- Youth and student organizations of south Korea strongly demanded the authorities withdraw the \"enemy-benefiting\" label from the south Korean Council of Youth Organizations (Hanchong).\r\n The Youth and Students Solidarity for Implementing the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration in its statement on July 21 held that Hanchong is a patriotic organization struggling for democracy and independence of this land and has devotedly worked for the national reunification since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Labeling the organization as an \"enemy-benefiting\" organization instead of encouraging its activities is an act against the nation and reunification, the statement noted, demanding the authorities withdraw this label from Hanchong at once and repeal the \"security law\"(SL). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) in its statement on July 22 said that the authorities' labeling Hanchong as an \"enemy-benefiting\" organization is an act of going against the aspiration of the whole nation for reunification and a dangerous move of anti-reunification forces to hamstring the process of improving the relations between the south and the north and destroy the forces for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement demanded the authorities immediately withdraw this label from Hanchong, the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the South Headquarters of Pomchonghakryon and the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils and repeal the SL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, Son Jun Hyok, spokesman for the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration, released a statement on July 20. The statement said that security authorities' attaching the label of \"enemy-benefiting\" organization to Hanchong indicates that they have become desperate in their moves to prolong the remaining days on the strength of the SL. It urged the authorities to repeal the SL which brands the fellow countrymen in the north as an enemy and aims at cracking down upon the patriotic organizations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The banner of Songun reflects noble patriotism as it calls on all the Koreans to unite irrespective of their idea, political view, religious belief, class and social sections and warm compatriotism as it underscores the need to take care of and protect all the members of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics calls for increasing the capability for self-defence in every way to protect all the Koreans from the moves of the U.S. imperialists for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many difficulties and ordeals are still lying in the way of the Korean nation struggling for its independent reunification but nothing can stem the strong trend in the era of independent reunification when the Koreans are advancing in the Korean nation-first spirit as long as the Songun politics of the WPK is in force. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are firmly maintaining the anti-imperialist independent stand and faith in socialism, undeterred by any manifold difficulties and ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was proved by the fact that the National Assembly of People's Power of Cuba on July 1 adopted a declaration on rejecting the vicious sanctions of the U.S. imperialists to tighten blockade against Cuba and stamp out the Cuban revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the DPRK and Cuba are far from each other geographically, their peoples are strengthening support and solidarity for each other in their cause. The friendly and cooperative relations between the two peoples are growing stronger with each passing day thanks to their common ideology on the front of anti-imperialist struggle. This is accelerating the revolution and construction in the two countries and making contributions to accomplishing the socialist cause and the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Sunday said that the Korean people highly appreciate the achievements made by the Cuban people in their struggle to smash the undisguised sanctions of the U.S. against Cuba and to defend the cause of socialism, and send firm support and solidarity to them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their \"elite division\", B-29 aircraft, the Seventh Fleet and hundreds of warships were not enough for them to win in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As soon as the war broke out the KPA started an immediate counter-attack to liberate Seoul, the stronghold of the enemy, after three days. And it easily crossed over the enemy's defence line in Kumgang and annihilated the U.S. 24th Division, a \"pride\" of the U.S. Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A Christmas Offensive which was launched by the U.S. with five army corps for the purpose of ending the Korean war was frustrated by the KPA's tactics of second front. Even U.S. papers admitted that the defeat was unprecedented in the history of the U.S. Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. used even germ and chemical weapons which had been prohibited by international law, killed innocent people at random and drove tens of thousands of servicemen from its allies into dangerous battle sites to leave them dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the U.S. soldiers who were mobilized in the war for money were an increasing number of deserters to save their lives from defeated battles, 20,000 in the U.S. Army on a monthly average and 3,000 a day at maximum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In the three-year war the U.S. lost about 1.57 million troops, over 12,000 planes, more than 560 warships including the cruiser \"Baltimore\" and many other pieces of combat and technical equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. imperialists, who unleashed the war to invade the DPRK in its cradle, knelt down before the Korean people after suffering tremendous losses 2.3 times those in the Pacific War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people feel a great pride of being a heroic people who started the U.S. imperialists on the downhill.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
