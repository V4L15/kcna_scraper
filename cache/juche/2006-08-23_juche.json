            "content": "KPA Panmunjom Mission Terms \"Ulji Focus Lens\" War Action \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Panmunjom, August 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army issued a statement Tuesday condemning the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises that started in south Korea on Monday at a time when the U.S. has become ever more undisguised in its hostile policy towards the DPRK and its moves to isolate and stifle the latter and the stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. has reached an extreme phase.\r\n The statement said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side can not but draw serious attention to the fact that these joint military exercises are timed to coincide with the largest-ever naval and air combined maneuvers staged in the waters off the Korean Peninsula and those exercises are staged after keeping a carrier strike flotilla on alert in waters near it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are taking a serious note of the fact that the above-said war maneuvers were launched at a time when the DPRK and the U.S. are still in the relations of hostility and belligerence and after the former declared a war against the latter in a recent resolution of the UN Security Council adopted by wirepulling its followers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As clear to everyone, \"Ulji Focus Lens\" now underway in a terror-ridden atmosphere is obviously an undisguised military threat and blackmail against the DPRK and a war action going beyond the phraseology of violation of the Armistice Agreement (AA). No one can vouch that it would not go over to an actual war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has already clarified more than once that a preemptive military action against other side is not a monopoly of the U.S. and the KPA side, therefore, reserves the right to undertake a preemptive action for self-defence against the enemy at a crucial time it deems necessary to defend itself, now that the two countries still remain in the above-mentioned relationship due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mission is authorized to state that the KPA side would not be bound to the AA in taking on its own initiative military measures for protecting the security and sovereignty of the country in the future, considering the ongoing war maneuvers as a war action declaring the AA null and void.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Reckless calls for \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK are heard from among the Japanese reactionaries and they have become more undisguised in their moves to grab Tok Islet, part of the inalienable territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and present reality clearly prove that Japan is the principal enemy of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will employ every possible means and method to force Japan to pay for the blood shed by the Koreans without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They thus propounded the truth that the popular masses are the master of their own destiny and that their independent idea and consciousness and creative activities are the very force pushing history forward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-Japanese revolutionary literature and art based on the great idea and creative methods reflecting the demand of the times and the desire of the popular masses are precious assets and tradition of Korean nation's literature and art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With Kim Jong Il soaring as the lodestar leading the era of independence, the revolutionary literature and art of Korea began developing on a new higher stage with the anti-Japanese revolutionary literature and art created by the President as its brilliant tradition and a great flower garden of Juche-based literature and art spread in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the energetic guidance of Kim Jong Il, revolutionary novels and films based on the famous masterpieces have made their appearance and \"Sea of Blood\"-style revolutionary operas and \"Mountain Shrine\"-style dramas come into being. This is a successful inheritance of the tradition of anti-Japanese revolutionary literature and art and a precious fruition of the Juche-based literary and art revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bright is the future of Juche-based literature and art of Korea as it is guided by Kim Jong Il who is carrying forward to accomplishment the revolutionary cause of Juche and it has the shining tradition of revolutionary literature and art.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What is serious is that the south Korean authorities are zealously joining the U.S. in its moves to provoke a war against the DPRK. This tells that they are going against the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, inter-Korean ministerial talks were deadlocked and projects for humanitarian aid suspended due to the south Korean authorities' servile attitude toward the U.S. to deteriorate the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a wild daydream for the U.S. to seize the DPRK by force. The army and people of the DPRK are keeping sharp eyes on the U.S. war moves and will never allow the aggressors to intrude into the sky, land and waters of the DPRK even an inch.\r\n The U.S. should stop the adventurous war exercises against the DPRK at once and the south Korean authorities should stop depending on outsiders and take the road of national independence, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
