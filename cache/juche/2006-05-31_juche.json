He should have felt ashamed of the inglorious past history of his family and repented of it, though belatedly. But there is no sign of his feeling such moral responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, on the contrary, has justified and whitewashed his family's criminal history. This is clearly proved by what he uttered when he was active as minister of Public Management. He asserted that \"there was not such thing as forcible drafting\" and \"Japan just permitted Koreans to change their names into Japanese as they wanted it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that he can't be otherwise as he has inherited the tradition of the criminal family just as a crow can not turn out to be a white heron. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can not but be a tragedy of the Japanese political camp that a descendent of such shameful family is keen to be a frontrunner in the political arena though he deserves curse and censure from all people. No wonder, there are not a few heavyweights in the Japanese political camp at present who have similar family backgrounds as Aso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess which way Japan will go as descendents of such war criminals are still at large. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now censured as the sworn enemy of the Korean nation and as enemy of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will certainly force Japan to pay for all the damage and humiliation imposed upon the Koreans by the Japanese imperialists in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
