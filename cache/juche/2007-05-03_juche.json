This is a very dangerous criminal act of blocking the process of peacefully settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, escalating the military tension and driving the situation to the phase of confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in its signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the south Korean warlike forces' moves for arms buildup are timed to coincide with their war exercises targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war and peace can never go together. South Korea's reckless arms buildup strongly backed by the U.S. is a criminal act of aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula and driving the inter-Korean relations to a crisis again. It is quite unjustifiable as it is disturbing peace and security on the peninsula and the rest of Asia, sparking off an arms race and increasing the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. and south Korean warlike forces' reckless war moves against it behind the curtain of the dialogue but take measures to resolutely counter them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to clearly understand the gravity of the situation and the consequences to be entailed by it and discontinue their provocative and reckless arms buildup at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It rejects outsiders' involvement and interference in this cause and helps the nation solve the reunification problem in accordance with its own will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politics helps the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad have heightened awareness of national independence and pride and dynamically advance along the road of reunification and patriotism. It provides a sure guarantee for solving the problem of Korea's reunification for the establishment of the national sovereignty in it as a whole on the principle of national independence by the Koreans themselves. Herein lies one of reasons why the WPK's Songun politics becomes a patriotic one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This politics is also a politics for peace that helps prevent a danger of war on the Korean Peninsula and reliably protect the security of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a treasured sword of peace as it helps contain the U.S. imperialists' ever-more undisguised moves for a new war with deterrent for self-defence and create atmosphere favorable for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il, illustrious commander of Mt. Paektu, protect not only the DPRK from the imperialists' aggression but defend south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable stand and consistent policy of the WPK to embrace all Koreans loving the country and the nation and get them united irrespective of ideology, system, class and strata to achieve the reunification of the country, the cherished desire of the nation. The Songun politics is one of great national unity as it rallies all the Koreans closer under the banner of patriotism and national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Fascist Juntas' Human Rights Abuses under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The National Reconciliation Council issued a white paper Wednesday in which it denounced the successive south Korean fascist juntas for committing human rights abuses against south Koreans, depriving them of their elementary rights and democratic freedom and brutally massacring them after fabricating \"pro-communist cases\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The white paper says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They faked up \"pro-communist\" cases to ruthlessly suppress and kill pro-reunification patriotic figures and innocent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Syngman Rhee regime was the first to cook up such case in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fascist rulers openly committed terrorism against patriotic figures in a bid to eliminate their political rivals after labeling those patriots \"pro-communists\" under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. After installing a pro-U.S. separatist regime they enacted the \"National Security Law (NSL)\", the worst fascist law, in December 1948 in a bid to support the regime by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the Park Chung Hee military fascist clique seized power through the U.S.-orchestrated \"May 16 military coup.\" It also worked hard to fake up \"pro-communist cases\" to support the U.S. colonial rule and its dictatorial regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the miserable end of the \"Yusin\" fascist dictator, Chun Doo Hwan and Roh Thae Woo fascist juntas wrested power by force of arms to enforce a harsher fascist rule. Then came the Kim Young Sam fascist clique worse than its preceding military dictators as it faked up \"pro-communist cases\" under the signboard of \"civilian government.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean fascist juntas have deprived the south Koreans of their elementary rights and democratic freedom through the most brutal iron fist rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have even deprived the south Koreans of their right to express their will and give their views on what they have seen and heard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to gratify their political greed, they watched every move of people, men and women, young and old, ranging from politicians, scholars, media persons, businessmen, religionists, youths and students to ordinary citizens and housewives and put them under control. They indiscriminately arrested those incurring their displeasure even a bit and persecuted, tortured and killed them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military gangsters made even a former president aged over 80, \"presidential candidate\" of an opposition party and their right-hand man targets of execution and terrorism when they considered those figures to be standing in their way of enforcing the fascist rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean fascist juntas indiscriminately killed innocent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every mass-killing committed by the fascist cliques in collusion with outsiders since right after Korea's reunification is recorded as the most shameful hideous crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is known as \"mass killing of civilians\" during the Korean war was typical of the massacres that laid bare the fascist cliques' ogrish nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kwangju Massacre in May 1980 was the most hideous crime against humanity that bore witness to the fascist junta's monstrous mass-killing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fascist laws like NSL which were invoked for human rights abuses in south Korea in the past are still in force there and the descendents and remnants of the fascist cliques are working hard to restore their old regimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party of south Korea directly responsible for those human rights abuses has not yet made even a word of apology for the crimes committed by its predecessors. It is instead going so impudent as to talk about \"human rights\" and \"people's interests\" in a bid to come to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has no right whatsoever to talk about human rights as it has a crime-woven history behind it and it should be, therefore, not allowed to remain in the political arena any longer.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto es un acto criminal peligrosisimo encaminado a obstaculizar la solucion pacifica del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana, exacerbar la tension militar y llevar la situacion a la fase de confrontacion y guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual del dia 2 y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo mas grave es que el aumento armamentista de las fuerzas belicistas surcoreanas tiene que ver con los ejercicios de guerra de agresion al Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La guerra y la paz son incompatibles. Por lo tanto tal aumento armamentista exacerba la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana, lleva de nuevo las relaciones Norte-Sur a la fase peor, perturba la paz y la seguridad de esta region y el resto de Asia e incrementa la carrera armamentista y el peligro de guerra, lo cual no puede justificarse por nada. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El ejercito y el pueblo de Corea observan con alta vigilancia las temerarias maniobras belicas de agresion al Norte que libran los belicistas de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea detras de la cortina de dialogo y tomaran medidas decisivas contra ello. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las autoridades surcoreanas deben tener presente de la gravedad de la situacion creada y las consecuencias que emanen de esta y poner inmediatamente fin a su acto provocativo y temerario.\r\n    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
