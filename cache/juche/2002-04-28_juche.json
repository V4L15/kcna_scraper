His noble revolutionary life was the epitome of the political history of the 20th century and a glorious history in which an epoch-making example of an independent policy was created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His independent policies were great ones to achieve and defend the independence of the popular masses based on the immortal Juche idea and the most revolutionary ones to adhere to the steadfast anti-imperialist stand and strengthen the driving force of the revolution in every way and thus lead the revolution and construction to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policies shaped by the president were independent ones strictly based on the philosophical principle of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Adhering to the steadfast anti-imperialist stand is an important requirement for pursuing an independent policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He formed the down-with-imperialism union under the banner of the anti-imperialist independence and started the Korean revolution in his early years. Since those days of the anti-Japanese revolution, he had firmly adhered to the anti-imperialist independent stand all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He rallied the popular masses as one, guided by the Juche idea and solved all problems relying on their strength, thus giving origin to the benevolent politics, the first of its kind in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tradition of following independent policies has been successfully carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. as a result, the country enjoys the highest dignity and honor and the 21st century is shining as a century of independent policies.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean foreign minister hit for his reckless remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- South Korean minister of foreign affairs and trade Choe Song Hong spoke highly of the hard-line policy of the Bush administration toward the DPRK during his visit to the U.S., saying that it brought new progress in the north-south relations.\r\n The committee for the peaceful reunification of the fatherland in a statement today said that his remarks betray an ulterior intention to curry favour with the master and harm the fellow countrymen with his help, utterly indifferent to improving the north-south relations and developing dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south relations, which had been in a state of freeze due to the U.S. hard-line policy toward the DPRK, have been brought back on track and dialogue and contacts between the north and the south resumed entirely thanks to the steadfast will and sincere efforts of the DPRK to resolve the national question independently by the efforts of the Korean nation without depending on outside forces, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean foreign minister's remarks attributing the restored north-south relations to the result of the U.S. policy of \"strength\" are an unpardonable insult and challenge to the dialogue partner and an intolerable slavish submission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that such outburst let loose by the senior most official who is in charge of the issues of inter-Korean relations and peace on the Korean peninsula is by no means his personal view but represents the official stand of the authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to react to the U.S. policy of \"strength\" intended to infringe upon its sovereignty with its toughest position, not tolerating it in the least, and it is its firm will to let the nation play a main role in solving its internal problem by itself under all circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who react to good with evil are fated to meet only sledge-hammer blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such traitors who make a mockery of and insult the fellow countrymen, kowtowing to their master the U.S., as Choe Song Hong should be dislodged and eliminated at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and expect any improvement in the inter-Korean relations as long as these elements remain in office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the authorities of the south side sincerely hope that the inter-Korean relations will improve in the spirit of the joint declaration, they should apologize for the reckless remarks made by Choe Song Hong and take a responsible and understandable measure against his practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely watch the south side's attitude.    \r\n\r\n"
