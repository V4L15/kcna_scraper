Such  double-dealing attitude of the U.S. betrays its unchangeable aggressive ambition to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Demanding the South Korean authorities stop immediately their criminal ballistic missile development, the statements warned: If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities persist in those moves for a war of aggression, they will be held fully responsible for the ensuing dangerous consequences.  \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang tour \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 23 (KCNA) -- The South Korean monthly magazine Shin Dong-a, in its November edition, carried an article \"people of Mt. Kumgang\" pouring cold water on the tour of Mt. Kumgang and extremely provoking the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its writer who professes to be a \"scholar in politics\", in  the article, mocked at our people, saying that North Koreans may change their mind or \"it will be full of confusion\" when contacting tourists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went the length of letting loose an absurd piffle that North Koreans would \"be shocked by the appearance\" of South Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This  can not but arouse unanimous hatred and denunciation of our people as it is very serious anti-national utterance aimed to foil the tour of Mt. Kumgang now under way as part of the non-governmental  cooperation and bar inter-Korean reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gravity of the article lies in that it represents the foolish attempt of the South Korean authorities to destabilize the north by imbuing our people with the corrupt almighty-dollar principle through the tour of Mt. Kumgang and sending the wind of \"liberalization\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As already known, the DPRK took such a patriotic step as allowing South Korean people to tour Mt. Kumgang, taking into consideration their strong desire to see the  famous mountain of the nation, which is also the pride of the world, in order to meet the request of the South Korean Hyundai Business Group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the South Korean authorities, interfering in the tourism from its start, have worked hard to misuse it as a \"channel\" for serving their sinister purpose of transforming our people's  ideological and mental state and destroying  our system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The writer's foolish rhetoric suggests that he is either an operative or agent of the South Korean \"Intelligence Service\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His nonsensical article is, in essence, not different from what Min Yong Mi uttered in a foolish attempt to make our man \"defect to the south.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean \"Intelligence Service\" did not bother to orchestrate the \"second Min Yong Mi script\" through the magazine shin dong-a after it failed in the \"Min Yong Mi operation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the South Korean authorities are resorting  to every conceivable means and method to misuse the tour of Mt. Kumgang to create confusion in the mind of our people,  we feel the strong need to take correspondent measures to cope with  this move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities will be fully accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by the serious developments. \r\n\r\n"

This is the height of shamelessness peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries' claim that the DPRK's launch of satellite was a \"missile\"  launch and a \"threat\" to Japan is aimed at stepping up its moves to become a military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons in real earnest under the pretext of this \"threat.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised not to forget the saying \"curses, like chickens, come home to roost.\" \r\n\r\n"

This is clearly evidenced by their deliberate procrastination over the investigation into the massacre in Rogun-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is now lending a deaf ear to the proposal of the South Korean authorities for a joint investigation, while the South Korean authorities are keen on calming down the anti-U.S. spirit of the South Korean people under the pretext of \"friendly relations\" with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under this situation it is hardly possible to expect a probe into the truth about GIs' massacre from the U.S. and the South Korean authorities.
