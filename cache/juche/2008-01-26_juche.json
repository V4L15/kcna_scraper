Then, he dropped in at various production processes to acquaint himself in detail with the production and management of the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expressing his great satisfaction over the fact that the workers, technicians and officials of the farm have thoroughly established the scientific raising system and new production processes in the past to turn the farm into one serving for the people's living, he gave a high appreciation of their feats. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the farm is playing an important role in improving the people's diet, he set forth the tasks to be carried out by the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important, above all, in putting the production on a normal basis at high rate is to satisfactorily settle the feed problem, he said, stressing the need to strive for building solid fodder bases so as to supply nutritive feed, including protein fodder, by the farm itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to increase the production of chicken and eggs at the farm, he said, it is necessary to establish the scientific breeding system to gain good breeds suited to the climatic and soil conditions of the country and put the raising on a scientific basis, effectively ensure the equipment and technical management and steadily enhance the technical level and skill of the producers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also said that the farm should pay deep attention to the scientific research into poultry farming and provide enough disinfection facilities and thoroughly establish the strict anti-epidemic system to prevent loss of even a chicken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he went to the Kanggye Pig Farm newly built in Jagang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the farm in front of its panoramic picture, he went round it to acquaint himself in detail with its construction and management. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly praised the feats of its builders, noting with great satisfaction that the province has successfully built the modern pig farm with high capacity by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This modern stock-breeding centre in the province will be helpful to further increasing the meat production, he said, advancing the tasks to be carried out by the farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to produce more meat at the farm, it is necessary to establish the scientific management system on the basis of modern technology and, at the same time, take drastic measures for fodder supply to satisfactorily solve the feed problem by its own efforts and effect a new turn in raising pig, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being told that the production at stock-breeding centres built in different parts of the province has been put on a normal basis at high rate to pay off profoundly, he underscored the need to give fullest play to the production potentials of the already built chicken, duck, pig and rabbit farms so as to provide the people in the province with more bountiful and civilized life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the WPK Central Committee.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the society declared this in a statement issued Friday assailing Japan for instigating the Japan Land and Geographical Board recently to produce the above-said map on the basis of information collected from its observation satellite and the U.S. commercial satellite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the above-said action was prompted by the extremely sinister intention of the Japanese reactionaries to convince the public at home and abroad that Tok Islet belongs to Japan come what may, the statement goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is irrefutably proved and recognized from historical and international legal points of view that Tok Islet is part of the inalienable territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' claim to Tok Islet is no more than a far-fetched assertion which cannot go down with anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent distribution of the above-said map clearly proves that the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion to realize the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" have entered an extremely reckless and dangerous stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a more serious attention is the fact that the Japanese authorities made the claim to the islet at a time when they have become evermore undisguised in their moves against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan, acting as a shock brigade in executing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon the Japanese reactionaries keen to grab even the inviolable territory of Korea, while working hard to tamper with history instead of redeeming the hideous crimes committed by Japan in the past, but certainly force them to pay for all its crimes.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The strong military power has been the source of strength as it helped the DPRK resolutely defend its national sovereignty with strong pluck in the stand-off with the enemies and in foreign relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The powerful national defence capability of the DPRK instills strong national self-respect and great pride and honor into the Korean people united close around the Republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people always remain strong-willed and never allow anyone to hurt their national sovereignty as they have the invincible revolutionary armed forces. They are so strong in their national self-esteem that they never beg for peace no matter how dear it is to them nor follow what others do blindly. They feel proud that the Songun politics of the Workers' Party of Korea is the best and the unity between the army and the people is the strongest. This represents the self-respect and pride of the Korean people who have the powerful national defence capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's strong national defence capability also serves as powerful engine in achieving its economic prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now displaying its might as a dignified country with powerful national defence capability as it is led by Kim Jong Il, Songun brilliant commander of Mt.

The U.S. is apt to make a tougher approach towards any country behaving from a weak stand but hesitates and fears any country standing firm against it, firmly abiding by a revolutionary principle. It is, therefore, necessary to adopt an independent mode of counter-action and react to the U.S. hard-line policy from the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' hard-line policy will prove futile when the world revolutionary people boost the unity and solidarity and take joint actions, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
