It reaffirmed the principle of terminating the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. in the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework published on October 21, 1994 and the DPRK-U.S. Joint Communique announced on October 12, 2000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the Bush administration came to power it unilaterally abandoned its commitments stipulated in the documents related to the DPRK-U.S. relations signed in the period of the previous administration, reducing them to dead ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Talking about the \"written security assurances\" the U.S. is, in actuality, beefing up its armed forces around the Korean peninsula and staging military exercises targeted against the DPRK one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This teaches a serious lesson that there is no guarantee that the next administration will not backpedal the commitments made by the present administration and reveals with added clarity that the socalled \"written security assurances\" are nothing but a political plot of the Bush administration to mislead the world public and invent a pretext to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that unilateralism of the U.S. as a superpower has reached its height what is necessary for the DPRK is not a document changeable when the U.S. chief executive is replaced by another but a non-aggression treaty with a legal binding force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unthinkable for the DPRK to hope to see the nuclear issue solved and expect peace and security on the Korean peninsula, counting on Bush's \"written security assurances\" to be reduced to a dead document any time as it lacks Congress ratification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent refusal to conclude a non-aggression treaty compels the DPRK to steadily increase the nuclear deterrent force as a means for just self-defence to avert the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula and protect the sovereignty and security of the country.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is now becoming ever more undisguised in its military moves to stifle the DPRK in and around the Korean peninsula, thus compounding the nuclear issue, instead of working to solve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK is left with no option but to intensify the counteraction now that it has become clear that the U.S. does not have any willingness to renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

The historic Pyongyang meeting and the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration ushered in the new era of the nation, the era of national independence and reunification, when the Korean nation is hewing the road of reconciliation, unity and reunification by its own efforts.

Had the Japanese diplomatic boss been interested in their implementation, he should have mentioned Japan's obligation to redeem her past wrongs before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations between the DPRK and Japan worsened because of Japan's aggression and brutal crimes against the former over a long period and they have not yet been settled because Japan has evaded covertly and overtly its responsibility for the redemption of its past wrongs after the war, the author of the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being the fact, it is unbecoming and disgusting for Japan to play a clumsy farce to create the impression that it is interested in the improvement of the relations with the DPRK, letting out a stream of words even at the international arena about the solution of \"the abduction issue\", \"implementation of the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration\" and \"desire for the normalization of the diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan,\" while neglecting what it should do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is requesting the international community to help it, branding the DPRK, the victim, as the assailant.

Castigating this as a new step to prepare an invasion of the DPRK, Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today says:\r\n The U.S. imperialists' new step indicates that their espionage on the DPRK has entered a full-dressed stage and the danger of the second Korean war is growing. They announced an \"arms buildup plan\" for the U.S. troops present in south Korea and are carrying it into practice. The plan covers 150 items including an additional deployment of a rapid deployment brigade and latest missiles with the fabulous costing of 11 billion U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wanted a peaceful settlement of its nuclear standoff with the DPRK, there would be no need of arms buildup and espionage on the DPRK. There is no change in the U.S. imperialists' aggressive designs to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. Their talk about a \"peaceful solution\" is a reversed ballad of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When they are trying to completely disarm and swallow up the DPRK, it is entirely natural for it to take practical steps to maintain and reinforce its nuclear deterrent. The army and the people of the DPRK are countering with high vigilance the double-dealing tactics of the U.S. which is loudly talking about \"a peaceful solution\" of the nuclear issue while intensifying espionage on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A signed commentary of Minju Joson warns that if the aggressors invade the land, air and territorial waters of the DPRK even an inch, it will deal a decisive retaliatory blow at them and wipe them out.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
