            "content": "CPRK Blasts Park Geun Hye's Press Conference\r\n Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Thursday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards the fact that Park Geun Hye, \"presidential\" candidate from the \"Saenuri Party\" of south Korea, pulled up the DPRK at a recent press conference, while bragging about her stand on the May 16 military coup and the \"yusin\" dictatorship:\n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 24 when the issue of the \"yusin\" dictatorship surfaced as the main focus of the situation in the run-up to the \"presidential election\" in south Korea, Park Geun Hye at an urgent press conference made an apology to the victims, admitting the illegality of the May 16 military coup, the \"yusin\" dictatorship and the case of the People's Revolutionary Party, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She made a sudden U-turn in her stand though she zealously shielded the May 16 military coup and \"yusin\" dictatorship as inevitable \"historic choices\" even shortly ago. Her gesture was prompted by the concern that she might be defeated at the \"presidential election\" as the people's protest is running high and support rate for her is sinking due to her remarks embellishing the \"yusin\" dictatorship while the popularity of the candidates from the opposition camp is rising.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that at the press conference she groundlessly pulled up the DPRK, asserting that the May 16 military coup and the \"yusin\" dictatorship were inevitable actions to cope with the \"threat of southward invasion\" from the north and defend \"security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On a series of previous occasions she justified the \"yusin\" dictatorship by malignantly accusing the DPRK, asserting that but for the May 16 military coup and the \"yusin\" dictatorship, south Korea would have been swallowed up by the north long ago as the former was fully exposed to the latter's \"threat\" because of its weak national power in the 1960s and the 1970s and suppression of democracy to a certain extent was not so serious when compared with this threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What was disgusting was that she was compelled to make an apology under the above-said embarrassing situation. People were much more stunned by her outbursts that the May 16 military coup and the \"yusin\" dictatorship were attributable to the \"threat from the north\". This is preposterous and a wanton distortion of the historical facts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the periods of the May 16 military coup and the \"yusin\" dictatorship were concerned, people's desire for peaceful reunification grew stronger in the north and the south than ever before under the influence of the April popular resistance and thanks to the publication of the July 4 joint statement and there was no \"threat from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The south Koreans said that national reunification was the only way for them to live after the April popular resistance. They expressed ardent desire and will for peaceful reunification, chanting the slogans \"Let us go to the north, come to the south and let us meet at Panmunjom!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In hearty response to them, the DPRK advanced the most just and fair proposal which calls for organizing a mechanism common to the nation, leaving the political systems between the north and the south as they are and enforcing federal formula for promoting uniform development between the north and the south in order to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Was there any \"threat from the north?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation that prevailed in 1972 when traitor Park Chung-hee cooked up the \"yusin constitution\" helps the world know well that the three principles for national reunification reflecting independence, peaceful reunification and nation's great unity were laid down by the DPRK and they were solemnly declared as the July 4 joint statement at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Was this \"threat of southward aggression posed by the north?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already disclosed before the whole world, the May 16 military coup and \"yusin in October\" were fascist actions taken by Park Chung-Hee, a pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese military hooligan, to grab power and shore up his dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Park Geun Hye dared let loose the above-said outpourings. Her remark was an intolerable grave provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What she uttered at the recent press conference clearly proves that she remains unchanged in her stand and ulterior motive over the issues of May 16 military coup and \"yusin\" dictatorship and her \"view on the north\" is just the same as that of the former \"yusin\" dictator and traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that if she is allowed to come to power as she is making so desperate efforts to justify the \"yusin\" dictatorship utterly indifferent to public opinion at home and abroad, south Korean society will certainly meet disaster and the inter-Korean relations totally collapse. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will inevitably lead to the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship in south Korea, the escalation of confrontation between the north and the south and the increase of the danger of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People from all walks of life in south Korea should not be taken in by the crafty tricks of the \"Saenuri Party.\" They should not allow the revival of the second \"yusin\" dictatorship but resolutely oppose and reject it."

They are standing firm against imperialism and all reactionary forces. They are contributing to accomplishing the human cause of independence and peace through their struggle for independence against imperialism. The DPRK is holding high the banner of struggle against the imperialist hegemonic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The banner of socialism is fluttering in Asia, and Venezuela and other countries in Latin America are emerging new anti-imperialist independent forces aspiring after socialism. African countries, too, are aspiring after socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The non-aligned movement is powerful anti-imperialist independent forces in the present era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NAM, which has developed into the broadest international movement grouping huge population and 120 countries of the world, dramatically changed the balance of forces between progress and reaction and put strong spurs to the process of global independence.  The NAM could grow to be powerful forces energetically pushing forward the era of independence as it has preserved and developed the tradition of unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The might of the anti-imperialist independent forces of the world lies in the developing countries. They have tremendous economic potentials and account for more than 70 percent of the world's population.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have huge scientific and technological forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their might finds its vivid expression in that they are positively pushing forward regional integration and the multipolarization of the world through economic cooperation bodies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their rapid economic development in the new century draws international attention. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-imperialist independent forces in the world grew stronger in their might in the new century, far from becoming weak. They are incomparably stronger than the imperialist hegemonic forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can prevent the anti-imperialist independent forces from dynamically advancing towards the global independence."

Bajo tal circunstancia, Park Geun-hye, candidata presidencial del \"Partido Saenuri\", organizo el dia 24 la \"conferencia de prensa emergente\", ocasion en la cual reconocio la ilegalidad del \"golpe del 16 de mayo\", la \"renovacion\", el caso del Partido Revolucionario del Pueblo, etc. y pidio \"disculpa\" a sus victimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta hace poco, ella elogio el mencionado golpe y la \"renovacion\" describiendolos como inevitables \"opciones historicas\", y ahora cambio  apresuradamente su posicion, por la preocupacion de que ojala se fracase en las \"elecciones presidenciales\" por el aumento de la protesta de la opinion publica y la baja de la popularidad debido a sus palabras de encomio a la dictadura de \"renovacion y por el ascenso de la popularidad de otros candidatos del circulo opositor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que ella se atrevio a acusar a la RPDC diciendo que el \"golpe del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion\" fueron inevitables para prevenir la \"agresion al Sur por el Norte (de Corea)\" y defender la \"seguridad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon anterioridad, en varias ocasiones, tambien insistio en que en las decadas de 1960 y 1970 era muy debil el poderio nacional del Sur de Corea, razon por la cual se encontraba ante la \"grave amenaza del Norte\" y apunto que si no hubieran existido el \"golpe del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion\" el Sur se habria conquistado por el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY justifico la dictadura de \"renovacion\" agregando que el hecho de haber sido oprimida la democracia en aquel entonces no era tan problematico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi la candidata Park, que amparaba tanto el \"golpe del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion\", se vio obligada a pedir disculpa por el respecto y atribuyo el \"golpe del 16 de mayo\" y la \"promulgacion del sistema de renovacion\" a la supuesta \"amenaza del Norte\", lo cual consterna a todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu palabra ilogica constituye una gran tergiversacion sobre la verdad historica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel tiempo era mas fuerte que antes el animo por la reunificacion pacifica en ambas partes coreanas gracias al Levantamiento Popular de Abril y la  publicacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio y no existia nada la \"amenaza del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del Levantamiento Popular de Abril, los habitantes surcoreanos manifestaron en pleno despliegue el deseo y la voluntad de la reunificacion pacifica bajo la consigna \"!Vamos al Norte, ven al Sur y encontremonos en Phanmunjom!\" diciendo que la reunificacion solo es el medio de subsistencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En respuesta a ello, la RPDC presento el mas justo proyecto de dejar tal como eran los regimenes politicos existentes en el Norte y el Sur de Corea, organizar el aparato comun de la nacion y aplicar el sistema federativo que promueve el desarrollo unificado de ambas partes para realizar de manera pacifica la reunificacion del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por tal motivo, no existia ninguna \"amenaza del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al juzgar la circunstancia de 1972 en que el traidor Park Chung Hee inventaba la \"constitucion  renovada\", todo el mundo conoce que fueron presentados por la RPDC los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria: la independencia, la reunificacion pacifica y la gran unidad nacional, los cuales fueron publicados solemnemente al interior y exterior del pais como Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Como ya se revelo totalmente ante todo el mundo, el \"golpe de Estado del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion de octubre\" fue de rabo a cabo una atrocidad fascista del traidor Park Chung Hee, gangster militar proyanqui y projapones tendente a quitar el \"poder\" y mantener la dominacion dictatorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A pesar de esto, la candidata del \"Partido Saenuri\" Park Geun-Hye se atrevio a acusar a la RPDC justificando el \"golpe de Estado del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion\", lo cual es la grave provocacion intolerable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La entrevista demuestra que no se ha cambiado nada su posicion en cuanto al \"golpe de Estado del 16 de mayo\" y la \"renovacion\" y su \"concepcion del Norte\" tambien es igual a la del ex dictador de \"renovacion\" y del traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si toma el poder la candidata del \"Partido Saenuri\" que hace esfuerzos desesperados por justificar la dictadura de \"renovacion\" sin hacer caso de la opinion publica interna y externa, no cabe duda que seran tragicos el destino de la sociedad surcoreana y las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto llevara solo el renacimiento de la dictadura de \"renovacion\" en el Sur de Corea, la agravacion de confrontacion de ambas partes coreanas y el aumento del peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Todas las clases y capas del Sur de Corea no deben enganarse por la trampa astuta de la banda del \"Partido Saenuri\", sino rechazar categoricamente la rehabilitacion de la \"segunda dictadura de renovacion\"."
