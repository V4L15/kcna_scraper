Earlier, the south Korean authorities said there can never be any negotiations for reopening the tour of Mt. Kumgang resort unless the north cancels the postponement of the reunions of separated families and their relatives, and that south Korea would not make a proposal first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a shameless act aimed to cover up their confrontation stand of pushing the north-south relations to a catastrophe again and shift onto the DPRK side the responsibility for the present situation by resorting to the \"theory of principle\", Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A big hurdle now lies ahead of the way of improving the relations between the north and the south that was paved with much effort. This is attributable to the south Korean ruling quarters running amuck to realize their daydream of confrontation of social systems with no heed paid to defusing tension and reunifying the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean conservative regime found fault with the north and talked the rubbish about \"attempt to hold initiative\", far from acknowledging their responsibility and making an apology for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Problem is their wicked and megalomaniacal way of thinking by which they approach the north-south relations from a wrong viewpoint of confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is seriously mistaken if it calculates it can get something by continuously heaping calumnies on the north.

The U.S. imperialists even used napalm bombs and germ weapons to brutally kill peaceable civilians. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is misleading the public opinion in such a manner that the Korean War had been fought between the north and the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the U.S. egged the puppet regime of Syngman Rhee on to prepare military provocations against the northern half of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even now some people say that the DPRK was the first to \"attack\" south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, none of them explains the fact that a lot of leaflets calling for surrender and becoming \"voluntary prisoners\" were printed by a department of the U.S. for a psychological warfare, timed to coincide with the start of the war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The false story is still rife. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling quarters are still serving the U.S. as its stooges and yes men. In other words, they serve the U.S. imperialists who burnt away everything with napalm bombs, suffocated people with toxic gas and reduced houses and public buildings to ashes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists continue to commit crimes, threatening the DPRK economically and militarily. It is because the DPRK is winning victory after victory with the might of the Juche idea and Songun politics. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has a strong foundation of self-supporting national economy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with dividing the homogeneous Korean nation, the U.S. imperialists are hindering its growth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people always remember who brought misfortunes to the land of morning calm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They firmly believe that the day is sure to come when the U.S. imperialists are forced to withdraw from south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korea is sure to be reunified."
