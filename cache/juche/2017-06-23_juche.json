            "content": "DPRK FM Spokesman Accuses U.S. of Slandering Humanitarian Measure\r\n Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry Friday released the following statement over the fact the U.S. administration authorities are heating up the anti-DPRK smear campaign by abusing the humanitarian measure taken by the DPRK as an inhuman act, concerning the death of Warmbier, an American citizen:\n\t\t\t\t\t Warmbier is clearly a criminal sentenced to reform through labor in accordance with the DPRK law on March 16, 2016 for the hostile act he committed against the DPRK on an assignment from an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was made public to the world, during the press conference on February 29, 2016, Warmbier confessed in tears that he had committed hostile act against the DPRK, with connivance of the U.S. administration, after he received an assignment from the Z-Society of the Virginia University of the U.S. controlled by the Friendship United Methodist Church, an anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization of the U.S., and the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t CNN and other U.S. media outlets are still broadcasting the video of Warmbier admitting his crime and apologizing for it at the press conference in Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK-U.S. relations are in the most hostile and belligerent state, and the U.S. is making every frantic effort to disparage the prestige of the dignified DPRK and stifle it while imposing heinous sanctions and pressure unprecedented in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although we had no reason at all to show mercy to such a criminal of the enemy state, we provided him with medical treatments and care with all sincerity on humanitarian basis until his return to the U.S., considering that his health got worse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the groundless public opinion now circulating in the U.S. that he died of torture and beating during his reform through labor, the American doctors who came to the DPRK for repatriation of Warmbier will have something to say about it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They examined Warmbier and exchanged medical observations about him with our doctors. They recognized that his health indicators like pulse, temperature, respiration and the examination result of the heart and lung were all normal and that we provided him with medical treatment and brought him back alive whose heart was nearly stopped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the former officials of the Obama administration publicize as their \"achievement\" the release of 10 American citizens granted by the humanitarian measures we had taken. They cannot but acknowledge the fact that we treat the detainees in accordance with international laws and standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact that Warmbier died suddenly in less than a week just after his return to the U.S. in his normal state of health indicators is a mystery to us as well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It reminds us of an incident that Hunziker, an American citizen who had illegally crossed the border and entered the DPRK on August 24, 1996, died in less than a month after he returned home in perfect health accompanied by Bill Richardson, the then U.S. Congressman, on November 27 the same year thanks to our humanitarian measure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time, the U.S had totally ignored and not even mentioned a word about his death. The point here is he was also an American citizen, was he not?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Warmbier is a victim of policy of \"strategic patience\" of Obama who was engrossed in utmost hostility and negation against the DPRK and refused to have dialogue with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Why the U.S. government which claims to care about the welfare of its citizens had not even once made an official request for the release of Warmbier on humanitarian basis during the Obama administration? The answer should be given by the U.S. itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although Warmbier was a criminal who committed hostile act against the DPRK, we accepted the repeated requests of the present U.S. administration and, in consideration of his bad health, sent him back home on humanitarian grounds according to the adjudication made on June 13, 2017 by the Central Court of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. totally distorted this truth and dared to clamor about \"retaliation\" and \"pressure\" on the dignified DPRK while deliberately kicking up the smearing campaign against the DPRK. This is a frontal challenge and political plot against us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To make it clear, we are the biggest victim of this incident and there would be no more foolish judgment than to think we do not know how to calculate gains and losses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The smear campaign against DPRK staged in the U.S. compels us to make firm determination that humanitarianism and benevolence for the enemy are a taboo and we should further sharpen the blade of law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should ponder over the consequences to be entailed from its reckless and rash act."

Korean Authorities Have to Stop Speaking Ill of DPRK and Send Back Its Citizens\r\n Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the Consultative Council for National Reconciliation gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Friday as regards an anti-DPRK farce over the \"repatriation of detainees\" being waged in south Korea over the issue of Warmbier who had recently been sent back to the U.S.:\n\t\t\t\t\t Now being undertaken in south Korea is a frantic confrontation racket against the DPRK as Warmbier died in the middle of treatment in the U.S. The American man had served a prison term after being sentenced to it for committing hostile acts against the DPRK and was sent back to the U.S. as a humanitarian measure taken by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative opposition parties including the Liberal Korea Party and conservative media are talking about \"heinous cruelty\", \"subhuman torture\" and \"strong denunciation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 22, some ruling and opposition lawmakers held a press conference at the \"National Assembly\" where they submitted a \"resolution\" demanding a \"probe into truth by the international community\" and \"denouncing the violation of human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the chief executive of south Korea went busy, sending a \"message of sympathy\" to the U.S. He, in an interview with CBS, talked about \"unwarranted and brutal treatment\" and \"crucial responsibility\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those, who are utterly ignorant of how we treated Warmbier from a humanitarian standpoint, are spouting such rubbish as \"brutal acts\" and \"tortures\". It is needless to say that those acts are prompted by the intrinsic nature of pro-U.S. servants keen on tarnishing the image of the DPRK and currying favor with their master U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is all the more ridiculous is that the south Korean authorities are clamoring for the \"repatriation of detainees\" with the recent issue as a pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of folly and impudence for the puppet forces to use the Warmbier issue for calling for \"repatriation\" of criminals who were arrested and sentenced to heavy penalty for committing hideous crimes against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To talk about \"repatriation\" of criminals who are in the middle of prison terms is an intolerable mockery and challenge to the law of the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet forces, so much clamoring for \"concern\" and \"repatriation\", are truly concerned for \"humanitarianism\", they have to immediately send back 12 DPRK women citizens whom they abducted in group in broad daylight and Kim Ryon Hui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of northerners now under detention in the south are anxiously looking forward to their repatriation to the homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was emphasized by the DPRK more than once, there can never be any humanitarian cooperation between the north and the south before the settlement of the repatriation issue of the DPRK citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clearly know that they can never cover up their unethical nature no matter how loudly they speak about \"detention\" and \"repatriation\" just like a thief getting afraid of his shadow. And they should immediately send back all the DPRK citizens on whom they are practicing persecution after detaining them against reason."

El Comite de la UE y Francia exigieron a EE.UU. consultar y tratar el asunto de sancion anti-Rusia con los paises aliados de Europa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que fuera rechazada por la sociedad internacional la sancion de EE.UU que perjudica los intereses de otros paises y regiones segun sus intereses y pauta sin tomar en consideracion el derecho internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuestionando el ejercicio del derecho a la autodefensa de la RPDC frente a la extremada politica hostil y la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU., este recrudece la injusta e ilegal campana de sancion y presion contra aquella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta maniobra brutal y salvaje tiene el objetivo de suprimir el derecho al desarrollo de la RPDC y hasta el de existencia de su pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. quiere extender ahora su garrote de sancion hasta a los aliados europeos aunque lo esgrimia antes solo contra los paises desobedientes y aspirantes a la vida independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de hoy testimonia que si se toleran el despotismo y las arbitrariedades de EE.UU., ningun pais se liberara de las garras de sancion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad internacional no debe admitir nunca la campana de sancion de EE.UU que trata de hacer al mundo retroceder a la edad medieval."
