Korean Security Authorities' Fascist Plot under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 3 (KCNA) -- The \"Prosecution\" and \"Intelligence Service\" of south Korea are busy investigating five former and incumbent leading members of the Democratic Workers' Party after arresting them on charges of violating the \"National Security Law\" (NSL). They took such action, asserting that they got in touch with an \"operative from the north\" and they were \"suspected of visiting the north without permission.\"\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Friday says:\r\n Such anachronistic action of the south Korean security authorities is, in a nutshell, one more anti-DPRK racket kicked up at the instigation of the U.S. and pro-U.S. conservatives in south Korea and a fascist plot reminding one of the past era of dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fascist racket kicked up by the U.S. and pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea on the basis of sheer lies goes to prove that they are going reckless in their moves to block the advance of the June 15 era of reunification, the news analyst notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of them to try to fan up hostility toward the DPRK among south Koreans by employing such stereotyped method as cooking up a \"spy ring case\" in the June 15 era of reunification. This rowdyism only lays bare their despicable colors and precipitates their self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The banner of independence against outside forces which has always been held aloft has served as a banner in the life and struggle of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is more than sixty years since the U.S. occupied south Korea taking the place of the Japanese imperialists. It has since imposed only misfortune and sufferings resulting from national division upon the Korean nation, encroaching upon the national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality clearly prove that the U.S. and Japanese imperialists are the sworn enemies of the whole Korean nation as they have done harm to the Koreans and sought to enslave them generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The soul of the participants in the Kwangju uprising calls for a dynamic struggle against outside forces and for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youths and students and people in south Korea and all other fellow countrymen in the north and overseas should inherit the strong spirit of independence and the indomitable self-sacrificing spirit with which Kwangju students rose in the uprising 77 years ago against the outside forces' domination and national humiliation and wage a just and bold patriotic struggle to establish sovereignty of the nation.\r\n Minju Joson says that the Korean people will never forget the hideous crimes the Japanese imperialists committed by bringing unspeakable misfortune and sufferings to the Korean nation in the past but surely force Japan to pay for them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
