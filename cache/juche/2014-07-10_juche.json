This helped accurately define the order of combat actions and firepower missions of the strike units of the Strategic Force in the western sector of the front in case of emergency and round off the firing methods according to different enemy targets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the drill was successfully staged in combination with rapid movement as required by a modern warfare. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave important instructions for rounding off the combat preparations of the Strategic Force and applying the Juche-oriented rocket combat methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \"We should be prepared for both words and actions. However fair-minded and just we are, we may become a bargaining chip for the strong and our precious history inherited with blood will loose its shine in a moment if we are weak\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great expectation and conviction that the units of the Strategic Force would as ever further step up the combat readiness of rockets and always keep themselves ready to promptly fire them by undergoing drills under the simulated conditions of an actual battle and thus cope with the reckless confrontation hysteria of the enemies to stifle the DPRK by force at any cost with powerful military deterrent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Pak Jong Chon, Yun Tong Hyon and Hong Yong Chil."

In particular, the UNSC resolutions Nos. 1718 and 1874 are a product of high-handedness, a culmination of illegality cooked up by them in disregard of the universal international laws. That is why the DPRK has never recognized the legitimacy of those resolutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been nearly 40 years since the UN resolution on the withdrawal of all foreign troops from south Korea was adopted at the 30th session of the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time, 43 member states of the UN presented a joint resolution on the issue of Korea to the General Assembly, which calls for dissolving the \"UN Command\" in south Korea, withdrawing all foreign troops from south Korea, replacing the Armistice Agreement with a peace agreement and taking practical measures to ease tension between the north and the south of Korea and ensure stable peace. And if the resolution was fully implemented, the situation would not have aggravated in the region with the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula already settled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fact alone goes to prove that the U.S. is the enemy of global peace, who has made a mockery of the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers are not qualified for talking about UN resolutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now what remains to be done by the U.S. and its followers is to just keep watching the measures to be taken by the DPRK to bolster its capability for self-defence."
