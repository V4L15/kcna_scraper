Korean Puppet Defence Minister's Reckless Remarks Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the puppet minister of Defence of south Korea at a session of the \"National Assembly\" openly let loose malignant and reckless remarks labeling the DPRK \"biggest principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland released information bulletin No. 940 on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It said: The above-said outbursts let loose by the puppet defence minister in the wake of the call made by the puppet chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of south Korea for \"a preemptive attack\" on the nuclear base of the DPRK at a confirmation hearing at the \"National Assembly\" in March are an unpardonable provocation to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The puppet defence minister's recent balderdash cannot be construed otherwise than an undisguised treachery of going against the desire of the nation for reconciliation, unity and reunification and the trend of the times as it revealed once again the true colors of the Lee Myung Bak group which has persistently negated the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, the bulletin noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History records not a few traitors who committed shameful acts of treachery, but it does not know such confrontation-minded maniacs who have run wild, regarding compatriots as \"principal enemy,\" as the group of sycophants and traitors in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory of \"principal enemy\" means the theory of confrontation and theory of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group's reckless remarks about the \"principal enemy\" go to prove that their talk about \"resumption of dialogue between authorities\" and \"sincere consultation\" is nothing but sophism intended to cover up their treacherous colors and they are an open declaration of a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their utterances will only precipitate their disgraceful destruction as they are nothing but a foolish ploy to tide over their serious crisis through the moves for confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will never tolerate the above-mentioned reckless remarks made by the Lee Myung Bak group but more strongly react to them. The group of traitors will be held fully accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by their behavior.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The south Korean people have not yet been freed from the yoke of colonial slavery, subject to the U.S. domination and interference, while many countries and nations in the world achieved independence, freed from the foreign forces' domination. This is unbearable humiliation for the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deplorable situation created by the opening of south Korean market to American beef is a product of the U.S. arrogant and high-handed acts to force unconditional servility and submission upon the south Koreans and, at the same time, a natural outcome of the Lee group's treacherous policy. This time the U.S. forced south Korea to open its markets to American beef by using its colonial stooges who have neither elementary national conscience nor an iota of self-esteem. It is as clear as noonday that it will bring bigger misfortune and sufferings to them in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no desperate fascist suppression to turn back history can the Lee group put down the struggle of the south Korean people to terminate the foreign domination and interference, achieve independent and democratic politics and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Justice stands for the south Korean people struggling for independence and their just cause is sure to triumph.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the real intention of the imperialists to subjugate developing countries economically and intensify exploitation and plunder of them. For developing countries to count on the \"aid\" from the imperialists would lead them to a national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries should wage a creative drive to meet their new higher need and goal for development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever make positive efforts to boost cooperation and exchange with other developing countries on the principle of collective self-reliance.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Sigue cumpliendo en este ano tambien el cargo del presidente de la Direccion Surena de la APJERP, entidad pro-enemiga\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl grupo de abogados de Yun resistio a la proposicion de la fiscalia insistiendo en que \"El Norte no es la entidad anti-Estatal, y en particular, la APJERP es la entidad legal del movimiento por la reunificacion compuesta de jovenes y estudiantes del Sur y el Norte de Corea y en Ultramar\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn el tribunal Yun dijo que no puede perdonar la locura de las autoridades de seguridad publica que tildan al puro movimiento por la reunificacion del \"cumplimiento del objetivo especial\" y \"cumplimiento de orden\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDenuncio la conducta de las autoridades de la seguridad publica que cuestionan el envio de delegado de la \"Federacion de Consejos Generales de Estudiantes Universitarios del Sur de Corea (FCGEUS)\" al gran festival por la reunificacion de la APJERP efectuado en 1999 en el Norte de Corea diciendo que este se corresponde al \"crimen de infiltracion y fuga\" de la \"Ley de Seguridad\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRefuto que las actividades en el Norte de representante de la FCGEUS eran las justas y legales como innumerables actividades por la reunificacion que los obreros, campesinos, estudiantes, mujeres, hombres de cultura y artistas, politicos y religiosos y los demas habitantes de distintos sectores desarrollaban durante 8 anos posteriores a la publicacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSenalo que de veras, la \"Ley de Seguridad\" es maligna ley anti-reunificacion que contraviene a la epoca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTerminado el juicio publico, el Comite de Medidas para la Liberacion de Yun Ki Jin, presidente de la Direccion Surena de la APJERP sostuvo una rueda de prensa para condenar la conducta de la fiscalia titere calificandola de un acto anti-reunificacion que contraviene a la epoca de la reunificacion.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
