It is what Japan should do \r\nin any case. Japan must apologize to the Korean people for \r\nits past crimes and make as much material compensation as \r\nis acceptable to people.\r\n   Rodong sinmun stresses this in a commentary today.\r\n   The analyst says:\r\n   compensation is part of Japan's postwar settlement and \r\ndoes not mean complete atonement for Japanese imperialism's \r\ncrimes. If Japan is to fully atone for its past crimes, it \r\nmust make an official apology and material compensation and \r\npledge not to repeat such crimes.\r\n   Japan's atonement for its past crimes is an unavoidable \r\npolitical and legal responsibility and moral obligation.\r\n   The Japanese authorities are mistaken if they think Japan \r\nis an exception in international law and usage and that \r\nJapan can do without liquidating the past.\r\n   Japan still refuses to atone for the past and pursues a \r\nhostile policy toward the DPRK. So, the anti-Japanese \r\nsentiment of the Korean people grows stronger. The Korean \r\npeople do not want normal ties with Japan devoid of postwar \r\nsettlement.\r\n   For Japan to liquidate the disgraceful past and establish \r\ngood-neighbourhood and friendly ties with the DPRK is an \r\nimportant issue for peace and stability in Asia.\r\n   The 20th century is in the dusk and the 21st century is \r\nto break. It is high time the Japanese government \r\nauthorities pondered it over and adopted a sincere approach \r\ntoward postwar settlement. \r\n\r\n"
