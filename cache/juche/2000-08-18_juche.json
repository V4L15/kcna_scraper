It is against common sense that the South Korean police arrested patriotic students at this time, still defining the north as an \"anti-state organization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is required today is to do things helpful to developing dialogue, contact and exchange, improving the inter-Korean relations and settling the reunification issue as stipulated in the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean police, however, are cracking down on the students on the strength of the \"Security Law\", going against the trend towards the improved inter-Korean relations and the aspiration of the people. This is an act of deliberately inciting confrontation with the north and putting a brake on the implementation of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The anachronistic act of the South Korean police makes us doubt whether the South Korean authorities are willing to implement the declaration or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities have a true will to implement the declaration, regarding it as a milestone in improving the inter-Korean relations and reunifying the country, they should abolish the \"Security Law,\" the anti-reunification evil law, first of all, release the arrested students and take strict measures to prevent any renewed acts contrary to the spirit of the north-south joint declaration. \r\n\r\n"

Afterwards the law on overseas dispatch of forces was adopted and took effect, and a \"bill on revising the law of the SDF\" was passed to dispatch \"SDF's\" planes overseas under the pretext of \"rescuing Japanese in foreign countries in contingencies\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"law on emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\" which was adopted and took effect last year invested the \"SDF\" with the right to participate in war and right of belligerency. What remains to be done by the \"SDF\" is only to increase the capacity of military operations for reinvasion. That is why the three services of the \"SDF\" are planning to stage the \"combined exercise for preventing disasters\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shows that the Japanese militarist scenario to reinvade Korea has been more concretized and has entered a stage of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Prevention of disasters\" is nothing but a subterfuge to mislead public opinion under the signboard of \"humanitarianism\" and justify the \"SDF's\" moves to reinvade Korea. \r\n\r\n"
