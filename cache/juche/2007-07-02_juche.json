The U.S. cooked up this mechanism by abusing the name of the United Nations to veil its true colors as an aggressor and massively ship into the Korean front its armed forces together with troops of its satellite countries. After its defeat in the war, the U.S. transferred the command from Tokyo of Japan to south Korea on July 1, 1957, while being hell-bent on the moves to ignite another war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling the facts, the statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the transfer of the command into south Korea, the U.S. has kept its forces' presence in south Korea under the signboard of the \"UN forces\", more desperately engaging itself on the moves for domination, interference and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though a resolution calling for its disbandment was adopted at the 30th Session of the UN General Assembly in 1975, the U.S. has kept it up until now. It is nowadays working hard to reorganize the command into a \"multi-national coalition body\" while talking about the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\" in a bid to calm down the daily growing public demand for the withdrawal of its forces and expand its moves for a war of aggression worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an open challenge to the entire Korean nation and public opinion at home and abroad aspiring after the peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never be allowed to continue its moves for permanent occupation of south Korea and against the DPRK under the helmet of the \"UN forces\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN forces\" in south Korea are aggression forces commanded by the U.S. from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Forces Command\", a leftover of the last Korean War, should be dissolved at once and the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately disband the \"UN Forces Command\" and withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea as unanimously demanded by all the Koreans and the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should resolutely reject the U.S. military occupation and moves for war of aggression on the DPRK and more bravely turn out in the struggle to get the U.S. imperialist aggression forces withdrawn from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Stop to Abe Regime's Anti-DPRK, Anti-Chongryon Campaign Demanded\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tokyo, June 28 (KNS-KCNA) -- The Central Standing Committee of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) released a statement Thursday condemning the Resolution and Collection Corporation of Japan for taking a repressive measure against Chongryon at the instruction of the Abe regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the corporation issued an application for the forced sale of the Hall of the Central Headquarters of Chongryon, the statement declared that the action was aimed at usurping the hall quite contrary to its original mission of bond collection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Since the appearance of the Abe regime Japan's hostile policy towards the DPRK and Chongryon has become evermore pronounced. It is against this backdrop that such business issue as collection of bonds has become a political issue and the above-said corporation took a repressive action in total disregard of law, common sense and practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the reason behind this action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon has played the role of a DPRK diplomatic mission abroad under the present situation where there are no diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Abe regime has been engrossed in a noisy anti-Chongryon campaign, deliberately misrepresenting its legitimate activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the Abe regime against the DPRK and Chongryon are nothing but extremely anachronistic and foolish acts quite contrary to the world trend. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We demand the Abe regime lift at once the sanctions including the embargo on the ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" that have done great harm to the living of the Koreans in Japan and guarantee the Koreans in Japan their right to existence and other rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, at the same time, strongly demand that the Resolution and Collection Corporation respond to the sincere negotiations for reconciliation with Chongryon and retract at once its application for unreasonable forced sale of the Hall of the Central Headquarters of Chongryon, proceeding from its fair stand free from any discrimination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our hope that the Tokyo District Court will dismiss at once the application for forced sale made by the above-said corporation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unreasonable action taken by the Abe regime and the corporation will leave an indelible blot on the history of the relations between the DPRK and Japan as it is a serious breach of the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blasts Anti-Chongryon Campaign in Japan\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK Sunday issued a statement denouncing the Abe group's evermore undisguised suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese days the Abe group's anti-Chongryon campaign has reached such a reckless and hideous phase that it can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe inherited ultra-nationalism and national chauvinism from his ancestors who had been steeped in the antipathy towards Koreans to the marrow of their bones. He has escalated the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon racket since he assumed the premiership by inciting bitterness towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group has taken harsh actions against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan such as forcible search of its facilities and their houses, assaults and arrests of them last year and this year. Not content with this, it is working hard to force upon Chongryon the sale of the plottage and building of the Hall of its headquarters through the Resolution and Collection Corporation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe group instructed the corporation to raise an extremely discriminative and unfair demand to Chongryon, persistently turning down its sincere and reasonable proposals to redeem debts. It has thus unilaterally hamstrung Chongryon's efforts for the solution of the problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a wanton infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK which no previous regime of Japan dared as it is a move to physically remove the centre of activities of Chongryon, a champion of democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan, and stamp out the activities of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon is a legitimate overseas compatriots organization of the DPRK whose mission is to protect the democratic national rights of the direct victims of the criminal drafting of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists in the past and the Koreans in Japan, their descendants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese authorities are under an unavoidable legal and moral obligation to protect Chongryon and guarantee its activities in the light of the historical background against which Chongryon came into being and the crimes committed by the Abes against the Korean nation for several generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Abe group is keen to usurp even the building and plottage of Chongryon, not content with its crackdown on it. This is a blatant violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK little short of financial sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how noisily the Japanese authorities trumpet that their action to usurp buildings of Chongryon is a \"business matter related to the collection of bonds,\" the terror-ridden campaign sweeping Japan is a product of Abe's premeditated plot and his direct instruction to realize his political ambition to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe is now feeling uneasy about the steady decline of the support rate for him with the election to the House of Councillors slated to take place late in July. Finding his far-fetched assertion about the \"issue of abduction\" no longer workable, he has gone insane in his move to usurp the building of Chongryon in a bid to put the DPRK-Japan relations to the lowest ebb and lay a hurdle in the way of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by Japan in chilling the efforts to bring about progress at the six-party talks designed to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula is to drag on the settlement of the problem in a bid to use it as a pretext till its militarization has become a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite ridiculous for the Abe group to harshly suppress Chongryon which has done nothing wrong as soon as its delegates went back to Japan from the talks where they kept mum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As Japan is behaving so dastardly with a black-hearted intention, the DPRK cannot but raise a serious question as to whether there is any need for its continued participation in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never remain a passive on-looker to the Abe group's harsh suppression of Chongryon and its relevant field will take necessary steps against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
