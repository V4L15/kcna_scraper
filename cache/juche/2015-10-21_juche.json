            "content": "Kim Jong Un Goes Round Completed Mirae Scientists Street\r\n Pyongyang, October 21 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, went round Mirae Scientists Street, which was successfully completed as a model of Juche-oriented architecture and fairy street in the era of the Workers' Party. \n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the street, he said the longer one watches it, the more magnificent and spectacular it looks. He noted with pleasure that it proves visually the idea of the Workers' Party of Korea of attaching importance to science and talents, it is a fashionable street of perfect combination of the Juche character, national identity, originality and formative art and unique one of our style which appeared in the capital city of Pyongyang as an icon of cultural efflorescence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said it is something unimaginable to build a street with flats for thousands of families and more than 150 public catering outlets in a matter of just one year by the existing method of construction. He noted with excitement that the completion of Mirae Scientists Street convinces everybody that the appearance of the country would undergo beyond recognition a decade later as everything is done in just one year instead of ten years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different places of the street, he learned in detail about the construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is fantastic, indeed, to watch the tower symbolic of the 53-storied skyscraper which has been built like an electronic track so that one may know it is Mirae Scientists Street even from distance, adding that formative art was applied to all the buildings at a very high level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pleased that the flats have been constructed at the best quality and teachers and researchers would need to bring with them only hand luggage as their drawing rooms, parents' rooms, rooms for couples, children's rooms, kitchens, etc. are fitted with high-quality furniture and fixtures, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hearing officials say foreigners will hardly believe that ordinary educators and scientists of the country will live free of charge in such deluxe apartment houses in the street on the picturesque bank of the Taedong River, he said that it is the advantages of the socialist system in the DPRK which capitalist countries can neither imitate nor build. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the builders for having built all kinds of public catering and cultural and welfare establishments on the ground floors of the buildings in an impeccable manner to meet requirements of settlers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted with appreciation that resting places and sporting parks have been built in a peculiar style so that residents might have good rest and do sports and greening in the residential area and the project for reinforcing banks of the river were done very well. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast will of our party to consolidate the foundation of socialism by dint of science and advance socialism with the power of the engine of science, he said, stressing the need to steadily increase substantial investment in the scientific researches on the basis of the successes and experience gained in the work for consolidating the material and technical foundations of different scientific research bases and improving the living standard of the scientists and researchers in recent years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the buildings of the street spruced up at a speed unprecedented in the history of construction are laudable structures of Songun Korea built by our service personnel and people with the will to create everything dear in their own style by their own efforts at a lightning speed, optimistic about the future, and they are valuable crystal of their patriotism, he said, extending thanks to the units of the Korean People's Army and other units which participated in the construction, builders and helpers in the name of the Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and belief that all the builders would give fullest play to the inexhaustible mental power displayed in the construction of Mirae Scientists Street and make a positive contribution to turning Pyongyang City into a hub of Songun culture and the most magnificent and fashionable city of the world fame in all aspects and building the socialist country into a highly civilized nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction on inaugurating the street.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Kim Ki Nam, Kim Yang Gon, O Su Yong, Jo Yong Won and Ma Won Chun."

Korean Chief Executive of Her Anti-DPRK Remarks during Foreign Tour\r\n Pyongyang, October 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean chief executive's recent junket to the U.S. is under fire by Koreans for her sycophancy towards the U.S. and remarks escalating confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t During her junket, she, together with the U.S. president, adopted a \"joint statement on the north\", and at a joint press conference she talked volumes about \"nuclear weapons and human rights issues in the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint statement called on the U.S. and south Korea to \"modernize their alliance in a sustainable manner and closely cooperate with each other to cope with the north's provocations of all forms.\" At a press conference the U.S. master and the south Korean colonial servant  chimed in with the issue of ratcheting up confrontation with the DPRK, blustering that they would not recognize the DPRK as a nuclear weapons state and that its \"human rights performance\" is deplorable and crying out for slapping \"harsher sanctions against it\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disgusting, indeed, is the behavior of the south Korean chief executive as she is scuttling the important affair of the nation in league with outsiders, chilling the hard-won atmosphere of the north-south reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, she made the junket to the U.S., prompted by her politically narrow-minded sycophancy towards outsiders and confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, the capabilities for self-defence including its nuclear weapons and missiles the DPRK acquired by tightening its belt serve as a treasure common to all Koreans in the north, the south and abroad. It is thanks to these capabilities that the Koreans live on this land free from war and dispute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To urge the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear weapons and missiles is little short of urging it to drop its independent stand and dignity and become slaves of the imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, since she took office, has cried out for pressurizing the DPRK to dismantle its nuclear weapons, a treasured sword for self-defence guaranteeing peace and security of the nation, while keeping mum about the nuclear weapons and missiles of the U.S. that have plunged the Korean Peninsula into the constant danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If there are any provocation and threat to the peninsula, they are only provocation and threat of aggression on the north by the U.S. and the south Korean regime, its ally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean warmongers are massively reinforcing armed forces and staging joint military drills, openly crying out for making a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK after mapping out an operation plan in which \"strike at its headquarters\" was made an established fact. All these moves are bringing the danger of war to the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive during her junket eagerly asked the U.S., the architect of Korea's division and chieftain of war, to handle the nuclear issue of the DPRK with utmost urgency and the strongest will, raising a hue and cry over \"threat\" and \"provocation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her behavior reminds one of a mere child knowing nothing of the world, to say nothing of the issue of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cheers of hurrah that resounded at the military parade and public procession of Pyongyang citizens for marking the 70th founding anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea represented the single-minded unity of the service personnel and people of the DPRK which is stronger than nuclear weapons and a true picture of the invincible DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is unable to escape an ill-fame as a traitor to the nation as she was politically short-sighted when she hurt compatriots, clinging to the coattails of outsiders quite contrary to the trend of the era of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime had better bear in mind the lesson drawn from the miserable ends met by those keen on confrontation."
