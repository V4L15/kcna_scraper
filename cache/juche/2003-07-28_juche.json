But they are not afraid of and will not avoid it. It is utter folly for the U.S. to think that its troops will go scot-free when they are relocated in areas south of seoul. The U.S. should not think that its forces present in South Korea will survive another Korean war to be ignited by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the U.S. had unilateral wars of aggression, in which it would beat the \"enemy\" by applying \"surgical operation-style strike\" in long distance, without being counterattacked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, such way of war can never work on the Korean army and people who have strong war deterrent force under the great Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n"

Present on invitation were diplomatic envoys of different countries to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Chun, chief of the general staff of the Korean People's Army, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that the Fatherland Liberlation War waged by the Korean people was a worldwide revolutionary war against the armed invasion of the allied imperialist forces led by the U.S. and a liberation war of justice to defend the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic victory of our army and people in the war was a brilliant victory of President Kim Il Sung's Juche-based military idea, strategy and tactics and unique war methods, he stated, referring to the enduring feats the president performed in leading the anti-U.S. war to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Fatherland Liberlation War of the Korean people convincingly proved that the army and people intensely loyal to their great leader's guidance could finally win in the confrontation with any formidable imperialist enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people always remember the progressive humankind of the world who rendered full support to them in the fight of justice during the war, and the Chinese people who dispatched volunteers formed with their fine sons and daughters to the Korean front and helped the Korean people at the cost of their blood, and are grateful for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This war teaches the immovable truth that the singlehearted unity of the party, army and people around their great leader is the best treasured sword of victory capable of defeating any formidable enemy armed with sophisticated weapons. It also instills into the Korean people the strong revolutionary faith that with this sword, the DPRK will surely emerge victorious in the present confrontation with the U.S. though it is rigorous and hard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean revolution is making a vigorous advance on a higher stage, recording a new chapter of victory in the history of the struggle against the U.S.-led imperialists with the ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces under the distinguished Songun leadership of supreme commander Kim Jong Il who is creditably carrying forward the President's cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun revolutionary line and the Songun policy are the strategic line and political mode that should always be held fast to as long as imperialism remains on the earth and the enemy resorts to aggressive moves, the reporter said, urging all the party members, KPA officers and men and people to remain true to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need to continue directing enormous efforts to the increase of military capability so as to firmly prepare the people's army politically, ideologically and in military technique and cement the singlehearted unity of the army and the people as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for carrying through the line of economic construction in the Songun era on preferentially developing the defence industry to provide a sure guarantee for the nation's defence capability and maintaining production upswing in all fields of socialist construction and thus glorifying the 55th anniversary of the DPRK with proud achievements in work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the arrogant and outrageous moves of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK by force are being carried into extremes, he declared that the army and the people of the DPRK will promptly beat back any \"precision strike\", \"surgical operation-style strike\" and \"preemptive nuclear attack\" with the powerful war deterrent force which they have built up through all hardships, tightening their belts under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. belligerent group and its followers dare unleash a war in defiance of our warnings, they will not be able to avoid the merciless crushing blow of the army of the DPRK and they will suffer a miserable defeat dwarfing that they met in the past Korean war, he warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He concluded that all the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad will more vigorously wage the anti-war, anti-U.S. struggle through national cooperation under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and thus surely achieve the historic desire of national reunification and build an independent, reunified great prosperous powerful nation in this land without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In military and technical aspects, it was the war largest ever in history in scale except the past two world wars and the first war in the era of a-bombs, a war in which most advanced weaponry was used at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The myth about the U.S. imperialists' \"mightiness\" meant, in essence, the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. military capability, that is its tremendous economic potential and the superiority of its aggression troops in numerical strength and military technique based on such potential, the memorandum says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, that myth was shattered to smithereens in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the three year-long Korean War, the U.S. imperialists hurled over two million troops and all types of modern military equipment and weapons. But, even their \"ever-victorious division\", B-29 called \"superfortress\", seventh fleet with missouri as its flag ship and hundreds of warships of the navy in the far east could not save the U.S. from its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the Second World War the U.S. suffered a loss of 46,000 planes in the wide skies of the world in four years. However, in the Korean War it lost more than 12,000 planes in the small skies over the Korean Peninsula, one thousandths of that size, only in three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists were so foolish as to calculate that if they erased the cities and rural villages of Korea from a \"map\", set fire to mountains and streams, plants and trees and killed at random men and women, old and young through a \"mass killing operation\" involving the use of even germ and chemical weapons, they could frighten the Korean people and demonstrate the U.S. \"mightiness\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they could not bring the Korean people to their knees by any barbarous atrocities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why former U.S. defense secretary marshall deplored that the myth was shattered, saying the U.S. was not so strong as others thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., the \"superpower\" that suffered not a single defeat in the 100 odd year-long history of war of aggression, sustained a disgraceful defeat for the first time before the young people's army in Korea and the myth about the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. imperialists was shattered to smithereens. The memorandum refers to the worldwide significance of the victory in the Fatherland Liberlation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the war helped protect the security of the socialist countries and the world peace and further strengthen the socialist forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory brought about a new surge in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle and the national liberation struggle, precipitated the collapse of the imperialist colonial system as a whole and thus occasioned an epochal turn in the cause of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the military and technological superiority in which the U.S. imperialists had believed as in \"God\" proved absurd and the corruption of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops was brought to light in the Korean War, hundreds of millions of oppressed people, of the world who were taken in by the idea of fearing and worshiping the U.S., were freed from the mental yoke and joined the anti-imperialist front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people came to view the U.S. as a \"clay-moulded giant\" and a \"paper tiger\", not an \"invincible power\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They grasped the truth that a decisive factor of winning a victory in the revolutionary war lies in the united strength of the popular masses convinced of the validity of their cause, not in the advantages of the combat equipment and, accordingly, even a small country can surely defeat any formidable enemy and win a final victory if it fights against him in a do-or-die spirit, singleheartedly rallied around its leader, believing in its strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The example of the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle set by the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberlation War served as a banner of the national liberation struggle in colonies and a factor of opening an epochal turn in the struggle for global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
