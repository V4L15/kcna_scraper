            "content": "U.S. Decision to Finance Anti-DPRK Broadcasting Services Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Reconciliation Council gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Thursday blasting the U.S. decision to finance the anti-DPRK broadcasting services in the hands of the anti-communist conservative organizations in south Korea:\r\n The U.S. State Department was reported to have decided to make a financial allocation in the fiscal 2007 to start on Oct. 1 for three anti-DPRK broadcasting services including one operated by a group of defectors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not conceal its intention to continue such financial assistance in the next fiscal year, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The decision is one more intolerable provocation against the DPRK and a vicious act of inciting confrontation between Koreans in breach of the June 15 joint declaration and the north-south agreement on stopping each other's smear propaganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the U.S. worked out \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" in October of 2004 and decided to finance the anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations from its government budget every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. is now under fire for being the world's biggest human rights abuser, its policy for stifling the DPRK is rejected in different parts of the world and its human rights rackets kicked up by undesirable plot-breeding organizations prove futile, it is now left with no option but to use such criminals as human scum for its smear campaign against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This once again betrays the deplorable position of the U.S. and its brigandish ambition to stifle the DPRK come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates that such mean smear campaign will help bring down Korean-style socialism whereby all the servicepersons and people are single-mindedly united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop such clumsy farce and the south Korean authorities should not permit the operation of such anti-national and anti-reunification broadcasting services in breach of the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should take a resolute measure to stop the broadcasting at once, pondering over the serious impact it will have on the inter-Korean relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Dangerous U.S. Moves to Force \"Preemptive Strike Strategy\" Debunked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- The U.S. war-thirsty forces are these days stooping to a plan to establish what they call Korean Peninsula air battle command which would perform a U.S. air force strike mission under the U.S. Pacific Command when they provoke a Korean war. Synchronizing with this, the U.S. Defense Department announced that the U.S. would sell a \"patriot\" missile system worth 1.5 billion U.S. dollars to south Korea.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Thursday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a highly dangerous scheme on the part of the United States to gain \"upper hand in strength\" and force its \"preemptive strike strategy\" at whatever cost. This testifies that they have made the provocation of the second Korean war a fait accompli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pentagon has already reorganized the U.S. 8th army in south Korea and the 3rd army in the U.S. mainland into a field army and rounded off an integrated operational command system over the large forces of the U.S., Japan and south Korea. The establishment of the new Korean Peninsula air battle command of the U.S. means, in the final analysis, that not only the U.S. air force in the Asia-Pacific region but also its air force in the mainland will take part in the operations of this command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected establishment of the command is intended to boost the preemptive strike capacity of the U.S. air forces in preparation for a war of aggression against the DPRK. Linked with it is the decision to sell a vast \"patriot\" missile system to south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of the afore-said command is, immediately that of an air commanding body for a \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK. This scheme is a patent proof that the Korean war scenario of the U.S. imperialists has entered a practical stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the dangerous military strategy of the U.S. is pushed ahead, it will destroy the military strategic balance and stability in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region and add fuel to the arms race and military confrontation among the countries interested in this area strategically.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was led to the creation of a unique way of revolution to win victories by Songun with belief in the might of the people, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of independence put forward by the union, they added, became the starting point of the struggle for founding in Korea a revolutionary party of Juche type, a party of new type different from the parties of bygone days, and, it has been kept in the whole course of the party building and activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of anti-imperialism, independence and sovereignty, and socialism held aloft by the President in the union is wholly embodied in the Songun policy pursued by Kim Jong Il to display ever-victorious might in the military confrontation with the U.S. imperialists without gun reports and open a new era of the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation of Juche, they said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea, they stressed, has fully inherited the ideology and fighting spirit of the union whose justice and unbreakable might have been fully verified on the prolonged and arduous road of revolution spanning 80 years and its cause of Songun revolution will be all triumphant in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the symposium were officials of the central and Pyongyang city party and administrative organs and working people's organizations, men of science, education, party official training institutions, the press, literature and arts and officials preserving revolutionary historical sites.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 12 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today term the U.S. moves to \"reorganize\" its forces in south Korea a dangerous adventure as it disturbs peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and drives the situation to catastrophe.\r\n What the U.S. seeks through this is to increase the capability of its armed forces to carry out war actions against the DPRK and arm the south Korean army with heavy and advanced weapons by stepping up their \"reorganization\" under the signboard of \"transfer of the right to command wartime operations\" and thus use it as a shock force in a second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun observes this in a commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"reorganization\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea is escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula while increasing the danger of another war, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Despite this grave situation, the south Korean war-like forces are busy with arms buildup and north-targeted war exercises, joining the U.S. in its moves to invade the DPRK. Such actions can never be pardoned as they are acts of treachery going against the June 15 joint declaration and bringing the inter-Korean relations to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are bound to be sternly punished by history and the nation for such wrongdoings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. ignites a war against the DPRK, it will suffer a bitter defeat. The U.S. should make a radical switchover in its anachronistic Korea policy and pull all its aggression forces out of south Korea and its vicinity, urges Minju Joson in a commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
