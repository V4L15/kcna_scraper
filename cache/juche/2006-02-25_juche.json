The people from all walks of life, aware of the gravity of the situation, should wage an unflinching struggle until they completely ostracize the old and corrupt political group of GNP and its remnant forces. \r\n Underscoring the need to achieve great unity against conservatism at an early date under the banner of progress and reform, the declaration called on all the people to ostracize the traitorous party forever through a nationwide anti-GNP struggle and break a new ground of progress and reform and open a new phase of the June 15 era of independent reunification without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
