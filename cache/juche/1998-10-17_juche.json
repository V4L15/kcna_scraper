This shows the persistence and shamelessness of Japan's long-standing hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   It cannot but be a shame in the 20th century that Japan is acting audaciously, not yet making apology and compensations for indelible crimes against the Korean people and for great damage on humankind. \r\n   Our people keep tabs on this rude action as well as the past crime-woven history of Japan. \r\n\r\n"

It also gives a comprehensive exposition of the features and peculiarities of the WPK as a working-class party of new type and tasks and ways of strengthening the party and improving its leadership role.\r\n   The WPK has won victory after victory. It is because it has always adhered to the principle of independence laid down by the DIU and inherited the tradition of unity of the DIU. It is also because the WPK makes itself a harmonious whole with the popular masses as the DIU did.\r\n   It is the fixed will of Kim Jong Il to inherit the tradition of the DIU purely despite alteration of generations.\r\n   He works hard to firmly defend the glorious revolutionary traditions established by the President Kim Il Sung. \r\nThanks to Kim Jong Il's energetic guidance the WPK will remain the party of Kim Il Sung for ages. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also aimed at creating extreme distrust in and antagonism against the DPRK among the Japanese, imbuing them with the anti-Korean spirit, inventing an excuse and a justification for the militarisation of Japan and staging a comeback to Korea which they dreamed of.\r\n   For their refusal to make an apology and compensation for the past crimes the Japanese authorities are not entitled to poke their nose into the \"talks on peace on the Korean peninsula.\" They are now crying for \"six-party talks,\" though. The loud-mouthed \"talks\" are nothing but a trick to stifle the DPRK, in league with the U.S. and South Korea.\r\n   We vehemently denounce the misbehaviour of the Japanese reactionaries, considering it a grave insult to the sovereignty of our republic and the dignity of our people.\r\n   We don't care whether normalisation of diplomatic relations with Japan is realised or not. \r\n   However, it is our unshakable will and right to get an apology and compensation from Japan for its past crimes generation after generation. \r\n\r\n"

In four years till 2004, more than 60,000 ex-soldiers of America, who had participated in the aggressive Korean War, will \"visit\" Seoul.\r\n   The former American soldiers were provokers of the Korean War and aggressors. Accordingly, their visits to South Korea are ones intended to incite another Korean War and a prelude to an aggressive war.\r\n   They are an open challenge to and provocative act against the DPRK.\r\n   We, representing the indignation of the nation, vehemently condemn the United States and the South Korean authorities for planning South Korea visits of former American soldiers, aggressors and war criminals who had reduced our inviolable territory to ashes and killed a large number of innocent Korean people after igniting the war of aggression.\r\n   It is clear what the South Korean authorities seek in the visits.\r\n   They intend to incite the fever of war against the north through the visits of participants in the Korean war and bridge over their ruling crisis with the help of anticommunist right-wing forces of the United States. Worse still, they seek to worsen DPRK-U.S. relations and thus create a favourable atmosphere for provoking a war against the north.\r\n   However, the United States and the South Korean authorities will only be cursed and denounced as aggressors and warmaniacs by people at home and abroad. \r\n\r\n"
