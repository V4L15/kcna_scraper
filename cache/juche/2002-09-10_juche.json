This is nothing but a silly dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bolton is getting overheated in the smear campaign and the moves to stifle the DPRK as the worst type of the U.S. hawkish hardliner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut his demeanor only damages his image as a senior diplomat of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there is any issue in the DPRK that may cause any security concern of the U.S., this is entirely due to its administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, the DPRK has clarified more than once that it is ready to respond to the dialogue aimed to clear the U.S. of its worries over security if its administration is willing to abandon its hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's principled stand on the DPRK-U.S. dialogue remains unchanged. The ball is in the court of the U.S. Bolton is well advised to behave himself, if he is interested in the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.    \r\n\r\n"
