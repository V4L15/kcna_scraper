            "content": "Withdrawal of \"northern limit line\" called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang,July 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army in a statement issued on July 8 denouncing the United States and the South Korean  hawkish forces for bringing forward the so-called \"northern limit line\" in a bid to conceal the crimes they committed by causing the exchange of fire between the patrol boats of the navy of the KPA and South Korean naval vessels in the West Sea of Korea on June 29 and blaming the north for the incident.\r\n Laying bare the true nature of the line, he stated: Firstly, the \"northern limit line\" is a brigandish line unilaterally drawn by the U.S. and the South Korean military in the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK side without any discussion with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"northern limit line\" is a line unilaterally drawn by the commander of the U.S. forces present in South Korea in the 1950s as he pleased without any agreement with the DPRK, and the U.S. has not informed it of this till now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, the \"northern limit line\" is an illegal line that ignores even the elementary provisions of the Korean Military Armistice Agreement and the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Subparagraph B of paragraph 13 of the AA stipulates that all the islands lying to the north and west of the provincial boundary line between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do shall be under the military control of the KPA side, and the un forces side shall control only five islands in the territorial waters under the military control of the KPA side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even in view of the international law, it is a common practice recognized by all countries to fix boundary lines on the principle of equidistance from the projecting parts of lands of both sides, their outer boundaries and their islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. government also drew on a map the \"imaginary line of territorial waters\" of the DRKK south of the \"northern limit line\" asserted by the South Korean side now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, the U.S. and the South Korean bellicose elements have been opposed to the proposal of the KPA side for scores of years to discuss and clearly fix the military demarcation line in the west sea because they have been well aware that the \"northern limit line\" is contrary to the law and does not stand to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the 346th meeting of the military armistice commission in December 1973, at the 449th meeting in July 1989 and at general-level military talks in Panmunjom in August and September 1999 the KPA side noted that future clashes were unavoidable unless a clear Military Demarcation Line was drawn in the West Sea, repeatedly urging the U.S. side to take an immediate measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of the recent incident in the West Sea the KPA side clarified that the issue can be solved only when the Military Demarcation Line in the sea is discussed and fixed. But the U.S. and the South Korean sides paid no heed to it, only keen on the smear campaign against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the South Korean hawkish forces claimed that patrol boats of the KPA navy crossed the \"northern limit line\" and opened fire first. This only goes to prove that they perpetrated a premeditated provocation by illegally infiltrating their warships into the territorial waters of our side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and South Korean warmongers are well advised to immediately stop the smear campaign against the DPRK and refrain from infiltrating armed vessels into our territorial waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side is not opposed at all to the south side's request to salvage the recently sunken warship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the south side should inform the KPA side of the date and time of salvaging operation, ships and equipment to be involved, their operating waters and other details in advance to prevent unexpected new clashes during the operation as it has to be undertaken in the waters under the military control of the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. and the South Korean authorities sincerely wish peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and seek ways for improved relations, they should not dance to the tune of hawkish forces but behave with discretion, facing up to the reality.    \r\n\r\n"

It is nothing but a bogus line unilaterally drawn by the u.s. as it pleased in the territorial waters of the DPRK side without any discussion with it since the conclusion of the agreement. It is well known to the world that the DPRK has never recognized it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The infiltration of several warships and many fishing boats deep into the territorial waters of the north side under the pretext of this illegal bogus line itself is a grave act of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is obvious is that the U.S., holding the prerogative of the Supreme Command over the South Korean Army, might know about the intrusion of the South Korean warships into the territorial waters of the north side and their provocation. The U.S., therefore, can never flee from its responsibility for this incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is much upset by the situation where the anti-U.S. sentiment is growing stronger than ever before among the South Korean people and they are becoming increasing assertive for the withdrawal of the U.S. Forces from South Korea. This required the U.S. to orchestrate a shocking case. It is beyond doubt that the U.S. warmongers carefully dreamed up the incident in a bid to put the brake on the process of improving the north-south relations and impair the international prestige of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's exercise of sovereign right and the fixed will of the people's army and people of Korea to take a strong self-defensive counter-measure by all means against anyone infringing upon its sovereignty. The DPRK will strongly retaliate against any infringement upon its sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's hostile attitude toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- According to Mainichi Shimbun, the foreign affairs research council of the Liberal-Democratic Party and the director of the defence bureau of the Defence Agency of Japan described the recent armed clash in the West Sea of Korea as an \"organized and premeditated action of North Korea\" in a bid to shift the blame for it on to the DPRK. And they went the length of slandering its political system.\r\n Such behaviour can never be tolerated as it is a continuation of the persistent anti-DPRK hostile moves taken by the Japanese reactionaries to tarnish the image of the peaceloving DPRK and isolate and stifle it when ever an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, they have no ground to talk anything about the recent incident, and it is impertinent for them to poke their nose into the case without knowing its origin and circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified by the DPRK, the incident occurred when the South Korean Army under the U.S. manipulation intruded into the territorial waters of the north side and fired first at patrol boats of the navy of the Korean People's Army on routine coastal guard duty. It was an entirely deliberate and premeditated military provocation made by the South Korean military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and the South Korean right-wing conservatives are now misleading public opinion over the incident, talking about \"provocation by the north side\" and \"violation of the armistice agreement\" and calling for a \"war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the truth behind the case is becoming clear with the passage of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fishermen on Yonphyong islet and soldiers of the South Korean Army who got wounded in the incident testified to the fact that it was triggered off by the South Korean Army. Accordingly, voices calling the South Korean side to account for the incident are growing stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ignoring such hard facts, the Japanese reactionaries are only echoing the groundless arguments made by the U.S. and the South Korean right-wing conservatives so as to distort the truth of the incident. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the South Korean right-wing conservatives are working hard to spoil the atmosphere for inter-Korean reconciliation arranged with much efforts, incite confrontation between the fellow countrymen, deliberately strain the military situation on the Korean Peninsula and find a pretext for an invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking advantage of their plots, Japan seeks to fish in troubled waters. This shows how sinister and wicked Japan is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is the fact that the foreign affairs research council of the LDP dared vilify even the political system of the independent and dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries took issue with its political system over the incident, which glaringly reveals what they seek in their smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not resort to such third-rate trick but change its hostile policy toward the DPRK as soon as possible.    \r\n\r\n"

He proposed to go back to the peasant's house he had visited in the daytime. Saying he was reluctant to leave without seeing him again as his family seemed to be the poorest in the village. With what great regret he would say even the premier told him outside without entering his house as it looked so shabby, he added. so, the car went back to the village.\r\n The premier spent the night in his house and even had a breakfast with him without reserve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened in September, Juche 79 (1990) when President Kim Il Sung visited china while the banquet was under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung told General Secretary Jiang Zemin that one official was a quite familiar face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jiang introduced to the president the official as the deputy director of the general office of the Communist Party of China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Searching his memory, the president said with a smile on his face in a moment that he was a stenographer. Then the president called the official and asked if he participated in the talks with Mao Zedong as a stenographer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told the president that he participated in the talks as a stenographer in 1963. the president said it was not 1963 but 1964 and he saw the stenographer sitting at one corner of the conference hall. The president recollected with deep emotion that a stenographer at that time grew up to be a cadre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president dropped in at a new modern dwelling house in the Saenal agricultural co-operative (at that time) in Sinchon county, South Hwanghae Province, in the evening of January 25, Juche 47 (1958.). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round inside and outside of the house, asking if its floor was heated and it was not cold in the room. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acquainting himself with everything, he told officials to spend the night in the house not yet occupied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had a supper at the disordered new house lately and went to bed after talking with officials of the county and the cooperative for hours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Next morning he instructed the officials to build many cultural houses of the same style for farmers, saying he found during the night its structure was good and the fire burning well and felt no wind coming in.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
