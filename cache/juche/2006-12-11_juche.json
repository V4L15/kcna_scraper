            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Observing Revolutionary Principle \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- It is the unbreakable revolutionary principle to strengthen a party of the working class organizationally and ideologically and reliably ensure its leadership over the revolution and construction, steadily enhance the function and role of the socialist power, preserve and develop the socialist ownership and staunchly struggle against imperialism.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one keeps the revolutionary principle, the principle of the working class, one will emerge victorious, but if not, one will go to ruin, the article notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to consistently maintain the revolutionary principle in accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence, the cause of socialism. That is the way to defend the basic interests of the revolution and advance the revolution to victory without any deviation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one takes a step back from the revolutionary principle, it will lead to a hundred steps back. In the long run, the dignity of a nation and the sovereignty of a country will be lost to meet a cruel fate of subordination and slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist cause starts with the class struggle, and it is defended and advanced through the struggle. Under this situation in which the cause of socialism is being carried out in the fierce class struggle, it is important to firmly preserve the principle that one should not have a slightest illusion about the class enemies but wage an uncompromising and merciless struggle against them without the slightest concession. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists seek to instigate the remnants of the overthrown exploiting class and the reactionaries to undermine and overturn socialist countries while committing armed interventions against those countries. So, the U.S. annually appropriates a billion US dollars for activities intended to overthrow governments of other countries.\r\n The imperialists are benumbing class consciousness of the people under the signboards of \"exchange\" and \"cooperation\" of various forms and infiltrating the bourgeois ideology and culture by using all sorts of propaganda medium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As evidenced by the historical lesson, one step back and concession from the fierce class struggle resulted in one hundred steps back and concessions and the gains of revolution were lost to the enemies in the end. Therefore, it is important to wage an uncompromising and merciless struggle against the class enemies without any concession.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an intolerable provocation openly revealing the ambition to invade the DPRK.\r\n Papers Sunday carry commentaries in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean military warlike forces agreed to round off a practical \"military operation plan\" by materializing the \"CONPLAN 5029\".

The U.S. imperialists are staging exercises of preemptive attack on the DPRK's strategic facilities while tightening economic sanctions and intensifying military pressure on it. The south Korean warlike forces, too, are stepping up the military reinforcement and the development of up-to-date war equipment, asserting about \"new environment for security\" and \"threat\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts prove that \"dialogues\" and \"peaceful solution to the nuclear issue\" on the lip-service of the United States and the south Korean authorities are nothing but a deception and their intention to invade the DPRK by force remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean warmongers should clearly know that it is nothing but a daydream for them, preoccupied by the ambition for invasion of the DPRK, to expect \"an emergency situation\" of somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will show no mercy to any aggressors seeking to debase its dignity and system and invade it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they ignite a war of aggression on this land at any cost the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize all war deterrent forces they have built up under the banner of Songun to deal merciless blows at the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Friday in this regard.\r\n The GNP's anti-DPRK hysteria for confrontation and war has gone beyond the danger line, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP let loose a spate of invectives against its fellow countrymen in the north, talking about \"threat\" and \"disaster\" over its deterrent for self-defence while shutting eyes to the U.S. nuclear weapons for aggression. As if it were not enough with this, it is now crying out for applying \"sanctions against the north even by not ruling out a war,\" bereft of reason to ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by its treacherous act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a top-class nuclear war servant party of the U.S. as it does not bother to jump into fire with faggot on its back, calling for not ruling out even a war in collusion with foreign aggressors, utterly indifferent to the destiny of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP clan incited distrust and stand-off between the north and the south in the past, talking about \"unification by prevailing over communism\", \"reunification under the liberal democratic system\" and \"reunification by absorbing the north\". Though the nation lives in the June 15 era the GNP is working hard to stamp out the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and hamstringing the nation's efforts for reconciliation and cooperation while totally denying the idea itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act of the GNP clearly proves that its anti-reunification moves have reached an extremely mean and reckless phase as it insists that it can not get reconciled, cooperate and co-exist with the fellow countrymen in the north with the differing ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a foreign party going by the Korean name as it is a group of pro-U.S. henchmen and top-class servants who are prolonging their remaining days under the U.S. patronage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a group of fascist remnants and their descendents who are marginalized being censured and denounced by the people. It is keen to bring back the bygone days when they were engrossed in treachery, fascism and anti-reunification acts lording it over the people, backed by the U.S. which has manipulated the successive pro-U.S. dictatorial regimes in south Korea for the past more than half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing to be expected from the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the whole of south Korea will turn into a hotbed for the U.S. nuclear war and the Korean nation fall victim to it once the GNP is allowed to seize power. Then the June 15 joint declaration will be reduced to a dead paper and the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone will be totally stopped and south Korea will come under the second \"Yusin\" fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans can not live in peace nor can the whole nation evade a disaster as long as the GNP is at large just as any chronic tumor is bound to get worse if it is left unoperated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean brothers and sisters should never pardon the most wicked traitors including the GNP but throw them into the graveyard of history through a resolute and merciless struggle to be buried there for good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement calls on all Koreans to wage a nationwide struggle to meet the challenges of the U.S. and other anti-reunification war forces including the GNP and achieve independence, peace and reunification under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the historic June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It expressed the conviction that the south Korean brothers and sisters would deal a telling blow at the GNP, a group of the most despicable sycophantic traitors, never forgetting the nightmare of military fascism that tormented them in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was developed by scientists and technicians of the Korean Pharmacopeia Committee and the Pulunbyol Information Center through their concerted wisdom and efforts as required by the trend of the development of standardization of medicament on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the start of the work for instituting the \"DPRK Pharmacopeia\".\r\n In the DPRK the institution of the pharmacopeia has made progress, giving full play to the advantages of the correct public health policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the socialist healthcare system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Pharmacopeia Institution Committee was set up in December of Juche 45 (1956). This helped establish a well-regulated system for observing the law and discipline as regards drugs and ensuring the scientific and technological verification of medicament. The subsequent period witnessed the institution and publication of the first version of \"Korean Pharmacopeia\" which helped thoroughly establish a drug verification and quality guarantee system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institution of \"Korean Pharmacopeia\" made rapid progress under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il who has shown profound loving care for the promotion of the people's health.  As a result, continued editions of pharmacopeia were instituted and published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n IT was introduced to the institution of pharmacopeia, a basic book containing regulations on medicament and a legal standard which obliges the relevant units to observe it in the development, standardization, production, supply, storage and management of medicaments. This has brought about a drastic turn in ensuring the proper installation and use of pharmacopeia database, effective processing and editing of its information and in its supply and service.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Security Authorities' Fascist Outrage under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- The south Korean security authorities recently arrested former vice-chairperson of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) on the charge of \"espionage for the north\".\r\n A spokesman for the North Headquarters of Pomminryon in a statement on Dec. 9 termed this fascist act a political plot of the south Korean security authorities and other pro-U.S. ultra-right conservative forces to cook up a \"spy-ring case\" in a bid to block the advance of the progressive reform forces and restore the fascist dictatorial regime under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. by applying the same method as done in the past period of military fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The groundless whirlwind of arrest kicked up by the security authorities is mainly aimed to punish the pro-reunification patriotic figures and bring the June 15 era for reunification back to the era of confrontation era at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their trumpeting about \"spy-ring case\" had already been proved by history to be politically motivated since the advent of the June 15 era. This diatribe will never help mislead the mindset of the people towards reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a challenge to the advance of the times that they again orchestrated such long-bankrupt charade as the above-said \"spy-ring case\" to accuse her for the mere reason that she got in touch with compatriots in the north in the era of independent reunification when the idea of \"By our nation itself\" has become an irresistible trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean security authorities should face up to the trend of history and immediately stop the unreasonable suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic figures including those related to Pomminryon.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
