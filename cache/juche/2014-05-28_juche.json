He added he might rest assured of the quality of foodstuff when he looked at them only from outside as the face is the index of the heart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling the Ryongmun Liquor Factory was built on the personal initiative of leader Kim Jong Il who instructed the KPA to build and operate a modern liquor factory conducive to the development of the nation's food industry, he proposed erecting in the compound of the factory a mosaic depicting Kim Jong Il looking at foodstuff and personally chose its site.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un went round various places of the factory including the process for filtering water, liquor production and packing processes and a depot to learn in detail about production and modernization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said: \"I am pleased to see the factory filtering spring water well before using it for liquor production to thoroughly ensure the quality of liquor as it remains unchanged in all seasons in terms of quantity and physical and chemical properties\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching piles of products at the liquor depot, he said such a fantastic scene would have been unthinkable without keeping the production going at a high rate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the room for the display of products, he saw an analysis diagram estimating the quality of Ryongmun liquor in comparison with other liquor before acquainting himself with the alcoholic strength, volume and quality of various liquor products of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at the brand of Ryongmun liquor, he was pleased that the factory excellently designed it to meet the flavor and taste of the Korean people as he had stressed the importance of successfully designing it during his visit to the factory last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the factory not to rest content with the successes already made but to develop the Ryongmun liquor as a famous one representing the DPRK by realizing the automation of production processes at a higher level and further improving the quality of products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, KPA Col. General So Hong Chan, first vice-minister of the People's Armed Forces, and Han Kwang Sang, department director of the Central Committee of the WPK."

Korean Defense Ministry for His Anti-DPRK Provocative Remarks \r\n Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet military group is being deeply engaged in \"dealings for security\", putting the situation on the Korean peninsula at extreme peril.\n\t\t\t\t\t Spokesman for the Ministry of Defense Kim Min Sok at a press conference on April 14 made thoughtless remarks that the \"north threatens peace and stability not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest of the world\". On April 29 he also cried out for a \"resolute counteraction\" to \"provocations\" by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 12 he went the lengths of letting loose invectives labeling the DPRK a \"historically retrogressive country\" and a \"country that should disappear at an early date\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 22 the puppet military hooligans staged a farce of floating a fiction about \"shelling\" by the Korean People's Army at the most sensitive area in the West Sea of Korea in a bid to brand it as \"a provocateur\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet joint chiefs of staff at the \"fourth great forum for bolstering up joint capability\" opened to public the \"five-phase military strategy towards north for unification\" to which the concept of \"fourth generation war\" was applied.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a total denial of the DPRK, an open disclosure of their ambition for \"achieving unification through absorption\" and a declaration of a war disclosing their scenario for all-out military confrontation with the DPRK and confrontation of social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the successive south Korean regimes slandered the inviolable political system in the DPRK and the south Korean Ministry of Defense worked out military strategies and operations targeting the DPRK at all times. But it is the first time that the \"five-phase military strategy\" envisaging specific proposals for overthrowing the socialist system in the DPRK such as \"operation for destabilizing it \", \"operation for disabling nukes and missiles\" and \" operation for stability \" was set forth accompanied by coarse vitriol and military provocations against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The active dealings being made by the puppet Defense Ministry allegedly to ensure security are the last-ditch effort of the Park Geun Hye group to get rid of its catastrophic crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean puppet authorities have been driven into a bottomless quagmire due to the suspicion of fraudulent \"presidential\" election, the racket for eliminating the \"forces following the north\", worsening people's livelihood and an economic slump, etc. To top it all, the unprecedented ferry sinking disaster triggered off the public resentment at Chongwadae, pushing the Park group into an impasse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being hit hard from all sides, the Park group let the puppet Defense Ministry float a series of fictions such as stories about a \"nuclear test in April\" and the \"north's drones\" in an effort to seek a way out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ministry is set to fight a war with the DPRK by straining the situation on the Korean peninsula while counting on the military hardware of its American master. But this is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with faggot on one's back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even the south Korean media jeered at the Defense Ministry, saying it seems that the ministry made the same mistake as a shepherd's and it is engaged in dealings for security by straining the situation for no reason to provoke the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Defense Ministry's \"dealings for security\" are neither for the sake of compatriots nor for peace and stability on the peninsula. The Park regime is censured for toeing the outsiders' policy and acts of treachery. What it is doing is no more than a charade to save it from sinking to the bottom of the sea as what happened to ferry Sewol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has the unbreakable single-minded unity of the army and people and nuclear armed force which it has built up with much effort.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Ministry, a group of colonial mercenaries and a rash mob without its own soul, feature and the prerogative of supreme command, seeks to bring down the socialist system in the DPRK. This is a daydream reminding one of a puppy unafraid of a tiger and an intolerable and hideous crime against the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Defense Ministry should clearly know that it is the first target of retaliatory blows to be entailed by its thoughtless outbursts and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only merciless punishment awaits the Park Geun Hye military group for a series of its thrice-cursed crimes."

Only a few hours after making public the talk, she set out for overseas trip.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The racket for taking \"measures\" for coping with the Sewol tragedy kicked up by the Park group every day is just aimed to deceive the public and bar her approval rate from sinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the public is unanimous in commenting that it is not a normal way of thinking to take measures for investigating and threatening bereaved families and other people behind the scene while making an apology to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sewol disaster is a product of all evils endemic in the Park regime plagued with all kinds of diseases and blamed for its retrogressive, unpopular and unethical nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sleight of hand can the Park group evade the responsibility for the Sewol tragedy."
