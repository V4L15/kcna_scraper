The action taken by Air Bus, however, is an extremely base act of adding fuel to increasing tension and a dangerous one of disturbing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Arms sale is not just a commercial lever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strategic arms sale to dispute-torn regions in the world, notably the Korean peninsula, has become a major lever for the U.S. and its followers to execute their foreign policy for aggression, dominate other countries and interfere in their internal affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula has turned into the most dangerous hotspot due to Washington's hostile policy and policy of massive arms sale against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with turning the whole of south Korea into an arms market and exhibition ground awash with U.S.-made weapons, the U.S. has ceaselessly shipped its latest lethal weapons to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea has been reduced to the world's biggest nuclear outpost, hotbed of nuclear war and exhibition and test ground for new type weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A nuclear war may break out any moment on the Korean peninsula with the highest density in the deployment of nuclear weapons, where latest weapons are being introduced in an unbroken chain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation on the peninsula, which has turned into the world's biggest hotspot due to Washington's high-handed and arbitrary practices, requires all countries more urgently than ever before to think twice over any act of harassing peace and stability in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, EU countries are mulling selling four air tankers to south Korea, a grave war crime pursuant to the U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EU countries have often pretended to make a great contribution to global peace and stability, trumpeting about \"defence of peace\", and are now zealously cooperating with the U.S. aggression policy. This is hypocrisy towards the world community and perfidy to peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does this behavior bring any benefit to EU members?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They had better bear in mind that it will be necessary for their own good to refrain from such acts as escalating tension but pursue a policy helpful to ensuring peace and stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strategic arms sale is a main factor of disturbing regional peace and security."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Refutes Hostile Forces' Reckless Remarks about Pyongyang Bio-engineering Institute\r\n Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- Riff-raffs of the U.S. who claim to be experts on north Korean affairs and senior researchers in a recent meet-the press pulled up the Pyongyang Bio-engineering Institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t They talked rubbish that its facilities are \"similar to those for producing anthrax germs\", \"processes for producing agrochemicals are similar to those for producing anthrax germs\" and \"the institute hints the north is capable of producing anthrax germs.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 10 YTN, KBS and other reptile conservative media of south Korea echoed their assertions, jabbering \"there is some sense\" in a bid to escalate the anti-DPRK smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is no more than a foolish attempt of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces to divert to the DPRK the world protest and criticism of the U.S. which introduced live anthrax germs into its military base in south Korea and conducted experiments for applying them into an actual war and the south Korean puppet regime which connived at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. tops the world list of biological weapons and anthrax germs and it is the world's worst criminal state stooping to any means and methods to use them. It has more than 400 companies specializing in developing biological weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. defined the Korean peninsula as the most dangerous region in the germ warfare to measure the killing rate of anthrax germs. Since 1998 the U.S. set up institutes and related facilities in its military bases in Osan, Ryongsan and Phyongthaek of south Korea before any other U.S. forces bases in the world to conduct anthrax germ experiments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In May this year it introduced into south Korea the anthrax germs called \"devil's weapon\" whose fatality rate reaching 95 percent, the highest of biological weapons. This is the most hideous scenario to exterminate the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. south Korea turned into a testing ground of all biological weapons such as anthrax germs and arsenal of deadly weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, chiefly to blame for the production, stockpiling and proliferation of biological weapons. It is, at the same time, an empire of evils which does not bother to exterminate other nations and states in utter disregard of international law and world public opinion in order to realize its ambition for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The American murderers and their servants south Korean puppet authorities' false propaganda about the Pyongyang Bio-technical Institute is absolutely intolerable as it is the height of trick against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Refuting the U.S. accusation against the Pyongyang institute, the commentary queries are a lot of bases for producing agrochemicals in the U.S. and various other parts of the world the facilities for producing anthrax germs? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean authorities are under-wits suffering from mental derangement as they take the facilities for the production of agrochemicals for anthrax germ production base. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We declare once again that Korean scientists developed bio-chemicals in the 21st century highly efficacious for agricultural production, animal husbandry, fruit farming, gardening and horticulture and not harmful to human bodies, soil and ecological environment through Juche-oriented scientific pursuits. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK acquired the technology which was monopolized by a few developed countries as evidenced by the establishment of the system for industrially producing bio-chemicals on a high sterilized, dust-free and unmanned basis. This is a signal success for all Koreans in the north and the south to be proud of in the world and national treasure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities, cat's paws of the U.S., vilify the Pyongyang institute as \"anthrax germ production base\". They are the most despicable traitors and human scum without equals in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The story of \"the base for producing anthrax germ\" floated by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities is part of their propaganda about \"threat of biological weapons\" from the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. sets the biological weapons warfare and anthrax germ warfare as main military operations for a new war on the Korean peninsula and has pushed ahead with them for several decades. On the other hand, it cooked up the story of \"threat of biological weapons\" and story of \"anthrax germ base\" and the south Korean authorities connive at this crime. They should not be let go scot-free. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no vitriol can the U.S. and the south Korean authorities tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK."

Actualmente llega a mas de 400 el numero de las companias que se dedican al desarrollo de las armas biologicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara estimar la mortalidad de los bacilos de antracosis, EE.UU. definio la Peninsula Coreana como primera zona peligrosisima de la guerra bacteriologica y desde el 1998, instalo por primera vez en las bases militares norteamericanas en Osan, Ryongsan y Phyongthaek del Sur de Corea el instituto y otras instalaciones interesadas y vino realizando experimentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn mayo pasado, introdujo en el suelo surcoreano los bacilos de antracosis, llamados como \"arma diabolica\", cuya mortalidad llega a 95%, cometiendo asi un crimen antietico encaminado a exterminar la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a las maniobras de EE.UU., el Sur de Corea se ha  convertido en un lugar de experimento de las diversas armas biologicas y el deposito de las armas mortiferas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe veras, EE.UU. es el verdadero criminal de la produccion, posesion y proliferacion de las armas biologicas, las de exterminio masivo y es imperio de males que para alcanzar su ambicion agresiva, no vacila en cometer las maniobras para exterminar a otras naciones y otros estados sin tomar en consideracion las leyes internacionales y la opinion publica del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa divulgacion de ese rumor por parte norteamericana y surcoreana deviene el climax de la conspiracion anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, el imperio cuestiono el susodicho instituto insistiendo en que esto podria ser una \"base de produccion de bacilos de antracosis\" porque son iguales los procesos productivos de ese bacilo y los insecticidas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la teoria del imperio, las numerosas bases de produccion de fertilizantes instaladas en todos los rincones  del mundo deben ser las bases productoras de arma mortifera, bacilo de antracosis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon los imbeciles con trastornos psiquicos, Estados Unidos y los compinches titeres que consideran la instalacion de  produccion de insecticidas como base productora de bacilo de antracosis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvemos a aclarar que nuestros cientificos han inventando con el autoctono metodo de investigacion cientifica el bio-insecticida del siglo 21 de gran eficiencia necesario apremiantemente en la agricultura, la ganaderia, la fruticultura, la floricultura y la selvicultura y no influencia al cuerpo humano, la tierra y el medioambiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLograron en el nivel elevado la esterilizacion sin polvos y la absoluta automatizacion para producir de manera industrial el insecticida y establecieron otras tecnicas productivas  monopolizadas solo por algunos paises desarrollados del mundo, lo cual es el resultado y el patrimonio nacional dignos de enorgullecer a todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon sirvientes a grandes potencias, traidores a la nacion sin precedentes y escorias humanas los titeres surcoreanos que acusan la base productora de insecticida de su connacional de base productora de bacilos de antracosis obedeciendo a su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl rumor que se difunde por el imperio y los titeres surcoreanos es la continuacion y ampliacion de su anterior teoria sobre \"amenaza de armas biologicas\" del Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNunca seran tolerados los crimenes de EE.UU., que para la nueva guerra coreana determino la guerra biologica como una de las operaciones militares principales y lo promueve durante decenios, mientras invento el rumor de la \"amenaza de armas biologicas\" y la \"base de bacilo de antracosis\", y los  compinches titeres surcoreanos que lo amparan activamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon cualesquier palabrerias, el imperio y la banda titere surcoreana nunca podran manchar la digna imagen de la RPDC."
