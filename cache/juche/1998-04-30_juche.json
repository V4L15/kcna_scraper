            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry on unreasonable U.S. military�@occupation of S. Korea \r\n Pyongyang, April 30 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea published a memorandum on Wednesday concerning the unreasonable military occupation of South Korea by the United States.\r\n   Citing irrefutable facts, the memorandum says that though the United States, which has kept its some 40,000 troops in South Korea for more than half a century, is trying to justify the military presence, it can never be justified.\r\n   The document proves that the call for permanent U.S. military presence in South Korea is only too unreasonable from the technical point of view and in view of the demand of the international political developments after the end of the Cold War and the purpose of the \"four-way talks.\"\r\n   It consists of \"1. U.S. troop pullout  from South Korea is key to  solution to the Korean issue,\" \"2. U.S. troop pullout is unavoidable obligation in view of international law\" and \"3. U.S. troop pullout is urgent demand of present era.\"\r\n   The document says in part:\r\n   The U.S. troops in South Korea are the very one that divided Korea and has obstructed its reunification. They also pose threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   For the purpose of realising its century-old ambition for dominating Korea, the United States brought 45,000-strong two divisions to Inchon port, South Korea, on September 8, 1945, under the pretext of disarming the defeated J1panese imperialists.   The U.S. forces, which occupied the areas south of 38th parallel, proclaimed the appearance of a \"military government\" in South Korea. They carried out a \"separate election\" by military force on may 10, 1948 to form a puppet regime and divided Korea. The United States started a war on June 25, 1950 to dominate the whole of Korea, but was defeated. It then brought forward a \"Two Koreas\" policy and fixed the division of Korea, keeping hold on a half of the country.\r\n   The United States has violated and killed the Korean Armistice Agreement, turned South Korea into a gunpowder keg and ceaselessly staged military provocations and manoeuvres against the DPRK.\r\n   They brought the situation of the Korean peninsula to the brink of war through the spy ship \"Pueblo\" incident in January 1968, the large reconnaissance plane \"EC-121\" incident in April 1969, the Panmunjom incident in August 1976, the helicopter incident in December 1994 and other incidents.\r\n   The U.S. military presence in South Korea is unreasonable also in view of international law.\r\n   It is a publicly accepted principle governing international law that after the end of war, belligerents withdraw their troops to remove hostile relations and normalize bilateral ties.\r\n   After the end of the Korean War, China completely withdrew its troops from the north of Korea on its own initiative in 1958 and other countries which joined the \"UN Forces\" withdrew their troops from the south as demanded by the U.S. government. The United States, too, would withdraw its troops by and large after military actions in other regions.\r\n   The U.S. military occupation of South Korea is a wanton violation of the armistice agreement envisaging the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The 60th paragraph of the fourth article of the armistice agreement which was signed in July 27, 1953 stipulates that, within three months after the armistice agreement is signed, a political conference of a higher level of both sides be held to settle the questions of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, etc. But the United States concluded with the South Korean puppets a \"mutual defense treaty\" on August 8, 1953 for its military presence in South Korea for an indefinite period. And it declared the suspension of talks at the Geneva meeting in April 1954.\r\n   The U.S. military occupation of South Korea is also contrary to  UN resolution.      \r\n   The DPRK side-proposed resolution 3390b adopted at the 30th UN General Assembly called for the dissolution of the \"UN Command\" in South Korea and the withdrawal of all foreign forces. The U.S. side-proposed resolution 3390a also stipulated that the U.S. forces shall withdraw from South Korea if an alternative proposal for ensuring peace is provided.\r\n   With the Cold War terminated, the U.S. military presence in South Korea can no longer be justified with the conception of the Cold War period.\r\n   The United States claimed that the U.S. military presence in South Korea was conducive to \"safeguarding peace\" as a \"deterrent to the Soviet Union's attack and the north's invasion.\" But now the theory cannot work.\r\n   It is a strategic mistake of the United States that it is still calling for its permanent military presence in South Korea now when \"relationship of strategic partnership\" has been established along with the detente process accelerated since the beginning of the 1990s.\r\n   It is an international trend to eliminate foreign troops and bases from other countries.\r\n   In early '90s the former U.S. Administration made public a program of three-phased withdrawal of its troops from South Korea and announced that the first-phased withdrawal was carried out.\r\n   The United States must not pursue the anachronistic policy of its military presence in South Korea but immediately take a step of withdrawing its troops from South Korea.\r\n   Doing so is in the U.S. strategic interest.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
