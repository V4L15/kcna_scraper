Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- Reunification movement organizations of South Korea reportedly made public statements on July 8 and 9, condemning the Seoul city police authorities for arresting on July 8 Hwang Son, a spokeswoman of the south headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon), who had conducted just activities to implement the June 15 joint declaration. \r\n The anti-reunification conservative forces, threatened by the growing desire for independent reunification, walked her away in a bid to crack down on the pro-reunification patriotic forces and put down the aspirations of the patriotic people for reunification in South Korea, said the south headquarters of Pomchonghakryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) said that the authorities did not revise even a word of the \"Security Law\" over one year after the publication of the declaration but rather walked away a representative member of the reunification movement organisation for trio solidarity of students in south, north and abroad, which casts doubt on their will to implement the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solidarity for implementation of the south-north joint declaration said that it would more vigorously struggle for the rescue  of Hwang Son and abolition of the \"Security Law\" shoulder to shoulder with all the pro-reunification patriotic forces in paving the way for reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unification solidarity for implementation of the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration and peace on the Korean peninsula stressed that it would vigorously advance along the road of reunification, the road of implementing the declaration indicated by the 70 million fellow countrymen. \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA slams U.S. for inventing absurd pretext for MD\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 12 (KCNA) -- The United States has invented an absurd pretext to establish the controversial \"Missile Defence\" system (MD) at any cost.\r\n An adviser to the U.S. Secretary of Defense at a press conference held in Tokyo on July 9 said that missile defense is necessary to force North Korea, Iran, Iraq and other countries to give up the missile development in a bid to justify the U.S. administration's moves to establish the adventurous MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remark once again underscoring the U.S. stance related to the MD is nothing but very despicable and shameless sophism intended to tone down the world-wide denunciation of the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the international community contends, the U.S. keen to have an unchallenged position as the \"only superpower\" in the world is working hard to establish the MD in a bid to make the nuclear deterrents of Russia, China and other countries powerless.   The U.S. refrains from hurting the feelings of big countries as far as possible but accuses those countries it considers to be small and weak of \"missile development\" in a bid to cite what it called \"threat\" from them as a pretext for pushing the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is required by the U.S. to seek understanding of the MD from its allies and other big powers and establish it as fast as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is known to be the biggest possessor of the most powerful sophisticated nuclear and conventional armed forces. it is, therefore, a height of folly for Washington to take issue with self-reliant defence capabilities of small countries and cite them as a pretext for establishing the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the U.S. is so naive to use \"threat\" from small countries as a pretext for achieving its strategic aim to contain big powers in the Asia-Pacific region.    \r\n\r\n"

He put forward the most reasonable and realistic policies and proposals for the country's reunification in every period and at every stage of the developing revolution and energetically worked for their realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- in 1972, a proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo in 1980 and the 10-point programme of great unity of the whole nation in 1993. And he initiated the north-south summit talks in Juche 83 (1994), thus opening a bright vista for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He devoted his heart and soul to the preparations for the talks to make them successful so that they might open a decisive phase of the country's reunification and bring a reunified country to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He worked day and night without rest for the success of the projected historic talks.     He examined a document related to the talks past midnight, unaware that there was downpour on the night of July 7. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But his heart unexpectedly ceased to beat after he wrote nine letters \"Kim Il Sung July 7, 1994\" on the front page of the document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This autograph is a clear proof of his indefatigable efforts and total dedication to the cause of the country's reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
