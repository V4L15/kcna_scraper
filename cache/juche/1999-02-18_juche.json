At a laboratory scientists were to inform him of integrated circuits production process and the efficiency of supercomputer equipment. He took a glance at the laboratory and explained in detail technical process and equipment, as well as the world trend and direction of their development and indicated a solution of a knotty problem.\r\n   His profound knowledge struck them with admiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He had extensive knowledge and distinguished ability in his boyhood. Young as he was, he indicated a truth that one added to one made one larger than the original one, as well as two. He also held out a reason for the lack of a  black flower. In his junior middle school days he assiduously read books of science and technology of various kingdoms to capture the tower of knowledge built by humankind. In those days his bookshelf was stacked with books of social science, including philosophy, economics and history, military books, books of natural sciences and technical books such as electricity, machine and metal and literary books.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While directing an orchestra of an art troupe, he caught a chromatic interval of a musical instrument, which a conductor could not. When experts failed to find a solution as regards the load of a steel beam of a structure which was being built on an expansion basis, he told them to use light metal.\r\n   Numerous are anecdotes about his rare ability.\r\n   Korea owes its recent successful launch of an artificial satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1,\" the first in the nation's history, and new turning-points in various domains of the national economy to the concrete guidance of Kim Jong Il gifted with a rare brain. \r\n  \r\n"
