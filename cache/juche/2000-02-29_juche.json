One day, officials there prepared a special food for him.

Therefore, the popular masses should dominate and transform the world to hew out their destiny and have a correct understanding of and view on the world. For this, it is necessary to correctly know what is the essential characteristics of man and what kind of force dominates, transforms and develops the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hence, the Juche philosophy raised from a new angle the relations between man and the world as its fundamental question alone can give a correct answer as to who is the master of the world and what is the motive force for transforming and reshaping it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The human history of philosophy has thus been enriched with a philosophy which has raised man's position and role in the world as its fundamental question different from the former one which takes relations between matter and consciousness as its fundamental question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Juche philosophy's clarification of this fundamental issue marked  a miracle in the history of human thinking as it ushered in an era guided by the man-centred philosophy. \r\n\r\n"
