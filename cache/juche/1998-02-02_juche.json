Of this figure, short-term foreign debts which would mature in less than one year amounted to dlrs 80.2 billion and middle- and long-term foreign debts which would mature in more than one year ran into dlrs 72.8 billion.\r\n   Dlrs 25 billion of the short-term foreign debts will mature toward the end of this year.\r\n   Unable to pay the debts, the South Korean authorities have borrowed more money for debt-servicing, which has further driven them into an unretrievable crisis.    \r\n \r\n"

What it seeks mainly is to cobble together a new military bloc. It is illustrated by Cohen's remarks that it is necessary to strengthen military cooperation with Asian nations and a military bloc involving the U.S., Japan, South Korea, etc. Is the mainstay of the U.S. \"security\" strategy in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n   Besides its forward-deployed troops the U.S. intends to frame up another military bloc with its satellites and use it in the execution of the strategy for the domination of Asia.      \r\n   Its intention, however, may trigger a fresh arms race in Asia.\r\n   The U.S. wants to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea by force of arms and put other Asian nations under its military control.\r\n   The Asian people need to exercise utmost vigilance against the U.S. aggressive Asia policy and smash it in time.\r\n   The U.S. must give up the anachronistic Asia strategy and seek peace.    \r\n \r\n"
