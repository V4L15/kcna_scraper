He called upon all the units of the society to earnestly follow its example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n He noted that officials should always take deep care of the living of the workers as the working class is the reliable vanguard of the revolution which has single-heartedly remained loyal to the Party, only thinking of the destiny of the country and the revolution and always devoting their all to the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n He spared time to see a performance given by a traveling art squad of the plant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n At the end of the performance replete with the revolutionary spirit, Kim Jong Il warmly congratulated the squad on its successful performance. He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the workers of the plant are living and working in a revolutionary manner full of joy, confident and optimistic about their future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n, He repeatedly praised the plant for having done a lot of work in the past, noting that the plant where the revolutionary soldier spirit prevails is good not only at the production performance but at the ideological education, mass cultural work and supply service and all other work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled by the plant, expressing the expectation and conviction that its workers would fulfill their mission and duty they have assumed before the era and history.    \n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Sophism of U.S. and KEDO about \"Fate\" of LWRs under Fire \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA in connection with the recent talk made by the U.S. and the KEDO about the \"fate\" of LWRs:\n U.S. high-ranking officials recently said the U.S. made it clear that there was no prospect of the LWR construction and there can be no concession such as the resumption of the LWR construction. It was against this backdrop that an executive council meeting of the KEDO held a few days ago announced that member states of the council have not reached a consensus of views on whether the LWR construction would be resumed after December 1 2004 when the period of its temporary suspension will expire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  It is well known that the Bush administration announced the measure to stop the provision of heavy oil to the DPRK on November 14, 2002 under the pretext of the non-existent issue of \"enriched uranium program\" and halted the LWR construction on December 1, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n In this regard the DPRK, considering that the Bush administration unilaterally and completely scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework adopted in October 1994, took a corresponding measure and additional measures are now expected to be taken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Frankly speaking, we have never thought that the Bush administration steeped in hostility toward the DPRK to the marrow of its bone would bring the LWR construction to a completion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The point is why the U.S. is now talking about the issue of LWR construction again though it is long since it discarded the issue by itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Needless to say, the Bush administration was prompted by a sinister attempt to evade the responsibility for having unilaterally scrapped the Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. is grossly mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The DPRK will certainly settle accounts with the U.S. which unilaterally pulled out of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The LWR issue taught a serious lesson to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n There can be no relationship based on confidence with the U.S. administration as it scrapped the AF whose core issue is the provision of LWRs, throwing away the document signed by its president like a pair of old shoes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n  It is necessary to settle any issue with the U.S. through an one-to-one agreement on the principle of simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n That was why the DPRK put forward a formula calling for a simultaneous package solution to the nuclear issue and a \"reward for freeze\" proposal as the first phase action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The Bush administration would be advised to see how the international community is censuring the U.S. for its non-compliance with international commitments. Then, it may come to realize the fact itself and sympathize with the DPRK's fair and aboveboard proposal.    \n\n    \n\n"

            "content": "End to U.S. Military Occupation and Domination over South Korea Called for \n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute in an indictment issued on June 3 cited historical facts that the United States has desperately blocked independence, democracy and reunification, encouraged corrupt politics and committed all sorts of crimes since its occupation of south Korea.\n The U.S. military occupation and colonial domination over south Korea are something unprecedented as they are characterized by craftiness and brutality of the U.S. imperialists that put into the shade the cruelty of the Japanese imperialists, the indictment said, and continued: The U.S. occupation of south Korea was totally illegal and unjustifiable from its outset as it absolutely lacked an international legal ground. This military presence, therefore, is a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n No sooner had the U.S. occupied south Korea than it declared a \"military administration\" and enforced a brutal \"military rule\" putting the governor-general rule of the Japanese imperialists into the shade. It faked up a pro-U.S. puppet regime with hand-raised stooges and built an American-style colonial domination system and, through it, brought under its control all the domains of south Korea including politics, military, economy and culture and kept south Korea more dependent on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Since its occupation of south Korea, the U.S. has cooked up many shackling treaties and agreements including \"the temporary agreement on military affairs and security in the transition period\" and placed south Korea under its strict domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n In consequence politics, economy and culture of south Korea have got rotten so completely that there is hardly a thing that belongs to it but everything seems to belong to America. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The south Korean people have been deprived of elementary rights as man and mercilessly killed owing to the unprecedented U.S. military occupation policy and colonial rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n What was done by the U.S. before anything else right after its military occupation of south Korea was that it forcibly dissolved the people's committees that appeared after the liberation of Korea (August 15, 1945), dissolved the patriotic and democratic political parties and organizations and cracked down on the people in their struggle for the establishment of a united democratic government at the point of bayonet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The monstrous massacres committed by the U.S. during the Korean war were the thrice-cursed ones which made the whole nation tremble with rage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n After the war, the U.S. reduced south Korea into a barren land of democracy and human rights, pursuing a harsher colonial fascist rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The GIs' crude violation of democracy, human rights abuses and barbarous massacre of south Koreans were not just crimes committed by individuals but organized crimes perpetrated at the instruction of the U.S. ruling quarters and by their order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. thrice-cursed atrocities have taken lives of more than 83,000 south Koreans up to this date since the end of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. is not only chiefly to blame for having kept Korea divided into two parts but for having thrown a stumbling block in the way of its reunification and it is the root cause of confrontation and war, the indictment noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n After its occupation of south Korea the U.S. set up pro-U.S. separate government in south Korea in a bid to keep Korea permanently divided, defying the will of all the Koreans to set up a legitimate united government. It even provoked a war of aggression in Korea to put even its northern half under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. has worked harder for division, confrontation, war and maneuvers after the war to gratify its wild ambition for aggression, far from drawing a lesson from a disgraceful defeat it suffered in the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n It was none other than the U.S. that blatantly challenged the historic meeting of the top leaders of the north and the south and the publication of the June 15 joint declaration in 2000 that excited not only the Koreans but the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The Bush Administration listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and one of the targets of preemptive nuclear attacks and has since stepped up preparations for a war of aggression against it, openly blustering that north Korea is the next target after Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Human and material damage caused by the U.S. to south Koreans for nearly 60 years of its occupation amounts to 43 trillion U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The south Koreans have been under foreign oppression for 100 years:  For over 40 years under the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and then for nearly 60 years under the U.S. military occupation and rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The Koreans can not expect the U.S. to guarantee the security of the nation and the peace of the Korean peninsula. They should preserve them by their concerted efforts through national cooperation. The great Songun politics of the DPRK provides a sure guarantee for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. should not try to deceive the public opinion through such farces as the \"transfer of its forces to Iraq and their redeployment\" and \"troop cutback\" but unconditionally take all its troops and war means out of south Korea in a definite and irreversible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The south Koreans should put an end to the U.S. protracted military presence and domination of south Korea by forcing the U.S. troops to pull out of south Korea at an early date through national cooperation and the concerted efforts of the Koreans in the spirit of national independence and the Korean nation-first spirit under the banner of the historic June 15 joint declaration.    \n\n\n\n"

            "content": "Abu Ghraib Prison, Oswiecim Concentration Camp of New Version\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 3 (KCNA) -- The United States announced on May 24 that the Abu Ghraib Prison in the suburbs of Baghdad would be dismantled.\n The announcement was apparently aimed to remove the traces of GIs' human rights abuse in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The prison reminds one of the Oswiecim Concentration Camp in Poland where fascist Germany brutally tortured and killed a large number of innocent people from different European countries during World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n GIs applied such special torture methods to Iraqi detainees as inflicting mental and physical sufferings upon them and driving them in an unbearable mental position to easily wrest confessions from them. The fact has been disclosed by media, photos, video-tapes and testimonies of victims. The terrible torture methods are the worst human rights abuse in the 21st century putting the fascists' torture methods into shadow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n U.S. soldiers left all the detainees, men and women, naked, an act which is considered to be the most shameful thing for the Islams, before torturing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The Russian paper Pravda May 11 said it has become a commonplace to keep detainees naked in prison, while the Japanese Tokyo Shimbun May 5 reported that they unclothed not only men but women and video-recorded them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Thousands of photos and video-tapes which have already been made public are enough to evidence their unimaginable tortures such as tortures with electricity, military dogs and poisonous snakes and building of human pyramid. The worst of them is the sexual torture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n GIs' abuses are a wanton violation of the Geneva Convention prohibiting the maltreatment of prisoners and violation of their human rights. They are also a denial of the Islamic ethics and human morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n What matters is that the abuses are not merely crimes of individual soldiers who broke discipline but intentional, premeditated and organized crimes perpetrated by the top authorities of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Recently, the U.S. \"New Yorker Magazine\" said U.S. Defence Secretary Rumsfeld approved a secret operation to apply the investigation method used in Afghanistan last year to the Abu Ghraib Prison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The magazine said the operation plan was also approved by National Security Advisor to the President Rice and reported to Bush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n This indicates that the abuses are organized crimes committed in a planned way by the U.S. Department of Defence, the CIA and other military and intelligence agencies of the Bush Administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Such unpardonable abuses have been reported from other prisons in Iraq, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Since it started the Iraqi war of aggression on March 20 last year, the United States has used about 311,000 depleted uranium bullets, 13,000 cluster bombs and many other kinds of shells and bombs to devastate the country and kill tens of thousands of civilian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n All the facts prove that the United States is not a \"liberator\" of Iraq but the worst human rights violator that tramples down the freedom, sovereignty and rights to existence of the Iraqi people.    \n\n\n\n"

On June 4 that year, he commanded a surprise attack on Pochonbo successfully. In the wake of the Pochonbo battle, the KPRA dealt heavy blows at the Japanese imperialists again in Mt. Kouyushui and Jiansanfeng, thus demonstrating its invincible might and instilling the confidence in victory into the mind of the downtrodden people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Upon hearing the news about the battles, the Korean people were so excited. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Kim Ku, obstinate nationalist boss, who had been leafing through newspapers, came across news of the Pochonbo battle and was so inflamed. He opened the windows and shouted over and over again that the Paedal nation was alive. The fact is enough to show what a great inspiration the battle gave to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Newspapers of China and the Soviet Union, to say nothing of Japanese papers, highlighted the news of the battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n Frequently recollecting the battle, the President said that the flames which flared up in the homeland when even the sun and moon lost their light were a dawn heralding the resurrection of the nation, and that the greatest significance of the Pochonbo battle was that it not only convinced the Korean people, who had thought Korea was dead, that their country was still alive but also armed them with the belief that they were fully capable of fighting and achieving national independence and liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The Pochonbo battle is still inspiring the Korean people in their efforts to build a great prosperous powerful nation, unyielding to the enemy's moves to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.    \n\n\n\n"

He highly appreciated what the complex did in remoulding all the production processes and enhancing the production capacity to bring about a new surge in production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The complex has introduced IT into heat treatment and other processes and put the oil pressure technology on a high level, thus manufacturing such quality machines as 2-cubic-meter loader, oil-pressure excavator, self-inhaling pump, small-size bean-oil press and other kinds of machines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n It started operation in September Juche 34 (1945).At that time it was the Sinuiju Machine Factory. It has manufactured numerous machines for the development of the national economy by fully displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard-working. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n In June 1952 when the Fatherland Liberation War was at its height, President Kim Il Sung inspected the factory and guided a meeting of the Party cell of its casting workshop to inspire the 10 Party members of the cell and other workers of the factory.
