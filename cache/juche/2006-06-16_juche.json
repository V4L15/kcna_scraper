It is, therefore, the most sacred duty for all the Korean people to consolidate and glorify the system forever.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article. It continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the working people are taking part in the exercise of power in all fields and the state administration in a responsible manner with equal political rights as equal members of society and conducting free social and political activities in the country where they have become a master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism is cherished in the hearts of the Korean people not as a mere conception of a social system but as a symbol of dignity and honor and hope. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the supreme principle governing the activities of the Workers' Party of Korea and the state to enable all the people to live well off on an equal footing and steadily improve the standard of their material life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party and the state have consistently enforced popular policies for the improvement of the living-conditions of the people and the promotion of their well-being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such popular policies were invariably enforced even in the period of \"the Arduous March,\" the forced march when conditions of the country were so hard. The DPRK has firmly adhered to the principle of giving priority to anything popular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is the society where the collectivist principle \"One for all and all for one!\" perfectly prevails in the mental and moral life of the people. All the working people enjoy a happy life like one harmonious family, helping and leading each other forward irrespective of revolutionary post, position and age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The on-going general march for Songun revolution is a worthwhile march to consolidate the socialist system and give fuller play to its advantages.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This tradition is, so to speak, the tradition of \"By our nation itself\", the tradition of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the sum total of the past six years that the key to the accomplishment of the cause of reunification lies in shaping the destiny of the nation and waging the reunification movement independently, pooling the efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should uphold and thoroughly carry into practice the noble tradition of \"By our nation itself\", the tradition of national independence, bearing in mind that the steadfast defence and positive application of it is the only way of adding shine to the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In resolving all the problems arising in the accomplishment of the reunification cause, the north and the south should firmly adhere to the stand of Juche of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should strengthen unity under the banner of the joint declaration as required by the times, transcending differences in idea and system, class and strata. It is important to further develop the movement for reunification in diverse forms and methods so that the atmosphere of reconciliation and cohesion may continue to surge into high tide within the nation. Guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" dialogue should be made and cooperation, exchange and mutual travel be promoted in such a manner as to help toward the achievement of genuine cohesion of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desperate attempts of the pro-U.S. conservatives in south Korea to turn the trend of the era of national cohesion and independent reunification to confrontation, cringing to outside forces, must be smashed to smithereens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out as one man in the struggle against the aggression and war, domination and interference of the U.S. imperialists with do-or-die resolution and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity is a righteous patriotic struggle for the Koreans who are plagued with sufferings of national division and the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should add fresh force to the trend of the era of the June 15 joint declaration for reunification by vigorously waging the three-point patriotic movement with extraordinary patriotic zeal and renewed determination.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It transferred nuclear weapons-grade enriched uranium to south Korea and Israel and encouraged Japan to stockpile plutonium, shutting eyes to it. The U.S. blamed other countries which posed no problem, while sidestepping those issues that should be called into question. It applied sanctions and put pressure upon them and even referred them to the UN under the absurd charge of being \"nuclear criminals\" for the mere reason that they incurred its displeasure. These are unpardonable crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state, has applied unjust double standards over the nuclear issue, hindering the implementation of the NPT, fostering nuclear arms race and compelling non-nuclear states to bolster nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ever-more undisguised nuclear war moves serve as a catalyst accelerating the global nuclear arms race and creating the danger of a thermo-nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has neither justification nor face to talk about other's \"nuclear issue\" as it is the most ferocious nuclear criminal and the arch criminal gravely threatening human existence and civilization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should lend an ear to the unbiased international voices and stop its reckless moves to start a nuclear war and foster the nuclear arms race before talking about the non-existent \"nuclear threats\" from other countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He expressed belief that this joint national event would mark another landmark occasion in implementing the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Former President Kim Dae Jung in his speech noted that the June 15 south-north summit recorded as the most meaningful event in the history of the Korean nation was significant talks at which both sides vowed to stand for national self-determination and agreed on national reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He extended thanks to Chairman of the National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il for leading the summit to a success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the supreme task before the fellow countrymen to reunify the nation divided by foreign forces, he noted, calling for handing over a proud reunified great country to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Then followed congratulatory speeches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Kim Yong Dae, vice-chairman of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland who is leading the delegation of the authorities of the north side, said:  We are pleased to attend a grand festival that opened with splendor and hear loud shouts of \"By our nation itself\" reverberating far and wide here in Kwangju, the historic city where the movement for independence and reunification raged. This marks another event that demonstrates the spirit of the June 15 era and confirms once again the significance and vitality of the joint declaration in carving out the destiny of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our option is clear at the crossroads of reconciliation or distrust, unity or confrontation, peace or war and reunification or division, he said, underlining the need to wage a dynamic struggle to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" whose validity has been proven in practice over the last six years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Jong Sok, minister of Unification of south Korea who is leading the delegation of the authorities of the south side, said: Over the last six years the south and the north have striven hard to pull down the barrier of antipathy and confrontation. There were obstacles and difficulties in their way but they could overcome them as they had a strong will to implement the June 15 joint declaration without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time to break the chains of confrontation and distrust and carve out a future for a proud reunified nation, he said, calling for comprehensively developing exchange and cooperation in various fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kwak Tong Ui, co-chairman of the overseas side's committee for the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, said that the north-south relations of distrust, misunderstanding, discord and confrontation were replaced by those of confidence, understanding, reconciliation and cooperation, a shining fruition of the historic June 15 joint declaration. The grand festival today is possible because June 15 has been deeply enshrined by the fellow countrymen as the \"day of by our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Korean nation which is responsible for reunification and it is again the Korean nation that is capable of achieving it, he said, calling for a nation-wide movement to categorically reject the outsiders' interference in the internal affairs of the nation and achieve reunification independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then art performances were given by the north, the south and the overseas sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They were highly acclaimed by the audience for staging colorful numbers including songs of reunification theme, folk songs spiced with peculiar national flavor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side's committee to implement the joint declaration hosted a reception in honor of the north side's delegation to the festival Wednesday evening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delegation of the authorities and some members of the non-governmental delegation of the north side visited the \"May 18 State Cemetery\" in Mangwol-dong, Kwangju on the same day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
