In case Japan sits on the UNSC, it may unhesitatingly launch aggression and war in various parts of the world and bring misfortune and disasters to humankind under the pretext of \"coping with threat\" and \"ensuring peace\" by abusing the authority of the UN as a political and military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is considered as a country without faith and principle worldwide. It is quite self-evident that such a country as Japan which follows the United States like a shadow and serves it without independence is not entitled to become a permanent member of the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave itself properly, clearly understanding how the world treats and approaches it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These were a too negligible amount. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the expression of the compensation claim, the Japanese side at the talks persisted in the use of the term \"economic cooperation fund\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

She found the book \"Tomorrow of the East\" in which the British journalist pieced together the behind-the-scenes story about the fabrication of the \"Ulsa Treaty\" and published a translated edition of the book titled \"Secret Letter of Emperor Kojong\". The book carries a copy of the Emperor's letter and gives a vivid description of Japan's intrigues and arbitrariness surrounding the faking up of the \"treaty.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Patriot under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean prosecution authorities arrested 80 years old Ri Jong Rin, honorary chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, and staged a fascist trial of him on Jan. 17 after subjecting him to constant psychological pressure and crackdown on the charge of violating the \"National Security Law\" (NSL).\r\n The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in information bulletin No. 894 on Thursday branded this fascist action against the aged pro-reunification patriot as another unpardonable criminal act against reunification as it is aimed to chill the nation's cherished desire for reunification and lay a stumbling block in the way of implementing the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Ri has done despite his advanced age is that he has made devoted efforts to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification in unity with the reunification movement organizations in the north and overseas, prompted by his strong desire for the reunification of the country, it noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is anachronistic that the south Korean authorities incriminated the patriotic activities for reunification in the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration by invoking the NSL, a leftover of the old era of confrontation, which should have already been thrown into the dumping ground of history. It is also an intolerable act against humanity that they threw the old man behind bars though he requires absolute rest due to his ailment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly respect the main spirit of the joint declaration and want the improved inter-Korean relations, they should not take to prison such pro-reunification patriotic figures as Ri Jong Rin on charge of being \"outlaws\" but show their will to achieve national cooperation by rightly estimating their reunification movement and guaranteeing people from all walks of life the freedom to discuss the issue of national reunification and conduct activities for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The cases of their intrusion numbered 28 this month, he added, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Jan. 17, 18 and 21, they committed such military provocation as infiltrating battleships into the waters south of Kuwol Hill of the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each time the intrusion was made the Navy of the KPA served warning over walkie-talkie available aboard warships of both sides, demanding they quit there at once. But the south Korean army seriously got on the nerves of seamen of the north side by making such provocative reply as \"it does not recognize those waters.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the south Korean military authorities are letting media spread the nonsensical story about the \"north's intrusion.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These disturbing moves indicate that the south Korean military authorities are pushing the situation to the danger line as they are so keen on preserving the illegal \"northern limit line\" that they are unable to look ahead even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the two sides stand in confrontation with each other with arms, any foul provocative behaviour on the part of one side against the other side is bound to touch off resentment and any act going beyond its limit is bound to spark a skirmish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warmongers want to see this to happen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act of dancing to their tune, utterly indifferent to the noble idea of the June 15 joint declaration and the points agreed upon at the inter-Korean general-level military talks can be perpetrated only by the group of sycophantic traitors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
