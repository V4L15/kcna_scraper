A good combination of politics and military affair can be made only by a great brilliant commander with literary and military accomplishments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the early days of his revolutionary struggle Kim Il Sung gave origin to the army-based revolutionary leadership which calls for building revolutionary armed forces not only into a combat contingent fighting enemy but into an army of political nature educating people and leading a revolution so as to achieve the victory of the Korean revolution in reliance upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great tradition of the army-based revolutionary leadership in the DPRK is now being successfully carried forward and developed by Kim Jong Il on the basis of his army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having him as the top leader of the party, state and army, our army and people could adhere to the revolutionary principle to the last despite rigorous adversity in the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Korean revolution is demonstrating the invincible might of the single-hearted unity thanks to Kim Jong Il, the father of the people, the article notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having Kim Jong Il as the center of unity the DPRK has been able to firmly preserve generation after generation the tradition of unity which originated from the down-with-imperialism union. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The precious tradition of the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks which Kim Il Sung established in the days of the anti-Japanese revolution and the exploits he performed in fully embodying it in building the driving force of the Korean revolution are now being successfully carried forward and developed by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Holding Kim Jong Il in high esteem as the father and the center of the unity, the DPRK has achieved the most solid single hearted unity between the supreme commander and his soldiers, between the leader and the people.\r\n"

It is also designed to tide over the financial crisis of the U.S. munitions monopolies, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable evil practice of the U.S. to draw water to its mill by making sacrifice of other countries. The deadlocked dialogue has been resumed and an atmosphere for reconciliation and cooperation created again between the North and South of Korea. This proves that the hostile policy toward the DPRK, unilateralism and strong-arm policy pursued by the U.S. are going busted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never bring the situation on the Korean Peninsula under its thumb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should change its unreasonable policy toward the DPRK, though belatedly. If not, it would be put under more unfavourable condition. The U.S. bellicose and aggressive nature has been more clearly disclosed under the eyes of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should swim with the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well advised to stop hindering the peace and reunification of Korea and withdraw its forces from South Korea.\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes remark made by U.S. assistant secretary of state\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 20 (KCNA) -- John Wolf, U.S. assistant secretary of state, reportedly told a news briefing on April 16 that Bush's remarks singling out North Korea, Iran and Iraq as an \"axis of evil\" reflected real facts and that the United States is deeply concerned about \" North Korea ready to sell missiles to any country.\" \r\n His remark still describing the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" goes to prove that the United States is still clinging to the policy of confrontation with the DPRK with hostility towards it, though Washington is talking about dialogue with the DPRK, and persisting in its war moves against DPRK in a bid to stifle it by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wolf's outburst that \"the United States is ready to unilaterally go into action when its national interests are threatened\" cannot but heighten the DPRK's vigilance as it means the green light to implement the plan for a nuclear attack on the DPRK already worked out and announced by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that the tense military situation reminiscent of that on the eve of a war which had prevailed on the Korean Peninsula due to remarks about \"an axis of evil\" made by Bush in last January will not be created again owing to the U.S. reckless attempt to start a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point at issue is that his remark chilled the atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula according to the recent joint press release published by the North and South of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south are required to respect each other and make efforts to prevent any escalation of tensions in the basic spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and create a positive atmosphere of bringing back on track the relations between the north and the south temporarily frozen. To this end it is necessary to put an end to acts obstructive to this process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, the United States is still keen to escalate the tensions on the Korean Peninsula, clamoring again about an \"axis of evil\" which is little short of \"declaration of war\" against the DPRK, not away from the anachronistic way of thinking belonging to the Cold War era. How can the DPRK remain a mere onlooker to this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is compelled to maintain a high degree of vigilance and strongly react to the U.S. moves as it is persistently clinging to the policy of strength to stifle the DPRK, indifferent to the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is well advised to behave with decorum, properly understanding the firm will of the people's army and people of Korea to react to the use of force with force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
