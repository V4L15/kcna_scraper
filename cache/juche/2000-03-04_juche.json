It is yankees who committed mass killings of the people, including Kwangju massacre, and reduced the South Koreans to slaves of the international monetary fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent anti-U.S., anti-Japanese demonstration of pro-reunification, pro-democracy forces of South Korea manifested the firm will of the South Korean people not to pardon the U.S. and Japanese aggressors and the South Korean authorities subservient to them at all. The U.S. should have a correct understanding of the situation, make an official apology and compensation for all the atrocities committed so far and go back to their den, as demanded by all the South Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

This is intended to maintain its sphere of influence supported by a military edge in the Asia-Pacific region, without difficulty with the financial assistance of its ally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese government annually spends about 500 billion yen for the upkeep of nearly 50,000 U.S. troops in the form of \"sympathy budget.\" Japan, which the U.S. occupation forces call \"heaven,\" is ill-famed for being the best in keeping the foreign forces as it has a government that does not hesitate to sacrifice the interests of its people for its master, the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities who have expressed \"deep understanding\" and \"sympathy\" as regards the financial burden for the upkeep of the U.S. forces are as servile as the South Korean rulers who finance the presence of the U.S. forces with a colossal amount of money collected from the people, praising them as a \"benefactor\" and \"protector,\" and prolong their remaining days under their protection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces present in Japan and South Korea are the root cause of the danger of war. It is, therefore, a way of guaranteeing peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in Japan to force the U.S. forces to pull back from there to the last one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only then, will both South Korea and Japan no longer suffer the disgrace of paying the expenses for the upkeep of foreign forces. \r\n\r\n"

It opened up a bright prospect of agricultural production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the agrarian reform in force, a series of measures were taken for the improvement of the impoverished living of the peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pursuant to the wise agricultural policy of the Worker's Party of Korea, agricultural cooperativization was completed in 1958 and the socialist rural economy system based on collectivism established in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The successful carrying out of the three revolutions,  ideological, technical and cultural, in the countryside resulted in solidly consolidating the material and technical foundation of agriculture and bringing about a new turn in the spiritual and moral traits and life of the peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But agriculture was hardest hit by consecutive years of natural disaster and an acute shortage of fuel and electricity. The food situation, therefore,  still remains difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agricultural workers are now all out to make preparations for the year's farming in order to overcome the present difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Trucks and tractors are operated with substitute fuel and compost is carried to fields by carts, ox-pulled sleighs and by farmers on their back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   North and south Hwanghae provinces are busy sowing early ripening spring wheat and barley in paddy and non-paddy fields as the first crop to solve the food problem in early summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Cities and counties in north Phyongan province and cooperative farms in the suburbs of Pyongyang are also busy sowing wheat and barley seeds in right season after choosing right soil and selecting high-yielding seeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agricultural workers are thus greeting their holiday with successes in the spring sowing and preparations for farming as required by the Juche method of farming. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
