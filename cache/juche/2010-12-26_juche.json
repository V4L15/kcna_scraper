In the relations with the U.S. it is reading its face, dancing to its tune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is proven by Japan's sovereignty being violated in the strategic demand and interests of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whole Japanese territory is being offered as military bases of the U.S. and its forces are granted extraterritorial rights. They are rampaging throughout Japan, committing all sorts of crimes and seriously threatening the life and security of the Japanese people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of transfer of the U.S. military base in Futenma shows Japan's submission to the U.S. giving priority to the strategic demand of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese government has no ability to defend the dignity, security and rights of the Japanese people even in its land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deceptive plot being hatched by Japan with the U.S. master behind the curtain of the \"three non-nuclear principles\" also proves the mean diplomatic attitude of Japan serving the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is actively taking part in the U.S. smear campaign against the DPRK. This is also product of Japan's servile diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Irony is that Japan made a fuss over the conspiratorial \"Cheonan\" case, saying that it would \"take the lead if south Korea requires the UNSC resolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for Japan to try to become the permanent member of the UNSC as it is not aware of even where it stands."
