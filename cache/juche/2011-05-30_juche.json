            "content": "DPRK Will Not Deal with Lee Myung Bak: Spokesman for NDC of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The moves of the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors to escalate confrontation with the DPRK have reached an extreme phase. A spokesman for the National Defence Commission of the DPRK issued a statement condemning them on Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is doing sordid things only while escalating the accusation of the headquarters of our revolution and the sacred socialist system, reminding one of a puppy knowing no fear of the tiger, the statement notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors fakes up false stories and whitewashes its misrule, undermining national reconciliation and unity and deliberately laying a hurdle in the way of peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is impertinently talking about what it called \"true intention\" of the \"Berlin proposal\", crying out for somebody's dismantlement of nukes and apology for no reason. It is busy pulling up the DPRK under the pretext of false case and over its legitimate measures for self-defence, driving the inter-Korean relations to uncontrollable catastrophe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group went the lengths of malignantly slandering the DPRK's magnanimous proposal for bringing about a new phase of reconciliation, cooperation, peace and reunification through wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations without any pre-conditions in a bid to create impression among the domestic and foreign public that its delaying tactics would help \"contingency\" occur as it desires.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his recent trip to Japan he made no scruple of taking issue with the DPRK's nuclear issue and back in Seoul he even said that he would try to persuade someone with \"affection\", the statement said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was against this backdrop that the puppet military warmongers hurled a great number of soldiers into holding firing exercises in ranges in Yangju and Inchon Kyonggi Province from May 23.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And anti-DPRK conservative forces of south Korea during their foreign trip described the May 18 Kwangju massacre as \"an act done by a special unit of the north\" though it was perpetrated by the Chun Doo Hwan military fascists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement clarified internally and externally the following principled stand of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The army and people of the DPRK will never deal with traitor Lee Myung Bak and his clan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is our stand to let them wait for \"contingency\" as long as they please according to their \"waiting strategy,\" sticking to their \"theory of principle\" on the basis of their own judgment till they face their self-destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The DPRK will launch a nationwide offensive to put an end to the moves of the Lee group to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The all-out offensive of the army and people of the DPRK is a merciless one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The trend of the times will prove that hot waves for genuine democracy will rage in the base of the group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The army and people of the DPRK for the present will take practical actions to cope with the confrontation racket of the group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the group put a check bar on reconciliation and cooperation, denying dialogue and contacts, the Korean People's Army will cut off the north-south military communication in the area along the east coast which has been maintained to provide a military guarantee for the north-south passage and close the communication liaison office in Mt. Kumgang area as the first step. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already warned by the DPRK, it will take a physical action without any notice any time against any target to cope with the anti-DPRK psychological warfare persistently perpetrated by the group with a foolish aim."

            "content": "CDN ratifica su posición de no tratarse con Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 30 de mayo (ATCC) -- Con respecto a que llegan al límite las campañas de confrontación fratricida que lanza la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak contra la República Popular Democrática de Corea, el portavoz del Comité de Defensa Nacional de la República Popular Democrática de Corea hizo pública el día 30 una declaración.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos días, la banda de traidor Lee comente fechorías intensificando el grado de censura a la Dirección de la Revolución y al sagrado sistema socialista de la RPDC, sin tener conciencia del peligro. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak socava la reconciliación y la unidad de la nación y crea obstáculos artificiales en el camino de paz y prosperidad inventando lo que no ha ocurrido y camuflando sus infames políticas antipopulares, señala la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, esa banda habla de la supuesta \"intención verdadera\" de la \"propuesta hecha en Berlín\" insistiendo a menudo en la renuncia nuclear y la \"disculpa\" de alguien y lleva las relaciones íntercoreanas a la fase irremediablemente catastrófica pretextando el incidente tergiversado y las justas medidas de autodefensa de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, está engañando a la opinión pública como si vendría la \"situación de emergencia\", ansiada por ella, dilatando el tiempo con censurar la magnánima propuesta de la RPDC de abrir la nueva era de reconciliación, cooperación, paz y reunificación mediante el diálogo y negociaciones amplios e incondicionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante su reciente estancia en Japón, el traidor Lee volvió a acusar el problema nuclear de la RPDC y de vuelta en Seúl, se atrevió a decir con fanfarronería que trataría con \"cariño\" a alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esas circunstancias, los belicistas de la capa militar títere del Sur de Corea movilizaron desde el 23 de mayo pasado a muchos uniformados para que dispararan balas en los campos de tiro de Yangju de la provincia de Kyonggi y de la ciudad de Inchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tanto, las fuerzas conservadoras del Sur de Corea, opositoras a la RPDC, insisten hasta en el escenario internacional en que el genocidio de Kwangju del 18 de mayo, cometido por la camarilla militar fascista de Chun Doo Hwan fue \"acción de los comandos del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos en que llegan al límite las campañas de confrontación con la RPDC que lanza la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak, el CDN de la RPDC expone al interior y al exterior del país la siguiente posición de principios:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  1. Nuestro ejército y pueblo no se tratarán nunca más con la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Que ellos (traidores surcoreanos) esperen cuanto quiera la \"situación de emergencia\" según su \"estrategia de espera\" manteniendo la llamada \"teoría de principios\" hasta que se les llegue la autodestrucción. Esto es la posición de nuestro ejército y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Entraremos en la ofensiva general pannacional para poner punto final a la campaña de enfrentamiento anti-RPDC de la camarilla del traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta ofensiva de nuestro ejército y pueblo será la implacable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La corriente actual demostrará que una verdadera oleada de democratización se levantará en el mismo bastión de la camarilla del traidor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  3. Nuestro ejército y pueblo tomarán por ahora las medidas de acción frente a la campaña conflictiva de la camarilla del traidor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ya que ella bloqueó el proceso de reconciliación y cooperación rehusando el diálogo y el contacto, nuestro ejército cortará, como primer paso, las comunicaciones entre los círculos militares del Norte y el Sur de Corea en la zona costera del Mar Este y cerrará la oficina de enlace de comunicaciones en la zona del monte Kumgang, las cuales se mantenían hasta ahora para asegurar en el plano militar el tránsito Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En cuanto a la guerra psicológica anti-RPDC que sigue librando la camarilla del traidor con las ambiciones estúpidas, tomaremos reacciones físicas sorpresivas contra cualquier blanco y en cualquier tiempo como ya hemos advertido."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia ejercicio aéreo anti-RPDC en el Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 30 de mayo (ATCC) -- Desde el día 23 hasta el 27, los belicistas títeres surcoreanos desarrollaron junto con las fuerzas aéreas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea un ejercicio aéreo de gran envergadura contra la República Popular Democrática de Corea tomando por teatro operacional el espacio aéreo al oeste de la Península Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\tEn esa maniobra se movilizaron más de 50 aviones de combate y los medios de ataque preventivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun publicó el día 29 un comentario individual, que señala en particular:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el curso de ese entrenamiento muy provocativo y peligroso, los escuadrones de ataque \"frustraron\" la \"provocación de guerra total\" por parte de las supuestas \"escuadras enemigas\" y cumplieron el bombardeo táctico sobre los objetivos claves en la tierra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta aventurera provocación militar parte del intento de atacar preventivamente a la RPDC tras agravar la ya tensa situación de la Península Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos días, los títeres surcoreanos recrudecen más que nunca las provocaciones militares muy sospechosas contra la RPDC en el Mar Oeste de Corea y en la zona al oeste de la línea de demarcación militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, realizan sucesivamente los ejercicios de fuego naval en las 5 islas y su contorno, que se encuentran en las aguas jurisdiccionales de la RPDC, y los complots de guerra. Y en julio que viene tendrá lugar por primera vez en los alrededores de la isla Paekryong un entrenamiento conjunto de los infantes de marina de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos febriles ejercicios de guerra en la zona occidental del país coinciden con los pasos de la \"reforma de defensa\", fundamentada en la \"consolidación de acción conjunta\" entre las fuerzas terrestres, marítimas y aéreas y el cuerpo de marines, tales como la fundación de la \"comandancia de defensa de las islas del noroeste\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse hecho es un desafío frontal a la RPDC que se esfuerza en todo lo posible por mejorar las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas y por la paz del país. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC ama la paz, pero castigará implacablemente a los que se atrevan a atacarla. Esto no es una advertencia vana."
