If a nation loses independence and is under foreign domination and subordination, its dignity and interest will be trampled down and it will be maltreated and disregarded and finally reduced to a ruined nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of peaceful reunification clarifies that national reunification should be achieved in a peaceful way without recourse to armed forces. It is not the Korean nation but foreign forces that want confrontation and war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe interests of the Korean nation rest on peace, not war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity clarifies that independent and peaceful reunification of the country should be achieved by the united efforts of the nation. It is the great unity of the nation that makes it possible to reject the foreign forces and flunkeyist traitors, defeat the forces of aggression and war and achieve peace and reunification. in order to achieve great national unity the nation should be united under the banner of independence and patriotism, transcending differences in ideology and social system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how the situation or circumstances may be changed the reunification of Korea will surely be realized on the three principles.    \r\n\r\n"
