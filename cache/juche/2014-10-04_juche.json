            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM Slams U.S. Frantic Anti-DPRK Campaign \r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement Saturday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is becoming all the more pronounced in its hostile moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After ceaselessly staging war maneuvers against the DPRK from the outset of the year with huge armed forces and destructive weapons involved, the U.S. is intensifying its anti-DPRK operations, while totally denying its line, policies and social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. is running the whole gamut of invectives against the DPRK over its nuclear issue and \"human rights\" issue and all other matters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 23  U.S. Secretary of State Kerry held a \"high-level meeting\" with those toeing the U.S. line to  pull up the DPRK over its \"human rights\" issue at which he malignantly slandered its social system.  The U.S. assistant secretary of State for Democracy, Human Rights and Labor disclosed the U.S. intention to continue encouraging human scum to take the lead in the human rights racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. special representative for north Korea policy and the U.S. assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, in their official appearances slandered the DPRK's line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force and blustered that only when north Korea dismantles its nuclear weapons, can it achieve security and prosperity, while talking about its nuclear issue and \"violation of international law.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking once again, the DPRK was compelled to make a bold decision to have access to nuclear weapons due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, nuclear threat and strategy for stifling it for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear force serves a powerful treasured sword to protect the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation under the prevailing situation and provides a sure guarantee for focusing efforts on preserving peace and security, building economy and improving the standard of the people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's line of simultaneously developing the two fronts serves as a banner for bolstering nuclear deterrence for self-defence to cope with the reckless nuclear threat and aggression by the U.S. and its followers and, on its basis, winning a decisive victory in building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear deterrence of Songun Korea can never be given up and bartered for anything unless the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat are fundamentally terminated. The DPRK's line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is the strategic line which should be permanently maintained to meet the supreme interests of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. act of pulling up the DPRK's nuclear deterrent and its line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is a revelation of its sinister intention to swallow up the DPRK after forcing it to disarm itself. The U.S. frantic human rights racket is the heinous hostile moves to tarnish the image of the DPRK and destabilize it in a bid to bring down its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is highly illogical for the U.S., the chief criminal of international terrorism and human rights abuses and the world's biggest graveyard of human rights, to behave as if it has become a \"human rights judge\", while hardly settling its own problem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. human rights moves against the DPRK find their clear manifestation in that it persistently prevented the DPRK, party directly concerned with the \"human rights issue\" that was tabled during the UN General Assembly, from taking part in the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has a will to strengthen the international cooperation in order to make its people enjoy better human rights, but it will never allow any attempt to use the \"human rights\" issue as leverage for putting pressure to bring down its social system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The discussion of denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula will be meaningless as the U.S. is set to bring down the DPRK's state system at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK agreed to work for the denuclearization of the peninsula because the U.S. expressed its will to respect the DPRK's sovereignty, stop the nuclear threat against it and coexist in peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is left for the DPRK to do now is to take all possible measures for self-defense to cope with the U.S. hostile policy toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. frantic racket of pulling up the DPRK's line, policies and social system out of its evil repugnancy and inveterate hostility will only harden the DPRK's faith and will to keep to the path chosen by it."

This brought the north-south relations back to the days of mistrust and confrontation in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, addressing the UN session recently, cried out for \"the north's dismantlement of nuclear program\" in a reckless effort to deprive the fellow countrymen in the north of treasured sword--nukes for protecting fellow countrymen and peace. Reciting a litany of \"human rights issue in the north\" she openly denied the inviolable socialist system in the DPRK and defamed the people's right to a genuine life. She went the lengths of shielding those involved in the anti-DPRK \"balloon operation,\" calling them \"defectors from the north\". She even disclosed her ambition for achieving \"unification through absorption\" while referring to the lapse of 25 years since the pulling down of the Berlin Wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever truly hopes for the improvement of the north-south ties and peace and stability of the nation should turn out to eliminate anti-reunification forces such as Park Geun Hye and implement at an early date north-south joint declarations that were agreed upon at the north-south summits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The justice- and peace-loving people of the world extend full support and solidarity to the Korean people in their just cause of achieving the reunification of the country and peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the rest of Northeast Asia on the basis of the north-south joint declarations, guided by the idea of By Our Nation Itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers underlined the need to conduct active joint actions demanding the implementation of the north-south joint declarations while keeping in close touch with friendship and solidarity organizations of various countries of the world and international organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the round-table talks the participants looked round photos showing the historic north-south summit in 2007 and the Korean people working hard to implement the October 4 declaration."
