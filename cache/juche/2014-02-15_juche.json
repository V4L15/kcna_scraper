Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. military warmongers are letting loose a whole string of sophism that their war drills are \"defensive ones\" to cope with the \"nuclear threat\" from the DPRK and it is natural to stage regular military exercises. This is nothing but rhetoric falsifying the situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. used to ignite a war of aggression on the basis of all sorts of plots and lies while staging saber-rattling in a terror-ridden atmosphere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this way the U.S. has trampled down sovereignty of other countries under various pretexts. It is now mulling applying the same method to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is working hard to let Koreans in the north and the south fight each other and trigger off a fratricidal war in a bid to fish in troubled waters. It has a dangerous scenario to exterminate all Koreans in this world in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., having such blood-stained history making people tremble with horror, claims that the DPRK, an inviolable country, is \"threatening\" world peace and security and a \"rogue regime repeating provocation and appeasement.\" This provokes a side-splitting laughter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Important installations of the DPRK are strike targets of the units of aggression forces to be involved in the drills and the large scale combined landing operation scheduled to take place during the drills aims at occupying Pyongyang. This hard fact clearly proves the danger and gravity of Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military drills. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out owing to this saber-rattling of the U.S. war maniacs, the U.S. will never be safe either."
