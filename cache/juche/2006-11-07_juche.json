            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves to Cover up \"Comfort Women\" Issue under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- Japanese Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary Shimomura in a lecture let loose the nonsensical remark that there was a need to reexamine the 1993 statement of the then Chief Cabinet Secretary Kono in which he expressed feelings of apology and repentance as regards the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and Prime Minister Abe defended this utterance.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are shameless ones who stoop to any infamy to leave the past crimes of Japan in oblivion and evade responsibility for them. But no sleight of hand can help them evade the state responsibility for the past crimes in reducing women to sexual slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese rulers are calling for the reexamination of the 1993 statement of Kono. How should this be interpreted? This reveals the cruelty and inhumanity peculiar to Japan. The Japanese imperialists put not only Filipinos but also Koreans to human body experiments, killing many of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The barbarous experiments on human bodies by the Japanese murderers typical of the cruelty and inhumanity peculiar to Japan can neither be erased nor be covered up. The Japanese reactionaries, however, are trying to cover up these crimes, refusing to admit them. In kicking up a dust over \"reexamination\" they seek to deceive the unbiased public opinion and thus divert elsewhere the attention of the Koreans and other Asians demanding the settlement of the issue of the \"comfort women\" drafted for the Japanese army and shake off responsibility for it. This will bring into a bolder relief the cruelty, inhumanity, shamelessness and moral vulgarity peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's redemption of its past is not a simple commitment that it may or may not fulfill. It can never evade redemption of its past crimes against Korea. The longer it delays it, the greater will be its crimes and the heavier will be the price it must pay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Imperialists' Plunder of Land Accused \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- 100 years have passed since the Japanese imperialists cooked up and promulgated an \"order by the Residency-General\" what they called \"regulations on land and real estate\" for the purpose of justifying their plunder of land after occupying Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday comes out with a signed commentary in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This was a document for aggression and plunder as it provided them with a \"legal guarantee\" for expropriating land in Korea to an unlimited extent, the commentary observes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After promulgating even such an order to intensify the plunder of land after their occupation of Korea the Japanese imperialists established economic domination over Korea the overwhelming majority of whose population were engaged in agriculture and enforced a harsher colonial rule over it. They expropriated land in Korea in a brigandish and violent manner. This crime was just a tip of iceberg of the innumerable crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are the inveterate and sworn enemy of the Korean nation as they are hell-bent on distorting history and stepping up their moves to stage a comeback to Korea, oblivious of the lesson taught by history. What matters is that there still remain the leftovers of the criminal policy of plundering land enforced by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still left in south Korea is the land given to pro-Japanese traitors by the Japanese imperialists in the past. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deplorable thing. Needless to say, the above-mentioned case is nothing but a product of the crimes the Grand National Party of south Korea has perpetrated by pursuing flunkeyism towards Japan and treachery generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely force the Japanese imperialists and the pro-Japanese traitors to pay for those crimes, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And he saw to it that it had been safely kept in the supreme command until the end of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After then, he led the work of translating the True Records from the Chinese character into Korean reflecting more than 500-year long history of the Ri Dynasty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President gave field guidance to King Tongmyong's mausoleum of Koguryo, King Wang Kon's mausoleum of Koryo and others and taught that historical cultural legacies should be arranged, preserved and managed well. And in the closing years of his life, he saw to it to unearth and study the historical evidence of King Tangun, founder of the nation, and energetically guided the project of erecting the mausoleum in grandeur, thus ascertaining the 5,000-year-long history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Remaining true to the President's lofty intention, Kim Jong Il rectified the distorted and obliterated history of the nation already in his days at Kim Il Sung University. While making an inspection tour of army units to give the Songun revolutionary leadership, he called at the Ryangchon Temple and other cultural relics, instructing officials to preserve and manage better the cultural heritage of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also attributable to his guidance that the national Ssirum (Korean wrestling) tournament for \"Grand Bull Prize\", Korean national costume exhibition and other activities have been briskly held amid a great concern of the people in recent years. As a result, the folk traditions keep in full bloom in all fields of social life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
