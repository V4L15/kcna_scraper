            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Work Published in India \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Leader Kim Jong Il's famous work \"The Juche Philosophy Is an Original Revolutionary Philosophy\" was published in booklet by the All India Indo-Korean Friendship Association on May 20.\r\n The work, brought out on July 26, Juche 85 (1996), comprehensively clarifies the originality and advantages of the Juche philosophy as compared with the preceding philosophy of the working class. It also explains the reason why the Juche philosophy serves as a revolutionary philosophy and political philosophy of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and clarifies the principled issues arising in the study of the Juche philosophy and in its explanation and dissemination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The booklet in its preface says: The 40-year-long leadership of Kim Jong Il over the Korean revolution is a glorious history during which he has strengthened the WPK into a Juche-oriented revolutionary party steering the era of independence with his outstanding idea and leadership and shining annals in which he achieved the greatest success in carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last more than half a century since its foundation the WPK has led the Korean revolution to victory without even a single mistake or deviation in the implementation of its line despite all the challenges of the international reactionaries and manifold ordeals. This was possible because the WPK has been guided by such political philosophy as the Juche philosophy and regarded it as the ideological, theoretical and methodological basis of its activities.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Calls for End to U.S. History of Aggression on Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- It is said that U.S. missionary Underwood the Fourth whose Korean name is Won Kwang Han will leave south Korea this fall.\r\n His great grandfather was dispatched to south Korea as a member of an advance team for invading Korea under the cloak of U.S. missionary in 1885. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A member of the Underwood family which has left footsteps of crimes as a stooge in executing the U.S. policy of aggression on Korea for four generations is now going to be expelled from south Korea. This means that he can no longer stay there in face of the  sentiments of independence against the U.S. rapidly growing among the south Koreans from all walks of life in the wake of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Underwood family has acted guides and scouts in laying the foothold of aggression under the mask of religion for nearly 120 years since it set foot in Korea and it has been the chief criminal in spreading the idea of worship towards and fear of the U.S. and disseminating the U.S.-style culture among the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known, U.S. missionaries including the Underwood's, till they were expelled with the outbreak of the Pacific War, craftily defended the Japanese imperialists' policy of occupation of Korea  and systematically carried out preparations to put Korea under the U.S. control in the future. \r\nThis is evidenced by the fact that Underwood the Second held the post of an adviser to the U.S. Military Government which the U.S. imperialists set up to establish a colonial rule after occupying south Korea with the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in 1945. To cap it all, this man took up the post of an adviser to the U.S. side which led to the collapse of the Soviet-U.S. Joint Committee when the issue of establishing a provisional democratic government in Korea was laid before it soon after the liberation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Underwood family has resorted to sly tricks to create the impressions that it has rendered a sort of service to the Koreans with pretty phrases about religion and education, going around under such Korean names as Won Tu U, Won Han Gyong and Won Kwang Han. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea captive to the idea of worship towards the U.S. have expressed sympathy with it and are now showing regret at the expulsion of the Underwood the Fourth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this is nothing but fraud, hypocrisy and foolish self-deception of the master and the servant for concealing their true colors. The ugly records of the Underwood family are the epitome of the U.S. history of aggression on Korea. The crimes committed by it against the Koreans generation after generation can never be forgiven. They will remain as disgraceful records. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is time the U.S. imperialist aggression troops were made to leave south Korea just as the Underwood family, the scout of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should force the U.S. troops to pull out at an early date and drop the curtain on the U.S. history of aggression on Korea.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Brands U.S. as Ringleader of Nuclear Proliferation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- The United States is working hard to put into practice the Proliferation Security Initiative (PSI).\r\n It manipulated the UN Security Council to adopt a \"resolution on banning non-state organizations' deal in weapons of mass destruction (WMD) and calling on all countries to adopt effective laws\" on April 28. The U.S. Navy is attempting to bring the Strait of Malacca under its control with the aim to inspect DPRK ships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reveals the U.S. dark intention to paralyze the function of the present international law system, check the legitimate trade among sovereign states and isolate and block the DPRK under the plea of the U.S.-led PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, U.S. President Bush, addressing the 2003 UN General Assembly session, called for incriminating the proliferation of weapons and early this year advanced a \"7-point proposal on non-proliferation\". Not content with this, the U.S. administration submitted a draft resolution on urging the check of weapon smuggling and preventing the proliferation of weapons to terrorists to the UN Security Council in March. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that the U.S.-loudmouthed PSI is aimed to establish an interventionist and brigandish international order as it calls for justifying the U.S.-led \"sea and aerial blockade system\" and expanding the scope of its application in a bid to \"punish\" independent non-nuclear states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The PSI is also aimed to perpetuate the specified states' nuclear monopoly and justify the application of the U.S. double standards and the special benefits granted to those countries obedient to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is no nobody's secret that the U.S. connived at Israel's development of nuclear weapons as early as in the 1970s and keeps patronizing and cooperating with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that PSI is explicitly targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clear from the background against which PSI was set out and its objective to isolate and blockade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is forcing other countries to join it in its hostile moves against the DPRK, branding the DPRK's efforts to increase its military capability for self-defence as a \"proliferation of WMD.\" The U.S. unilateralism is a hotbed of nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is unhesitatingly resuming the nuclear test to modernize and increase nuclear weapons while talking about \"reduction of nuclear weapons\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nParticularly, it is keen to realize its strategy for \"preemptive nuclear attack\" on the DPRK and other sovereign states. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels the DPRK to maintain and increase nuclear means to cope with the strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to reflect on its own wrong doings before anything else and behave itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is one of the greatest results achieved by Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon and Koreans in Japan have waged a resolute struggle always in the same ranks with the people in the homeland to defend the socialist homeland and displayed noble patriotic devotion for its prosperity and development, without the slightest vacillation in the grim situation of ever more wanton moves of the reactionaries against socialism and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon, conscious of being a driving force of the movement for national reunification, has dynamically struggled to achieve the great unity of the nation and reunification, strengthened friendship with the peoples of Japan and other countries, expanded and developed relations with international organizations and bodies and thus greatly contributed to creating international circumstances favorable to the movement of Koreans in Japan and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the homeland are proud of the struggle and achievements of Chongryon and will always remember the brilliant feats performed by Chongryon in its patriotic activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in its article says the patriotic cause of Chongryon is righteous. The movement of Koreans in Japan will always record victories as long as there are the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, the socialist system of Juche most advantageous in the world and Chongryon, the powerful organization of compatriots, it states.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue will find its solution if the U.S. handles it on the principle of \"reward for freeze.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. that brandished a nuclear stick towards the DPRK. The U.S. is, therefore, an assailant while the DPRK is its victim. If the former continues pressurizing the latter without fulfilling its commitments, it will only spark confrontation and clash. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never allow an unprincipled compromise or humiliating concession as regards the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula. The U.S. should make a correct judgment and take a practical action for its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary notes that if the U.S. truly stands for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, it should promptly drop its brigandish assertion and attitude and honestly approach it.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
