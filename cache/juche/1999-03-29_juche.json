The imperialists and international reactionaries cannot stem this trend of the times, the author of the article says, and continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to be subjugated to others and do people allow other nation to violate their dignity, interfering in their internal affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The main force that stems the trend of the times toward independence at present is imperialism engaged in practices for domination and subjugation.   The imperialists are trying to bring developing countries under their control with the predominance of strength and nuclear weapons and establish an international order based on the jungle law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is why they are intensifying economic infiltration into developing countries through \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" and domination and intervention on the plea of \"settling  disputes.\"   Particularly, they are getting frantic in their moves to prevent the revival of socialism.   The progressive people all over the world should struggle under the uplifted banner of anti-imperialism and independence until they have accomplished the cause of global independence by frustrating the moves of the imperialists and international reactionaries to hold independence in check. \r\n   \r\n"

This is another anti-north war racket kicked off by the South Korean authorities led by its chief executive after they made outcries over \"threat of mass destruction weapons\" and \"infiltration\" from the north recently, the news analyst notes, adding:&nbsp;&nbsp;This saber rattling like all the war drills the South Korean war hawks have staged so far with outside forces or separately is war exercise aimed at invading the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The on-going  war drill \"Hoguk 99\" is bringing dark clouds of nuclear war to the Korean peninsula.   This once again clearly illustrates that the South Korean rulers are the most vicious war-thirsty elements going against the reconciliation and unity of the nation, peace and peaceful reunification.   The South Korean war hawks, who brand fellow countrymen as \"principal enemy\" and are running amok to stifle the north by force of arms in collusion with outside forces, can never go scot-free.   If they dare ignite a war, ignoring the north's repeated warnings, they will not be able to escape from miserable self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Day of abolition of illiteracy marked in DPRK\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- 50 years have passed  since illiteracy was abolished in March 1949 in the DPRK.    Korea was liberated from the colonial rule of the Japanese in August Juche 34 (1945). Right after liberation more than 2.3 million adults were illiterate in the North Korea. That was due to the Japanese aggressor's colonial  policy of obliterating colonial national culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese illegally occupied Korea,  forced Koreans to take Japanese names and deprived them of a chance to learn or use the Korean written and spoken language.   The abolition of illiteracy was an urgent question in just-liberated Korea.   The  President Kim Il Sung caught the swing of affairs and made sure that anti-illiteracy campaign was launched in 1946.     It was thanks to his wise guidance that illiterates disappeared nationwide in March 1949, and the use of Chinese characters was banned in the same year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government have paid primary attention to education since the liberation of the country.   The first meeting of the provisional people's committee of North Korea held in February 1946 took up the question of pencil production as its first item and factory colleges appeared at the height of the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953) decisive of the destiny of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea launched into universal compulsory primary education in 1956, universal free education in 1959 and universal compulsory 11-year education  in 1972.   In the pre-liberation days. Korea did not have even a single university, but it has hundreds of universities today. It has a huge army of nearly 2 million intellectuals.   Korea began national education with  an anti-illiteracy campaign.  It set itself the goal of intellectualizing all members of society, which calls for raising their cultural level to that of university graduates.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA urges United States to discharge its responsibility\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities are now trying to build up public opinion over the loud-mouthed \"exchange of unconverted long-term prisoners for ROK army POWs and those abducted by the north\" at an international human rights conference in a bid to lay an obstacle in the way of the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners.   The South Korean authorities have illegally kept the unconverted long-term prisoners behind bars for scores of years, putting them to unheard-of tortures and maltreatment for refusing \"ideological conversion\". It is a foolish attempt to conceal their human rights abuses to propose to \"exchange\" them for non-existent \"ROK army POWs\" and \"those abducted by the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have already repatriated all POWs to the side of the United States under the Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA). Therefore, POWs problem does not exist in the north nor can there be such a thing.    \"Those abducted by the north\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities is a far-fetched assertion. There are  in the north people who defected to the north from South Korea, longing for the DPRK. But there is none of \"those abducted by the north\".   In actuality, the POWs issue is a matter that should be discussed and settled between the DPRK and the United States under the KAA. So, the South Korean authorities have neither justification nor qualification to poke their nose into the matter. Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities proposed  to exchange the unconverted long-term prisoners, who should have been repatriated to the north long before, for the non-existent \"ROK army POWs\". This only betrays the lack of political common sense on the part of the present authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying their attempt are the sheer impudence of the South Korean authorities as well as their intention to make use of the issue of unconverted long-term prisoners, a humanitarian issue, for a political purpose.    The South Korean authority's unceasing political gambling  over the issue of the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners is mainly attributable to the attitude of the United States, their master and signatory to the KAA, evading its responsibility.   From long ago, the DPRK made it clear that the responsibility for the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners, the north's prisoners of war, rests entirely with the United States and demanded more than once that the United States sincerely discharge its obligation as a signatory to the agreement, but it has turned blind eyes to it till now.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Especially, our side is  now unearthing the remains of American soldiers who died in the area of the North Korea during the Korean War and handing them to the U.S. side from a humanitarian point of view. The United States, however, is turning aside from the issue of the unconverted long-term prisoners though it should have sent them back to our side as a signatory to the KAA.    This can never be overlooked.   This is a challenge baffling common sense from the legal and humanitarian points of view. The United States, though belatedly, should discharge its responsibility and obligation under the armistice agreement and international law so that the unconverted long-term prisoners may return to the northern half of the country. This will be helpful to the solution of GIs' remains.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
