The imperialists and international reactionaries cannot stem this trend of the times, the author of the article says, and continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No one wants to be subjugated to others and do people allow other nation to violate their dignity, interfering in their internal affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The main force that stems the trend of the times toward independence at present is imperialism engaged in practices for domination and subjugation.   The imperialists are trying to bring developing countries under their control with the predominance of strength and nuclear weapons and establish an international order based on the jungle law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is why they are intensifying economic infiltration into developing countries through \"aid\" and \"cooperation\" and domination and intervention on the plea of \"settling  disputes.\"   Particularly, they are getting frantic in their moves to prevent the revival of socialism.   The progressive people all over the world should struggle under the uplifted banner of anti-imperialism and independence until they have accomplished the cause of global independence by frustrating the moves of the imperialists and international reactionaries to hold independence in check. \r\n   \r\n"

This is another anti-north war racket kicked off by the South Korean authorities led by its chief executive after they made outcries over \"threat of mass destruction weapons\" and \"infiltration\" from the north recently, the news analyst notes, adding:&nbsp;&nbsp;This saber rattling like all the war drills the South Korean war hawks have staged so far with outside forces or separately is war exercise aimed at invading the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The on-going  war drill \"Hoguk 99\" is bringing dark clouds of nuclear war to the Korean peninsula.   This once again clearly illustrates that the South Korean rulers are the most vicious war-thirsty elements going against the reconciliation and unity of the nation, peace and peaceful reunification.   The South Korean war hawks, who brand fellow countrymen as \"principal enemy\" and are running amok to stifle the north by force of arms in collusion with outside forces, can never go scot-free.   If they dare ignite a war, ignoring the north's repeated warnings, they will not be able to escape from miserable self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

Korea was liberated from the colonial rule of the Japanese in August Juche 34 (1945). Right after liberation more than 2.3 million adults were illiterate in the North Korea. That was due to the Japanese aggressor's colonial  policy of obliterating colonial national culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese illegally occupied Korea,  forced Koreans to take Japanese names and deprived them of a chance to learn or use the Korean written and spoken language.   The abolition of illiteracy was an urgent question in just-liberated Korea.   The  President Kim Il Sung caught the swing of affairs and made sure that anti-illiteracy campaign was launched in 1946.     It was thanks to his wise guidance that illiterates disappeared nationwide in March 1949, and the use of Chinese characters was banned in the same year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government have paid primary attention to education since the liberation of the country.   The first meeting of the provisional people's committee of North Korea held in February 1946 took up the question of pencil production as its first item and factory colleges appeared at the height of the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War (1950-1953) decisive of the destiny of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea launched into universal compulsory primary education in 1956, universal free education in 1959 and universal compulsory 11-year education  in 1972.   In the pre-liberation days. Korea did not have even a single university, but it has hundreds of universities today. It has a huge army of nearly 2 million intellectuals.   Korea began national education with  an anti-illiteracy campaign.  It set itself the goal of intellectualizing all members of society, which calls for raising their cultural level to that of university graduates.  \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
