Seizure and financial expropriation of institutions including the Central Standing Committee of Chongryon have been undisguised and business activities of Korean traders and industrialists have been seriously infringed upon at the instigation of the Japanese government and under its direct intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, the Japanese reactionaries tried to totally destroy Chongryon while hatching a plot to use even the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in case of emergency after defining Chongryon as a target of the law on the prevention of destructive activities, the law which is applicable to anti-state plot-breeding organizations or spy groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government has put media in motion to create hostile atmosphere toward the DPRK, Chongryon and Koreans in Japanese society and put Koreans in Japan in fear and panic so that they can hardly live at ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon is a sacred overseas Koreans' organization of the DPRK and a legitimate body. It has so far conducted patriotic activities to defend the dignity and right of the Korean nation and has done nothing contrary to the Japanese law. The organization has played the role of a diplomatic mission for friendship between the Korean and the Japanese people because they have no diplomatic relations. The Japanese government is legally and morally liable to ensure Chongryon's activities and protect Koreans in Japan even in view of the content of the organization's activities and mission and international human rights norms. The Japanese government, however, has persecuted Chongryon and restricted its activities under this or that pretext, regarding it as a thorn in the flesh. It even shut its eyes to the Right hooligans' reckless terrorism against Chongryon and instigated them to do it.\r\n Japan's persistent suppression and persecution of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan instead of apologizing and compensating for hideous crimes it has committed against the Koreans in the past is little short of adding another crime to its previous crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- To achieve a great alliance against conservatives provides a basic way of meeting the blatant challenge of the pro-U.S. conservative forces, foiling their obstructive moves, steadily promoting progressive reforms and placing the movement for national reunification on a new higher stage in south Korea.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the ultra-right conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea are making desperate efforts to bring back the old era characterized by flunkeyism and treachery, fascism and inter-Korean confrontation, the article says:\r\n It is a very important socio-political and historical task for hewing out the destiny of the popular masses for independence to promote social progress and reforms and reenergize the movement for national reunification in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to frustrate the vicious obstructive moves of the reactionaries of history and achieve democracy and reunification, the popular masses should hold high the banner of unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These reactionaries are bound to make desperate efforts when they find themselves in an abyss of ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S conservative forces are standing in the way of the cause of the fellow countrymen including the south Koreans to achieve independence, extending their tentacles not only to the political circle but to judicature, prosecution, media and other fields exercising their influence upon them. This shows how arduous the struggle of the south Korean people for democracy and national reunification is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to frustrate the reactionary offensive of the pro-U.S. conservative forces, not only the broad popular masses but progressive pro-reform and pro-reunification political parties, politicians and organizations and figures of various strata should firmly unite as one under the uplifted banner of unity to ensure the undisputed superiority of the progressive forces to the reactionary conservative forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various political parties and organizations in south Korea aspiring after progress, reform and national reunification should achieve the great unity of the progressive forces irrespective of ideology and ideal, placing the common interests of the nation and people above anything else and transcending the difference in ideals and party groupings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
