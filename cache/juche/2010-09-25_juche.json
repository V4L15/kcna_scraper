He highly appreciated their creative success and efforts made by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young artistes, in particular, who performed in the opera are very high in their artistry, he said, adding that this is a clear demonstration of the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy on training reserve artistes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the Korean people having such world-famous cultural treasures as the five revolutionary operas and advancing with pride toward the world should know better about the world culture, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underlining the need to round off on the highest level the opera \"Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai,\" a classical work of China, which exposed the contradictions in the unethical class society, and show it to the Korean people as it is still instructive, he set forth specified tasks and ways to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm stand of the WPK and people of the DPRK to further consolidate and develop generation after generation the precious DPRK-China friendship provided by President Kim Il Sung and the leaders of the elder generation of China for a long period, he noted, stressing that cultural exchange plays an important role in boosting the friendship between the two peoples.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Jang Song Thaek, vice-chairman of the NDC of the DPRK and department director of the WPK Central Committee, Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and other leading officials of the C.C., the WPK."

Kumgang Reunion Center as the venue of the reunion, the DPRK side had a sincere consultation on it as a separate issue by getting its officials concerned involved at the contact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the south side, which had been reluctant to have the said working contact from the outset, took an insincere attitude toward the contact. It overturned all the agreed points, including the date of reunion and the date of exchange of lists of persons to be involved in the reunion, on which both sides agreed upon at the last contact, proposing to delay them. It also insisted that it was possible to adopt an agreement unless the issue of the venue of the reunion is settled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK side proposed discussing the said issue between those persons concerned of both sides, accepting the south side's proposal with magnanimity, the south side immediately withdrew its assertion about the venue of the reunion and proposed changing it. It thus deliberately threw another hurdle in the way of discussing the issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   The south side, while delaying the talks for hours over the issue of the venue, took such a very rude attitude as saying that it would unilaterally withdraw from the contact though it has not yet been concluded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the wrong stand of the south side, the two sides at the contact failed to properly consult any issue regarding the date of the reunion, its scope and venue, ending up without adopting any agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side insincerely approached the contact without preparing any keynote speech and making preparations for an agreement. When the DPRK side chided this behavior, the south side took such an impolite attitude as putting forward the roughly prepared speech it had used at the previous round of the contact, leaving the date and words untouched.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The current round of the contact clearly revealed that \"humanitarianism\" and the pain of the \"separated families\" about which the south side has so far talked a great deal are nothing but sheer lies and it has no will to substantially solve the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side took a serious note of this and urged the south side to honestly approach the discussion on the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both sides decided to further the contact between those related to the authorities and the Red-Cross working contact on the issue of the venue of the reunion in Kaesong on Oct. 1."
