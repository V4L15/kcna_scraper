Korean Puppet Defence Minister's Reckless War Hysteria Flayed\r\n Pyongyang, December 17 (KCNA) -- Ri Sang Hui, puppet minister of Defence of south Korea, addressing a recent session of the  \"National Assembly,\" cried out for \"restructuring\" the puppet army and \"putting it on an ultra-modern and technological basis\" and \"strengthening the posture of military counter-action,\" while talking about someone's \"contingency.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went the lengths of letting loose provocative remarks calling for \"measures to cope with conflicts\" and staging \"exercises for counteraction,\" taking issue even with the recent just measure taken by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Wednesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: This lays bare the sinister intention of the Lee Myung Bak group to escalate the moves for a war against the north under the pretext of \"coping with conflicts,\" persistently pursuing its foolish ambition to attack the DPRK by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe anti-reunification \"policy towards the north\" advocated by the Lee group is, in essence, an adventurous and foolish war policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms in collusion with foreign forces and extend its corrupt \"liberal democratic system\" to the north, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inter-Korean relations once characterized by elated atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity were frozen all of a sudden and the situation on the Korean Peninsula grew so tense that a war may break out there any moment. One of the main reasons was that such wicked bellicose elements as Ri Sang Hui has been hell-bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen and moves to provoke a war, holding important posts in the military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch reckless behavior of the traitor should not be overlooked as it is little short of a grave military provocative act to further escalate the moves for a war by zealously taking advantage of the U.S. policy of aggression towards the DPRK and realize his long-cherished wild ambition to invade it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is impossible to improve the inter-Korean relations and achieve peace and reunification and there is no way to avert a war as long as such confrontational maniacs as Ri Sang Hui are allowed to remain in office. Lee Myung Bak's keeping such warmonger as Ri Sang Hui in his regime is as foolish an act as pricking his own eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRi Sang Hui will never be able to escape a stern judgment of the history and the nation as he is the arch criminal responsible for pushing the inter-Korean relations to the present tension and to the brink of a war."
