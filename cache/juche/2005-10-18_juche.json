            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries Urged to Be Prudent \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- The ultra-right conservative forces of Japan including Acting Secretary General of the Japan Liberal Democratic Party Abe have busied themselves with their anti-DPRK campaign recently. Referring to the resumption of the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental contact, they asserted that \"the government should apply economic sanctions against north Korea unless it  takes sincere approach toward the abduction issue\" and instigated the \"Society of Families of Abductees\" and the \"Society for Rescuing Abductees\" to release a statement demanding the government apply economic sanctions. They went the lengths of peddling it on the international arena.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today observes: Lurking behind this ruckus is a sinister political purpose to incite \"people's sentiment\" over the abduction issue in a bid to win political clout and expand their power bases. This is also aimed to mislead the people's mindset to creating an atmosphere hostile to the DPRK in the Japanese society in an effort to scuttle the inter-governmental contact between the DPRK and Japan and torpedo the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how much the Japanese reactionaries may talk about the abduction issue the DPRK does not care at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seems to calculate that the DPRK would find it difficult to live on without its \"economic aid\". This is a height of folly.\r\n The  Japanese ultra-right conservative forces seek to frighten the DPRK over the issue of economic sanctions and meet its political interests. This is, however, nothing but a crude way of thinking of country philistines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care whether Japan applies economic sanctions against it or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' oft-repeated call for the application of economic sanctions against the DPRK with a noisy hue and cry over the abduction issue would do their country nothing good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Abe and other political philistines of Japan, seized with their unlimited political greed, keep going reckless without properly understanding who their rival is, they will have to pay a high price for their behavior.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are in full line with the desire of the compatriots for achieving the reunification of the country through the great unity of the nation free from foreign interference as they provide basic ways of conducting the movement for independence and reunification on the fundamental principles of national reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said three forms of cooperation reflect the unanimous desire and fixed will of all Koreans to live and develop independently, promote the process of national reconciliation and reunification and defend peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign forces are alien ones and the forces for division. What the foreign forces have done since their occupation of a half of Korea is nothing but acts against the reconciliation and unity of the nation, peace and peaceful reunification. It is due to the foreign forces that the Korean nation still remains divided and has undergone misfortune and pain and a tense situation is prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and it is exposed to the danger of a new war.\r\n Even at this time the U.S. imperialists are running amuck to provoke a new war, chilling the desire of the Koreans for reconciliation and unity and persisting in their moves against the north in a bid to block independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three forms of cooperation provide the only way of smashing the moves of the U.S. imperialists and achieving independent reunification. This cooperation is effective enough to frustrate the foreign forces' moves to provoke a new war, nuclear war and create a peaceful environment for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should wage a more dynamic struggle to realize the three forms of cooperation under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" whose vitality has been fully demonstrated in practice, as required by the developing reality.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
