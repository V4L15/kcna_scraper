It is a torchlight of patriotism and landmark for national reunifiation that enables the entire nation to wage the reunificatiion movement nationwide at a new high stage with a clear goal and confidence.\"\r\n   \"The great leader comrade Kim Jong Il, who puts his heart and soul into realising the President's idea of reunification and leadership, has wisely led the Korean people to fight for national reunification through the establishment of the DCRK.\"\r\n   \"In his celebrated August 4 work 'Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification, Secretary Kim Jong Il defined the three charters of national reunification as the proposal for founding the DCRK, the three principles of national reunification and the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation. His outstanding and tested leadership is a decisive guarantee for national reunification.\r\n   \"In order to realise the proposal for founding the DCRK and reunify the country, we must hold fast to the principle of national independence, resolutely smash the domestic and foreign bellicose elements' new war preparations and preserve a lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula.\"\r\n   \"If the tension is to be eased and the danger of war to be removed in Korea, the United States must renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK and accept the DPRK's proposal for concluding a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S.\"\r\n   \"Japan must repent of its past sincerely, discard its hostile policy toward the DPRK and refrain from encouraging the south Korean rulers to division and war.\"\r\n   \"The Korean people must achieve great national unity, irrespective of differnces in ideology, ideal and system.\"\r\n   The senior officials present at the meeting included Pak Song Chol, politburo member of the WPK Central Committee and Vice-President of the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
