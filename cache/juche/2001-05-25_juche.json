Korea urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) --  The United States should withdraw its troops from South Korea at an early date now that there remains neither justification nor ground for it to keep them there, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south adopted the agreement on non-aggression and the June 15 Joint Declaration. The former Soviet Union collapsed and the north's former and present allies established diplomatic relations with South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And \"strategic partnership\" was established among big powers around the Korean peninsula. All these facts give the lie to the logic that U.S. forces' presence in South Korea is necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The earlier the U.S. troop pullback from South Korea, the better because it will help bring earlier the day of Korea's reunification, given the fact that its presence is a stumbling block in its way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The earliest pullback of the U.S. troops is also helpful to ensuring peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will also do the U.S. good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States' pullback of its troops from South Korea is a touchstone showing whether it is willing to rectify its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK or not and whether it is interested in the reunification and peace in Korea or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it persistently pursues the policy of military occupation of South Korea swimming against the trend of the times in the new century, it will stand strongly rebuffed and condemned internally and externally.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
