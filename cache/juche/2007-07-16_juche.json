            "content": "Full Implementation of February 13 Agreement Depends on U.S. and Japan  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- Given the fact that the DPRK has fulfilled all its commitments, the full implementation of the February 13 agreement depends on how the other five participating countries of the six-party talks honor their commitments on the principle of \"action for action\" and on what practical measures the U.S. and Japan, in particular, will take to roll back their hostile policies toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry declared this in an answer given to the question put by KCNA Sunday as regards the DPRK's suspension of the operation of its nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK suspended the operation of the above-said nuclear facilities on July 14, the day the first shipment of 50,000 tons of heavy oil arrived and allowed members of the International Atomic Energy Agency to monitor the facilities according to the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking into consideration the fact that the DPRK was supposed to suspend the operation of its nuclear facilities from the time 50,000 tons of heavy oil has been provided according to the February 13 agreement, this means the DPRK's earlier fulfillment of its promise than scheduled and a manifestation of its good faith towards the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The provision of substitute energy including heavy oil is by no means \"aid\" in the form of charity but compensation for the DPRK's suspension of its nuclear facilities and the activities of the IAEA in Nyongbyon are not \"inspection\" but limited to verification and monitoring.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a wicked act of infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, which no preceding regimes of Japan dared to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a single day has passed in Japan without witnessing human rights abuses including the politically-motivated crackdown upon Chongryon and national discrimination, maltreatment and assaults against the Koreans in Japan for the past decades. For these crimes Japan has become an object of concern among the UN human rights organizations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Branding the Japanese authorities' discrimination against the Koreans in Japan and their moves to obliterate other nations as heinous racial discrimination and the worst human rights abuses perpetrated in wanton violation of major international human rights laws including the UN Charter and the World Declaration on Human Rights, he continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is whitewashing the crimes committed by it in the past, far from admitting its invasion of Korea and other Asian countries and massacre of tens of millions of innocent civilians, and is now covetous of the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.  The DPRK, therefore, cannot remain an onlooker to these inhuman acts of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I have the pleasure to request you to include the item \"Contemporary form of ethnic cleansing\" in the agenda of the 61st session of the UN General Assembly and distribute this letter as an official document of the UN General Assembly and the UNSC for the purpose of sounding a note of warning against the national chauvinism including Japan's suppression of the Koreans in Japan.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such moves continued even after the conclusion of an international convention banning the introduction of nuclear weapons to non-nuclear states and zones, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. announced in July, 1992 that it had withdrawn all tactical nuclear weapons from south Korea. But it has professed the \"NCND policy\" which proves that it cannot but admit the fact that nuclear weapons exist in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is like a guilty party filing the suit first that the U.S. is raising a hue and cry over other's \"nuclear issue\" and \"nuclear threat\" while shelving its criminal introduction of nuclear weapons into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula entirely depends on the U.S. switchover in its policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop such a foolish act as threatening the Korean nation with nukes and quit south Korea taking with it its nuclear war hardware without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As their hard-line Korea policy proved futile, the U.S. reactionary ruling quarters have become so crafty as to try to materialize their strategy for destabilizing the DPRK through broadcasting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have drastically increased the hours of anti-DPRK broadcasting and left no means untried to infiltrate the corrupt capitalist idea and culture into the DPRK through it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. enacted the reactionary \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" and decided to sharply increase the hours of broadcasting in Korean language as a \"measure to promote democracy in north Korea.\" This eloquently proves how persistent the U.S. administration has become in its moves to intensify the smear broadcasting campaign against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is smuggling transistor radios and micro TVs into the DPRK through various channels in a bid to cause the people of the DPRK to make ideological vacillation and change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an undisguised move to stifle the DPRK in the ideological, mental and cultural fields as it is aimed at destabilizing and degenerating man-centered Korean-style socialism. The U.S. is, however, seriously mistaken. The people of the DPRK do not lend an ear to the enemies' smear broadcasting but are reacting to their reactionary ideological and cultural offensive with the revolutionary ideological offensive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After the end of the Second World War, they singled out Asia as a \"vital continent which would decide on the advance of the world history in 1,000 years to come\" in carrying out their military strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said aim sought by the U.S. imperialists can be clearly proved by their \"ABC scenario,\" the plan for Far Eastern invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The first phase of the scenario (A) was to start the Korean War with the U.S. forces and south Korean forces involved and the second phase (B) was to escalate the war into Manchuria with the rearmed Japanese troops and the army of Chiang Kai-shek of Taiwan involved and the third phase (C) was to occupy Ural of the Soviet Union. This clearly testifies to the fact that the U.S. imperialists planned to escalate the Korean War into China and the Soviet Union and thus spark off a new world war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the U.S. imperialists ignited the Korean War regarding their domination over the whole of Korea as a key issue in realizing their wild ambition to conquer Asia and bring the world under their control.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And this clearly indicates that their wild ambition to reinvade Korea remains unchanged still today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@It is as clear as a pikestaff that Koreans will have to suffer the same misfortune and disasters as they underwent in the last century if they remain an onlooker to the Japanese reactionaries' frantic confrontation with the DPRK and their moves to stage a comeback to Korea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Speakers at the meeting branded the Japanese reactionaries' criminal moves against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan as a despicable behavior of those hell-bent on the anti-DPRK campaign, bereft of reason and bitterly denounced the Abe group in the name of all teachers, students and employees of the university. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming the criminal acts perpetrated by the Abe group an intolerable provocation to the DPRK and Chongryon and an act of pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to the lowest ebb, they said that this only reinforces the Korean people's will to force the Japanese reactionaries to pay for all the crimes committed against them up to this date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All youths and students in the DPRK are renewing their firm determination to force the Abe group to pay for the crimes committed against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, they noted, adding that the Japanese reactionaries' headlong rush into the country's militarization and its veer to the Right would only invite self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Abe group keeps going hostile to the DPRK, Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, youth and students of Songun Korea who have grown up under the care of the brilliant commander of Mt.
