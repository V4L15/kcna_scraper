The poem calls for putting a definite end to the U.S. imperialists' 60-year long occupation of south Korea and national division and making 2005 the year of independent reunification and thus letting the generations to come remember it forever.\r\n The Korean people are the most independent nation as they achieved the country's liberation by defeating the Japanese imperialists and stand firm against the U.S., the boss of the world's imperialism, it notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls upon all the Koreans of the same blood to turn out in the patriotic struggle to drive out of this land the U.S. imperialists and the sycophantic traitorous forces in death-bed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the year of independent reunification does not come of itself, the poem says that when the Koreans wage a dynamic struggle to bring earlier the day of reunification by their concerted efforts under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration, the day of independent reunification will break to shed its brilliant rays.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is entirely\r\nattributable to the U.S. vicious policy and moves for aggression to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, notes Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article.\r\n The article refers in detail to the fact the U.S. worked out such scenarios for armed invasion of the DPRK as the \"new OPLAN 5026,\" \"OPLAN 5027-04\" and \"5055\" and has already put them into concrete forms. It staged at least 100 joint military exercises with Japan and south Korea every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have massively shipped latest war equipment into south Korea and areas around it under the pretext of filling up the \"combat forces gap\" and \"security gap\" caused by the implementation of their plan for the redeployment of their forces, the article notes and goes on : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Huge armed forces of the U.S. and south Korea are now deployed in the areas near the Military Demarcation Line to be ready to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK any time. \"Aegis\" destroyers of the U.S. 7th Fleet deployed in the East Sea of Korea are now performing their operational duty. The strategic and tactical air force in Okinawa, Guam and other areas has been massively beefed up to strike the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the \"reduction\" and redeployment of their forces the U.S. imperialists seek to effectively use Japan as a base for air strike and naval operation, rendezvous of U.S. ground force and a logistic base for fighting a war against the DPRK. Their espionage against the DPRK has been escalated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. oft-repeated talk that \"it has no intention to mount a military attack on north Korea but wishes to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue\" is nothing but a camouflaged peace offensive to further step up its preparations for the second Korean war behind the curtain of \"peace and dialogue\" and disarm the army and people of the DPRK ideologically and morally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to cogitate about the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its start of the second Korean war and make a policy switchover from a hostile policy to a policy of peaceful\r\nco-existence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This helped the Korean nation to have a serious lesson that it should not have any illusion about the U.S. but counter it in do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula was exposed to the imminent danger of war all the year round owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. imperialist warmongers who made military invasion of sovereign states in disregard of the international law and the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the invincible arms of Songun defending the national dignity and sovereignty and the country's peace and security, a war would have been ignited in this land by the U.S. imperialist warmongers and the Korean nation would have sustained the disasters of nuclear war, far from achieving national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the Korean nation got precious experience that national cooperation is strength in the anti-U.S., anti-war struggle against the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and interference and that the strong forces of national cooperation can credibly shape the era of reunification with the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience and lesson in the movement for national reunification last year helped the Korean people to clearly understand that national cooperation against the U.S. is the most urgent and vital task in the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas should unswervingly carry out the three-point cooperation -- cooperation for national independence, for peace against war and for reunification and patriotism -- in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" so as to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification in this significant year, true to the militant task set forth in the joint editorial of the papers of the Party, the army and the youth league.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This policy of double standards is under fire by a signed article of Rodong Sinmun Saturday.\r\n The U.S. policy of double standards is the root cause of throwing the world-wide non-proliferation system into confusion and disturbing international stability, the article says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cites facts to lay bare the true colors of the U.S. which has no right to talk about the issue of nuclear proliferation as it is not a \"fair nuclear judge\" but a manipulator and an arch nuclear proliferator. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the truth about south Korea's suspected nuclear development which stirred up a world public furor, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's secret nuclear activities are a natural outcome of the U.S. policy of double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far connived at, patronized and cooperated with Israel in its nuclear weaponization on the mere ground that Israel is its \"ally.\" It has also kept mum about and connived at the Japanese reactionaries' nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is calling into question the so-called \"nuclear issue\" of those countries which go against the grain with it and styling itself a \"nuclear judge\" while conniving at, patronizing and cooperating with the pro-American forces and its allies in their development and possession of nuclear weapons from its unilateral and prejudiced stand. This is the height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. accusation against the DPRK over its non-existent \"uranium enrichment issue\" clearly proves that the U.S. policy of double standards assumes extremely partial and aggressive nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to put the lid even on the peaceful nuclear activities of those countries that court its displeasure by cooking up misinformation about them for the mere reason that their ideas and systems are different from it but transfer nuclear technology to its allies and connive at and back them in their development and possession of nuclear weapons. This shows well how contradictory and biased the U.S. policy of double standards is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a revelation of the worst double-dealing tactics and the height of shamelessness that the U.S. is calling into question the DPRK's legitimate self-defensive step to increase its nuclear deterrent force and seeking to disarm the latter though it overlooks, patronizes and cooperates with its allies in their moves to go nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue, it is well advised to abandon its policy of double standards.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
