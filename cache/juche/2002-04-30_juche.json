He took a step to send the patient to a country developed in medical science and technology to get accurate diagnosis. \r\n Several minute medical examinations proved that his sickness was not cancer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus his life was prolonged for nearly 20 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, 1966 was recorded in the history of the DPRK as a year with no New Year address in the lifetime of the president. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was on May 25, Juche 63 (1974) that the president gave on-site guidance to South Hwanghae Province and called a consultative meeting to discuss the construction of dwelling houses in the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that 1,000 dwelling houses should be built in Oguk-ri, Anak county, to change its appearance, the president gave detailed instructions on location of a new village, shape of the dwelling houses, internal structures and heating system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he said that he would be the master of the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He personally formed a labour force for construction and took measures to provide necessary equipment and materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And when the project began he acquainted himself with the construction at any time and took necessary measures. He came to the spot on September 5 that year to solve knotty problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus Oguk-ri was turned into an \"ideal village\" with 1,300 dwelling houses, public service facilities, a nursery, a kindergarten and a hospital in one year.\r\n"

Paektu\" dedicated by vice marshal of the Korean People's Army Kim Ik Hyon to Rodong Sinmun today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The founding of the worker-peasant red guards and the young red guards was a shining victory of Kim Il Sung's military idea of self-defense in which the Juche idea was applied to the military field. It was a historic event that made it possible to further strengthen an all-people, nationwide defense system so as to consolidate the defences of the country as firm as an iron-wall, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's defence forces in the DPRK have achieved the greatest success in history under the army-based revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. They are now performing great exploits in the struggle for national defence and the building of a powerful socialist nation, holding a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle or a writing brush in the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's defence forces fully equipped with modern offensive and defensive means have tremendous capability to wipe out any enemy on their own and creditably defend their hometowns and working places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can match the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK as they were founded under the care of the three generals of Mt. Paektu and fight, inspired by Kim Jong Il's idea, faith, pluck, gut and strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the enemy dares encroach upon even a blade of grass and a tree of the DPRK its people's defence forces will turn out as one alongside the Korean People's Army in the sacred war to annihilate the enemy and honorably defend the leader, the idea, the cause and the system of the DPRK and achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail. \r\n\r\n"
