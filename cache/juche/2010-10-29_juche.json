            "content": "S. Korean Military Authorities' Rejection of Contact Denounced\r\nPyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the north side's delegation to the north-south military talks issued the following statement Friday denouncing the south side for rejecting the north-south military working talks:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the south Korean puppet military has persisted in the operation for scattering anti-DPRK leaflets in the areas along the Military Demarcation Line where the armed forces of both sides stand in acute confrontation and perpetrated such military provocations as infiltrating ships of its navy into the territorial waters of the DPRK side in the West Sea of Korea one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet minister of Defense openly called for modulating frequency of anti-DPRK psychological broadcasting and distributing radios needed for it in the areas of the DPRK side and even cried out for installing more loud-speakers and setting up new large electronic displays. All this adds to the gravity of the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to put the grave prevailing situation under control, the DPRK side on Oct. 22 proposed the south side holding the north-south military working talks to discuss the issue of implementing military agreements already reached between the militaries of both sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side, however, turned down the proposal for the talks, talking about \"a responsible measure\" for the case of sunken warship \"Cheonan\" and the \"ambiguity\" of the issue of implementing the north-south military agreements as regards the proposed talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When looking back on the history of the north-south relations, it is very hard to find a precedent in which one party rejected the talks proposed by the other party even when the bilateral relations reached the lowest ebb. This was because the rejection of dialogue precisely meant confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The action taken by the puppet military authorities to reject dialogue and contact is an expression of their ignorance of the trend of the times and an act of treachery turning their back on the nation by stoking mistrust and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the sunken warship case, it was obviously a hideous fabrication and charade orchestrated against the DPRK and, therefore, the puppet forces are obliged to apologize to the DPRK for this a thousand times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army of the DPRK will counter the south side's reckless provocative act of openly shunning the implementation of the inviolable bilateral agreement with a merciless physical retaliation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK considers the improvement of the north-south relations and detente as dear, but it will no longer feel any interest in dialogue and contact as long as the puppet forces keep doing harm to the DPRK under the pretext of the sunken \"Cheonan\" case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations will move in the direction set by the DPRK as required by the times and the desire of the nation even without military dialogue and contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet military authorities will have to keenly realize what catastrophic impact their rejection of dialogue will have on the north-south relations."
