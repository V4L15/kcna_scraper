            "content": "Imperialists' moves to check transfer of science and technology condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The imperialists are desperately trying to check the transfer of science and technology. Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed article in this regard.\r\n Disclosing the intention sought by the imperialists in their persistent moves to prevent the dissemination of science and technology, the article continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are more craftily working to dominate other countries through scientific and technological blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their major strategy to subjugate in terms of science and technology those countries which they failed to put under their control by aggression and war and turn them into \"scientifically and technologically underdeveloped colonies.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their contention that they can not realize their ambition to dominate developing countries if science and technology develop in those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they are preventing the developing countries from introducing scientific and technological achievements under a number of absurd pretexts although they are loudmouthed about \"free transfer\" of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clearly evidenced by \"Wassenaar Arrangement\", the second \"Cocom.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are also trying to use their temporary superiority in the field of up-to-minute science and technology and it as a means of dominating the developing countries. To this end, they are making every possible effort to bar their latest science and technology and it from being introduced to those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reality requires the developing countries to counter the imperialists' scientific and technological blockade with the strategy of developing their own science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article clarifies tasks and ways to do so.     \r\n\r\n"

This is precisely the historic place where President Kim Il Sung, who had set out on the road of revolution while still a boy, driven by a passionate desire for national liberation, offered his first greeting to our people after leading the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle to victory and returning home in triumph. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people built the arch of triumph in April Juche 71 (1982) on the occasion of the 70th birth anniversary of the president to hand down his immortal revolutionary exploits and revolutionary history to posterity. \r\n A grand structure 60 metres high, 50.1 metres long and 36.2 metres wide, the Arch of Triumph is a four-storeyed edifice piled up with pieces of white granite.\r\n The archway 27 metres high and 18 metres wide is open in four directions. The archway is fringed with 70 azalea reliefs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carved in relief on the front and back of the Arch of Triumph is the immortal revolutionary hymn \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" and on both sides a bronze relievo \"a guerilla bugler.\" also carved on the right and left pillars are Mt. Paektu, the sacred mountain of revolution, and the dates \"1925\" and \"1945,\" the year when the president set out on the struggle for national liberation and the year when he returned in triumph after winning it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are the relievos of the subsidiary six-figure groups below them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sculptural groups represent anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and people from all walks of life warmly welcoming the president upon his triumphal return and the excited faces of the working people out to build a new country in response to his speech on triumphal return. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arch of triumph has scores of rooms, balustrades, an observatory, lifts, etc.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japanese chief executive's visit to \"Yasukuni Shrine\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese chief executive visited the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" on august 13 defying the unanimous opposition of the world peace-loving people and the progressive public including those in Korea and other Asian countries which fell victim to Japan's invasion in the past century.\r\n This was an outright challenge to the fair judgement of the history of the 20th century in which the brigandish Japanese imperialists suffered a defeat and Tojo and other chieftains of the war of aggression were sentenced to capital punishment as top war criminals and the requirements for the development of history in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since their defeat the \"shrine\" has served as a symbol of militarism as top class war criminals are entombed there and visit to it by politicians has, therefore, been considered as a criminal act of reviving militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those statesmen who advocated the visit to the \"shrine\" and practiced it were without exception right-wing conservative politicians who encouraged and spearheaded the revival of militarism in japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why Nakasone's official visit to the \"shrine,\" the first of its kind after Japan's defeat, sparked such great furore at home and abroad. And this presented itself as a serious political and diplomatic issue, putting Japan into a tight corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The visit to the \"shrine\" paid by the Japanese chief executive on the occasion of the day of defeat despite this historical lesson taught by post-war political history is little short of officially stating that the Japanese authorities ideologically and spiritually represent militarism and ultra-nationalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also an affront to the Korean and other Asian people to whom Japan brought unbearable disasters in the past and an expression of its revengeful design to start a war of aggression just as war criminals did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the chief executive changed the date of his visit and uttered ambiguous words in a bid to justify his behaviour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this did not help change the nature of his visit but only brought the trite method of the political chicanery peculiar to Japan into bolder relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ruling quarters can never evade the historical, political and diplomatic responsibility for this serious development.    \r\n\r\n"
