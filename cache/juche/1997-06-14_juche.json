By \"regional security\" and \"prevention of disputes\" they mean military intervention and aggression.\r\n   What can not be overlooked is that the United States and the Japanese reactionaries revealed in the interim report their attempt to invade and stifle the northern half of Korea.\r\n   On the plea of \"jointly coping with an emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula, the Japanese reactionaries are scheming to speed up militarisation and create legal conditions for re-invasion. And, the United States schemes to attack and conquer the north of Korea with Japan as a shockbrigade.\r\n   Therefore, the United States is conniving at and urging Japan's militarisation and demanding joint military action in case of \"emergency\".\r\n   The Korean people, who cherish justice and peace, can not remain an onlooker to the moves of the U.S. and Japanese hawks to stifle and reinvade Korea.\r\n   Branding the \"interim report\" as something ill-boding, Minju Joson demands that the United States and the Japanese reactionaries suspend reckless military moves at once. \r\n\r\n"

Putting the main stress on the political and moral incentive does not mean neglecting the material incentive. However, if the main stress is laid only on the material incentive in the whole of economic management, it will entail a grave consequence.\r\n   The miracles wrought in the 1970s characterised by the great speed campaign, the 1980s characterised by heroic feats in grand socialist construction and the 1990s characterised by the revolutionary spirit of soldiers prove the validity and vitality of the idea and theory of Secretary Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

They worked out one evil law after another, detained Koreans at random and punished them without trials.\r\n   The Koreans who were detained in 1918 numbered more than 142,000. About 18,000 Koreans were murdered in the period from 1906 to 1911.\r\n   The Japanese imperialist aggressors killed as many as 40,000 Koreans at the end of 1931 and early in 1932.\r\n   Particularly, at the time of the Great Kanto Earthquake in September 1923, nearly 10,000 Koreans were slaughtered in such brutal ways as hanging, gouging out eyeballs, cutting off noses, dismembering and stabbing them in the abdomen with knives and spears.\r\n   The Japanese imperialists ruthlessly killed young Koreans who had been drafted for forced labor. The killing of \"Comfort Wwomen for the Army\" was an unimaginably brutal crime.\r\n   Japan must apologize and atone for such crimes, the paper says, and continues:   Atonement for the above-said massacres is not an issue belonging to the choice of Japan. Japan must pay for the killing of Koreans without fail. If Japan refuses or tries to delay it, it will be made to pay more dearly.\r\n   The Korean people have a legitimate right to receive apology and compensation from Japan. They will certainly make Japan pay.  \r\n\r\n"
