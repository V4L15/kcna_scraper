This marked an event of special mention as it brought about a landmark turn in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration is a programme for national unity based on the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and consistent with the patriotic spirit and a great programme for national reunification, the paper notes, stressing that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" has now become an idea representing patriotism and a message of the times as it is favored and followed by all Koreans desirous of unity and reunification irrespective of ideology, political view and ism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the proud appearance of the Korean nation in the June 15 era of reunification for all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to thoroughly embody the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" the principle of national independence, in the struggle for national reunification by pooling will and efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle waged over the past eight years evidently proved that the Koreans can settle any problems arising in the movement for national reunification when they pool their efforts in the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" The path covered by the fruitful struggle for national reunification in the new century goes to prove the validity and vitality of the June 15 joint declaration and instills into the Koreans the firm conviction that it is possible to warm up the inter-Korean relations and achieve the peace of the country and prosperity common to the nation and reunification only when they bring about a surge in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How to approach the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it, is a touchstone discerning independence from subjugation, peace from war and reunification from division. Intolerable is any ism and debate negating the above-said declarations and going against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that all the Koreans will wage a more vigorous nation-wide struggle for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and thus usher in a new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity without fail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Thanks to this declaration the Koreans at home and abroad have brought about landmark events and achieved spectacular successes unprecedented in the history of the national division over the past 8 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea keen on sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen is busy peddling \"pragmatism\" and \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as a measure for improving the inter-Korean relations. But this is intolerable traitorous and anti-reunification sophism aimed to stop the advance of the June 15 era of reunification and push the north-south relations to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the June 15 joint declaration serves as the only landmark for achieving the cause of reunification. If the declaration is to be firmly defended and implemented to the letter it is necessary to resolutely reject and oppose the moves of the conservative ruling forces of south Korea to negate and scrap it, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But conferences of youth and students, men of the press, women and educators from the north and the south for implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration took place at Mt. Kumgang resort one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants expressed their resolution once again to reject the outsiders' interference in the national issue and the moves of the sycophantic forces following it and to achieve the independent reunification, peace and prosperity under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow-countrymen have keenly experienced the validity and might of the idea \"By our nation itself\", making headway in spite of the challenges of the separatists within and without over the last eight years since the adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in Juche 89 (2000). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogues and contacts including the ministerial talks and the realization of collaboration and interchange between the north and the south have developed the old relations of distrust and confrontation into ones of reconciliation and unity, remarkably raising the pro-reunification atmosphere on a nationwide scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The large scale pro-reunification events held in Pyongyang, Mt. Kumgang resort, Seoul and other places by organizations and figures of all levels in the north, south and abroad on various occasions such as June 15 and August 15 gave a powerful impetus to the reunification movement of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those years have witnessed the formation of the June 15 All-Korean Committee, a pan-national reunification movement organization, which is the first of its kind in the history since the division. As a result, it realized the solidarity of the north, south and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the idea \"By our nation itself\" is the banner and the mark for national reunification both in name and reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists and the anti-reunification forces of south Korea are trying to impair the process of national reconciliation and unity, they can neither hold in check nor break the will and aspiration of the nation to achieve the reunification of the country with concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow-countrymen in the north, south and abroad will vigorously strive to bring earlier the day of national reunification, holding higher the banner of the \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
