Herein lies the most right way of achieving the great unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If all the fellow countrymen promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests and unite on the principle of subordinating everything to the common interests of the nation and the cause of national reunification, they will be able to set up a federal unified state without doing any harm to any side or anyone, keeping the differing systems and governments in the north and the south as they are, the article stresses. \r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates that sinister political aim of the reactionary forces of Japan is lurking behind this case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sankei Shimbun said that the public peace department of the Japanese Police Agency is \"poised to seek a clue to the deal in special materials between Japan and the DPRK, the truth of which still remains almost unclear, with the case as a momentum.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This only lays bare the sinister intention of the Japanese authorities to charge the DPRK with \"nuclear development\" as a new \"shock therapy\" and thus achieve their foolish goal, instead of repenting of the reckless hostile acts they committed against the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The actual conditions of the nuclear power stations in Japan and its massive shipment from overseas and stockpiling of nuclear materials eloquently prove that Japan is plagued with the most serious nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This notwithstanding, Japan is slinging mud at the DPRK for no reason, instead of curing its own sore spot. This is a height of folly and shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are well advised to take a proper stand toward the dastardly diatribe launched against the DPRK under the pretext of the \"monazite case\" and mull the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations over. \r\n\r\n"
