            "content": "Letter to Kim Jong Il from C.C. of NDFSK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il received a letter from the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea on April 15, the Day of the Sun.\r\n Noting that President Kim Il Sung provided the guiding idea of the times by founding the immortal Juche idea, performed unparalleled exploits in liberating the country and defending the sovereignty of the nation by defeating the two most ferocious imperialist formidable enemies and set a world-wide example of creation and construction by leading the social reform and socialist construction at different stages to victory and turning the north into a powerful socialist state, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, the letter added that all this represents the greatest exploits to be specially recorded in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president who worked heart and soul for national reunification, always considerate of the people in the south, laid down the wisest line and policy of national reunification and led all the Koreans to the road of independence and unity, providing a solid groundwork for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, the letter said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the cause of Juche started by the president is being creditably carried forward and developed by Kim Jong Il, the letter continued: He most successfully accomplished the cause of perpetuating the memory of the president, thus enabling the people to hold him in high esteem as they did in his lifetime and giving a steady continuity to his revolutionary history. This is the greatest exploit as he paved the way for creditably carrying forward the revolutionary cause and winning an eternal victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president's last instruction on national reunification is being successfully carried out and the cause of building a prosperous powerful nation is making a leaping advance thanks to the endless journey for Songun guidance made by Kim Jong Il. He is the most outstanding leader of the present era and the bright sun of the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will decisively foil the U.S. moves to provoke a war and bring earlier the day of independent reunification by further intensifying the movement for reunification through national cooperation under the uplifted banner of the three charters for national reunification and the June 15 joint declaration and thus realize his life-long desire.    \r\n\r\n"
