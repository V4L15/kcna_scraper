            "content": "DPRK Will Show Its Will for Counteraction with Military Action: KPA Supreme Command\r\nPyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army (KPA) issued the following statement Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. nuclear war racket has gone beyond the danger line and entered the phase of an actual war, defying the repeated warnings from the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. let B-52 formation deployed in Anderson air force base on Guam fly into the sky above south Korea at around 08:00 on March 25. The formation staged a nuclear striking drill with simulated targets in the depth of the DPRK from around 11:50 and revealed it to the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. even let the conservative media of south Korea reveal the process of the 2010 operation against Osama bin Laden. It openly said the operational plan of \"south Korea-U.S. combined forces\" includes targeting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK with the use of lethal striking means and methods of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey blustered that the operation targeting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK has no problem in terms of military technique, adding that they are closely monitoring all the relevant moves of the DPRK. They even made such bluff that now is the time to unfold \"active north Korea policy\", \"not passive one\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present south Korean puppet authorities tried to link the Cheonan sinking case with the DPRK and shift the blame for the Yonphyong Island shelling on to the DPRK just as traitor Lee Myung Bak did. They said they plan mounting precision missile attacks on the statues of great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in different parts of the DPRK including those in Pyongyang if \"local provocation\" of similar nature reoccurs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey, unafraid of divine punishment, even said that they drafted the \"list of targets\" based on detailed analysis of the locations, sizes and specific features of those statues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these moves clearly prove that the anti-DPRK hostile acts now under way by the U.S., south Korean puppet forces and all other followers under the pretext of the DPRK's satellite launch and the underground nuclear test have entered a reckless phase of practical implementation after going beyond the phase of threatening and blackmailing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe gravity of the situation lies in that such reckless moves are timed to coincide with the U.S.-masterminded resolutions on sanctions against the DPRK being carried into practice intensively through conspiracy and nexus with all hues of hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA Supreme Command declares at home and abroad the final decision of the army and people of the DPRK as follows as regards the present prevailing situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. We will demonstrate with the practical military action the firm will of the army and people of the DPRK to take counteraction to defend the sovereignty and dignity of the supreme leadership of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is a limit to patience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the clear conclusion drawn by us that we can never tolerate the serious situation in which the sovereignty and dignity of the supreme leadership of the country are ruthlessly trampled down and the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail are turning into a real war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom this moment the KPA Supreme Command will put on the highest alert all the field artillery units including strategic rocket units and long-range artillery units which are assigned to strike bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops in the U.S. mainland and on Hawaii and Guam and other operational zone in the Pacific as well as all the enemy targets in south Korea and its vicinity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. We will show the present puppet authorities of south Korea, which are dancing to the tune of their master, kowtowing to his hostile policy toward the DPRK, the strongest will of the DPRK army with physical action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe enemies are seriously mistaken if they think they can find an opportunity for striking \"basic bases\" and attacking \"support forces\" and \"commanding forces\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey should be mindful that everything will be reduced to ashes and flames the moment the first attack is unleashed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the unshakable stand of the army and people of the DPRK that they can never allow the treacherous acts, the preceding ruler committed by pushing the inter-Korean relations to a catastrophe and blocking the way for peace and prosperity for five years, to be taken over by the present south Korean chief executive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. We call upon progressive people of the world opposing war and loving peace to turn out as one in the struggle against the brigandish U.S. highhanded and arbitrary practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInjustice can never become justice though it is practiced by big countries with advantageous military muscles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven the resolution of the UN Security Council will become unjust one and become an international crime going against the trend of the times if it is devoid of impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInjustice is temporary one and will die in end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut justice is like a flame that flares up forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA Supreme Command calls upon the conscience of the world to actively join the army and people of the DPRK in defending independence and justice, not blindly following the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and the UNSC's \"resolutions\" bereft of impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVictory is in store for the army and people of the DPRK rising up to defend the sovereignty, and progressive people of the world loving justice and peace."

            "content": "DPRK Informs UNSC of Impending Danger of Nuclear War on Korean Peninsula\r\nPyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement on Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. anti-DPRK hostile acts being intensified over its satellite launch for peaceful purposes have reached the eve of nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn Monday U.S. B-52 strategic bombers flied to the sky above south Korea by stealth again to stage a nuclear bomb dropping drill aimed at a surprise nuclear preemptive attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTheir flight defying our repeated warnings clearly proves that the U.S. plan for a nuclear war has entered an uncontrollable phase of practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is making desperate efforts to seek a way out from igniting a nuclear war against the DPRK, afraid that if the DPRK with nuclear weapons achieves economic prosperity through the building of a thriving nation, its hostile policy toward the DPRK will end in failure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has already cooked up two \"resolutions on sanctions\" through the UN Security Council in less than two months, creating a vicious cycle of escalated tension to provide an international pretext for unleashing a nuclear war under the signboard of \"nuclear non-proliferation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the U.S. is mobilizing all their \"three nuclear attack means\" in the preparation for a nuclear war against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStrategic nuclear missiles in the U.S. mainland are aiming at the DPRK and submarines with nuclear warheads are swarming to the waters off south Korea and its vicinity in the Pacific region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, the U.S. deputy secretary of Defense, who visited south Korea to finally examine the preparations of a nuclear war against the DPRK, openly said that the U.S. military attaches top priority to the second Korean war, giving green light to a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea and the south Korean military chief drafted a \"joint plan to cope with local provocation\". The main point of it is to start a total nuclear war involving the U.S. forces in the U.S. mainland and the Pacific region after the south Korean puppet army touches off a conflict. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean warmongers, elated with the backing of the U.S. master, are threatening punishment to \"provocation\" of the DPRK and even seeking a nefarious purpose of hurting status of great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, symbol of our supreme dignity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prevailing grave situation goes to prove that the U.S. is seeking a nuclear war against the DPRK, its first target of attack, after moving the strategic centre for world domination to the Asian-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA nuclear war in the Korean Peninsula is no longer a presentative meaning but realistic one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow the U.S. is brave with the numerical advantage in nuclear weapons but it is doomed to perish in the flames kindled by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has its own powerful precision means for nuclear attack and nuclear war methods.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppets who are behaving recklessly under their master's nuclear umbrella will experience a sound by-blow of a nuclear attack when a war breaks out between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo cope with the prevailing grave situation the KPA Supreme Command made a final decision to demonstrate with a practical military action the strong will of the DPRK army and people to take a resolute counteraction and gave an order to the strike forces of justice to keep themselves on the highest alert.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpon authorization the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK openly informs the UN Security Council that the Korean Peninsula is now in a touch-and-go situation due to the nuclear war provocation moves of the U.S. and south Korean puppets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK army and people that have become one with the Supreme Command are entering the final stage of the all-out showdown with the U.S. to defend the country's sovereignty and the nation's dignity by dint of the power of Songun they have long bolstered up."

It is a great treason against humanity little short of brandishing a sword against the hearts of the army and people of the DPRK and the world progressive people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the \"case of bringing down statues\" was disclosed to have been plotted by them targeting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, we declared that we will surely punish the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey now seek to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, not content with the racket for a nuclear war against it.

It also compelled the Korean people, the best in the world, to tighten their belts. The amount of human and material damage done to the DPRK till 2005 totaled at least 64,959 854 million U.S. dollars. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUncountable are the mental oppression, political, moral and cultural damages done to the Korean people by the U.S. through its persistent moves for a war and threat of aggression at every stage of socialist construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe state of ceasefire has been a legal reason for such protracted instability on the Korean Peninsula and its ensuing consequences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrequent military skirmishes in Panmunjom and in waters of the West Sea including Yonphyong Island and other events which greatly shocked the world were not accidental ones but those entailed by the unreasonable ceasefire mechanism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. egged south Korea on to preserve the illegal \"northern limit line\" by abusing the limitation of AA. Consequently, not a day passed in peace on the five islands on the West Sea of Korea and extreme tension prevailed there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese areas are an epitome clearly showing the danger of AA and the actual possibility of the outbreak of another Korean War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has become as clear as a pikestaff that AA cannot prevent a new war on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe sovereignty of Korea and its nation should not be left to others to defend it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the DPRK allows itself to be bound to AA as before with the U.S. hostile acts against the DPRK becoming intolerable in all aspects, the Korean people should suffer again from all the obstacles, misfortunes and tragedy just as they did for over half a century. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo big power has so far been pleased to see the Koreans get united as one and become prosperous. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese days the U.S. and its allies have frantically stepped up their moves for sanctions and pressure and a war against the DPRK over its satellite launch and underground nuclear test. These have been pursuant to the hegemonic policy of those forces displeased with the efforts of the DPRK to build a prosperous reunified power and uneasy about their failure to carry out their strategy for world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the conclusion drawn by the DPRK from the threat of war to which it has been exposed for the last several decades that it is hardly possible to build a thriving nation and achieve stable and happy life and national prosperity as long as AA is left intact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people's grudge against the U.S. is mounting high and the patience and self-restraint of the DPRK have gone beyond their limit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat was why the DPRK made an important decision to uproot the root cause of infringing upon national sovereignty, dignity, peace and prosperity and expressed its will to take a decisive military counteraction including the exercise of the right to mount a preemptive precision nuclear attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the south Korean warmongers in collusion with the U.S. frantically step up the moves for a nuclear war against the north in violation of AA, the DPRK declared nullification of all the nonaggression agreements reached between the north and the south such as non use of armed forces against the other side, prevention of accidental military conflicts, peaceful settlement of disputes and the issue of nonaggression boundary line. These are the logical steps taken in line with the nullification of AA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK is fully ready to take potential and toughest counteractions which can force the anti-DPRK forces to experience the most miserable time in their destiny till their surrender."

The U.S. plotted to help the stooge of south Korea, whose fate was at stake for his policy of sycophancy toward the U.S., confrontation with fellow countrymen and unprecedented unpopular rule, prolong his remaining days, tighten a loop around its colony and thus use him as a shock brigade for executing its strategy for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe tricksters of the U.S. and south Korea buckled down to cooking up a shocking incident to build up public opinion over \"insecurity\" of the Korean Peninsula and \"increasing threats from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the sinking incident the south Korean authorities secured an approval for delaying the \"transfer of the right to command wartime operation\" and a \"firm commitment\" to \"provide extended nuclear deterrence\" from the U.S. in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. greatly benefited from the sinking case as evidenced by the opening of market, dispatch of troops overseas and the increased fund for the upkeep of U.S. forces.

            "content": "DPRK Will Wipe Out Aggressors Wherever They Might Be: Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The service personnel and the people of the DPRK warned that it would wipe out the U.S. military bases in south Korea and the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in the Pacific operational theatre if they dare make a slightest war move against the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\tCiting facts that there are a lot of U.S. military bases in south Korea and Japan and on Guam and Hawaii, the paper says the aim sought by the U.S. in concentrating military bases in the Pacific area is to stifle the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. seeks to attain two purposes through the confrontation with the DPRK. One is to continuously stage a war without a gun-report with the DPRK. In other words, it plans to use the military threat, offensive of pressure and policy of vicious blockade based on the hostile policy toward the DPRK. By doing so, it looks to divert public attention away from its serious bankruptcy, throw a wet blanket over the righteous struggle of the world revolutionary people advancing toward independence and progress and force its allies and reactionary forces to stage anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother purpose is to ignite an all-out war against the DPRK. The war between the DPRK and the U.S. is inevitable unless the U.S. drops its ambition to stifle the DPRK. This is the main purpose sought by the U.S. imperialists through the operation of military bases in the Pacific operational theatre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDangerous is that the U.S. attack on the DPRK can spill over into a nuclear war. The U.S. imperialists assert that it is regrettable that they did not use A-bombs during the Korean war. They are now trying to realize their ambition by working out many scenarios of a nuclear war against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists' scenarios of a nuclear war are becoming a reality through various drills for a war against the DPRK. They are watching for a chance to ignite a new Korean war in their bases in the Pacific. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are sadly mistaken if they think they can go scot-free in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula."

Since then Argentina had exercised the legal right to control the islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBritish troops seized the islands about 14,000 km away from the mainland in 1833 by force of arms and killed its natives at random and drove them away by force. Britain had since prevented them from returning and registering as legal residents of the islands while pursuing a national assimilation policy by immigrating British people into the islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen what is the real purpose of Britain to grab the barren islands inhabited by less than 3,000 people at any cost?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs an answer to this question, analysts say that the aim of Britain is to consolidate its rule over the Malvinas and waters off them, protect its interests in territory, navigation, trade routes, air space and increase its military presence in the Antarctic rich in natural resources in a bid to bolster its position in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBritain has insisted on the referendum only, strongly opposed to talks with Argentina over the Malvinas dispute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBritain unilaterally went ahead with the referendum after its proposal to change the wording of UN General Assembly resolution 2065 to include the principle of people's right to self-determination was flatly rejected by the United Nations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tArgentina is strongly reacting against the UK's referendum, terming it meaningless act that carries no international legitimacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Argentine government claimed that the referendum is simply invalid because most of the islands' population is not indigenous but \"transplanted British citizens,\" and therefore cannot be asked to vote on whether they want independence from colonial rule. It declared that it would not stop the struggle to retrieve the islands against the desperate moves of the UK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLatin American countries are extending full support and solidarity to the stance of Argentina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a summit of the Community of Latin American and Caribbean States recently held in Santiago of Chile a joint declaration was adopted to unequivocally support the Argentine dominium over the Malvinas Islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Venezuelan Foreign Ministry in its statement rejected the UK's referendum as a violation of relevant UN resolutions and international law, adding self-determination cannot be claimed in a disputed and colonized territory with a population forcibly implanted representing UK interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn disregard of that fair public opinion, the UK persists in its stance, employing such method where a force prevails, right perishes, being backed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prime minister of the UK said it would always be ready to defend citizens in the remote Falkland Islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. administration said that its position regarding the Falkland Islands, known as the Malvinas to the Argentines, remains unchanged, but acknowledged that the Falklands residents have clearly expressed their preference in a recent referendum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tArgentina is now maintaining its firm stand to retrieve the islands at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut the UK is not to easily give up its ambition and the U.S. is fanning up the dispute by backing the former in view of its strategic interests so that the islands dispute will become more and more acute, predict sources."
