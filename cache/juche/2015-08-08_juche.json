Korea's Projected Ulji Freedom Guardian\r\n Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime are planning to stage again Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drills from August 17.\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities of the U.S. Department of Defense and Department of State and the south Korean puppet Ministry of Defense are now busy officially terming the drills \"transparent and defensive\", \"regular and open\" ones in an effort to play down their criminal nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, they can never conceal the aggressive and reactionary nature of the drills as typical saber-rattling for making a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK and a test nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war rehearsal is a reckless military provocation of war servants to ignite a nuclear war any time by pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As clear to everybody, the war maniacs of the U.S. and south Korea, whenever staging Ulji Freedom Guardian, deployed many ultra-modern nuclear attack means in south Korea and its vicinity to stage provocative drills under the simulated conditions of a preemptive attack and all-out war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Involved in the joint war drills were not only nuclear strike means and other latest war hardware but almost every commanding post of the U.S. units to be hurled into the war actions in contingency in Korea and commanding posts of above regiment level of the south Korean puppet ground, naval and air forces, central and local administrative organs in south Korea and even munitions and civilian enterprises. Consequently, the sky, land and seas of south Korea turned into theaters of north-targeting drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year's Ulji Freedom Guardian is chiefly aimed to help the U.S. forces and the south Korean puppet troops get familiar with procedures of a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces announced that the projected saber-rattling would involve rehearsals for applying the details of the \"tailored deterrent strategy\", a scenario for a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK, to an actual war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"strategy\" is designed to make a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK in case a \"sign of use of nukes by the north\" is detected.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the plan for applying the above-said strategy to an actual war will get pronounced in the projected saber-rattling, it will put peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in other parts of Northeast Asia at greater peril.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK urged the U.S. and the south Korean authorities more than once to stop their joint military drills and opt for bringing about detente and creating a peaceful environment on the peninsula in order to make a decisive turn in the north-south relations this year that marks the 70th anniversary of Korea's liberation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they have challenged the DPRK's offers by staging mad-cap joint military drills, talking about non-existent \"threat from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For instance, they are going to stage a war drill to stifle the DPRK by force of arms through their Red Flag joint air drills in Alaska from Aug. 10 to 21.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a stark reality, the U.S. is working hard to mislead the public opinion by giving impression that the dialogue has not yet opened due to the DPRK in a bid to shift the blame for the abortive dialogue concerning the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As recognized by everybody, it is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, notably, joint military drills for aggression that only tension is escalating on the peninsula in the absence of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is wholly to blame for this tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can it evade its responsibility for having harassed peace and stability on the peninsula and in other parts of the region through its ceaseless joint military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ulji Freedom Guardian will entail tough military counteraction of the army of the DPRK to firmly defend the dignity of the nation and sovereignty of the country."
