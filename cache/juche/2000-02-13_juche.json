Even in Japan the paper is known for representing the views of the ultra right-wing reactionaries and militarist forces of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The smear campaign escalated by the Japanese reactionaries over the \"suspected kidnapping\", whose true nature has already been brought to light, through such reptile media as Sankei Shimbun is intended to spoil the atmosphere for improving the DPRK-Japan relations which has been created with so much effort, bar Japan from properly compensating for the past wrongdoings and put the brake on opening state relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another point at issue regarding the Japanese reactionaries' talk about \"suspected kidnapping\" is the Japanese authorities' attitude of conniving at the anti-DPRK campaign of the reactionary media under the pretext of \"freedom of speech.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese authorities have a true will to improve the DPRK-Japan relations, they should honestly approach the talks with their own views. \r\n\r\n"
