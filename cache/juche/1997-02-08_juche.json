Charter on respecting the sovereignty of nations and refraining from interfering in others' internal affairs. It is also a mockery of and challenge to the nations which are taking the road of independent progress.\r\n   The United States attached political strings of \"aid\" to \"democratic transition\" in Cuba, which is an insult to  peoples who value sovereignty as well as the Cuban people.\r\n   The United States is likely to think that any nation will sell off its sovereignty for dollars.

The statement says:\r\n   A grand photo exhibition opened in Los Angeles on February 1, cosponsored by the Sinhan Minbo newspaper office of ethnic Koreans in the U.S. and the DPRK-U.S. Friendship Council to mark the 55th birthday of the respected General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   On February 3, gangsters of the anti-DPRK organisations in the U.S. such as \"Koreans' society in south California,\" \"society of people from five provinces in north korea\" and \"society of the June 25 war veterans\" raided the exhibition hall in broad daylight, destroyed exhibits and brutally assaulted the sponsors, who were heavily injured and had to be taken to hospital. This heinous political terrorism was committed under the direct command of the South Korean puppet consulate-general in Los Angeles.\r\n   The South Korean Agency for National Security Planning under the control of  Kim Young Sam is behind this barbarous incident, at which the entire nation and world conscience can hardly repress surging indignation and resentment.\r\n   The CPRF takes a serious view of this incident which took place in broad daylight in the united states, which boasts of legal order and civilisation. At the same time, the CPRF bitterly denounces the Kim Young Sam regime, the provoker and mastermind of the criminal incident, in the name of the entire nation.\r\n   It is out of etiquette and patriotism that overseas Koreans opened a photo exhibition with reverence for the great leader of the nation on the occasion of his birthday.\r\n   All the Koreans uphold and follow Secretary Kim Jong Il as the sun of the nation and the lodestar of national reunification like President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   The progressives around the world celebrate the birthday of Secretary Kim Jong Il, praising him as the greatest of great men produced by humankind. In different countries, national preparatory committees have been formed and ceremonies of hanging his portrait, celebration meetings, photo exhibitions, seminars, lectures and other events organised.\r\n   The terrorism in Los Angeles shows the Kim Young Sam group are bereft of national conscience and morality.\r\n   This incident adds to the indelible crimes committed by Kim Young Sam against fellow countrymen at the time of the state funeral three years ago.\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
