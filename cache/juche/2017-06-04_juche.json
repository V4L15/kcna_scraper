            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Slashes at Another UN \"Sanctions Resolution\"\r\n Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement on Sunday as regards the fact that the hostile forces are getting hell-bent on the sinister moves for sanctions and pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hostile forces are now in a flurry, being disconcerted over the gunfire of victory set off by the DPRK's self-defensive industry in numbers and in succession. Pressing this panic button, they are desperate in their vicious attempts to put sanctions and pressure to bear upon against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 3, the United Nations Security Council again framed up \"sanctions resolution\" taking an issue of the DPRK's launch of ballistic rocket which is aimed to bolster up its nuclear forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This \"resolution\", which is said to have been drafted after a long \"consultation\" between the U.S. and China, places entities and individuals related with the DPRK's nuclear and rocket program as a target of \"additional sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the U.S. took its own way of announcing \"unilateral sanctions\" against the DPRK and included in it \"secondary boycott\" with a target of businesses and individuals of even Russia and other third countries which are alleged to have links with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs gives a strong condemnation and rejection to the UNSC's another campaign of sanctions as it is a crafty hostile act with the purpose of putting a curb on the DPRK's buildup of nuclear forces, disarming it and causing economic suffocation to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. steps up its military buildup including the modernization of nuclear weapons just in order to obtain the exclusive and permanent possession of the most sophisticated weapon system in the world. But, other country can't be allowed to test or launch any object which goes with the words of nuclear or \"ballistic\". This is really the height of shameless arrogance, self-righteousness and double standards.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Two countries railroaded \"sanctions resolution\" at the UNSC after having drafted it in the backroom at their own pleasure and are enforcing it upon others just paving it as \"the general will of the international society\". It is a bare expression of high-handed and arbitrary act in pursuit of their own interests trampling upon the international justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The buildup of nuclear forces by the DPRK is all too natural an exercise of its sovereignty to thwart what the U.S. imposed nuclear threat against the DPRK in an unprecedented way. It is also to achieve genuine international justice let alone the fact that it is to ensure peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a fatal miscalculation if the countries, which have had a hand in the frame-up of the \"sanctions resolution\", would even think that they can delay or hold in check the eye-opening development of the DPRK's nuclear forces even for a moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would squarely see that their mean and indiscreet act would go in just opposite direction to what they want for.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They kept saying about \"dialogue\" this time. But, it does not make any sense to profess about dialogue with unjust preconditions attached and by applying \"maximum pressure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what others say, whatever sanctions and pressure may follow, we will not flinch from the road to build up nuclear forces which was chosen to defend the sovereignty of the country and the rights to national existence and will move forward towards the final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Juche Rocket\", ultra precision and diversified, will continue to thunder and skyrocket in full blast in numbers and in succession until the moment when the U.S. and its followers are brought to reason about the root cause and a solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and take their right choices."

Con anterioridad a esto, el pais americano dio a la publicidad una \"sancion independiente\" contra la RPDC incluyendo la \"segunda sancion\" contra las empresas e individuos de Rusia y otros paises relacionados con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCondenamos rotundamente y rechazamos totalmente las tentativas de \"sancion\" que volvieron a escenificar el pais norteamericano y el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU calificandolas del perverso acto hostil encaminado a obstaculizar el fortalecimiento de fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC, desarmarla completamente y asfixiarla en lo economico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDevienen la extrema expresion de la arrogancia, egoismo y doble rasero las insistencias en que ellos mismos pueden hacer el aumento armamentista como la modernizacion de armas nucleares para monopolizar para siempre los sistemas de armas mas perfectos en el mundo y que otro pais no puede realizar todos los ensayos y lanzamientos expresados con las palabras \"nucleares\" y \"balisticas\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y China fabricaron a su capricho el \"proyecto de la resolucion de sanciones\" en una trastienda y lo adoptaron coercitivamente en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU describiendolo como la \"unanime opinion de la sociedad internacional\", lo cual es la expresion flagrante de la coaccion y arbitrariedad que persiguen solamente sus intereses pisoteando la justicia internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una gran equivocacion si los paises inventores de la presente \"resolucion\" piensan en que podrian dilatar o obstaculizar en lo minimo el desarrollo deslumbrante de las fuerzas armadas nucleares de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, ellos refirieron al \"dialogo\". Pero, resulta absurdo hablar de los \"dialogos\" presentando las injustas condiciones premisas y dando la \"presion maxima\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe lanzaran de manera mutifacetica y sucesiva los \"cohetes Juche\" precisos y diversificados al maximo hasta cuando EE.UU. y sus fuerzas seguidoras tomen una opcion justa enterandose de la causa raigal del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y los remedios para su solucion."
