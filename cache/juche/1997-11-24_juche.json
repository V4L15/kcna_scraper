Korean puppets begging for IMF rescue package\r\n  Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet clique decided to introduce emergency loans from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) on November 21 in a bid to emerge from serious economic crisis, a Seoul-based radio said.\r\n   This means that the catastrophic economic crisis leads to the introduction of trusteeship in the south Korean financial domain.\r\n   The decision came because the puppet clique is unable to pay a huge amount of foreign debt.\r\n   Ever since Kim Young Sam's assumption of office foreign debt of south Korea has sharply increased. It was 104,700 million U.S. dollars as of the end of last year and 110,300 million U.S. dollars as of the end of march this year.\r\n   With big businesses going bankrupt one after another or being in the grip of financial crisis and with banks unable to draw in loans, the worst financial crisis is being created in south Korea.\r\n   To make matters worse, the shortage of foreign currency has caused sharp devaluation of the south Korean won against the U.S. dollar, having a catastrophic effect on different economic domains.\r\n   The decision is a product of this financial situation, the radio said.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Prelude to reactionary offensive\r\n Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- The puppet Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) of south Korea fabricated a \"case of a spy couple sent by the north\" on November 20, according to radio reports from south Korea.\r\n   According to \"data\" released by the ANSP on that day after making loud advertisements about this case from the day before, \"resident spies\" and \"suspected persons\" number more than 200 people from all walks of life at home and abroad including famous professors, officials, politicians and pressmen.\r\n   The south Korean puppets, in an attempt to give credibility to the case, presented \"espionage facilities\" as material evidences including rifles, handgrenades, and tactical equipment. Worse still, Japanese press media were used in this case.\r\n   However, the case is a trite false propaganda forged by the agency as it did whenever the south Korean dictatorial regime was in a political crisis.\r\n   As well known, south Korea is now in a great political confusion and total crisis. Its rulers have been driven into a bottomless quagmire by unprecedented dogfights which are going on with the approach of the 15th \"Presidential Election\".\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group have already been sentenced to death politically for the crimes they have committed in five years of office. Needless to say, they will face more miserable fates than their predecessors after they step down. \r\n   This is why they fabricated what they called \"case of spy couple dispatched by the north\" at a secret room of the ANSP in no more than one week.\r\n   It is a trite method of the ANSP to manufacture and publish \"spy cases\" whenever elections are held in south Korea.\r\n   At the time of the 13th puppet Presidential Election, it invented the \"case of explosion of a passenger plane\" to help the traitor Roh Tae Woo, the military dictator, win in the election. And it produced the \"case of the workers' party of south Korea\" for the victory of the Kim Young Sam in the 14th presidential election.\r\n   When it published the \"case of spy couple dispatched by the north\", the ANSP advertised, \"our neighbours have reached a serious phase, sympathy with the north and sentimental arguments about reunification have become prevalent and progressive figures call for the abrogation of the 'National Security Law', the reunification based on confederacy and the withdrawal of the U.S. troops\".\r\n   It went the length of urging the people to zealously help in the investigation into the case, crying that they must not have a view that the ANSP has invented \"cases to create security-oriented political situation around the Presidential Election\".\r\n    This shows that the announcement of the case woven with falsity and forgery, sophism and threats is a prelude to the fascist reactionary offensive to suppress and emasculate the pro-reunification democratic forces with the \"Presidential Election\" in south Korea as an occasion and that the south Korean puppets intend to hold the election by means of violence, fraud and swindle by creating a new \"security-oriented political situation\" in south Korea.\r\n   The south Korean puppets must at once stop the groundless smear campaigns against the DPRK including the \"case of spy couple dispatched by the north\".\r\n   This case will bring nothing to them but their own ruin.\r\n   The ANSP has already been doomed to ruin. -\r\n\r\n"

Sustaining the national character means preserving and developing the good qualities of the nation and embodying them in all spheres of social life.\r\n   The article says:\r\n   Preserving the Juche character and national character is vital to socialism forever.\r\n   Strict adherence to the Juche character and national character in the whole course of socialist construction is a principled requirement for carrying out the socialist cause in keeping with its own nature of independence= it is a most scientific and just principle which entirely conforms to socio-historical conditions for the socialist cause.\r\n   All the fellow countrymen, including the people in the northern half of Korea, fully support the Korean-style socialism and have firm confidence in it.\r\n   In the past great-power chauvinists and opportunists described the DPRK's efforts to preserve the Juche character and national character of the revolution and construction as something contrary to socialism, claiming that they were \"nationalism\" and \"isolationism\". It is the Workers' Party and people of Korea that defend and exalt socialism to the last.\r\n   Invincible is the cause of socialism which is being carried out by the Korean people who have Kim Jong Il as the supreme leader of the party and revolution and move forward, firmly maintaining the principle of Juche and the principle of national independence, stresses the article.    \r\n\r\n"
