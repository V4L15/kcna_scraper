However, this only revealed his political ignorance, economic illiteracy and treacherous and corrupt colors, and invited public criticism.\r\n   Kim Young Sam must not resort to a clumsy trick but step down without delay and stand trial of history, as unanimously demanded by the south Korean people. \r\n   \r\n\r\n"

On the 16th, a ridiculous name of \"Hannara Party\" was invented and it was decided to appoint Ri Hoe Chang as a candidate of the party for \"Presidential Election\". \r\n   This shows that the ruling party has left no stone unturned  to curry favor with people and stay in power.\r\n   The newly-invented name is little different from the original name of the \"NKP\" in the meaning and shape of the name.\r\n   The point at issue is why the ruling \"NKP\" is in a hurry to rename itself.\r\n   It is because the \"NKP\" is rejected and condemned by the press and the people as the private political party of the traitor Kim Young Sam and as a decadent political party.\r\n   It is also because Ri Hoe Chang who declared his breaking with the traitor Kim as \"a sacred war\", reminding people of Kim Young Sam's records of treacheries, his followers and the \"Democratic Party\" which got united in political matrimony with them have harboured grudge against the traitor Kim and seek for a chance to take their revenge,  disillusioned about his arbitrariness, highhandedness and infidelity.\r\n   After the second \"merger of the ruling and opposition parties\" the ruling party is scrambling for \"Presidential Election\" under the slogan of \"liquidation of three Kims\".\r\n    The new group will also meet a miserable end.    \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, it is an issue to be settled between the United States and the DPRK.\r\n   The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework clarifies how the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" should  be settled.\r\n   We have frozen our nuclear facilities, fully cooperated with the IAEA in supervision and allowed IAEA's routine and ad hoc inspection of the unfrozen facilities according to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. We are making a full supply of \"information\". \r\n   The call for the DPRK to totally implement the safeguards accord is an attempt to put a spoke in the wheel of the implementation of the agreed framework and bring the \"nuclear issue\" back to the starting point.\r\n   We bitterly reject the resolution, considering that it came from the heinous aim of some dishonest-minded forces of the United States and the IAEA to isolate and stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
