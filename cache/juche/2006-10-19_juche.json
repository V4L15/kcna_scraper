            "content": "Nuclear Issue on Korean Peninsula, Product of U.S. Policy of Nuclear Threat \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- No progress can be expected in the discussion of overall arms reduction, let alone nuclear disarmament, unless a stop is put to the attempts at the monopoly of nuclear weapons and to nuclear threat based on it, stated the DPRK delegate, addressing a meeting of the First Committee of the 61st Session of the UN General Assembly on Oct. 9.\r\n If global peace and security are to be guaranteed, nuclear disarmament must be carried out before anything else so that nuclear weapons could be totally swept off the face of the earth, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation are inseparably linked with each other and the former is the key point.  Non-proliferation is unthinkable apart from nuclear disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the robber-like theory that only big countries can possess nuclear weapons and threaten and attack small countries with them is connived at or permitted any longer, the international order will undergo a major change essentially and this will drive the non-nuclear states to the possession of a nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, a focal point of the international community, is an offspring of the U.S. policy of nuclear threat based on its deep-rooted hostile policy toward the DPRK for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the reality today that missile launching and nuclear tests are connived at and they are not laid before the United Nations, given U.S. permission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries unilaterally urged the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program, disregarding the cause of the occurrence of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. In this they spoke for the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. This is flattery to the strength of the United States and is not intended for a true and fair solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the final goal of the DPRK and there is not the slightest change in its will to realize it in a peaceful way through dialogue and negotiation, as it is committed in the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will as ever make persevering efforts to remove threat from outside forces and ensure a durable peace on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And after the foundation of the DPRK, he saw to it to rename it as the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and clarified its character, mission and basic duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last six decades, the Red Cross Society of the DPRK has made great achievements in expanding its organizations steadily, improving health and welfare of the people, alleviating misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean people caused by the national division, promoting the friendship, solidarity and cooperation with international communities and defending the world peace in accordance with the fundamental principle and ideal of the Red Cross and Red Crescent movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has developed into a mass organization with a well-arranged organizational system down to every province, city, county (ri) and industrial establishment, and a million and hundreds of thousands of membership. Since its foundation, the society with a lot of curative institutions and health and cultural facilities under it has conducted brisk hygienic propaganda activities among the people to prevent infectious diseases and anti-epidemic work, thus making a great contribution to the work for improving the urgent public health service of the country and promoting health and welfare of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Fatherland Liberation War (1950.6-1953.7), the society carried out with credit the cure of wounded soldiers and patients, the relief activities of war displaced persons and prevention and treatment activities to cope with the bacteriological warfare of the U.S. imperialist invaders. In the post-war period, it fulfilled its duty and mission satisfactorily in various humanitarian activities such as healing war wounds and rendering first-aid service to people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It realized the repatriation of Koreans, who were forcibly taken to Japan before the liberation, on more than 100 batches from 1959 and sent relief goods to the flood victims in south Korea in 1984. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, it has conducted activities to realize the spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration made public in the year of 2000 and creditably solved humanitarian issues on the principle of impartiality. As a result, 63 unconverted long-term prisoners returned to the DPRK in September 2000 and arranged reunion of families and relatives separated into the north and the south on over 10 occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Red Cross Society of the DPRK has also made every effort to develop friendly and cooperative relations with international and national Red Cross organizations and help towards the world peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, unfortunately, priority is given not to the interests of the nation but to the interests of outside forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation demands the south Korean authorities put national interests ahead of the interests of the outsiders and thoroughly implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration under the present grave situation. But the south Korean authorities are actually following the U.S. will and demand for sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK, while paying lip-service to peace. This is, in fact, a treacherous act of leading inter-Korean relations to showdown and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation, strong in the spirit of independence and the sense of justice, can never allow its dignity and interests to be infringed upon and the settlement of the national issue to be delayed. To defend the national dignity and interests precisely means a way to peace and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
