Kim Jong Il's holidays devoted to people\r\n   Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- New revolutionary anecdotes are on everybody's lips in Korea.\r\n   One of them is about  Secretary Kim Jong Il's holidays devoted to the country, the revolution and the people.\r\n   On the first day of this year he visited the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School and enjoyed the holiday with its students, bestowing deep love on them. The following day, he met the youth travelling propaganda team of the Korean People's Army and solved problems arising in its activities.\r\n   On last year's Army Day (April 25) he called at the command of a large combined unit in the western sector of the front to congratulate the servicemen on the holiday. He learned about the unit's combat readiness and spent all the day with them.\r\n   Secretary Kim Kong Il's on-the-spot guidance has continued even on Sundays.\r\n   It was on Sunday morning, November 24, 1996, that he inspected the KPA Panmunjom mission and deeply moved its staff with loving care.\r\n   In December last year alone, he spent the first three Sundays in inspecting the guard Seoul 105 tank division named after Ryu Kyong Su (December 1), Kang Kon General Military Academy entitled Kum Song lifeguard (December 8) and Kim Il Sung Political University entitled Kum Song lifeguard and a new residential quarter built by the workers of the Kangdong Precision Machine Plant (December 15).\r\n   The inspection tour he made last year including red-letter days was as long as some 10,000 kilometres, reaching several dozen units of the KPA.\r\n    Indeed, his holidays during on-the-spot guidance were days of devotion for the country and the people, days of loyalty and filial duty which he devoted to implementing President Kim Il Sung's behests with a strong sense of moral obligation.\r\n   The Korean people, deeply moved by Secretary Kim Jong Il's tireless activities, are talking about the revolutionary anecdote about his holidays devoted to the people. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Illogical argument\r\n   Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are reportedly making desperate efforts to keep up U.S. military bases in Japan, an outcome of the Cold War. They are persistently supporting 100,000 U.S. troops' stationing in the Asia-Pacific region including  Japan, Which is insisted on by the United States, while openly opposing the cutback of U.S. bases in Japan.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries take the \"acute situation of the Korean Peninsula\" as an excuse for their opposition to the reduction of U.S. bases in Japan.  But, this is an unreasonable and foolish argument to cover up their sinister political and military purposes.\r\n   Japan is largely responsible for confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula. \r\n    In actuality, U.S. military bases in Japan are a factor straining the situation of the Korean Peninsula.\r\n    The Japanese reactionaries' opposition to the cutback of U.S. bases in Japan only reveals their ulterior intention to tighten the U.S.-Japan military alliance and stage a comeback to Korea.\r\n   The crimes of American soldiers in Okinawa sparked off strong anti-American sentiments among the Japanese people, who increasingly call for U.S. military bases' dismantlement. They also call for the repeal of the \"Japan-U.S. Security Pact\".\r\n   Upset by it, the Japanese reactionaries are crying over the \"situation of the Korean Peninsula\" in a bid to cool down the people's struggle for cutback of U.S. military bases in Japan, divert elsewhere their attention and  continue to take the adventurous line of building a military power. But this is a silly act.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries  should stop seeking ill-intentioned purposes backed by the U.S. military strategy and lend an ear to the just voice of the people. \r\n\r\n"
