Earlier Bush, Rice and other high-ranking politicians of the U.S. administration raised a hue and cry over the human rights situation in the DPRK.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in a statement on March 13 said that the U.S. has no right to say about someone's human rights as it is the worst human rights abuser and the biggest tundra of human rights.\r\n Noting that the American society is a typical unpopular society where even elementary right of the people to existence is wantonly abused, the statement continued:\r\n The human rights situation in the U.S. has gone from bad to worse since Bush came to power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group illegally occupied Iraq defying the UN, international law and the world public opinion to mercilessly massacre innocent civilians and turn Iraq into a sea of blood caused by a civil war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After attacking Iraq under the pretext of preventing the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\" the U.S. used not only WMD including depleted uranium shells but white phosphorus shells belonging to chemical weapons.\r\n The Bush administration issued a formal instruction for changing the interpretation of the Geneva Convention which strictly restricts the interrogation methods and approving more strict interrogation methods. It openly committed such horrendous atrocities as torturing undressed prisoners in Iraq, Afghanistan and Guantanamo.\r\n The CIA set up and operated even secret prisons in Europe and different countries to harshly maltreat and punish prisoners after working out rules for its overseas prisons with the permission of the administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. claims to be a \"protector of human rights\", raising a hue and cry over the human rights. This is a grave insult to the fair world public opinion. \r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"human rights\" is a blatant interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK by the Bush administration, which, prompted by inveterate bitterness toward it, seeks to achieve a sinister political purpose to isolate and stifle it.\r\n The escalated human rights offensive of the U.S. and hostile forces against the DPRK would only compel it to take every possible measure to defend sovereignty under the uplifted banner of Songun, firmly convinced of truth that human rights precisely mean sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Compiled in the textbook is a great part of the Korean history extremely distorted by reptile historians in the past.\r\n As already known, the Japanese imperialists who illegally occupied Korea in the early 20th century unscrupulously distorted the Korean history in an attempt to justify their colonial domination and obliterate the national spirit of the Korean people.\r\n Typical of the distortion are the reactionary doctrines on \"four vassal regions under the Han Dynasty\" and \"Mimana Miyake\" claiming that Korea had been subjected to other countries historically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wudi, king of the Han Dynasty, that is, ruined Kojoson (ancient Korea) in 108 B.C., built Rakrang region, one of the four tributary regions under the Han Dynasty in the northwestern area of Korea around Pyongyang and \"Mimana Miyake\", a ruling machinery of the \"Yamato Dynasty\" of Japan, governed the area south of the River Han for several hundreds of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such sophism of reptile historians was disputed by the historical circles of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea after Korea's liberation.\r\n It is not on the Korean peninsula but in the Liaodong area that the \"four vassal regions under the Han Dynasty\" were built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the \"History of the Three Kingdoms--Koguryo, Paekje and Silla\", 30,000 soldiers of Koguryo attacked Hyondo region of the Qin Dynasty in the year of 302 and captured and escorted more than 8,000 men to Pyongyang. The Koguryo army also defeated Rakrang region in Liaodong in 313 and 314 and routed even the Hyondo region to the Liaoxi area in 318 to seize the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Mimana Miyake\", which was mentioned only in \"Nihonshoki\" (old records of Japanese history), was not a colonial ruling organ of Japan set up in Kaya area of Korea but a provisional administrative organ of the Yamato State in a Korean lineage small state formed in the Kibi area of west Japan (the area of Okayama Prefecture), before a unified state was formed in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time, however, Japan came out again with the doctrines, the falsity of which has long been brought to light, in an attempt to legalize its past aggression of Korea and its wild ambition to stage a comeback to Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Preposterous is the cry for the �gintegration�h of the world involving politics, economy, ideology and culture today when each country and each nation are shaping their destinies with their own idea, system and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nationalism is a patriotic idea of achieving the prosperity of the nation by its own efforts, opposing dependence on foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are presenting a distorted picture of the realities, claiming that they are bringing economic revival to different countries and nations with what they call \"prescription�h and \"aid\". The \"prescription\" they are advertising is not a \"panacea\" for the rejuvenation of other's national economy and promotion of national reconciliation but a camouflage for covering up their aggressive and depredatory nature. \r\n Everyone should be a true nationalist before being a revolutionary and there is no revolutionary away from his nation.

The basic idea and the hard core of the three charters are the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They indicate the most fair and reasonable way of achieving the reunification of the country at the earliest date possible in conformity with the realistic conditions of Korea in which  differing ideas and systems have existed for a long time in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stipulate that Korea should be reunified in the manner of founding a national reunified state by the formula of federation based on one nation and one state, two systems and two governments, proceeding from the urgent demand of the nation and the realities of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo as the three charters for national reunification, thus opening a broad avenue for the Korean nation to successfully accomplish the cause of national reunification, true to the behests of Kim Il Sung.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Poor Farce of Japanese Ultra-Right Conservatives Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Recently the ultra-right conservatives of Japan called a meeting of the \"special team for the solution to the abduction issue\" at the prime minister's residence, at which they stressed the need to intensify information activities and get \"support from the world\" for the \"settlement of the issue\". They also called for publishing a booklet on the issue in different languages and distributing its copies among other countries. Then they arranged a press conference as regards the above-said meeting.\r\n Commenting on such row kicked up at the tacit connivance of the authorities and under their patronage, newspapers here today term it a despicable and poor charade staged as part of the U.S. anti-DPRK smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To repeat, like a parrot, just what the U.S. claims is an inveterate habit of the Japanese reactionary forces toeing the U.S. line, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\r\n It is the height of folly for Japan to evade its responsibility to redress its crime-woven past by using the \"abduction issue\" as a smoke-screen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the abduction issue is concerned, it is an important matter for which we should take Japan to task. Had Japan felt guilty even in the least of the hideous crimes it committed against humanity in the past, and had an iota of willingness to repent of them, it would not have dared to deny and embellish them. The relations between the DPRK and Japan have not yet improved but deteriorated due to the wrong behavior of Japan persistently evading the settlement of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why Japan is censured as a politically and morally base country. If it persists in its efforts to evade the settlement of the past, it will stand further isolated internationally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should be mindful of this and opt for liquidating its past at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is clear that this year, too, they seek to stand in military confrontation with the north through war exercises.\r\n This is well illustrated by their timing of the joint military exercises with the U.S. By planning to stage this saber rattling at a time when the 18th north-south ministerial talks were in the offing they glaringly revealed that they want neither dialogue nor reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should behave with discretion, pondering over the grave consequences to be entailed by their involvement in the U.S. moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Joint Military Exercises\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean People's Army side makes it clear once again that it will never remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. preemptive attack on the DPRK. \r\n A spokesman for the KPA Panmunjom Mission warned this in a statement issued on Tuesday to denounce the U.S. plan to stage large-scale RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises involving huge U.S. and south Korean troops throughout south Korea from Mar. 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side is of the view that a preemptive attack is not monopoly of the U.S. and the DPRK, too, has the right to preempt an attack as the most effective and positive act for self-defence in the light of the hard reality that the DPRK and the U.S. sides are still technically at war. It has already notified the UN of this stand.\r\n The U.S. redeployed its troops in and around the Korean Peninsula according to its new scenario for a war of aggression and perfected the operational plans through actual maneuvers. It has even \"local eyewitnesses\" who are ready to actively support and defend it in case it launches a war of aggression against the DPRK.\r\n We can not but take a serious note of the fact that the projected saber-rattling is timed to coincide with the racket the U.S. has kicked up to isolate and stifle the DPRK after spreading sheer lies about \"counterfeit notes\", \"drug smuggling\" and \"human rights abuse\" along with the fiction about the \"proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\" which it cited as a pretext for launching brigandish armed invasion of other countries. This behavior of the U.S. is a flagrant violation of the joint statement adopted at the six-party talks which stipulated that both sides shall solve issues on the principle of mutual respect and peaceful co-existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that the RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" to be staged involving huge troops and latest war means at a time when the distrust and confrontation between the DPRK and the U.S. are growing acute would not go over to an actual war.\r\n We are greatly enraged by the south Korean military authorities' decision to participate in the U.S-led exercises for a war of aggression against their fellow countrymen in gross breach of the June 15 spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA will follow with a high degree of vigilance the grave situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula due to the projected war maneuvers and keep itself fully ready to go into action to cope with any event on its own initiative.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
