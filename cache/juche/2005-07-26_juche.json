            "content": "GIs' Massacre of Civilians in Rogun-ri under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- The North Side's Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Massacres on July 24 issued an indictment laying bare the monstrous massacre of civilians committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Rogun-ri, Yongdong County, North Chungchong Province of south Korea during the Korean war.\r\n The U.S. killing of civilians in Rogun-ri has been further probed by new findings and confirmed by testimonies made by former U.S. soldiers involved in the crimes and witnesses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the indictment, the Seventh Regiment of the U.S. First Armored Division reached the area of Jugok-ri, Yongdong County, North Chungchong Province on its way of fleeing from Taejon on the evening of July 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces told civilians of the nearby village to gather with a promise to take them to a safe place. They brought together even refugees from different places including Rimgye-ri and took them away to Rogun-ri along the Seoul-Pusan railways next morning. Then they searched the civilians after forcing them to form short ranks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the inhabitants gathered along the railways at about the noon of July 26, a U.S. communication man had a wireless contact with some unit. Shortly afterwards a reconnaissance plane appeared and circled in the sky above their heads several times before flying back. No sooner had this happened than two U.S. fighters flew there to bomb and strafe the civilians.  In a twinkling at least 100 dead bodies were littered about the railways and their surroundings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Survivors ran helter-skelter into two railway tunnels. U.S. soldiers machine-gunned at those who took refuge there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Killings lasted for four consecutive days till the morning of July 29. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist murderers entered the tunnels under the pretext of \"treating the wounded.\" After confirming the number of survivors they again fired machine-guns at them. At least 400 of those civilians met tragic deaths after being allured into the trap by the beast-like U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment cited facts to disclose that the U.S. imperialists' mass killings in Rogun-ri were an organized and premeditated crime committed against civilians in wanton violation of the publicly recognized international law and war laws and regulations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to even the initially compiled data, they killed at least 1.24 million peaceable inhabitants in south Korea alone during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people who value the dignity and sovereignty like their life and soul will never allow the U.S. imperialists to exterminate the Korean nation through reinvasion and nuclear disasters but force them to pay for all their crimes at any cost, the indictment warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The North Side's Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Massacres in the indictment expressed the expectation that the world progressives who value justice, truth, peace and human rights would voice stronger solidarity with the south Korean people in their sacred anti-U.S. struggle and all the Koreans in their just struggle for peace and reunification of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As clearly proved by the recent disclosure of the fact Japan has neither qualification and face nor any justification to say anything about the above-said issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will certainly force the Japanese reactionaries to pay a dear price for this double crime.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
