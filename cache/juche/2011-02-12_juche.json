Korea Denounced for Sticking to Their Policy of Confrontation \r\n Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The preliminary talks for the opening of the north-south high-level military talks clearly showed the intention of the south Korean authorities to stick to their policy of confrontation with the DPRK, opposed to inter-Korean dialogue and negotiations and the improvement of the north-south relations. Major newspapers Saturday observe this in their bylined commentaries. \n\t\t\t\t\t The south side behaved very crudely, betraying its sinister intention to scuttle the north-south talks at any cost far from showing any stance to open them, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities were not ready to hold dialogue with the north from the outset. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They only tried to use the talks as a platform for imputing responsibility for the warship \"Cheonan\" sinking incident and the Yonphyong Island shelling to the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the preliminary talks they tried hard to justify their unreasonable demand, talking about \"the sentiment of the people\". This was preposterous, indeed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It admits of no argument that the south side came out to the conference room not to improve the north-south relations through dialogue but to cover up its true colors as confrontation maniacs and mislead public opinion at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The developments go to prove that it is impossible to improve the north-south relations and the situation on the Korean Peninsula will lead to a more dangerous phase unless the south Korean authorities give up their attitude of denying dialogue and seeking confrontation as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says that the attempt of the south Korean authorities to shift the responsibility for the collapse of the talks onto the other is to escape the domestic and foreign public criticism of them and further bedevil the north-south relations and thus escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen in collusion with outside forces."

This helps foil foreign aggression and war moves, protect the destiny and security of the nation and achieve durable peace and peaceful reunification of the country with invincible arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun, a major newspaper of the DPRK, Saturday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is thanks to the invincible Songun politics in the DPRK that a war has been averted on the Korean Peninsula and provokers failed to launch aggression over the last more than six decades, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans' desire and wishes to achieve independent reunification and peace and prosperity can come true only thanks to the Songun politics being praised as a patriotic one and demonstrating its might as a reliable shield for protecting the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sovereign right of the nation can never be protected by mere talking or appeal as long as aggression forces are allowed to seek world supremacy. Sovereignty which keeps the nation alive and the safety and happiness of Koreans would be unthinkable without the Songun politics in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has displayed its invincible might as a great banner for national reunification and prosperity in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic June 15 joint declaration and October 4 declaration were adopted to imbue all the Koreans with hope for reunification and shake the world and dynamic actions are now under way to achieve national reconciliation, unity and independent reunification. This reality today would be unimaginable without the great Songun politics which reliably protects peace on the Korean Peninsula and creates an environment favorable for independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun politics is symbolic of dignity and pride of the Korean nation as it ushered in a shining era of independent reunification in the history of the Korean nation and provides a sure guarantee for its triumphant advance."
