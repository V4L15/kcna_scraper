This brutal action left at least 5,000 innocent people dead and over 14,000 wounded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This monstrous massacre was wire-pulled by the U.S. imperialists occupying south Korea and holding the prerogative of supreme command over the south Korean forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heroic popular uprising ended in a tragic failure but the south Koreans should never forget the monstrous massacre committed to suppress the uprising and its failure.

Japan, however, categorically refuses it, claming that it was already made in package solution. Paying no heed to the victims and their families, it is trying to soothe them with a negligible amount of money out of \"civilian fund.\" It is even turning down the compensation claims of a few survivors among those drafted and forced to serve the imperial Japanese army as \"comfort women.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While remaining quite insincere in reflecting on and settling the past, Japan is showing extra zeal in the revival of militarism, distortion of history and territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll in all, Germany is admitted as a legitimate member of the international community by establishing official state relations with all countries through an honest settlement of the past. But Japan, quite contrary, finds itself a target of hatred and curse in Asia for its negation and distortion of the past history and persistent evasion of its settlement and still has the stain of an enemy state on its name. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave itself properly, clearly seeing how the world views it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He added rearing the children well made it possible to strengthen the country and achieve its prosperity. And he chose the site of the palace on Jangdae Hill in the heart of Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The palace, which was under construction, was razed to the ground by the indiscriminate bombings of the U.S. imperialists during the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In July 1953 when discussing the issue of rehabilitating and constructing Pyongyang, the President designated the construction of the palace as one of the main objects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saw to it that a modern palace with a floor space of 50,000 square meters, nearly 11 times that of the original one was constructed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave field guidance to the construction site on several occasions, with the result that the construction of the palace was completed as a comprehensive center for extracurricular education for schoolchildren in September 1963. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today there are more than 160 palaces and halls for schoolchildren including the Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace, the February 16 Schoolchildren's Palace and the Kaesong Schoolchildren's Palace throughout the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Organized crimes and various forms of abduction have forced great many foreigners to fall victims to American-imposed slave labor and sexual harassment. This is the real picture of the American society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is cursed and censured worldwide as the kingpin of man-hunting and flesh traffic from the historical and contemporary viewpoints. Yet, the U.S. does not feel ashamed of behaving as if it were a human rights judge. How ridiculous it is! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite out of logic for such country to speak critical of other countries over human traffic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system in the DPRK is a genuine popular system whereby its people are granted all political rights and freedom by law and everything is made to serve them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everyone is given a job according to his or her ability and wish and women receive preferential social treatment in the DPRK, a society based on man-centered Juche idea.\r\n The nature of Korean-style socialism does not allow such social vice as human traffic.\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. again pulled up the DPRK over its non-existent human traffic issue. This only indicates that the U.S. administration has gone to a reckless phase in its moves to damage the legitimate authority of the DPRK government over the flesh traffic issue plus the nuclear issue and put its intention to blockade the DPRK into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disputes in different parts of the world have produced many refugees and it is plagued with a full dimension of crimes and social vices including flesh traffic. This is a product of the war policy pursued by the U.S. against humanity to achieve its ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. intelligence institutions have persisted in their sinister operations to abduct DPRK citizens on its border areas and take them to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts suffice to prove that the human traffic much touted by the U.S. is not the problem of any other country but its own problem and that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for the crude violation of the independent rights of the popular masses and the worldwide disaster, misfortune and social vices.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
