Accordingly, they should have already been dismantled completely together with nuclear weapons.\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. is openly clamouring about the \" maintenance of the efficiency of H-bombs.\"  This eloquently proves that \" nuclear non-proliferation\"      on the U.S. lips is nothing but hypocrisy and that the U.S. is the very country responsible for nuclear proliferation.\r\n   The U.S., vociferating about \" nuclear non-proliferation\"  ,has wantonly interfered in the internal affairs of other nations as if it were an international inspector.\r\n   It is still loudly advertising the \"suspected underground nuclear site\" in the DPRK. Worse still, it is persistently urging the DPRK to accept cursed \" inspections\"      of the site.\r\n   The U.S. behaviour is the height of shamelessness.\r\n   In the final analysis, \" nuclear non-proliferation\" and \"inspections\"      clamoured about by the U.S. are no more than a trick to smell out the inside of others and disarm them.\r\n   The United States must stop the production of nuclear materials at once before advertising \" nuclear non-proliferation.\"           \r\n \r\n  \r\n"
