But why is the U.S infiltrating strategic reconnaissance and other planes into the airspace of the DPRK so frequently and beclouding the blue sky above the inviolable Korean peninsula by flying aircraft for strategic nuclear strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Does the U.S. have neither face nor qualification to talk about someone's \"violation of the AA\" though it is creating extreme tensions through ceaseless military build-up and war maneuvers for aggression while systematically destroying, breaching and violating the AA after occupying other country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are well aware that all the U.S. actions are aimed at securing \"plausible pretexts\" for justifying the huge armed buildup needed for laying a siege to Eurasia and its permanent presence in south Korea as its outpost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We clarify once again, the story about the \"north's involvement\" in the \"drone case\" is nothing but  a \"charade\" against the DPRK from A to Z, a replica of the Cheonan warship sinking case co-orchestrated by the U.S. and the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The truth has already been brought to light and those who faked up the \"charade\" will be sternly judged by history and the people anytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop such foolish act of patronizing for no reason the racket for confrontation against fellow countrymen kicked off by the poor colonial servant and come to its senses."

Transfer of the right to military command to other country is a strike to a sovereign state's authority, but the south Korean \"government\" wants the U.S. forces to stay in south Korea and maintain the control over its army.

On the contrary, big powers in the Asia-Pacific region are making rapid progress in politics, economy and military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such development is not in line with the U.S. strategic purpose to maintain its position as \"the world's only super power.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feeling uneasy about it, the U.S. is working hard to knock into shape \"NATO of Asian version\" in order to militarily contain the potential rivals in the region and hold supremacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While stepping up its moves to form the triangular military alliance, pursuant to its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific, Washington is working hard to develop the alliance into \"NATO of Asian version\" involving Australia and other countries in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is busy with diplomacy with those countries outside the triangular military alliance to bring them into \"NATO of Asian version\" and frantically stepping up the moves to tighten the U.S.-Japan-Australia and the U.S.-south Korea-Australia military alliances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that such moves of the U.S. for hegemony will spark off arms race, confrontation and military conflict in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is required to heighten vigilance against such scenario of the U.S."
