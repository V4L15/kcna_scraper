            "content": "Park Geun Hye Group's Moves to Seek Way out of Crisis in Provocations against DPRK Blasted\r\nPyongyang, November 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Disarmament and Peace Institute of the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Thursday in connection with the fact that traitor Park Geun Hye is trying hard to seek a way out of the worst crisis in provocations against the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park has been thrown into an inescapable predicament following the outbreak of \"Park Geun Hye, Choe Sun Sil scandal\", the hideous power-backed scandal unprecedented in history, and the detailed disclosure of the truth behind it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mass struggle of the enraged south Korean people is mounting as the days go by and Park is standing at the crossroads of whether to quit power of her own accord or face impeachment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that Park is trying hard to seek a way out of the current crisis in political and military provocations against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the trite method employed by the south Korean puppet forces to divert elsewhere the attention of the world public through confrontation and war racket against the DPRK whenever they faced a catastrophic phase caused by their unpopular and traitorous rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example was the tragicomedy that followed the ferry Sewol disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Sewol was sinking in April 2014 and hundreds of drowning pupils were crying for help in cold sea water, Park was spending time together with the ex-husband of Choe Sun Sil for seven hours. This is an open secret.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thrown into the unprecedented crisis by the waves of fierce movement for \"impeachment of Park Geun Hye\" sweeping across south Korea, she hurled military warmongers into recklessly opening fire at naval warships of the DPRK side on their routine guard duty in the waters along the extension of the military demarcation line in the West Sea of Korea and even went so hysterical as to call latrine door its drone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with the recent worst crisis facing Park, the puppet forces staged all forms of joint military exercises while vociferating about \"provocation from north Korea\" at confabs held with their U.S. master every day. They are also busy introducing U.S. strategic nuclear submarines equipped with nuclear warhead missiles. This is by no means accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was disclosed recently, Park, believing in the \"collapse\" timetable crafted by a green shaman in a back parlor, senselessly resorted to extreme confrontation moves against the DPRK such as total suspension of the north-south relations only to be forsaken by everybody. Under such situation no one can vouch that she would not take another reckless action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK keep tabs on all the crimes committed by the Park group which has done wrongs only against the DPRK since its seizure of power. They are fully determined to make a thousand-fold revenge on Park if she dares provoke the DPRK in order to survive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever chimes in with the Park group, failing to discern its last resort made while rushing headlong into ruin, will only face shame and disgrace."
