He handed over to President Kim Il Sung, his son, the two pistols as revolutionary heritage together with the ideas of \"Aim High\", preparedness for three contingencies--death from hunger, beating and cold and need to obtain comrades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon receiving the two pistols, the President conceived the great Songun idea to save the fellow countrymen from the depth of misery and organized the matchless anti-Japanese armed units and liberated the country by routing the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolutionary armed forces which find their origin in the two pistols sent U.S. imperialism which had boasted of its being \"the strongest\" in the world to the lot of a sun setting in the western sky under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung in the 1950s and defended the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation with honor by shattering the malicious challenges of the enemies in all the decades of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cherishing the philosophical principle that the two pistols, the revolutionary heritage of Kim Hyong Jik, are precious assets of the Songun revolution, the Korean people are faithfully upholding the Songun leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
