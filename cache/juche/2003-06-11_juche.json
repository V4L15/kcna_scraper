They went to the lengths of raising the issue of expelling the DPRK Ambassador. \r\nThey are seriously hurting the dignity of the DPRK while floating misinformation that the North Korean authorities may be involved in the drug smuggling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a ridiculous act of joining the United States in its moves to build up a \"united front\" against the DPRK in a bid to tarnish its image on the international arena and isolate and stifle it and a deliberate provocation intended to bedevil the normal relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are stunned by the false propaganda launched by Australian media although objectivity and impartiality should be the basic ethics of the press. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK makes it clear once again that its government strictly bans drug misuse and smuggling and has nothing to do with the recent case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had already notified the Australian side that the ship \"Pongsu\" is a non-governmental trading ship and the ship owner side did not know about the case at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, no sooner had the case occurred than Australian media took issue with the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government, groundlessly linking them with the case before the truth behind it is probed. This proves that the case is not merely a drug matter but a premeditated and intentional political intrigue to hurt and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a revelation of the mean plot to internationalize the drug issue and slander the DPRK by taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy towards it, the policy aimed to isolate and suffocate it by demanding it drop its nuclear weapon program first and putting international pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever an opportunity presents itself, the U.S. cites a nuclear issue and drug matter for launching an anti-DPRK smear campaign and misleading the world opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts indicate that the ship \"Pongsu\" case is a product of the political intrigues of the U.S. and some undesirable forces in Australia to invent a pretext to impair the authority of the DPRK and attack it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow how the case will be handled and never allow any attempt to use the case for hurting its authority and dignity.    \r\n\r\n"

Moreover, it needs not to have its political system and economic system guaranteed by someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has built up economy on its own and exerted strenuous efforts to stabilize the people's living despite the ceaseless blockade on the part of the hostile forces including the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It issued cabinet resolutions 32, 128 and 129 through which it increased the living allowances of working people as part of its measure to improve the standard of people's living. It also promoted several economic reforms and has positively encouraged joint ventures with foreign countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year, in particular, it took an important measure of refiting the prices of all commodities and raising living allowances and conducting economic management according to the step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year it adopted a law on accounting and developed farmers' markets into markets selling varieties of consumer goods and took several other practical measures that can be implemented by the efforts of our people to drastically boost economy and improve the standard of people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Markets found in different parts of the country are selling and buying not only agricultural products but industrial goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK wishes to receive as much cooperation as possible from other countries including expert training and experience as it is the first time for it to run such markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a fact, the U.S. is terming the DPRK a \"rogue state\", talking about its non-existent \"terrorism,\" \"drug trafficking\", \"abduction\" and \"counterfeiting of money\". This can not be construed otherwise than a challenge to the just measures of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to stop maligning the DPRK and mind its own business to improve its deplorable position as a rogue state engaged in all sorts of illegal acts such as terrorism and drug trafficking.    \r\n\r\n"

This direct settlement could be made only two years after the DPRK-Japan trade was approved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government did not allow the Japanese exporters engaged in the DPRK-Japan trade to use export bank loans. It did not lift the ban on DPRK traders and technicians' visits to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has consistently applied high rate customs to export goods from the DPRK, part of its economic blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While applying \"preferential tariff\" to other developing countries, Japan is not doing so to the DPRK but imposing the most unfavorable \"state tariff\" upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan took the lead in the \"collective sanctions\" against the DPRK as a shock brigade executing the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK in the 1990s. Worse still, it wooed international organizations to intensify economic blockade against the DPRK, peddling the \"nuclear suspicion\" of the DPRK among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has gained nothing from its economic sanctions against the DPRK. This only heightened the Korean people's revolutionary awareness.    \r\n\r\n"

There they discussed provocative measures concerning the call of Mangyongbong-92 at a Japanese port such as strict inspection and impounding of the ship on the strength of all laws now in force.\r\n This unreasonable and reckless racket has created an extremely disturbing development. Mangyongbong-92 is now barred from entering a Japanese port and Koreans in Japan are prevented from visiting their homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today dismisses this tyrannical move as a serious infringement upon the dignity of the DPRK and a vicious political provocation and inhuman act against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has so far stood for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. But it made a u turn in its attitude toward the settlement of the nuclear issue after having talks with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' recent step to prohibit Mangyongbong-92 from entering a port is a direct product of such attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this is part of \"sanctions\" against the DPRK we can not but regard it as very serious development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified that it would regard any \"sanctions\" as a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' move is a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which Japan committed itself to improve relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are well advised to behave with discretion, clearly understanding the Koreans' hostility toward Japan, rectify their anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and Chongryon and immediately stop their political operation against Mangyongbong-92.    \r\n\r\n"

We are compelled to do everything possible to counter the U.S. preemptive attack.
