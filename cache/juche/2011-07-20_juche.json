Korea under Fire \r\nPyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- It is a grave military provocation that the U.S. recently brought its nuclear submarine Texas belonging to the U.S. 7th Fleet carrying latest hardware including Tomahawk missiles to Pusan Port of south Korea, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a bylined commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t This reveals the criminal scenario of the U.S. warmongers to ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost, the paper says, adding: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind its entry into the south Korean port is the strategic scenario of the U.S. imperialists to browbeat the DPRK by force of arms and flexibly cope with the \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits particular attention is that the submarine made this portcall, timed to coincide with the provocative anti-DPRK remarks made by Walter Sharp, the then commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea, shortly ago. Sharp blustered it was necessary to promptly cope with additional provocation by north Korea and the U.S. and south Korea maintain strong alliance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable policy of the U.S. imperialists to retain its grip on south Korea, its only colonial military base in Asia, and use it as a forefront base for carrying out its strategy of aggression on the DPRK and the rest of Asia and a stronghold of military and strategic importance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. conceal or justify the sinister intention of the U.S. imperialists to perpetuate their military presence in south Korea and ignite another Korean war at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will have nothing to gain from its moves to escalate confrontation and start a war against the DPRK. The U.S. would be well advised to clearly understand the revolutionary will and mental power of the army and people of the DPRK, give up its scenario to ignite a new war and pull its troops out of south Korea as early as possible."

Countries in the region have favorable conditions for economic cooperation and exchange. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The northeast area of China has fertile farmland and mountainous areas including high mountain range linked with Mt. Paektu of Korea. It produces tens of millions of tons of grain annually. It is the world's leading producer of bean. This region abounds in timber of great economic value and has hundreds of species of medical plants. It is rich in underground resources and has more than a hundred kinds of metal ores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Fareast region of Russia close to Rason City borders on northeast part of Mongolia and faces China with Amur River (Heilongjiang) and Ussuri River in between.

Ports in the Fareast region of Russia are said to remain frozen in winter. That is why the Rason area can be a favorable transport hub. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The area will be a friendly economic and trade zone conducive to economic development, traffic and transport and welfare of the peoples of the two countries of DPRK and China.

En esta region hay el bosque maderero de gran valor economico, las plantas medicinales de cientos de generos y los recursos naturales incluyendo recursos de mineral metalico de mas de cien generos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La zona del Lejano Oriente de Rusia colindada con la ciudad de Rason tiene la frontera con la zona del nordeste de Mongolia y con China a intervalos del rio Amur (Heilongjiang) y el Ussuri.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　En esta zona montanosa son abundantes los recursos de bosque, petroleo, gas natural, estano, plomo, zinc, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　La zona economica y comercial de Rason esta situada en la posicion geografica mas favorable a  unir 3 provincias del Nordeste de China, el Lejano Oriente de Rusia y Mongolia, zonas prometedoras de desarrollo economico y comercial.
