Korean Military Warmongers Urged to Halt Psywar against DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- The anti-DPRK psychological warfare of the south Korean military warmongers has gone into extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet military warmongers are mulling bringing wicked conservative organizations to Paekryong Island on March 25 and 26 in a bid to let balloons containing hundreds of thousands of anti- DPRK leaflets, USBs on which corrupt animation files are recorded and foul one dollar notes, etc. to fly into the areas of the north side.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They attempted to scatter leaflets from the Rimjin Pavilion with conservative non-governmental organizations involved early this month, too, only to be compelled to cancel their reckless plan in face of strong protest of progressive personages and inhabitants there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are persistently getting frantic in scattering leaflets, even shifting the theatre for this operation in defiance of the north side's repeated warnings. This amounts to an official declaration that they remain unchanged in their policy of confrontation with the DPRK and are set to stand in showdown with it to the last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, the commander of forces of the Korean People's Army in the Western sector of the front, gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Wednesday: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA has already clarified its stand to blow up through sighting firings the bases for the anti-DPRK psychological warfare including the spots from which leaflets are scattered. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was because a psychological warfare precisely means a war action from a military viewpoint. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the puppet military warmongers are making persistent attempts to bring the above-said organizations to front areas to scatter leaflets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA always keeps itself fully ready to make sighting firing and blow up those bases for the anti-DPRK psychological warfare not only in the Western sector of the front but in all areas along the front in order to cope with the puppet forces' madcap psychological warfare and go into action any time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet military warmongers do not want to draw the same lesson as taught by the Yonphyong Island shelling, they should immediately stop all the psychological warfares including the leaflet-scattering operations and behave with discretion."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Policy of Confrontation with DPRK Rebuffed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, south Korean Minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek talked nonsense that it has pursued a \"principled policy toward the north\" based on \"no-nuke, opening and 3 000 dollars\" for the past three years and this \"will be a landmark turning point in unification\" in the future. Later, he blustered that the ministry is \"working hard for dialogue, cooperation, peace and unification\", claiming that there can be no other discussion as someone's \"denuclearization and opening\" are the \"core tasks for peace\" and a \"main target of the policy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a bylined article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said reckless remarks prove that the south Korean authorities are making desperate efforts to justify, preserve and implement at any cost their \"policy toward the north\" which brought the inter-Korean relations to collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said policy can never be justified under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an out-and-out theory aimed at carrying out the U.S. sinister scenario to do harm to the fellow countrymen under the pretext of the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula is not one between the north and the south but one between the DPRK and the U.S. as it was spawned by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities' \"policy towards the north\" is designed to realize their ambition for achieving \"unification under liberal democracy\" in total denial of the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, great programmes for the development of inter-Korean relations and national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a dangerous policy escalating the tensions on the peninsula and bringing the danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are so foolish to work hard to carry out the already bankrupt policy."

            "content": "ATCC comenta ambicion agresiva de EE.UU. y Sur de Corea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 23 de marzo (ATCC) -- Se tornan cada dia mas abiertas las maniobras del Sur de Corea para armar el ejercito titere con los armamentos norteamericanos. \n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el producto inevitable de la coincidencia de la ambicion de agresion de EE.UU., que intenta provocar la segunda guerra coreana, y de la banda traidora surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun el informe publicado el 14 de marzo por el Instituto Internacional de la Paz en Estocolmo, las armas de fabricacion norteamericana ocuparon el 71 por ciento de los armamentos importados por el Sur de Corea desde 2006 hasta 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Este ano tambien las autoridades militares del Sur de Corea volvieron a emplazar en sus fuerzas aereas los aviones de combate \"F-15K\" con mil 800 km de radio operacional, con los que suman decenas los cazas del mismo tipo. Y en julio introduciran \"Boeing E-737\", aparato conocido como \"comando del cielo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Tales maniobras devienen intolerable provocacion militar contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y acto criminal que lleva la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al borde de la guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo mas grave del caso es que la importacion de armas norteamericanas por parte del Sur de Corea coincide con las provocaciones a la RPDC que se cometen bajo el pretexto de la \"situacion emergente\" de esta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. pretende utilizar el ejercito titere surcoreano como brigada de choque de la provocacion de la nueva guerra, al armarlo completamente al estilo norteamericano desde la ideologia y el espiritu hasta los armamentos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En tanto, las autoridades militares surcoreanas tratan de tomar la \"supremacia militar\" sobre la RPDC mediante la ubicacion de los equipos y materiales ultramodernos de guerra nuclear y los armamentos de ataque aereo a precision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, no pueden ser toleradas nunca estas graves provocaciones politicas y militares que amenazan la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y el resto de la region de Asia-Pacifico y agrandan el peligro de nueva guerra."
