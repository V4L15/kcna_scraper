Lurking behind this is his intention to fan up the vanity of old lunatic Trump and keep the situation tense and thus fish in troubled waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, Japan wishes for the tension on the Korean peninsula more than others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Abe group which regards the escalation of tension on the peninsula as an excellent pretext for the constitutional revision and for pushing forward its plan for becoming a military giant is fully supporting the crazy strategy of Trump for increasing the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe who used to be lucky to tide over ruling crisis with the \"threat to security\" by the DPRK as a pretext, is now going in high spirits and openly fanning up his master's racket for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With Trump's visit as an occasion, he loudly trumpeted about \"serious threat to international community as a whole\" and \"maximum pressure\". This was prompted by his sordid intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable ambition of the island men to launch continental aggression with the backing of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is worth taking note of the statement of a former Japanese diplomat that \"it is only Trump out of the leaders of various countries in the present world who talk about threat by force at the UN general Assembly and it is only Abe out of the leaders of various countries who pursues Trump. How despicable the talks between the two persons are\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington Post on Nov. 6 commented that Trump and Abe have taken the same stand out of their common hostility toward the DPRK but their relationship is the strategic master-slave one and the attitude of Trump treating Abe is the one of treating his assistant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"majestic and powerful diplomacy\" touted by Abe is, in the long run, nothing but diplomacy submitting to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such diplomacy will not help \"defend the lives and a peaceful life of Japanese\" but will cause misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should mind that it will face a miserable end should it go reckless relying on the U.S. which is no more than a paper tiger."
