It was the fundamental policy and basic mode of the Japanese imperialists' rule of Korea to kill as many Koreans as possible, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not a single day has passed without Koreans' shedding blood during Japan's 40-odd-year long occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists cruelly killed Koreans everywhere they went. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They announced the \"three-point policy\" calling for killing all Korans, setting fire on everything and looting everything and killed Koreans indiscriminately in a bid to exterminate the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Kanto quake of 1923 the Japanese imperialists set in motion police and vigilante corps in an organized manner and ruthlessly massacred more than 23,000 innocent Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They forcibly walked away or drafted at least 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans and forced them into slave labor, abducted, kidnapped or forcibly walked away 200,000 Korean women to reduce them into sexual slaves for the \"Imperial Japanese Army\" in a madcap attempt to totally exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to their monstrous barbarity more than one million Koreans met cruel death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's massacre of Koreans was a crime against humanity in gross violation of the universally recognized international law and wartime law and regulations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crime can neither be erased nor lessened with the lapse of time and the statute of limitations cannot be applied to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people keep tabs on the past crimes of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will certainly force Japan to pay dearly for them.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This is a despicable pro-American sycophantic act and a vicious challenge to the aspiration of the south Korean people to decisively break with the principal criminals of aggression, the spokesman said, and went on:\r\n Walker was a heinous murderer, war maniac and special-class war criminal who brutally killed millions of Koreans during the Korean war.\r\n Nevertheless, the pro-American conservative forces including the Grand National Party are running amuck to erect the statue of Walker, turning their back on the grievance of all the fellow countrymen. This is aimed to revive the departed soul of a ringleader of the aggression troops to turn this land into a slaughter-place of Yankees and it is an anti-national move to unleash the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the pro-American conservative forces may try in south Korea, they cannot arrest the vigorous trend of the June 15 era toward national reconciliation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in south Korea should shatter the moves of the pro-American sycophantic traitors and bring the aggressors and murderers to justice instead of erecting the statue of Walker, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, and turn out in an undaunted struggle to destroy their ugly plastics, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Korean Pro-American Ultra-right Conservative Forces' Anti-North Smear Campaign Flailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 17 (KCNA) -- The smear campaign on the \"human rights issue in the north\" conducted by the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces at the instigation of the United States is a part of the war moves against the north and, accordingly, the anti-communist fanatics including the \"Grand National Party\" cannot evade their responsibility as the principal criminal of igniting a war.\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said this in an answer to a question put by KCNA on Friday in connection with the fact that the south Korean pro-American elements including the GNP recently held an \"international meeting on the human rights issue in the north\" in Seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The current anti-north smear campaign conducted by the south Korean pro-American ultra-right conservative forces including the GNP at the expense of the U.S. government budget is no more than a funeral of the living dead who have a long innings, denounced and forsaken in south Korea.\r\n As to the human rights issue, it rests with the U.S. and the south Korean pro-American conservative forces including the GNP.\r\n The GNP, a group of the remnants of the fascist dictatorship and their descendants, is now dead set against the abolition of the \"National Security Law\" and other anti-human rights fascist evil laws. It is so brazen-faced to run amuck to restore the old system under which its predecessors wielded the club of fascism against the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, it is ridiculous that those who keep mum about the human rights abuses of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops who did physical and mental harm to the south Korean people for 60 years of their occupation of south Korea are foolishly talking about the \"human rights issue in the north\".\r\n The U.S. has long resorted to shameless smear campaigns over the \"human rights issue\" before invading other countries and nations.\r\n The provokers and fanatics of confrontation will get nothing but disgrace and death.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
