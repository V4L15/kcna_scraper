            "content": "KCNA Warns Militarist Japan of Its War Hysteria\r\nPyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- The preservation of peace and stability in Northeast Asia has become a main concern of the international community. Quite contrary to this, military moves have gained in scope and strength in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is persistently calling for the reexamination of the \"three principles of arms export\" which it has advocated under the signboard of \"building a pacifist state\" since the 1960s while contemplating setting up the General Command of the Ground Force for an effective operation of the \"Self-Defense Forces\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is needless to say a premeditated and systematic move to round off the moves for turning Japan into a military giant and the preparations for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said principles have been proved to be a mere facade since the very day they were touted. Japan-made weapon parts have been ceaselessly exported to the United States for the production of war equipment and they have been used in various wars of aggression including the Persian Gulf War, unbound to the above-said principles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the issue of jointly developing the Missile Defense System with the U.S. was raised, the Japanese authorities openly buckled down to scrapping those principles, a nuisance to them, as if they had been waiting for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was part of that move that the Japanese prime minister recently gave an official approval of the re-examination of the principles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's abandonment of those principles is a revelation of its arrogance as it self-exposed that it is no longer a \"pacifist state\" but a war state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the demise of the Cold War Japan had asserted the building of a \"country capable of fighting wars.\" But it is now rushing headlong into a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this time when the situation in the region has grown extremely tense, Japan is making a switchover in its military doctrine from a system for building basic defence forces to that for building mobile defence forces in a bid to turn the SDF into \"very active 'SDF'\", an army capable of fighting wars. Japan's plan to set up the General Command of the Ground Force tasked for coordinating the contacts among various forces under the joint chiefs of staff which has a general command over the operations of the SDF and the Ground SDF is nothing but a detailed part of the radical process for comprehensively rounding off the preparations for reinvasion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese prime minister has gone the lengths of talking about the dispatch of the SDF to the Korean Peninsula in \"contingency\" without hesitation. This is a clear proof that an arrow for launching its reinvasion has been drawn on the map of the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Munitions monopoly capital which has swollen to the maximum under the patronage of the U.S. is behind these frantic moves for reinvasion in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese munitions industries are driving Japan into the joint development of military equipment and the performance of joint operations with the U.S., persistently requesting the Japanese authorities to ease the said principles. These moves are accelerating the formation of the U.S-led triangular military alliance in Northeast Asia and increasing the danger of war resulting from them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese militarism is becoming more arrogant through the process for emerging a military power as the days go by and challenging humankind as a hotbed of war threatening peace and stability in this region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community is following with vigilance the crafty and reckless moves of the Japanese reactionaries to step up their moves to turn Japan into a military power and the preparations for reinvasion backed by the U.S., while deliberately straining the situation in the region."

            "content": "Japan Accused of Its Moves to Cover up Introduction of Nuclear Weapons\r\n Pyongyang, December 14 (KCNA) -- According to the recently declassified diplomatic document of the Japanese Foreign Ministry, the then Foreign Minister of Japan Kosaka and U.S. Secretary of State Rusk worked out a document at the talks held in November 1961. Kosaka was reported to have implored the U.S. to keep in top secrecy the deployment in Okinawa of medium-range ballistic missiles capable of carrying nuclear warheads, saying that the government would be censured for failing to check it in case this fact was disclosed. \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove how craftily and viciously the Japanese government worked to cover up the introduction of nuclear weapons into the territory of Japan, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan took the stand of opposing nuclear weapons after the Second World War in a bid to draw global attention. But \"the three non-nuclear principles\" touted by Japan is no more than a smokescreen to cover up its criminal intention to go nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing facts to prove that Japan has secretly pushed ahead with its moves to go nuclear behind the curtain of \"the three non-nuclear principles\" since the 1960s, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was disclosed once again that the Japanese government worked hard to conceal the introduction of nukes, not content with letting the U.S. ship them into Japan at a time when the world is becoming cautious about the evermore undisguised moves of Japan to turn itself into a military power and launch its overseas expansion. This has heightened the vigilance among members of the international community against Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's loudmouthed \"three non-nuclear principles\" is nothing but a mere facade for realizing its nuclear ambition. Its trumpeting about \"pacifist state\" is no more than wordplay to deceive the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The veil of \"non-nuclear state\" worn by Japan so far has been completely thrown off."

En contraste, en Japon entran en etapa crucial los movimientos militares. \n\t\t\t\t\tEse pais isleno se obstina en la revision de los \"3 principios de exportacion de armas\" preconizados desde la decada de 1960 bajo el rotulo de la \"construccion del Estado pacifista\" y, al mismo tiempo, pretende instalar la comandancia terrestre general para la operacion efectiva de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo cabe duda de que tales movimientos sistematicos y premeditados son para convertirse en una potencia militar y perfeccionar los preparativos de nueva agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos \"3 principios de exportacion de armas\" resultaron superficiales desde el principio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin respetar esos principios que prohiben la exportacion de armas de Japon, los accesorios de armas japoneses fueron exportados sin parar para la produccion de equipos belicos de EE.UU. y usados en las guerras de agresion como la del Golfo Persico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se presento el problema de desarrollo conjunto del sistema antimisiles con EE.UU., las autoridades japonesas procedieron abiertamente a la cancelacion de esos principios que las molestan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este contexto, el premier japones aprobo oficialmente hace poco la revision de ellos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho significa que Japon ya no es un \"Estado pacifica\" sino pais belicista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del fin de la guerra fria, Japon vino insistiendo en la construccion del \"pais capaz de hacer la guerra\" y ahora marcha a galopes en esta direccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos tiempos en que la situacion regional es extremadamente tensa, modifico su doctrina militar sobre la capacidad defensiva basica en el sentido de que las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" fueran las activas y beligerantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa instalacion de la comandancia terrestre general, que coordinara los vinculos entre el jefe del Estado Mayor encargado de dirigir todas las operaciones y las tropas de \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" en diferentes zonas, forma parte de los preparativos finales de nueva agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, el premier japones habla sin escrupulos del envio de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" a la Peninsula Coreana en el tiempo de emergencia. Esto es una prueba evidente de que la flecha de reagresion de Japon esta dirigida a la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Detras de esa frenetica campana, esta el capital monopolista de industria belica de Japon expandido al maximo bajo la proteccion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los complejos de industria belica de Japon piden obstinadamente a las autoridades relajar los \"3 principios de exportacion de armas\" para que su pais pueda desarrollar equipos militares y cumplir operaciones junto con EE.UU. Por consiguiente, en el Nordeste Asiatico se impulsa la formacion de la alianza militar tripartita que aumenta el peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El militarismo japones se torna cada dia mas arrogante mediante la conversion en una potencia militar. Ademas, desafia a la humanidad como factor de guerra que amenaza la paz y la estabilidad de la region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La sociedad internacional vigila agudamente las imprudentes y astutas maniobras de los reaccionarios japoneses que aceleran la conversion de su pais en una potencia militar y los preparativos de la regresion agravando adrede la situacion regional bajo el abrigo de EE.UU."
