The plan envisages spending $11 billion for the beef-up of its military capability in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claims that the deployment of missiles in south Korea is of defensive nature as it is aimed to cope with possible ballistic missile and air strikes from someone. But this is, in fact, just part of its aggressive and offensive military buildup plan for the invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. designated the DPRK as a target of its \"preemptive attack\" and has massively shipped modern military hardware into south Korea since its self-proclaimed end of the Iraqi war, thus converting south Korea into the biggest arsenal in the Far East and ceaselessly increasing its military threat to Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the U.S. additionally inducted at least 20 new type Longbow AH-64D helicopters into a battalion of Apache helicopters of the U.S. 6th cavalry brigade stationed in south Korea. Then it replaced some PAC-2 by latest type PAC-3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its massive shipment of the latest combat equipment into south Korea also included more than 10 fighter bombers, a U-2, 6 F-117 Stealth bombers, one wing of F-15E fighters, one Shadow 200. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nearly 30 nuclear-powered submersibles have already been deployed by the U.S. in waters off the Asia-Pacific region under the simulated conditions of an \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. It also deployed 24 B-52 and B-1 in Guam under the same pretext this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It even announced a plan to begin deploying for an actual war latest type destroyer Aegis equipped with a missile interceptor system in the East Sea of Korea from September to come and round off its establishment of the naval missile interceptor system by the end of 2005. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These disturbing military moves of the U.S. are a major factor of straining the situation on the Korean peninsula and sparking military tension and arms race in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is following with utmost vigilance the U.S. deployment of ultra-modern military means and its escalated military threat to the DPRK stepped up behind the scene of dialogue and bracing for a possible provocation.    \r\n\r\n"

They argued that \"an impeachment trial is the only way of containing the president\" and even pulled up the north over the accident at Ryongchon Railway Station in North Phyongan Province.\r\n This is an unpardonable political provocation against the north and a shrill cry made by those forsaken by the nation before the hour of their death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's political system is the most advantageous, popular and dignified one envied and praised by the world people. \r\n Such act of slandering the political system in the north instead of expressing sympathy with the victims of the disaster cannot be interpreted otherwise than an inhuman rash act that can be perpetrated only by the political gangsters crazy for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the accident at Ryongchon Railway Station claimed huge human and material losses, governments of different countries and international bodies and organizations are sending messages of sympathy and relief goods to them from the sincere stand of humanitarianism and many south Korean organizations are rendering disinterested aid to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, those politicians are groundlessly speaking ill of the north over the disaster suffered by fellow countrymen, still not away from the old way of thinking. This only strips bare their true colors as snobs forsaken by the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They deserve condemnation and curse by the whole nation as they found fault even with the political system in the north over the accident of fellow countrymen in a bid to incite enmity and confrontation, feigning ignorance of a chain of big accidents in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The returns of the recent \"general election\" dramatically changed the political scene in south Korea and made it hard for them to exist any longer. It is a gross miscalculation for them to think their anti-north smear campaign would help them get out of this pretty fix. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Poisonous herbs should be rooted out without delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should eliminate at once the ultra right conservatives, cancer-like elements and poisonous herbs standing in the way of national reconciliation and unity and reunification of the country, toeing the line of foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will certainly settle accounts with those who slandered its system this time.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
