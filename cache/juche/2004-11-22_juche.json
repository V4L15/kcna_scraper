            "content": "U.S. Urged to Drop Its Policy for Stifling DPRK with Nukes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- The United States has not only kept nuclear weapons in south Korea since it announced the withdrawal of all of them from there during the office of Senior Bush but worked out a nuclear war scenario against the DPRK in top secrecy and has regularly staged drills for dropping nuclear bombs. This is a crucial issue that can never be overlooked. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has regarded it as an important issue related to the existence of the nation to remove the U.S. nuclear threat to the DPRK and has not stopped the struggle to make the Korean Peninsula nuclear-free, an anti-nuke struggle, even a moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. claimed to have withdrawn all the nuclear weapons from south Korea but, in actuality, bolstered its nuclear arsenal there both in quantity and quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group blustered that it must not merely wait for the DPRK to collapse as its preceding government did but accelerate its fall by all means including nuclear weapons. It was to serve such criminal purpose that it recently adopted the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" as a national policy to \"bring down the system\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S., the largest nuclear weapons state, nullified the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and adopted it as a national policy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK contrary to the basic spirit of the NPT, pushing the processes to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and denuclearize it to a stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about a \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\" after working out even a plan to use nuclear weapons in the event of contingency on the peninsula. This is nothing but sheer nonsense and lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality today helps the Korean people keenly realize what just steps the DPRK took to build a deterrent force strong enough to cope with the U.S. moves for a nuclear war in order to protect the destiny and security of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is bolstering its powerful self-defensive capacity to wipe out aggressors at one blow by countering the U.S. aerial strike with an aerial strike and its ground strategy with a ground strategy. This is an exercise of the inviolable legitimate right to self-defence with which no one can take issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will make sustained efforts to beef up its self-defensive deterrent force as long as the U.S. persists in its attempt to stifle the DPRK with nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to clearly understand the principled stand of the DPRK and its viewpoint on war and drop its reckless policy to stifle the DPRK with nukes.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

According to it, at least 20 persons concerned including the secretary general of the U.S. side to the MAC would be transferred from the U.S. military base in Ryongsan to be permanently stationed in the \"duty officers' room\" and the barracks around it in the JSA to perform the duty of \"approving\" and \"permitting\" the passage of personnel and materials from the south side through the DMZ.\r\n The U.S. is advertising this action as a step to \"give effective help in south-north cooperation\" including the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson Sunday terms this a crafty scheme to interfere in the north-south cooperation under the pretext of \"assistance\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inter-Korean cooperation is a nationwide work to achieve the common prosperity of the nation by the concerted efforts of the north and the south and, therefore, the U.S. has neither justification nor right to interfere in this undertaking, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. moves that inter-Korean cooperation including the construction of the KIZ has undergone turns and twists and it is clear that had the U.S. not interfered in this work and obstructed it, it would have made even greater progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly interested in the inter-Korean economic cooperation, it should apologize for its obstructions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent step taken by the U.S. goes to prove that its transfer of the guard duty in the JSA in Panmunjom to the south Korean army was nothing but a red herring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said action taken by the U.S. after having hindered the inter-Korean economic cooperation by hook or by crook is aimed to hamstring the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, block any process to improve the inter-Korean relations and keep south Korea under its domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must stop at once its base obstructions to the inter-Korean cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Urges U.S. to Drop Its Double Standards\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 20 (KCNA) -- The continued disclosure of nuclear-related secret experiments in south Korea since September has aroused great apprehension among the international community.\r\n According to information available, south Korea has pursued a nuclear development program for the past more than two decades. As a result, it has now basic elements and an integral system for nuclear weaponization such as the extraction of nuclear substance, manufacture of nuclear warheads, possession of nuclear warhead delivery means and pursuance of preparations for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that south Korea's nuclear issue has become a stark fact beyond suspicion, posing a grave threat to the peace on the Korean Peninsula and regional stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every secret nuclear experiment was conducted in south Korea according to the nuclear weapons program pushed forward by its authorities at the tacit connivance of the U.S. and under its patronage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not only rendered political support to south Korea in its nuclear weapons development but has given material, technical and manpower help to it. In fact, south Korea's production of nuclear substance and manufacture of nuclear weapons would be unthinkable without U.S. technical aid and provision of equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had south Korea's secret nuclear-related experiments been disclosed than the U.S. formally clarified the stand of its government that the case is not an \"issue of deep concern\". It is making nonsensical assertion that similar issues of other countries should be referred to the UNSC if the nuclear issue of south Korea is to be taken up there, claiming that the case is irrelevant to the development of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. has manipulated the IAEA to drag on its inspection of nuclear research centers in south Korea, making a mockery of the public at home and abroad demanding the probe into the truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA side, under the manipulation of the U.S., still shows tendency to downplay the case even today when it has become clear that south Korea's uranium enrichment and plutonium separation and its procrastinated notification of such activities have sparked off serious concern and that it has failed to examine equipment and operation diary, collect samples and organize interviews with relevant scientists which are essential for inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can neither trust nor recognize the results of three inspections made by the IAEA so far and can not but remain skeptical about the results of further inspections now that it has become clear that the organization applies double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's nuclear issue is a crucial issue as it will seriously affect the situation on the Korean Peninsula and the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear who will be a target of south Korea's nuclear weapons as it is an ally of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has urged the DPRK to accept the CVID, while shutting its eyes to the secret nuclear-related experiments conducted by south Korea under its nuclear umbrella. This reality is heightening Pyongyang's vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is taking issue with the DPRK's self-defensive measures to increase its nuclear deterrent force while defending and encouraging south Korea's nuclear weaponization and cooperating with it in this move on the basis of its undisguised double-dealing tactics. This is the height of shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to make the whole Korean Peninsula nuclear free. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never dismantle its self-defensive nuclear deterrent force unless a thorough and understandable probe is made into south Korea's nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the U.S. drops its double-standards in dealing with the nuclear issue and makes a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK will serve as a yardstick judging its future policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
