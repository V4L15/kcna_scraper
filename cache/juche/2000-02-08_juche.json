He created this spirit and method in February Juche 49 (1960) when he gave 15-day on-site guidance to Chongsan-ri and Kangso county, South Phyongan Province, at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the spirit and method whereby to make superiors help their subordinates, find a correct solution to any problem in realities and place the political work, the work with man, above all and give full play to consciousness and creative initiative of the popular masses so as to carry out the revolutionary tasks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying this spirit and method is a profound idea that calls for placing the interests of the popular masses above anything else and solving everything in their interests and going among them to enlist their strength and wisdom and solve the problems raised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In his report at the meeting, choe thae bok, secretary of the WPK central committee, said the creation of the Chongsan-ri spirit and method provided a method of leading the masses for the first time in history, the method that enables them to become true masters of state and society. It also brought about an epochal turn in establishing a political mode suited to the nature of the Korean socialist system, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He further said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This spirit and method was formulated as the work method of President Kim Il Sung and has been applied in the revolution and construction under the tested leadership of the respected Kim Jong Il. In the course great achievements have been made in the Korean people's building of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the years of \"arduous march\" and the forced march, the most rigorous period ever in the Korean people's history of revolutionary struggle, Kim Jong Il strictly adhered to and applied this work method of the President in all fields of revolution and construction, and thus overcame difficulties before them and turned misfortune into blessing and adversity into favourable conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter called for holding fast to the method as an all-powerful sword and pushing ahead with revolution and construction under the guidance of Kim Jong Il so as to build a powerful nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Attending the meeting were Kim Yong Nam, Hong Song Nam and other senior party and state officials. \r\n\r\n"

Korean rulers' moves to build bust of Syngman Rhee \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the South Korean \"National Assembly\" decided to erect a bust of Syngman Rhee at its building. This funny racket is an  insult to and mockery of the 70 million fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt happened when the present chief executive of South Korea proposed the construction of a \"memorial\" for Park Chung-hee and held the post  of \"Honorary Chairman\" of the \"Society for Memorial Service for Park Chung-hee.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Both Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee were despicable traitors to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Syngman Rhee went to the United States to receive an American-style education and become a dyed-in-the-wool pro-American element in the period of the Japanese imperialist colonial rule over Korea. After Japan's defeat, he cooked up a separate \"government\" in South Korea as a tool of the U.S., thus freezing the division of Korea. He was a war maniac who brought a disaster to the nation by provoking a war. Moreover, the traitor committed all sorts of irregularities and corruption and enforced mediaeval dictatorship to block the democratic development of the South Korean society. He was forced to flee to Hawaii by the April 19 popular uprising where he met a miserable end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Park Chung-hee, too, was a special class pro-Japanese traitor. He changed even his name into Minoru Okamoto and served as an officer of the \"imperial army\" for an aggression on the continent, vowing to \"die like Sakura (the national flower of Japan) in order to realize the Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" in the period of the Japanese colonial rule over Korea. He enforced military dictatorship for 18 years  after seizing the \"presidency\" through the \"May 16 military coup\" in 1961. He ran wild to create \"two Koreas,\" turning down the July 4 joint statement agreed upon by the north and south despite the strong aspiration of the nation after reunification. He also met a miserable death in face of the resistance of the South Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The country and the nation will not pardon those moves to call back the departed soul of the traitors. The compatriots at home and abroad are greatly angered by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spokesman for the central committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland in a statement demanded the South Korean authorities draw a proper lesson from the miserable end of their predecessors and immediately halt such a dastardly burlesque as building a bust of Syngman Rhee and a \"memorial\" for Park Chung-hee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Papers in Pyongyang continue to carry articles condemning the South Korean authorities for their traitorous acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spokesman for the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea in a statement demanded Kim Dae Jung's group stop the criminal moves without delay, warning that it will meet the same miserable end as Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-hee did. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the compatriots will never remain an onlooker to the traitorous moves of the South Korean authorities to call back the departed soul of the traitors for all ages. \r\n\r\n"

But the U.S. describes this as a sort of present to be given to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the logic of the U.S. that it is a due obligation of the DPRK to sincerely implement the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and U.S. lifting of economic sanctions and fulfillment of other commitments would bring \"benefits\" to the DPRK and it, therefore, needs \"repayment.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is, indeed, a brigandish logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We value independence like our life and soul. We return faith for faith but never tolerate any acts to impair our dignity and independence. It will be a great miscalculation if the U.S. thinks that it can frighten us or isolate and stifle our socialism through economic pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have defended our idea and system and increased our economic and military potentials despite scores of years of economic sanctions by the U.S.-led imperialist forces. We feel very proud of this. We will remain unfazed,  no matter what tough sanctions the U.S. may impose upon us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is well advised to think twice over all the consequences to be entailed by its escalated economic sanctions against the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

Forcing them to give up the DPRK nationalities is little different from forcing them to have other nationalities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not because they have no \"suffrage\" that their human rights are violated and their unstable living conditions are continued with national discrimination. It is entirely attributable to the Japanese authorities' anachronistic policy of humiliating the Korean nation and their moves against the DPRK and Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should withdraw the \"bill\" at once and ensure basic human rights and stable living conditions of Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should immediately stop their anti-national crime of instigating the Japanese reactionaries and vicious elements of the South Korean residents association in Japan to divide the community of Koreans in Japan. \r\n\r\n"

The \"Korean dictionary\" is called \"foreign language dictionary\" because over 80 percent of the words are written in foreign languages and Chinese characters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Almost all the texts of \"code of laws,\" \"legal\" documents, \"formal adjudication,\" \"government papers,\" etc, have been written in foreign languages and Chinese characters. Worse still, its \"nomenclature\" is written and sealed in Chinese characters. Kim Dae Jung, its present \"President,\" is also called \"DJ.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the world there is no such place as South Korea where road marks are written in three languages including English and Chinese characters and resident registration cards in two languages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mass media of South Korea mainly use foreign and mixed languages and 80-90 percent of brands and advertisements are written in foreign languages and Chinese characters. And businesses are competitively named in English. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Use of foreign languages is rapidly growing in daily life, to say nothing of specialized sectors such as science, literature and art and sports. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to a survey made by South Korean philologists into 1,643 daily life vocabularies, 95 percent of them are foreign and mixed languages while words peculiar to the Korean language are no more than five percent of the total. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such practices are serious in the field of education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMore than 70 percent of the terms used in teaching are foreign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korea, where its own written and spoken language can hardly be seen or heard but foreign languages are rampant, is, in the real sense of word, a colony in terms of language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its ruling quarters are resorting to the use of foreign languages and Chinese characters and mixed languages, neglecting the Korean language. This is a vivid expression of their flunkeyism, treachery and national nihilism and anti-social, anti-national and anti-reunification conception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have contended that the use of foreign languages and Chinese characters is inevitable as the written and spoken Korean language is unsuitable for \"globalization\", pretty hard in expression and outdated in view of the trend of the times. And they have described the use as a measure taken for \"era of international language, common tongue.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In contrast to the south of Korea, the north has firmly preserved the Juche character and national character in the field of language, with the result that the Korean language has been further developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was long ago that foreign languages and Chinese characters were eliminated from its politico-social life thanks to the embodiment of the Juche-based linguistic idea and policy advanced by the President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Press media in the DPRK use words easy for everyone to understand and its people the most cultured Pyongyang language. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the guidance of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, language, which was once regarded as means of social communication and cultural expression, could take its proper position and play its role as a main ingredient determining each nation, an important matter decisive of rise or fall of the nation, and an instrument for revolution and construction. This was a noteworthy event in human history, the paper concluded. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to shake off its ill-fame of \"enemy state\" \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, February 8 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, Japan asserted in its foreign policy for 2000 that its major task would be to become a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council this year. An official concerned of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Japan would like to take responsibility as its permanent member when the reform of the UNSC is under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is behaving as if its permanent membership depended on its decision. This is one more evidence of the craftiness and arrogance of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan is resorting to all sorts of trickery to seat on the UNSC, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is not qualified to become its permanent member. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has not yet shaken off the ill-fame of \"enemy state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBecause as a war criminal Japan has not honestly apologized, reflected on and compensated for the untold misfortunes and sufferings inflicted upon the peoples of Korea and other Asian countries after invading them in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is quite impudent of Japan to seek permanent membership of the UNSC while it is still registered as an \"enemy state\" in the UN charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe world's cautious approach to Japan's bid for UNSC permanent membership is attributable to the speedy revival of militarism in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan kidnapped more than 6 million young and middle-aged Koreans and took away at least 200,000 Korean women as \"comfort women for the army.\" The Japanese reactionaries are strengthening legal and military systems to repeat their past wrong-doings, refusing to admit all crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the beginning of the year, they have been busy with war confabs and arms buildup and war exercises, all aimed at reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf Japan becomes a permanent member of the UNSC, it will disturb the world and put many countries into the danger of their sovereignty being infringed upon by Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan had better shake off its ill-fame of \"enemy state\" before making a bid for permanent membership of the UNSC. \r\n\r\n"
