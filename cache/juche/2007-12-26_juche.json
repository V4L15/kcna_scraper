The purpose of the exercise was to strike ground targets, provide close air support, fight air battles and make intensive strikes by formations of planes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday terms this saber rattling part of the war moves of the U.S. bellicose forces to stifle the DPRK through surprise attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The madcap drills being staged by them to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK behind the scene of dialogue as part of their preparations for a second Korean war only cast a doubt as to whether the U.S. is willing for dialogue or not, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue advertised by the U.S. while seeking confrontation is, in fact, nothing but a military option to disarm its dialogue partner mentally and mount a surprise preemptive attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of the U.S. conservative hard-liners to pressurize the present U.S. administration to call off dialogue with the DPRK and strain the situation in a bid to make it complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can predict what shocking cases the U.S. bellicose forces will fake up to scuttle the negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. while busying themselves with war exercises and moves to modernize their armed forces in the future. Their stand is to screw up the military confrontation and ignite a war. This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. forces are pushing forward such dangerous plan for modernizing their armed forces as the so-called \"future combat system\" targeted against the DPRK and staging interceptor missile tests one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. conservative hard-liners are contemplating a reckless preemptive attack on the DPRK, its army and people are making preparations to resolutely counter it. It is the invariable stand and will of the DPRK to respond to dialogue with dialogue and counter force with force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
