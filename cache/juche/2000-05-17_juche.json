This time he went the length of openly calling for the production and export of sophisticated weapons under the plea of \"security,\" thus betraying the invariable design of the right-wing reactionaries of Japan to convert it into a military power and launch aggression overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This agitation cannot but spark public anger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of Japan's \"security\" is incompatible with its export of weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It does not stand to reason to export weapons on account of \"security.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is little short of Japan's intention to abandon its much publicized \"three principles of arms export.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"three principles of arms export,\" in fact, exist in name only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Realities in Japan where the specter of militarism is haunting go to prove that the Japanese authorities' loudmouthed \"contribution to peace\" is nothing but hypocrisy and their hue and cry over  the DPRK's \"missile threat\" is no more than a sheer ruse intended to draw water to their mill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Through arms sale the Japanese reactionaries seek to make profits, secure their military clout and expand the sphere of their influence and thus build a springboard from which to launch aggression overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits attention is the attitude of the United States which shuts its eyes to these militarist moves of Japan. The U.S. feigns ignorance of Japan's moves to become a military power, while getting extremely nervous about other countries' efforts to strengthen self-defence capabilities and blatantly interfering in them like an international gendarme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This behaviour cannot be construed otherwise than support to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries should stop frantically escalating their moves for Japan's conversion into a military power and aggression overseas and threat to peace under the patronage of the U.S. \r\n\r\n"

That is why the U.S. military occupation of South Korea should be terminated, reckless war games against the DPRK be discontinued and all lethal weapons be removed from South Korea. \r\n\r\n"
