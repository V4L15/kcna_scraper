It holds that issues of withdrawing the U.S. troops from South Korea and signing a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United States which it has consistently called for and which are the very key to Korea's reunification, must be discussed as the main agenda item at the four-way talks.\r\n   It is the consistent stand of the DPRK government to achieve the lasting peace and security of the Korean peninsula. Up to date, we have attended the four-way talks, expecting that they would make substantial contributions to establishing a lasting peace system on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   As is well known, the key to eliminating the root cause of the acute political and military confrontation on the Korean peninsula is to put an end to the military interference of the United States. What is needed for this is to conclude a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United States, signatories to the Armistice Agreement, and drive the U.S. forces out of South Korea.\r\n   This is why the DPRK raised it as a major agenda item for the four-way talks to withdraw the U.S. troops from South Korea and sign the peace agreement, which are vital to putting a period to the state of armistice and achieving the lasting peace on the Korean peninsula, and has made every possible effort to solve it.\r\n   However, any fruition has not yet been made at the talks against our expectation.\r\n   For its insincere negotiating stance, the U.S. side has to take full responsibility for the deadlocked talks.\r\n   It has not only evaded accepting our fair and aboveboard call for taking as the major agenda items the issues of withdrawing the U.S. troops and signing the peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. but also refused to debate about the issues. Worse still, it insisted that only matters containing its ulterior intention must be discussed.\r\n   The DPRK will make every possible effort to turn the four-way talks into fruitful ones helpful toward ensuring the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and expect that all the parties to the talks will also respond to its call with sincerity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
