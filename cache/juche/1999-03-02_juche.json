            "content": "World community urged to denounce nuclear power's attempt\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee, in a press statement issued Monday 45 years after the tragic nuclear disaster on Bikini Island, appealed to the world community to strongly protest and denounce the nuclear powers' nuke test and development.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no ground for the nuclear powers to refuse to commit themselves to completely abolish nuke-weapons as no Cold War system exists between the east and the west.   Fundamental revision of the nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) is instrumental in saving the mankind from nuclear disaster and building world free of nuke-weapons.   The DPRK maintains that there should be a new NPT which stipulates the obligation of the nuclear powers to eliminate nuke-weapons on the basis of justice and impartiality.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should be bold enough to drop the old War era mode of thinking intended to retain their vested rights and superiority and completely ban the nuke-test, thereby joining the people in the  endeavors to build the world free of nuke-weapons.   They should also make declarations guaranteeing non-use of nuke-weapons against the non-nuclear states in any case and  this should be subjected to International Law.   The United States should ponder over what catastrophic consequences would be entailed by a nuclear war in Korea and stop at once threat and blackmail against the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the complete elimination of nuke-weapons it is important, above all, to steadily push ahead nuclear disarmament worldwide and realize the complete denuclearization in northeast Asia, especially the Korean peninsula which is exposed to the biggest danger of nuclear war and where nuke-weapons are deployed in larger numbers than any other areas.   The United States should pull all nuke-weapons out of South Korea without delay and stop at once nuclear threat to the DPRK as per its commitments under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should lend an ear to the voices of her and other people of the world desirous of nuke-free peace, including the A-bomb victims in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, stop nuclear armament, give up her nuclear plan and guarantee the peaceful use of nuclear materials to world community.   The world's peace-loving forces should create nuke-free peace zones throughout the world and further expand them. \r\n     \r\n"

The north and south have already adopted an agreement on reconciliation, non-aggression, cooperation and exchange. What remains to be done now  is put it into practice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For South Korea, which is not a signatory to the armistice agreement, to cry over the \"conclusion of a peace accord\" without implementing the inter-Korean agreement is a symptom of hysterics.
