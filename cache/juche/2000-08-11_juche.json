It played a main role in the development of the Korean history in the period of the three kingdoms (Koguryo, Paekje and Silla) and externally demonstrated the resourcefulness of the nation and the power of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The economy and military power of Koguryo grew stronger after it moved its capital to Pyongyang (area around Mt. Taesong today), the sacred place of father Tangun of the Korean nation, in 427. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As Koguryo inherited the metal processing technique from Kojoson (ancient Korea), the skill of making iron farm implements, iron weapons, metal tools, etc, was highly developed from its early days. This was greatly instrumental in strengthening the feudal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Silk route,\" which takes an important place in the development of human civilization, was also explored by the people of Koguryo and its cradle was Pyongyang at the River Taedong basin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They used this route to export silk, Insam, leather and other specialties to different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Koguryo had developed national culture. It is evidenced by mural tombs where mural paintings distinct in color and vivid in depiction are well preserved still today. Typical of them are the mural tomb in Anak county, south hwanghae province, and a huge one in Kangso district, nampho. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As seen above, the Korean people have been resourceful and intelligent and have entertained ardent patriotism and strong will since olden times. \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, paying \"respects\" and praying for the soul of those entombed there means supporting aggression and praising militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is certain that the high-ranking quarters of Japan seek to galvanize public opinion over their official visit to the \"shrine\" beforehand in a bid to turn the whole land of Japan into a theatre for agitating reinvasion on the day marking the 55th anniversary of the Japanese imperialists' defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The militarist forces of Japan are egging high-ranking officials of its government on to incite dangerous militarist hysteria among the Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is the only country in the world that has not settled its crime-woven past until now though the world is at the turn of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yet, Japan is behaving wrong instead of fulfilling its duties. Japan is a country bereft of even an iota of morality and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are seriously mistaken if they think they can calm down world voices demanding Japan's redress for its past by embarking upon reinvasion. \r\n\r\n"
