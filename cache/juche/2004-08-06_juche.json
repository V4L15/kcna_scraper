            "content": "KCNA Report on Dangerous Reorganization and Redeployment of U.S. Forces \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 5 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency Wednesday released a detailed report laying bare the danger of the reorganization and redeployment of the U.S. forces in different parts of the world.\r\n The report cited concrete facts to prove that the U.S. plan for reorganization and redeployment is aimed at making a fresh forward-deployment of its troops as required by its military operation to dominate the whole world in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report said: The plan has been carefully worked out and put into practice by the U.S. bellicose elements at the instruction issued by Bush for world supremacy, while projecting the U.S. as the \"only superpower\" and styling himself an \"emperor of the world\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan is part of the strategy for world supremacy to contain big powers and regional strong nations that exercise undeniable great influence in the international arena, stem the trend toward multi-polarization, stifle the independent and sovereign states not yielding to the U.S. arbitrary practices, strong-arm action and unilateralism and thus turn the whole world into a U.S.-led \"free world\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reflects the U.S. operational intention to attain its military aim by rapidly dispatching its troops anywhere and anytime, not by containing \"hostile forces\" through the deployment of its armed forces in the fixed overseas areas as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has worked out an unprecedentedly reckless war scenario to mount a preemptive nuclear attack to meet the strategic need for the reorganization and redeployment of its armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., on the basis of the examination of its \"defense strategy\" during the Cold War era and the Clinton administration, announced last year the \"1-4-2-1 defense strategy\", a newly revised and supplemented scenario for a war for aggression. Entering this year, it published an operation plan called \"10-30-30\", a new war initiative, in which the \"1-4-2-1 defense strategy\" has been put into a concrete shape and developed in depth. \r\n On July 22 U.S. Congress approved the military budget for the fiscal 2005 amounting to 416 billion U.S. dollars, much bigger than that of the preceding fiscal year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is focusing its efforts on reorganizing and redeploying its armed forces in Central Asian countries and Mideast countries close to big powers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is aimed at achieving its strategic purpose of holding off the influence of big powers and securing abundant energy resources such as oil, natural gas and uranium in these regions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to consolidate its military bases in Central Asia and Mideast and, at the same time, build new ones with those forces now in the process of withdrawing from large military bases in Germany and countries in other regions and reinforcements from its mainland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has already buckled down to the work to attain its strategic aim to put Mideast under its complete control after deciding to permanently keep nearly 140,000 troops in Iraq and operate four military bases there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has stepped up its preparations to pull back its troops from Western Europe and forward-deploy them in East Europe, attaching great importance to the reorganization and redeployment of its forces in Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This plan reflects the U.S. strategic purpose to settle the contradictions in its relations with Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seeks to keep European countries within the framework of the master-servant alliance by creating uneasiness among them that any change in the traditional \"European security\" structure based on the nature and influence of the NATO having U.S. forces as its axis due to the plan to reorganize and redeploy the U.S. troops would result in destabilizing regional security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by it is to relatively enhance the strategic position of East European countries and thus hold in check Europe's integration process by containing big European countries which advocate independent Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is also contemplating making an overall reorganization and redeployment of its troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its ulterior aim is to round off a military operation to start the second Korean war against the DPRK and escalate tension in Northeast Asia, pursuant to its strategy of preemptive strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cutdown of the U.S. forces in south Korea and their redeployment are very dangerous military steps as they are intended to ensure a qualitative military edge and seize the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. drastically increased the spending of 11 billion U.S. dollars called for by its \"arms buildup plan\" to 13 billion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is another country to which the Bush administration attaches importance in carrying out the reorganization and redeployment of its troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its aim is to catapult Japan to the \"most important base\" in serving the U.S. troops stationed in the Asian-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. big-scale reorganization and redeployment of its troops under way worldwide as part of its moves to realize its strategy to dominate the world clearly testify to the fact that the U.S. is chiefly responsible for harassing global peace and stability and creating the danger of a nuclear war\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no such funny law in the world as the SL, which labels fellow countrymen an enemy. We do not recognize three years in jail and 5 years of stay of execution to which Prof. Song Tu Ryul was sentenced as the decision was made on the basis of the evil law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The verdict of \"not guilty\" is the only way of restoring his academic success and honor, the statement concluded.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Herein lie the immortal feats performed by him in Party building in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in his exploits in strengthening the Party into an ever-victorious steel-strong party as required by the era of Songun revolution is that he has further consolidated the political foundation of the Party by lifting the unity of the Party, the army and the people to a new height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unthinkable apart from the wise guidance of him who has energetically led the work to strengthen the Party in compliance with the requirements of the era of Songun that the army and the people of the DPRK have been able to win one great victory after another in death-defying confrontation with the U.S. imperialists and unfold a history of tremendous changes in this land while erecting quite a few monumental edifices adding shines to the era of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is a statesman rare to be seen, who is strengthening the WPK into a steel-strong party not shaking in any storm, as required by the times and the developing revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they are leaving no means untried to disseminate the bourgeois way of life in other countries. In their virulent infiltration campaign they utilize such literary and art works as film, drama and song and such media as newspaper, TV and journal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are these days maliciously trying to intensify superstition and psychological operations targeted against the DPRK.
