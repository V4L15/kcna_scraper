Imperialism is waste of history. It is law that imperialism go to ruin in the long run.\r\n   The swollen-headed imperialists work hard to handle international issues as they like and behave as if they could decide on the destiny of mankind as they wish, but everything is not done as they like.\r\n   After the end of the cold war, the imperialists concentrated their attack on the socialist countries to establish a \"New World Order.\" their campaign to isolate and stifle the DPRK has been unprecedentedly outrageous and vicious.\r\n   With no military threat, economic blockade and ideo-cultural offensive they could stifle our socialism.\r\n   Their anti-Cuban campaign is also destined to failure.\r\n   They left no stone unturned to make the non-aligned movement nominal, but the NAM member nations countered their campaign with the strategy of unity. As a result, the NAM has a louder voice and greater influence in the efforts to democratize the international community and establish a new fair international order.\r\n   The imperialists' intervention in the countries that maintain the anti-imperialist, independent position has been criticised and ridiculed by the progressive people around the world.\r\n   Upset at the growth of the ASEAN, the imperialists are putting pressure on it, but the ASEAN member nations settle every issue independently in conformity with their specific conditions, resolutely rejecting the imperialist intervention.\r\n   The African countries do not allow the imperialist moves for intervention and influence in the continent that are made behind the facade of \"settlement of disputes.\"\r\n   The Latin American countries are also watchful for the dominationist moves of the U.S. and seeking independent development.\r\n   Facts show the imperialists' moves to bring the world under their control can never be realised. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
