They have not yet made any apology or any compensation to the Korean victims and their bereaved families, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Information recently released by the Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare of Japan ascertained the horrible fact that some of the Korean victims of forcible drafting are entombed in the \"Yasukuni Shrine\". This is an intolerable mockery of the Korean victims of forcible drafting who met deaths with bitter grudge and indignation at the Japanese imperialists and their bereaved families who deeply grieve over the death of their kith and kin and unpardonable human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have spent 60 billion yen for retrieving remains of soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army. Japan is, therefore, the only country in the world which has extolled its war criminals and beautified the history of aggression while turning blind eyes to the victims of other countries who suffered untold damage and pain due to the war of aggression started by Japan in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have evaded the redemption of Japan's past crimes still today. Moreover, they are frantically kicking up an anti-DPRK racket, crying out for the \"application of economic sanctions\" against the DPRK and the adoption of the \"North Korean Human Rights Law\" over the issue of abducted Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the issue of the remains of the Korean victims of the forcible drafting, the statement raised the following demands to the Japanese government: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First. The Japanese government should make a thorough probe into the truth behind the issue of the remains of Korean victims of forcible drafting and make public the whole story about it as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. The Japanese government should admit the state responsibility for the issue of the remains and make a formal apology and make full compensation to the victims and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. The Japanese government should take a practical measure to find out remains of Korean victims of forcible drafting and rebury them either in their native places or in the places where their families reside as demanded by their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This snuffed off the \"control line\" restricting the production and export of weapons which Japan had maintained, though for form's sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the view and doctrine of action of the Japanese militarists to remove the troublesome \"control line\" it had drawn in the past by taking advantage of the situation changed with the end of the Cold War and plunge into the world with its military wings spread. The Japanese militarists have opened a broad way of arms production and export by softening the principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They do not want Japan to be restricted in the production of uptodate military hardware and placed at the bottom of the global list in arms export, bound to the principles. By discarding the \"control line\" of arms export, they seek to build a military power through unlimited arms expansion and arms production and prepare the \"Self-Defense Forces\" for any war of aggression and, at the same time, reap a windfall on the world arms market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's removal of the \"control line\" means, in essence, setting the stage for a switchover to building a new springboard in the development of munitions  industry and transferring all the legal orders and political system of the country to a militarist ruling system. This is, in fact, a very dangerous move like the establishment of a state ruling system before the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's easing the \"three principles of arms export\" is quite a dangerous act of fostering a renewed arms race and military conflicts worldwide. Japan is trying to attain its aim of overseas aggression by jumping into scufflings through the supply of weapons to the forces in disputes under the pretext of \"coping with threat\" and \"settling disputes\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people should intensify the anti-Japanese struggle, clearly seeing through the dangerous acts of the Japanese militarists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the banner we should hold high to make advance in our drive to effect a great revolutionary surge at present.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in an editorial Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit fully reflects the matchless grit and the spirit of uninterrupted revolution of Kim Jong Il, the great brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu, the spirit of waging a strenuous struggle and making steady advance till a final victory with faith that there is nothing impossible. It is also a manifestation of strong independent faith and national self-esteem, the spirit of settling everything our own way, firmly convinced of our idea and cause, the validity of the Songun policy and our own strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rushing forward in this spirit means a dynamic general march aimed to significantly augment the national power of the country and demonstrate before the world the invincible spirit of socialist Korea advancing under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said offensive spirit is based on the resourcefulness, grit and staunch fighting trait of the heroic Korean people advancing and struggling despite all ordeals and difficulties by the force of Songun. Only when they dynamically struggle in the offensive spirit and fighting trait created by the workers of Songgang will our country demonstrate the dignity as a great powerful nation winning one victory after another and achieving prosperity thanks to its matchless military capacity and single-minded unity and its solid economic foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rushing forward in this spirit is a worthwhile struggle to bring about a great Songun revolutionary upswing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the fields of the national economy including the metal industry and all other fields and units give fullest play to the might of ideology, the might of the revolutionary soldier spirit and enlist all the potentials for the development of economy and science and technology just as the workers of Songgang did, is it possible to radically improve the economic picture of the country and attain the high goal of building a great prosperous powerful nation in the new century ahead of schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members and other working people should effect a leap forward on all fronts of socialist economic construction in the spirit of spurring on steed as befitting the strong-willed revolutionary people who pulled through the adversity during the \"Arduous March\" like heroes and thus powerfully demonstrate before the world the spirit and might of Songun Korea this year which marks the 60th anniversaries of the Workers' Party of Korea and the liberation of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is raised because of the United States opposed to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the main outside force standing in the way of the Korean nation's cause of independence. Without an end to its domination and interference, the sovereignty and dignity of the Korean nation cannot be defended nor can the cause of national independence be accomplished. The anti-U.S. struggle is, immediately, the realization of cooperation for national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Apart from the struggle against the U.S. aggression and war moves, the country's peace cannot be defended and it is impossible to check the danger of a nuclear war which is coming toward the Korean Peninsula hourly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for peace against war intended to oppose war and defend peace by the united efforts of the Korean nation inevitably requires a powerful anti-U.S. struggle to smash the U.S. aggression on the DPRK and its provocation of a nuclear war and eradicate the root-cause of a nuclear war in the country. \r\n Cooperation for reunification and patriotism means a patriotic struggle to reconnect the artificially cut blood vessel of the nation, realize the reconciliation of the whole nation and promote the interests and prosperity common to the nation by the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for reunification and patriotism can successfully be achieved and can display its might when a daring nation-wide anti-U.S. struggle is waged to frustrate the interference and obstructions of the U.S., the root-cause of national division and harasser of Korea's reunification. \r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas should courageously wage a life-or-death struggle against the U.S. this year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

One should throw away the dagger hidden in his bosom, if he wants a dialogue and reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For a smooth implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, a suitable climate must be created, above all. Dialogue and war, reconciliation and confrontation can never go together. If the south Korean military authorities persist in military provocations, it is as clear as noonday that there will be created grave difficulties in the way of the implementation of the joint declaration and the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such rash acts leading the situation to the danger line can never be allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-thirsty forces must at once stop the military provocations bringing dark clouds of war over the country. Should the south Korean military authorities continue with such indiscreet military provocations for a confrontation between fellow countrymen, turning a deaf ear to the repeated warnings of the north, they will be held fully accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
