Now it is openly urging the country to sever bilateral relations, calling the DPRK a \"bad friend\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In May the U.S. president said that the U.S. would render more aid to Myanmar if it breaks off relations with the DPRK. The U.S. State secretary urged Myanmar to move in the direction of cutting off the relations with the DPRK whenever an opportunity presented itself. A few days ago, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs let loose such invectives that Myanmar should move to break off the relations with the DPRK, \"bad friend\", at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the U.S. hostile policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK remains unchanged and has been pushed forward with increased zeal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is precisely for this reason that the DPRK has kept itself fully prepared to cope with the U.S. hostile policy toward it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. which sows discord among countries, nations and tribes and harasses regional and world peace and stability is, in fact, a \"bad friend\" whom all the countries aspiring after independence should shun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-U.S. protests are unabated in Mid-east countries which suffer from untold misfortune and pains due to the U.S. interference, being caught in its tentacles of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has shifted its strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region and has fostered discord and stand-off. This resulted in fierce territorial disputes and escalation of tension in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts teach a lesson that tragic incidents occur wherever the U.S. sets its foot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has ensured the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula by dint of a powerful war deterrent built by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. keeps its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, it will meet a miserable end in the Korean Peninsula and the region."

They put on the screen nine films dealing with the \"life of defectors from the north\" and \"state of concentration camps\", malignantly slandering the human rights performance in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"People for Making Successful Unification\", another anti-DPRK human rights organization, held the special preview of \"48M\" allegedly produced by a defector to the south in the presence of ambassadors and envoys of various countries and members of NGOs at the UN Commissions on Human Rights in Geneva on Sept. 14.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organization also held a meeting to hear \"testimonies.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime also showed those films at U.S. Congress and in European countries and presented them even to international film festivals in alignment with the human rights plotters of the U.S. and Europe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime's ever-more undisguised anti-DPRK human rights campaign is another traitorous and anti-reunification frenzy to hurt the daily increasing dignity of the DPRK and incite the consciousness of confrontation with fellow countrymen among the south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat strongly denounces the puppet regime's anti-DPRK farce as a blatant challenge to the DPRK's dignity and social system and a sordid act aimed to quench the spirit for reunification through alliance with the north mounting among south Koreans of all social standings and incite confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people in the DPRK are opening up the heyday of prosperity in which they will lead a happy life in the socialist society in single-minded unity under the wise guidance of the illustrious commander of Mt.

They are bringing about fresh miracles and renovation in building a great prosperous and powerful nation with hope and confidence. This is the stirring situation of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the puppet regime has used human scum bereft of elementary conscience and dignity for kicking up false propaganda by distorting the situation in the DPRK. It is even abusing film arts for escalating confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such hysterical act of the regime is a mockery and insult to the film arts which is a product of modern civilization and which is obliged to reflect justice, truth and noble human life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime's sordid act clearly proves to what extent its frenzy for confrontation with the DPRK has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is trying to attain its dirty criminal attempt by using human scum, who betrayed the country and the people as well as their own blood relatives for their own indolence and luxury, and the parasitic riff-raffs. This proves that the regime is also made up of the same human scum and confrontation maniacs as those defectors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is setting the stage for all kinds of dirty farces, distorting the truth in the DPRK and tarnishing its image in a bid to garner supporting votes at the upcoming \"presidential election.\" But no one will lend an ear to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime's act only betrays its base nature, moral vulgarity and low level of civilization. It will get public censure and disillusion from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never let those involved in producing and showing anti-DPRK films, to say nothing of the south Korean authorities, go scot-free but sternly punish them in the name of the nation."

A large number of workers have honored their yearly plans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to successfully conclude this year's drive in order to consolidate all the achievements made so far and win greater victories. Success in the future drive for final victory in the building of a thriving nation would depend on how to conclude this year's drive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial calls on the Korean people to win shining victory in the on-going general offensive and thus demonstrate once again before the whole world the might of their single-minded unity around the great illustrious commander of Songun and their revolutionary mettle to do everything unconditionally once the Party is determined."

The declarations comprehensively clarify the principle and ways to solve the issue of the country's reunification and specific matters arising in achieving it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the period when the declarations were being implemented, the inter-Korean relations put an end to the history of distrust and confrontation that lasted for more than half a century and were definitely put on the orbit of reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south conducted brisk dialogue and cooperation in various fields, after boldly discarding the old conception of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the dynamic advance of the June 15 era of reunification, an atmosphere of peace and stability settled on the Korean Peninsula and a bright prospect of peace and reunification was opened there. This was entirely possible because the north and the south made concerted efforts to implement the said declarations, respecting them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The declarations call on all Koreans to pool efforts in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" and achieve the peaceful reunification of the country. Denying this means pursuance of the inter-Korean confrontation and a war. This is proved by what the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors has done.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group regarded it as a \"principle\" to oppose the declarations. This reckless stand totally blocked the way for defusing the present confrontation between the north and the south and created the worst situation on the peninsula where a war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that if the declarations are respected and implemented, the inter-Korean relations will improve and peace settle but if one denies and refuses to implement the declarations, confrontation will be escalated and a war will be bound to break out."

Y el secretario de Defensa norteamericano senalo que \"durante varios decenios la alianza EE.UU.-Japon sirvio de base de la paz y estabilidad de la region de Asia-Pacifico\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al mismo tiempo, el premier y otros gobernantes japoneses insisten en la necesidad de seguir manteniendo el \"Tratado de Seguridad\" EE.UU.-Japon para la \"estabilidad\" de la misma region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tales palabras muestran la malsana intencion de los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses de resistir y exterminar a las fuerzas progresistas en esta region y lograr su ambicion hegemonica y de nueva agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El fortalecimiento de la alianza EE.UU.-Japon significa el refuerzo de las fuerzas armadas agresoras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. emplaza enormes fuerzas armadas en los importantes puntos estrategicos militares y las zonas con abundantes recursos naturales bajo el rotulo de la \"estabilidad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El \"Tratado de Seguridad\" EE.UU.-Japon es para provocar la agresion y la guerra contra otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse tratado crea el peligro de guerra y amenaza la paz y la estabilidad de dicha region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu blanco principal es la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y Japon presentan como la demanda primordial de la estrategia sobre Asia-Pacifico aplastar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea tomando por trampolin el suelo surcoreano convertido en su base avanzada nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este contexto aumentan las tropas norteamericanas estacionadas en el Sur de Corea y lo convierten en el foco de guerra. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras que continuan las maniobras criminales de los reaccionarios norteamericanos y japoneses, no se puede lograr la paz ni la estabilidad en la region de Asia-Pacifico."
