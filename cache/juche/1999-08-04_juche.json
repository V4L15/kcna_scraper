            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman on peaceful use of  space \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today answered the question put by KCNA as regards the serious setback Japan suffered in its move against the DPRK at recent meetings of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the 32nd conference of the foreign ministers of ASEAN nations and the 6th \"ASEAN regional forum\", Japan was very hectic in its efforts to put a halt to the DPRK's re-launch of a satellite insisting its earlier launch was a \"missile launch\". And, over the results of the meetings it is making much ado,  asserting that its \"successful\" lobbying compelled participants of the meetings to express \"apprehension\" over the DPRK's \"missile launch\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Quite contrary to Japan's far-fetched argument that the DPRK's launch of a satellite was a \"missile launch\", all participants of the meetings described it as a \"payload launch\", which is tantamount to officially recognizing the satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\" which  the DPRK launched as a signal to start the building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This goes to prove that although Japan made desperate efforts to use the meeting of the \"ASEAN regional forum\" as an opportunity to inveigle the ASEAN nations into an anti-DPRK \"cooperation\" system in collusion with the United States and the South Korean authorities, most of the Asian and pacific nations are taking a cautious and vigilant approach to the wild ambition of Japan to become a military giant at any cost on the pretext of the DPRK's \"missile threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a deep-rooted bad habit of the Japanese reactionaries to attain their ill-intentioned purpose by faulting others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Potential threat to the Asia-pacific region does not come from the DPRK but from Japan which is working hard to realize at any cost its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" by stepping up nuclear weaponization and its conversion into a military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite Japan's dogged argument about \"launch of ballistic missile\" the DPRK's satellite launch has been recognized by the world and its scientific research aimed at the peaceful use of the space will gain further momentum. \r\n\r\n"

Top class criminals are still at large in Japan. This is the tragedy for human society and disgrace to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The international public circles are extending support and solidarity to progressive organizations and figures of Japan which are conducting activities for the liquidation of Japan's past crimes, including crimes related to the \"comfort women\" issue and forcible drafting in the teeth of the pressure and obstruction by the Japanese government authorities and right-wing reactionaries, the appeal pointed out.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese government authorities persistently deny the history of aggression and crimes and take the attitude of avoiding the responsibility for it, Korea will continue to struggle for the liquidation through generations and let them pay a high price at any cost, it said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We take this opportunity to call upon organizations and figures of Japan to invigorate their just struggle for smashing the unjustifiable moves of the authorities and liquidating Japan's past crimes including the crime related to the \"comfort women\" issue. \r\n\r\n"

They are waging powerful struggles of different forms including a street march, an over-night sit-in and a hair-cutting ceremony. Meanwhile, the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and Citizen's Solidarity for Democratic Society and other dissident organizations are conducting ceremonies for burning U.S. goods and movement for boycotting U.S. films, condemning the U.S. as \"cultural imperialists\" killing South Korean culture, the statement says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their struggle is an eruption of their pent-up indignation at the U.S. cultural infiltration and at the despicable flunkeyist and traitorous acts of the South Korean authorities and a patriotic struggle to prevent the withering of national culture and preserve the soul of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the Korean Film Workers Union vehemently denounces the South Korean ruling quarters' moves to open a market to U.S. films as an unpardonable anti-national flunkeyist and traitorous act of obliterating the excellent traditional culture of the Korean nation and blocking the South Korean moviemen's right to existence. It extends  full support and encouragement to the struggle of the South Korean people from all walks of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To root out the poisonous Yankee-style culture which is flooding South Korea and revive Korea's peculiar culture is the way of defending the country and the nation and accomplishing national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The moviemen and people of different social standings in South Korea should raise the flame of the anti-U.S. and anti-\"government\" struggle to  resolutely foil the attempt to open a market to U.S. films and defend and exalt the national culture. \r\n\r\n"

They are to rewrite or delete such points. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In fact, the Japanese militarist forces are fully ready for overseas aggression militarily, but they cannot do so, subject to the \"peace constitution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is, therefore, the stand of the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters to rewrite the \"peace constitution\" and legalize their moves for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the right of belligerency is legally guaranteed to them by the war-related legislation, they will be able to invade any countries as they please without any legal and institutional restrictions once the provisions of the present constitution banning overseas aggression are retrogressively revised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is what the recently endorsed bill is aimed at. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese reactionary quarters are truly desirous of peace, they should stop the moves for the retrogressive revision of the constitution. \r\n\r\n"
