Kim Jong Il's work supported \r\n Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- Kim Pyong Sik, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, made public a statement on August 23 supporting \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\", a celebrated work of Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n   He said:\r\n   \"This work is a platform for national reunification which consummates the undying exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung for national reunification and which comprehensively indicates all the principled matters related to the reunification of the country. It is also an immortal encyclopedia which can be worked out only by Secretary  Kim Jong Il who has inherited the Juche-based idea and line of the President on national reunification and his noble love for the country, the nation and the people.\r\n   \"The Korean Social Democratic Party will firmly preserve the Juche character and national character in the solution of the question of national reunification, reject flunkeyism and the idea of dependence upon outside forces and resolutely adhere to the principle of national independence. \r\nAt the same time, it will carry through the policy of great national unity and thus make a great contribution to firmly building up the internal force of national reunification.\"\r\n   \"We will further intensify the struggle to establish a unified nation-state based on confederation while removing obstacles lying in the way of national reunification and opening up a new epochal phase for the reunification of the country.\"\r\n   \"Under the present circumstances of the north-south relations which have been pushed to a more tense and acute phase than ever, we will unsparingly strive to make the south Korean authorities follow the policy of shaping the destinies of the country and the people from the stand of national independence hand in hand with the fellow countrymen, replace their anti-north confrontation policy with the reconciliation policy of alliance with the north and abandon the dangerous war policy. Besides, we will make strenuous efforts to ease the political and military confrontation between the north and the south and democratize the social and political life in south Korea.\"\r\n   \"In the work, the respected General said that if the south Korean authorities show an affirmative change in practice, the DPRK would meet with them any time to have an open-hearted negotiation on the destiny of the nation. Considering that this policy is of particular importance in improving the north-south relations, we maintain that the south Korean authorities should change their policy to correspond with this.\"\r\n  \"As pointed out in the work, the United States, Japan and other countries concerned should respect the sovereignty of the Korean nation and its will for reunification and actively help in the solution of the question of Korea's reunification\".\r\n\r\n"

Korean schools are excluded from the preferential measure related to taxes. Gangster-like acts of tearing down Korean national costumes at random are being committed in a systematic way in Japan.\r\n   The Ministry of Education of Japan urges Korean students in Japan to enter Japanese schools.

As a result, it has opened its missions abroad such as Cuba, Vietnam, Syria and Japan, established official relations with more than 100 foreign parties and organisations and grown to be a powerful militant organisation supported by many international bodies.\r\n   The NDFSK has conducted these activities in the teeth of harsh suppression by the successive rulers of south Korea.\r\n   The achievements and exploits the NDFSK has performed to discharge its mission and duty for the country and the nation for 28 years under difficult and arduous circumstances will be everlasting in history. \r\n\r\n"
