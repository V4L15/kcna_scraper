But common is that they are all hired by capitalists and live with wages they are paid for their exploitation. So it is natural that in the capitalist countries the working masses of different classes and strata strongly call for independent living and development against exploitation and oppression by capitalists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recent years witnessed big demonstrations in the U.S. and other capitalist countries in which the workers protested against the disparity in wealth and financial monopolistic capitalists. Not only the unemployed but the middle classes took part in the demonstrations unprecedented in scale in the history of capitalism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Capitalism is now plunging into the abyss of ruin in the face of the broad working masses' fight against daily-worsening political and economic crisis and exploitation and oppression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The capitalist class is trying hard to benumb the independent awareness of the working people and break down their unity in a desperate bid to weather the crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But capitalism is bound to go to ruin."
