In Essence, it means that they would suffocate them to death by keeping them in custody in South Korea where they have no blood relations.\r\n   We are disappointed at his remarks.\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters are advertising about \"reunion of separated families\" and \"solution of humanitarian issues.\"\r\n   If it had been true, they should have expressed their willingness to repatriate the unconverted long-term prisoners, which is vital to solving humanitarian issues and improving the relations between the north and the south.\r\n   We express once again our apprehensions over Kang In Dok's remarks that he would not solve such an urgent matter as repatriating the unconverted long-term prisoners.    \r\n \r\n"

Sinpho city on the east coast has several fishing bases--large Sinpho and Yanghwa fisheries, fishermen's cooperatives, culture farms and fishing sub-workteams.\r\n    Ports, major or minor, at these fishing bases are all mechanized and automated and can serve all types of fishing boats.\r\n   This area is provided with several ten-thousand-ton freezing factories, fish-processing centres, shipyard, ship-repair and fishing-tackle production centres.\r\n   Fisheries have scores of large, modern and all-purpose fishing boasts--12,000-ton processing mother ships, freezing-transport ships, 7,000-ton trawlers. They catch a lot of fish through deep-sea fishing, irrespective of weather.\r\n   The sea off Sinpho is Korea's leading pollack fishing ground.\r\n   The fisheries in the Sinpho area are engaged mainly in deep-sea fishing and properly combine inshore fishing with it all the year round.\r\n   The Sinpho fishery carried out its fish-catch quota under the six-year national economic plan (1971-1976) one year and a half ahead of schedule. Fisheries here play a big role in reaching the nation's fishing goal.\r\n   The processing bases here mass-produce frozen fish, pickled fish, fish-powder and salted fish eggs.\r\n   Fish is supplied across the country and exported in large quantities.\r\n   There are modern apartment blocks and modern villages, a house of culture for deep-sea fishermen and cultural centres, hospitals, polyclinics, schools, kindergartens and creches and trade networks.\r\n   There are also a fisheries college and technician training centres in fisheries and a fishermen's college, a part-time higher educational institution for fishing fleets.\r\n   Special state benefits are given to fishermen and there are a special supply centre and rest home for deep-sea fishermen.\r\n   Sinpho was desolate with some wooden boats before Korea's liberation. But now it has turned into a modern fishing industrial centre under the wise guidance and concern of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   He made a large state investment in the fishing industry here and gave personal guidance to it and looked after fishermen's life.\r\n   The Korean fishermen celebrate March 22 as their jubilee to mark that day in Juche 46 (1957) when he visited Sinpho and immortalize his exploits. Fihermen here are resolved to catch more fish.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
