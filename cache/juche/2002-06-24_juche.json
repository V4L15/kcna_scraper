            "content": "KCNA assails Japan's move for nuclear weaponization \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 24 (KCNA) -- Asahi Shimbun on June 17 disclosed the fact that a clandestine research into the possibility of nuclear weaponization has long been underway in Japan.\r\n Japan reportedly made a basic study of the nuclear policy between 1967 and 1970 and has stepped up the research into the nuclear weaponization since 1995. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cannot but be a very serious issue as the disclosure suggests that Japan, the first victim of nuclear disaster in history, has long pushed forward a plan for nuclear weaponization despite the public opposition at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since its defeat in the second world war, Japan has so far painted itself as a \"peace state\" and advocated \"exclusive defence\" at home and abroad. Japan has asserted a ban on nuclear tests, after identifying the \"three non-nuclear principles\" with the basic policy of its government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed fact, therefore, proves that the \"three non-nuclear principles\" have been used by the Japanese government as a fig-leaf to fool the anti-war, anti-nuke opinion since the very beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that a \"peace state,\" which adopted \"exclusive defence\" as its national policy, does not require any long-term research into nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can never overlook the reckless remarks made by politicians and senior government officials of Japan recently calling for access to nukes. They claimed \"it is possible to have nukes if they are for exclusive defence,\" \"it does not pose any problem for Japan to possess a-bombs, if they are small ones\" and \"Japan is capable of making thousands of nuclear warheads if it has a will\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These outcries fully reflect the position and policy of the government to go ahead with moves for nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhat it seeks is to emerge a nuclear weapons state from its former status of victim of nuclear attack and become a military power and start a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that these moves of the Japanese reactionaries have become more undisguised in step with the U.S. escalated moves to update nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hawkish forces of the U.S. administration recently decided to build a new plant producing plutonium fuses for nuclear warheads and conducted a sub-critical nuclear test despite the opposition of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of the U.S. bellicose forces and the Japanese reactionaries go to prove that both U.S. strategic offensive weapon reduction program and Japan's \"three non-nuclear principles\" are nothing but window dressing to cover up the U.S. intention to get a nuclear edge and Japan's aim to go nuclear and a pretext to justify their preparations for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are real nuclear war criminals. what they seek in persistently clamouring about the DPRK's non-existent \"nuclear issue\" has become as clear as noonday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to stop at once their base anti-DPRK campaign over \"nuclear issue\" and their reckless moves for a nuclear war which would bring horrible disasters to humankind. \r\n\r\n"

They made frantic preparations for a war against the northern half of Korea from the first days of their occupation of South Korea in September 1945 under the mask of \"liberator\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They framed up the \"defense headquarters\" that year and systematically armed the \"ROK\" armed forces with u.s. equipment, launching armed provocations along the 38th parallel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"AL-3\", a plan for the invasion of the northern half of Korea, was rounded off in the middle of 1949. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Macarthur called Syngman Rhee to Tokyo in February 1950 and gave him instructions to start a war in June, informing him that the \"ROK\" army will be put under the U.S. far eastern headquarters in an emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an \"11-point instruction\" recorded in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 17 Dulles flew into South Korea as a special envoy of the U.S. President to inspect the area of the 38th parallel and set June 25 as the day of starting northward invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told Rhee to start an attack, while propagandizing as if North Korea had invaded first so that the U.S. army, navy and air force could take part in the war under the name of the \"UN forces\" two weeks later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dulles had a secret conference with the commander of the U.S. far eastern headquarters, the secretary of defense and the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff in Tokyo on June 22 before giving \"combat order no. 29\" to Syngman Rhee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this order, the \"ROK\" army launched an over-all armed invasion of the northern half of Korea at 5 a.m. on June 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts clearly show the true colors of the U.S. imperialists who unleashed the Korean War.     \r\n\r\n"
