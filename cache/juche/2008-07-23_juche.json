Shortly ago, the U.S. forces side was so foolish as to inform the DPRK side that it would stage Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises from August 18 to 22, far from making an apology and giving assurances against the reoccurrence of similar cases to the guard personnel of the DPRK side who protested against the provocations. Timed to coincide with this, the U.S. announced that it would bring the latest super large Nimitz-class nuclear-powered carrier Ronald Reagan to Pusan Port of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear proof that the U.S. is keen to deliberately aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is perpetrating ceaseless military provocations against the DPRK, its dialogue partner, at this crucial time when diplomatic efforts are being made to settle the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. Its behavior is prompted by its calculation that if its military pressure and threat are escalated to keep pace with its diplomatic dialogue, it can discourage its rival, wrest an important political concession and boost its negotiating position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tells that the way of solving problems by strength still serves as a major lever for implementing the U.S. foreign policy and the American politicians are still obsessed with the outdated conception of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK clarified more than once, the policy of strength is not all-powerful and it does not work on the DPRK, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt of the U.S. to settle issues concerning the relations with the DPRK by strength would only lead the situation to catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time the U.S. and other countries concerned behaved themselves now that they are at the crucial phase of the process to settle the deep-rooted hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and achieve peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula by realizing the denuclearization of the peninsula. It is quite nonsensical for the U.S. to offer a handshake to its dialogue partner, while holding a dagger in its other hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be prudent, cogitating about the grave consequences to be entailed by its irresponsible behavior. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was an immortal exploit as he provided the nation with a powerful ideological and theoretical weapon for carrying out its cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme for the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo serve as the three charters for national reunification in which the fundamental principles and ways for national reunification are systematized and comprehensively dealt with in an integral manner on the basis of the immortal Juche idea and the precious experience gained by the President in the course of the struggle for the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President laid down the three principles-- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--, thereby providing the Korean nation with the fundamental stand and basic ways for solving the issue of national reunification by its own efforts in line with its will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proving the scientific accuracy and validity of the three charters for national reunification, the article says the struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration precisely means the development in depth of the struggle to carry out the President's Juche-oriented line and policy for national reunification and their successful embodiment.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
