            "content": "KCNA on Japan's moves to upgrade defence agency to ministry \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- The Japan Defence Agency reportedly decided to formally specify the issue of \"upgrading the defence agency\" in the white paper on defence to be announced in august. By the issue of \"upgrading the defence agency\" Japan meant to upgrade the defence agency to the \"defence ministry\" and develop its armed forces into regular armed forces.\r\n The right-wing forces of the Japanese political and military circles have been keen to reorganize the \"self-defence forces\" into independent regular armed forces but it is the first time that Japan decided to specify the issue in the white paper on defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that this attempt is made at a time when the right-wing politicians of Japan are becoming all the more undisguised in their moves to adopt the \"laws on emergency,\" a legislation of war for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suggests that Japan's wild ambition for turning Japan into a military power and its militarist moves to have a full-fledged position as a military power and set out to overseas aggression are being pushed forward as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Article 9 of the \"peace constitution\" stipulates that Japan, a war criminal state, shall not have regular army, navy and airforce and conduct collective military actions against other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is open secret that in recent years Japan has regained the right to participate in war and the right of belligerency through the adoption of the law related to the \"Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines\" and dispatched its aggression forces overseas under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\", thus rendering the \"peace constitution\" defunct little by little. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But if the defence agency is upgraded to the \"defence ministry\" and the \"law on emergency\" is adopted, the \"peace constitution\" will lose its validity of its own accord and Japan will be able to launch a preemptive attack on other countries anytime under the pretext of \"threat of armed attack\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the attempt to upgrade the Japan defence agency to the ministry is fraught with grave danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is the only brazen-faced country that is evading the redress for its past though it inflicted unbearable disasters upon humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that if Japan has regular armed forces and adopts the \"law on emergency\" in a bid to turn it into a military power and become a militarist country, it will rush headlong toward the reinvasion of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In that case, Japan will meet a more disgraceful defeat than what it suffered in 1945.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK government releases memorandum \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- The government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea released a memorandum on July 3 to hand down to posterity the immortal exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il for the reunification of the country on the occasion of the 30th anniversary of the July 4 Joint Statement.\r\n The president advanced the policy of north-south negotiations reflecting the requirement of the situation early in the 1970s and received the south side's representative who came here to participate in the north-south high-level political talks. There he laid down the three principles of national reunification --independence, peaceful reunification and the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, high-level political talks were held between the north and south on July 4, Juche 61 (1972) which resulted in the publication of the July 4 joint statement, keynote of which is the three principles of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that Kim Il Sung set forth the three principles, so that they came to serve as the reunification programme common to the nation, the memorandum hailed this as an immortal exploit to shine forever in the history of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a report made at the 6th congress of the Workers' Party of Korea held in October Juche 69 (1980) he advanced the proposal on reunifying the country by federal formula strictly based on the three principles. He also made public \"10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation for the reunification of the country\" in April Juche 82 (1993). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Kim Il Sung's far-reaching plan for achieving national reunification on those principles is being successfully implemented under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, the memorandum goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In his work \"Let Us Carry Out The Great Leader Comrade  Kim Il Sung's Instructions For National Reunification\" published on August 4, Juche 86 (1997) Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme for the great unity of the entire nation and the proposal for founding the democratic federal republic of Koryo as the three charters of national reunification which should be held fast to by the Korean nation. He thus provided a strong mainstay for reunification to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to his energetic leadership and patriotic bold decision that the historic Pyongyang meeting took place and the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration was published to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country's reunification should be achieved on the three principles and in line with the June 15 joint declaration based on them come what may in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is Kim Jong Il's fixed will and the consistent stand of the WPK and the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles and the joint declaration serve as the most realistic way of building confidence necessary for ensuring lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important in abiding by the principles and implementing the joint declaration is for the Koreans in the north and south to play their roles in a responsible manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The countries concerned should also do what they should do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the united states truly wishes to clear itself of \"worries over its security\" through dialogue with the DPRK, it should give up its \"strategy for Korean unification\" based on the \"system of liberal democracy\" advocated in the cold war era and refrain from hamstringing the Koreans' efforts to achieve reunification by observing the three principles and implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries concerned should support and encourage the north and the south of Korea in the efforts to observe the principles and implement the joint declaration to bring peace and reunification to the Korean peninsula.     \r\n\r\n"

In the statement the north and the south of Korea confirmed their will to reunify the country on the principle of reunifying the country independently without any outside interference, by peaceful means and through great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said the publication of the joint statement was an epochal event as it dealt a telling blow to the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad seeking dependence on foreign forces, war and division and showed all the fellow countrymen a bright prospect for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that it was a result of the distinguished and seasoned leadership of president Kim Il Sung who applied the Juche idea to the cause of national reunification, the reporter referred to the exploits the president performed for this cause until the last moments of his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter also noted that leader Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, advanced by the president, as the three charters of national reunification and provided the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, the banner of national reunification, to the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the important tasks to be carried out to preserve and implement to the letter the joint declaration so as to realize the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification, the reporter said: \r\n For the cause of national reunification to be realized, it is important to strictly adhere to the principle of reunifying the country by the united efforts of the Korean nation, work heart and soul for the thoroughgoing implementation of the joint declaration, prevent the danger of war created by outsiders and ensure peace and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" with the DPRK, while bringing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war after listing it as part of the \"axis of evil\" from the outset of the year. This, in fact, goes to clearly prove that the U.S. has not yet dropped its scheme to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its anachronistic policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should stop such acts as inciting confrontation and antipathy between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming the recent armed clash in the West Sea of Korea a continuation of the South Korean hawkish military forces' moves against the DPRK, peace and reunification, the reporter urged  the South Korean military authorities to admit the illegality of the \"northern boundary line\" and cease acting rashly, before blaming the north like the thief turning on master with a club. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad to decisively frustrate the moves of the warlike forces inside and outside Korea to ignite a new war and turn out as one in the anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle in order to save the destiny of the nation and achieve peace in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, it is necessary to achieve great national unity, transcending the difference in ideology, political view, system and religious belief, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Obstacles and difficulties still lie in the way of national reunification. But the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification is sure to be achieved as long as there are the legacy the president provided for reunification all his life and the leadership of Kim Jong Il over the work to successfully materialize his idea and plan for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among those present at the meeting were Kim Yong Sun, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of  Korea, Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the central committee of the Korean Social Democratic Party, Ryu Mi Yong, chairwoman of the central committee of the Korean Chondoist Chongu Party, and Kang Nung Su, minister of culture.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
