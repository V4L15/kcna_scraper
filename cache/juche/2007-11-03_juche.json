The trend of national cooperation is now growing stronger at a time when the desire for independence against the U.S. is rapidly mounting in south Korea, shaking the U.S. ruling system and getting the pro-U.S. sycophantic and traitorous forces there marginalized in the society. This development is the fruition of the above-said idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to firmly maintain the principle and stand of national independence, the basic idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are still forces that allow foreign forces to meddle in the issue related to the destiny of the nation or try to settle it in reliance upon them, away from the principle and stand of national independence even today when the history of the nation is guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" The Koreans should never tolerate this behavior, branding it as an act of treachery infringing upon the interests of the nation and spoiling the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean relations should be improved strictly on the principle of national independence, the idea of \"By our nation itself\" because this idea represents the idea of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This idea calls on all Koreans to put the common interests of the nation above all and unite on this basis, irrespective of idea, ism, political view, religious belief and the interests of classes and social strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For a Korean to remain faithful to the idea of \"By our nation itself\" or not serves as a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All countries and nations desirous of achieving and protecting independence should resolutely fight against the imperialist forces in close unity under the banner of independence against imperialism irrespective of population, territory, race, idea and political view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the people of all countries advocating independence firmly unite, can they successfully smash the imperialist forces' moves for interference and aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists have become evermore undisguised in their interference and aggression since the outset of the new century. All this is based on their upperhand of strength and their strength-almighty policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and other imperialist forces are working hard to divide the world into this or that category and sow the seeds of discord among countries in a bid to carry out aggression and war and dominate and subjugate other countries and nations with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are keen to rally those countries subservient to them as an allied force in an effort to dampen the progressive countries' spirit of independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the people of all countries in the world advocating independence are united closely as one, can they emerge independent forces against imperialism decisively superior to the imperialist forces, the article notes, adding that the unity of the independent forces against imperialism is an important and basic way for bringing imperialism to ruin and building a new independent world and a key to victory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
