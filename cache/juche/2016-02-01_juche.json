Korea \"Agreement\" on Sexual Slavery as Politically Motivated Artifice\r\n Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- KCNA issued an indictment on Jan. 31 as regards the fact that the issue of the unprecedented sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army spawned by the Japanese imperialists' colonial military fascist rule over Korea and their aggression of the continent in the past century is being misused by the hostile forces for attaining their sinister purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, talks were held between the Japanese and south Korean foreign ministers in Seoul on Dec. 28 last year all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks an \"agreement\" on the issue of sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army was announced at a lightening speed without leaving any official document required by provisions and procedures of international law as a result of Japan's impudent stand and south Korea's humiliating attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind Japan's recent negotiations with south Korea is the former's black-hearted intention to keep its history of past crimes buried into oblivion through the publication of the \"agreement\" and prevent it from being brought to the international arena again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the present south Korean ruling forces did recently, kowtowing to the U.S. and Japan, is the hideous sycophantic and treacherous acts which should be cursed down through generations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their shameless pro-Japanese behavior found a vivid manifestation in the facts that they refrained from uttering even a word of protest when Japan blustered 0.3 billion yen would be enough to solve the \"issue of comfort women\" and if it remains adamant, south Korea will move of itself and the former got facilities for forcible drafting of Koreans in the past registered as a world heritage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors is going foolish to lay a springboard favorable for their long-term office even by selling off the dignity and interests of the Korean nation and serving and yielding to the U.S. and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said \"agreement\" is a product of plots hatched by the U.S. by wire-pulling Japan and south Korea for the purpose of tightening its alliance with them from A to Z, the indictment noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years the U.S. has taken a lot of pain to clear the differences between Japan and south Korea in understanding the history, one of the biggest obstacle in the way of strengthening its alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. turned a blind eye to the Japanese chief executive and feigned ignorance of it when the latter craftily shunned the admission, apology and reflection on Japan's war of aggression against the Asian countries in the past. It even pretended to know nothing of the fact that he insulted many women who suffered the shame as sexual slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army by painting them as \"victims of the flesh traffic\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. put pressure on the south Korean authorities to cover up Japan's past crimes, claiming that it was necessary to go forward without looking back on history and it wished to see the south Korea-Japan relations back on tract during the south Korean chief executive's junket to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This diplomacy of appeasement and pressure on the part of Washington resulted in holding negotiations between rulers of Japan and south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive's U.S. junket was soon followed by the Japan-south Korea \"summit\" at which they promised to settle the issue of sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army till the end of that year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. was also deeply involved in the Japan-south Korea negotiations for reaching an \"agreement\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington strongly urged the talks between officials concerned and insisted that they were attended by high-ranking officials. This resulted in the talks between the foreign ministers of Japan and south Korea on Dec. 28 last year at which an \"agreement\" was made, leaving no written document.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the \"agreement\" was made according to the scenario of the White House to use its two stooges as a shock brigade for carrying out its aggressive strategy for dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said \"agreement\" characterized by high-handed, cunning and humiliating behaviors is the hideous politically-motivated swindle in the 21st century as it insulted and mocked at the Korean nation and human conscience for attaining the sinister goal of the war-like forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces should certainly pay for this thrice-cursed criminal act of disregarding international justice."

            "content": "ACNC califica de fraude politico el  \"acuerdo\" Japon-Sur de Corea sobre problema de esclavitud sexual \r\nPyongyang, primero de febrero (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que el problema de esclavitud sexual para el viejo ejercito japones, surgido en el siglo pasado a causa de la agresion al continente y la dominacion militar colonial y fascista del territorio coreano por parte del imperialismo japones, se malemplea por las fuerzas hostiles, la Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea hizo publica el dia 31 de enero el siguiente acta de acusacion:\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, el 28 de diciembre del ano pasado, se efectuaron apresuradamente en Seul las conversaciones de ministros de Relaciones Exteriores Japon-Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn esta cita ambas partes llegaron a un \"acuerdo\" sin dejar ni un documento oficial segun las formalidades legales internacionales, acordandose el cinismo de Japon y la actitud avasallante del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon se sento a la mesa de las presentes negociaciones a fin de dejar en el secreto de la historia sus crimenes del pasado e impedir la discusion de este tema en la palestra internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actitud de los gobernantes surcoreanos sirvientes de EE.UU. y Japon es el crimen antinacional y vendepatria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos no dijeron ni una palabra de protesta cuando Japon disparateo: \"se resolvera el problema de consoladoras con 300 mil millones de yenes\" y \"si persiste en su opinion el Sur de Corea lo aceptara\" e insistio sin escrupulos en registrar como patrimonios mundiales los establecimientos donde los coreanos sufrieron el trabajo forzoso por el imperialismo japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos traidores surcoreanos actuan como imbeciles para preparar el trampolin favorable a prolongar su mandato vendiendo la dignidad e interese de la nacion coreana y adulando y obedeciendo a ciegas a EE.UU. y Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente \"acuerdo\" es el producto de complot de EE.UU. que manipulo detras de la cortina de las negociaciones a Japon y el Sur de Corea a fin de consolidar la alianza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos el imperio se ha enfrascado en eliminar la discordia en el debate de la concepcion de la historia entre Japon y el Sur de Corea, tema considerado como mayor obstaculo en la consolidacion de la alianza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHizo la vista gorda cuando el gobernante japones eludio de modo astuto reconocer la guerra de agresion cometida en el siglo pasado por el imperialismo japones contra los paises asiaticos y pedir perdon por el respecto, y a la larga, insulto como \"victimas de trafico de seres humanos\" a las mujeres que sufrieron la vida de esclavas sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando la mandataria surcoreana realizaba una visita a EE.UU., le ejercio presion diciendo que \"hay que avanzar sin echar la vista atras a la historia\" y que \"EE.UU. desea la recuperacion de las relaciones Sur de Corea-Japon\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. indujo y coercio asi a los gobernantes de Japon y el Sur de Corea a hacer las negociaciones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, unos dias despues de la gira por EE.UU. de la mandataria surcoreana, tuvo lugar la Cumbre Japon-Sur de Corea, ocasion en la cual ambas partes comprometieron \"arreglar\" hasta finales del ano en curso el problema de esclavitud sexual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se entremetio en las negociaciones Japon-Sur de Corea para obtener el \"acuerdo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUrgio y coercio fuertemente a hacer las conversaciones de funcionarios de alto rango. De esta manera, el 28 de diciembre ultimo sostuvieron las conversaciones de ministros de relaciones exteriores Japon-Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"acuerdo\" sobre el caso de la esclavitud sexual para el viejo ejercito fue orquestado por la Casa Blanca que intenta utilizar a sus dos lacayos japones y surcoreano como brigadas de choque para el cumplimiento de la estrategia de hegemonia sobre Asia en el Nordeste Asiatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, el \"acuerdo\" caracterizado por el despotismo, la astucia y la bajeza es el fraude politico del siglo XXI de las fuerzas belicistas que pisotean y burlan la conciencia de la nacion coreana y la humanidad para ganar sus designios malintencionados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe saldara sin falta la cuenta final del crimen de las fuerzas hostiles que dan espaldas a la justicia internacional."
