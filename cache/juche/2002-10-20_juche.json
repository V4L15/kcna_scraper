This is a historical lesson the people should never forget, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n Modern imperialism is more crafty and vicious than old imperialism in the method of aggression and plunder, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This nature of modern imperialism finds a vivid expression in the fact that it is behaving more hypocritically than ever before while employing double-dealing tactics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The modern imperialists are pursuing a more crafty policy of aggression and war, styling themselves a guardian of peace and freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its good example is the slogan of anti-terrorism put up by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This nature of modern imperialism also finds a manifestation in the fact that it seeks to launch an undisguised armed invasion of those progressive and anti-imperialist independent countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. anti-terrorism war is now spilling into an over-all war to conquer those countries, going beyond the initial nature, purpose and limit of its military operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By escalating the war the U.S. seeks to threaten and militarily contain those counties which stand opposed to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, nothing but a desperate effort of the U.S. imperialists to get rid of a crisis of ruin as it only reveals its weakness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are seeking a way out in starting a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people should heighten the awareness and vigilance against the imperialists and keep themselves fully ready to react to their moves, not oblivious of the historical lesson that the imperialists are getting all the more crafty and unscrupulous as they are getting closer to their end.    \r\n  \r\n"
