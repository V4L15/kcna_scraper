            "content": "Japan's Building of Missile Shield under Fire  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- Recently the Japanese military deployed PAC-3s in the area south-west of Tokyo. Earlier, the military deployed missile defence installations made up of launching pad and radar in two bases around Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal scenario of the Japanese militarist forces is being translated into a reality as evidenced by the facts that Aegis destroyer \"Kongo\" of the Japan Maritime \"Self-Defence Force\" was deployed at the Sasebo base close to the DPRK to be ready to go into action after conducting its first test-fire of interceptor missile in the waters off Hawaii at the outset of this year and they announced a plan to increase the number of Aegis ships equipped with interceptor missiles to four. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed commentary carried in this connection: The Japanese reactionaries' moves to build missile shields reveal a very dangerous plan for reinvasion which should not be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the scenario of the Japanese reactionaries to cover their islands with a dense network of missiles and use them for making preemptive strikes at the DPRK any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tokyo Metropolitan governor Ishihara, a militarist fanatic, recently cried out for deploying a PAC-3 in the plaza of the \"Imperial Palace\" of Japan to make the people feel \"danger.\" This is little short of adding fuel to the fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for Ishihara, he is an icon of the ultra-right forces and a war maniac as he is steeped in bitterness toward the DPRK and chauvinism to the marrow of his bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His recent remarks represent the Japanese reactionaries' undisguised agitation for staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are pushing the DPRK-Japan hostile relations to the lowest ebb, while stepping up their moves to round off the preparations for launching reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir extreme hostile policy toward the DPRK is heightening the hatred of the army and the people of the DPRK toward Japan. Should the Japanese reactionaries persist in their moves for reinvasion, accelerating the building of missile shields targeted against the DPRK, this will entail catastrophic consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to bear this in mind and stop their rash actions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
