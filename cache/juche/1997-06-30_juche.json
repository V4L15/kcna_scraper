The north is dignified and famous for independence, self-sufficiency and self-reliance in defence.\r\n   It is self-evident that hostility and provocation to the north and increase of the danger of war will make peaceful reunification more distant and precipitate the moment of the nation's co-extermination.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime is increasing the degree of confrontation with the north to an intolerable extent, manipulating Chosun Ilbo to blow a heinous anti-north trumpet. The regime aims to remain in power till the expiration of its term even by putting the nation and the people on the altar of war.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, with a timebomb of joint suicide with the dying \"civilian\" dictatorship, is in a hopeless quagmire.\r\n   The press, whose mission it is to inform the people of justice and truth and serve social progress, has no room for such shameless and heinous plot-breeders and reactionary trumpeters as Chosun Ilbo. Unless Chosun Ilbo is removed, democratisation of the south Korean press is empty talk and a lie.\r\n   In the name of the people, the NDFSK bitterly denounces the unpardonable crime of Chosun Ilbo, which insulted the dignified northern system and made a frontal challenge to the desire of the nation and the people with a pen spoiled by hackwork for the Kim Young Sam dictatorship that is thrown into the dustbin of history.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo must immediately apologize for its despicable hackwork and antinational crime and explode itself.\r\n   Our patriotic-minded people will explode Chosun Ilbo and practically show how stern historical punishment is. At the same time, they will spot and severely punish the hackwriters of Chosun Ilbo who serve to retreat history and stain the national spirit. The officials and employees of Chosun Ilbo must lend an ear to the strong warning of national history and resign at once rather than die a dog's death as agitators for fascism, war and division.\r\n   All the people must no longer subscribe for Chosun Ilbo, the devil in press circles, but boycott the reptile press.\r\n   We are determined to fight on till Chosun Ilbo ceases to exist and is thrown into the dustbin of history. Time will prove the result. \r\n\r\n"
