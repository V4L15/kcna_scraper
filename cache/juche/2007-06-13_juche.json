The WPK set it forth as the main task of the ideological work to implant patriotic faith deep into the hearts of the popular masses and has steadily strengthened it. Under its wise guidance the Korean people have grown into revolutionaries of Juche type and true patriots making socialism their conviction and morality, and they are devoting all their strength and enthusiasm to the prosperity of the motherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To arm the whole society with socialist patriotism is the cardinal demand in firmly defending the Korean-style socialist system and the revolutionary gains from the imperialist aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the army and people of the DPRK are reliably defending the socialist system, their cradle of life, cherishing socialism as what keeps them alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries are resorting to every conceivable means to pull down Korean-style socialism.

They are the uninvited villains who put the half of Korea under their occupation under the mask of \"liberator\" after it was liberated from the colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists. They are the brigandish aggressor forces and a group of savage murderers who imposed calamities of war upon the Korean nation to grab the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush team's painting of the U.S. forces in south Korea as a \"war deterrent ensuring peace and stability\" is no more than window-dressing to cover up the criminal nature of the U.S. troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the U.S. forces' illegal occupation of south Korea, the Korean nation would have had a fundamentally different history: Korea would have not been divided into two parts and the Korean nation would not have faced the issue of national reunification, a cherished desire. All the Koreans would have achieved democratic development and national prosperity in one state under one and the same social system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush government is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can seek a way out of the bottomless quagmire in which it is now finding itself due to the daily worsening Iraq crisis, by operating its forces there the same way as done in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had better opt for pulling its forces out of south Korea and Iraq as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
