            "content": "Agrarian reform \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- After the liberation of Korea from the Japanese colonial rule in August Juche 34 (1945) the Worker's Party of Korea made the agrarian reform, a top priority for the building of a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In those days nearly 80 percent of the population were peasants in Korea. The peasants had centuries-old desire to do farming in their own fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agrarian reform was a prerequisite to freeing the peasants from feudal exploitation, rapidly developing agricultural productive forces and achieving prosperity of national industries and the national economy as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agrarian reform was urgently required to do away with the economic foundation of the reactionary forces, including landlords in rural villages and powerfully rouse the peasants, the driving force of the revolution, to the building of new Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That was why the President Kim Il Sung put forward the slogan \"land to the tillers \" and a unique policy of agrarian reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The policy was aimed at enforcing the agrarian reform on the principle of confiscation without compensation and distribution without charge and confiscating the land of the Japanese , pro-Japanese elements and traitors to the nation, the land of landlords who had more than five hectares of fields and the land rented out to others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK worked hard for the successful agrarian reform, true to the class policy of relying on the poor and hired peasants, isolating the rich peasants by allying with the middle peasants and liquidating the landlords. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 5th enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the central organizing committee of the Communist Party of North Korea that was convened on March 4, 1946, adopted a decision on the enforcement of the agrarian reform. The law on agrarian reform was promulgated on March 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK saw to it that more than 11,500 rural committees involving the poor and hired peasants were formed in North Korea, so that the reform was the concern of peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also dispatched teams to rural villages to support the reform. It mobilized all the political parties and public organisations to the struggle for successful agrarian reform. As a result, more than three million people of the New Democratic Party, the Democratic Party, trade union, the Democratic Youth League and women's union helped enforce the reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The historic task of the agrarian reform was carried out in a matter of some 20 days. \r\n\r\n"

It is a political charter and an undying great programme for great national unity for reunifying the country in reliance upon the efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The program was one more undying exploit he performed on behalf of the country, the nation, history and the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the people in the north and south of Korea and abroad should turn out as one in a patriotic struggle for national reconciliation and unity and the reunification of the country under the banner of the program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Implementation of the five-point policy of great national unity laid down by the Kim Jong Il is of weighty importance in achieving the great unity of the Korean nation. The policy is very instrumental in putting into practice the President's idea of great national unity and the programme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people should get united on the principle of national independence, the basis of the great unity of the whole nation. Only then is it possible to defend the rights and interests of the nation and shape the destiny of the nation independently in keeping with the will and requirements of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should achieve a firm unity for the country, the nation and reunification, transcending the interests of the classes and social strata irrespective of the differences in ideology, system, political view and religious belief under the banner of patriotism and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should also wage a vigorous struggle against outsiders, the main obstacle to national unity and reunification, and traitors following them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For great national unity it is of weighty importance for the whole nation to make mutual visits and contacts, develop dialogue and strengthen solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A firm will for national unity and national reunification makes it possible to achieve great national unity in defiance of any fascist suppression and obstruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Minju Joson today runs a by-lined article on this occasion. \r\n\r\n"

Korean \"ambassador\" to Russia \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- The South Korean \"ambassador\" to Russia in an interview with a Russian paper Rosinskaya Gazeta shamelessly justified the sinister aim of the \"sunshine policy\", letting loose a string of rubbish about the issue of Korea's reunification and the issue of the U.S. troops stationed in South Korea, according to the paper on March 30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a well-known fact that the \"sunshine policy\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities is a policy of confrontation and war full of rhetoric. This is evidenced by their ceaseless war exercises and arms buildup against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have consistently held that the South Korean authorities should not give lip-service to \"cooperation\" and \"reconciliation\" but make a switchover in their policy toward reunification and show their willingness to improve relations with the north in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their mere talk about \"cooperation\" and \"reconciliation\" is an empty talk and it cannot be construed otherwise than a window-dressing to conceal their anti-north confrontation policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the interview the \"ambassador\" went the length of talking such gibberish that 8 to 9 million \"divided families\" in South Korea look forward to meeting with their relatives in the north but do not pin any hope on reunification as it is unrealistic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an unpardonable insult to the aspirations of the Korean nation for reunification and clearly proves that the South Korean authorities' loudmouthed \"settlement of the issue of divided families\" is not aimed at reunification but seeks a sinister separatist aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"ambassador\" did not bother to talk nonsense that the U.S. troops in South Korea, the root cause of all misfortune and sufferings of the Korean nation, are \"playing an important role in preserving peace\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities have even an iota of national conscience and human dignity, they should stop orchestrating such balls intended to insult the nation's desire for reunification and justify their dependence on outside forces as what the \"ambassador\" to Russia said in a foreign country. \r\n\r\n"
