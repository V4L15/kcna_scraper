My maternal uncle An Haeng Gyo, who was associated with the is, lured me into boarding a ship bound for Pusan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is agents sought in tricking me into going to South Korea was to dream up the lie that there are \"refugees\" in the DPRK in a bid to tarnish the daily mounting international prestige of the DPRK, calm down the South Korean people's desire for reunification in alliance with communism and the north and fan up hostility towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I was told to engage myself in the anti-communist propaganda at the end of full-dress examination and brain-washing, but I refused to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unable to live any longer in the rotten South Korean society, a society with no future, I made up my mind to come back to the DPRK come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though I committed an indelible crime against the country I wanted to beg it to pardon me and have my body buried in my native home, after my death. this was my true feeling at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of several months' pain-staking efforts to escape from the South Korean society I succeeded in doing so, taking advantage of \"international marriage.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Back to the fold of the DPRK, I visited a relevent organ to make a confession of my crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He added that there remains his little Son Yu Yun ho in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the press conference Yu and his wife Choe Jong Nam held that their son's going to South Korea was entirely a product of the anti-DPRK plot of the is. The South Korean authorities should send him back without delay to the north to enable him to reunite with his parents, they urged.    \r\n\r\n"

This goes to prove that the present bush administration is a group of warmongers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready to react to the U.S. \"hardline policy\" and will never allow the u.s. conservative forces to encroach upon our dignity and sovereignty even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to ponder over the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
