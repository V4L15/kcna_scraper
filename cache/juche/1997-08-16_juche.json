We, therefore, proposed the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the United States and the U.S. military pullout from south Korea as agenda items of the talks.\r\n   But the U.S. refused to accept the issues and persisted in generalization of the agenda for discussion of other matters.\r\n   The U.S. position, contrary to the purpose of the talks, reveals that the U.S. is seeking an ulterior purpose through the talks.\r\n   The main reasons of instability in the Korean Peninsula are the belligerent relationship between the U.S. And the DPRK and the U.S. military presence in south Korea.  Obviously, the U.S. Is held responsible for no success in the preliminary meeting and instability in the Peninsula.\r\n   It is our irrevocable position of principle that peace in the Korean Peninsula needs the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S. and the withdrawal of U.S. troops from south Korea.\r\n   The U.S. must discard its unreasonable position and accept our realistic proposal.    \r\n\r\n"

He said in the statement that he met with a delegation of the Korean Chondoist Association of Pyongyang in Beijing in the autumn of 1993 and made every possible effort to reunify the country with all the fellow countrymen. But he resigned without keeping his promise to celebrate the centenary of the Kabo Peasant War jointly with the fellow believers in the north, owing to the obstructions of the south Korean authorities.\r\n   After arriving in the north he keenly felt that the people did a lot of construction and lived full of confidence and that all officials were very kind,  he noted.\r\n   \"I think it boundless honor to have come to this wonderful society led by the great General Kim Jong Il\", he said. \"I will devote my remaining days to achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country at an early date through the great unity of the whole nation and the concerted efforts of the nation, true to the Ten-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation clarified by President  Kim Il Sung\".\r\n   On the same day, he laid a bouquet and made respects before the Statue of the great leader President Kim Il Sung on Mansu Hill.     \r\n\r\n"
