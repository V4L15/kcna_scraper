The United States is reinforcing the armed forces of aggression in and around South Korea for the purpose of stifling the DPRK with strength. \r\n   The frantic war manoeuvres against the DPRK are leading the situation of the peninsula to an armed conflict and a phase of war.\r\n   The conservative hardliners of the United States are directing the arrow of their aggressive military strategy to the DPRK after the cold war in a bid to destroy the socialist bulwark.\r\n   The fact clearly shows what is the source of tension on the Korean Peninsula and from which side the threat of war comes. Accordingly, the question of ensuring peace and security on the peninsula should be discussed, focusing on removing the source of tension and war from the peninsula.\r\n   The international community, if it is truly interested in peace and security on the peninsula, should clearly see the situation of the peninsula and concentrate its efforts on removing the source of tension.     \r\n\r\n"
