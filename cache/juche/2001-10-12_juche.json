Kumgang tourism are slated to be held in October following the resumption of the north-south ministerial talks in September. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the dates of exchanging the 4th visiting groups of separated families and relatives and the Seoul visit of the Taekwon-do exhibition team are coming near. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But in South korea the whole army and police have been put on \"emergency alert\" under the pretext of what is happening abroad, thus creating an unpredictable atmosphere of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A \"perfect security posture\" is being called for at a \"national security council meeting\" or \"emergency state council meeting.\" And the military authorities are \"discussing measures against the movement of the Korean People's Army\" and urging their army to be fully ready to go into action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a dangerous act of going against the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, which calls for pooling efforts of the nation, and getting on the nerves of the north, a dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In such tense atmosphere of alertness smooth dialogue and travel can not be expected nor can there by any guarantee that an accidental event would not take place. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking into consideration the situation prevailing in South Korea, we cannot but postpone the exchange of the 4th visiting groups of separated families and relatives and dispatch of our Taekwon-do team to Seoul for the time being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We feel very regretful for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our steadfast and consistent will to develop dialogue and negotiation with the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from this stand, we will hold as scheduled the 6th north-south ministerial talks, the 2nd meeting of the north-south committee for the promotion of economic cooperation and the 2nd north-south authorities' talks to pep up Mt. Kumgang tourism slated for October. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We consider it reasonable to hold them in Mt. Kumgang area which we had already proposed and where security is guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the same time, we hope that the emergency alert will be lifted and a favorable atmosphere created soon in South Korea so as to exchange the visiting groups of separated families and relatives and Taekwon-do exhibition teams at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We believe that the south side will positively respond to our just measure.    \r\n\r\n"

Jangbaek\" and \"Mt. Sangbaek\" meaning that it is a mysterious mountain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made a particular mention of the three spectacular sceneries presented by Mt. Paektu, saying that it has open-hearted and dignified character of man and elegant and fascinating beauty of woman. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n O1e of the three sceneries is solemn and majestic landscape of the mountain. The sublime peaks of Mt. Paektu rising high and Lake Chon surrounded by them seem to embrace the whole universe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When seeing the peaks of Mt. Paektu and the majestic scenery of Lake Chon from the Janggun Peak, one may think that the fantastic nature was mysteriously created by heaven. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A vast primeval forest and ridges, big and small, surrounding it clearly visible from the Mudu Peak present picturesque scenery peculiar to Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A vast expanse of forest is bright with morning glow during the sun-rise and fog slowly sets in the forest, beginning from Mt. Sobaek in the evening. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can hardly claim that one has seen the landscape of Mt. Paektu without enjoying this fantastic scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Delicate and lovely is the landscape of Lake Samji standing against the background of peaks of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lake Samji with crystal clear water teems with fishes and wild ducks and flocks of deers and roe deers romp about, drinking water on its beach. It is reminiscent of a famous picture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people regard Mt. Paektu as the pride and honour of the nation, saying that the three spectacular sceneries presented by it fully represent the matchless pluck, invincible spirit, unbounded magnanimity and noble and benevolent personality of peerlessly great men and woman, the three generals of Mt.
