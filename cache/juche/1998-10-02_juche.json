            "content": "DPRF spokesman on S. Korean authorities' treason\r\n Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on October 1, denouncing the South Korean authorities for trying to sell Tok islet to Japan.\r\n   Tok islet is part of the inviolable territory of Korea.\r\n   The statement says:\r\n   It has been reported that a \"fishing agreement\" was recently concluded between the South Korean authorities and the Japanese reactionaries. The talks for the \"agreement\" had lasted two years and four months because of dispute over Tok islet.\r\n   In this connection, the \"Association for Study and Preservation of Tok Islet,\" fishery-related and other organisations and people of South Korea resolutely reject the \"agreement\" because it they say did not confirm the possession right over the islet, but included the islet in the waters of joint control with Japan, thus doing big harm to the interests of the nation and restricting the business right of fishermen.\r\n   The \"agreement\" is a treacherous one that abandons the dominium over Tok islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, and sells territorial waters to outside forces.\r\n   The South Korean authorities' bargaining with the Japanese reactionaries over Tok islet and its surrounding waters is a treacherous act just like the treason of the five traitors of 1905 as it ignores the fact that they belong to the territory and waters of the nation.\r\n   Tok islet was, is and will always be part of Korea's territory.\r\n   We make this clear once more. We do not recognise the treacherous and aggressive \"South Korea-Japan fishing agreement\" and declare the \"waters under joint control\" of 135 degrees and 30 minutes east longitude null and void.\r\n   The South Korean authorities must immediately stop the unprecedented treachery, mindful that their pro-Japanese treachery will precipitate their own destruction.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are mistaken if they think they can swallow the islet by manipulating the South Korean authorities who have no power of representation and sovereignty.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must act with discretion, mindful that the 70 million Koreans, who have deep grudges against Japanese imperialism that occupied Korea for more than 40 years, will never remain a passive onlooker to the Japanese militarists' moves for reinvasion.    \r\n\r\n"
