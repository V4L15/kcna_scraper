But they suffered a bitter defeat in the war by the President's unique military ideas, stratagem, commanding art and matchless pluck.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With his unique counter-offensive strategy, Kim Il Sung led the Seoul liberation operation to victory just three days after the outbreak of the war. Under his policy of uninterrupted attack operation, the Korean People's Army liberated over 90 percent of the southern part of the country and 92 percent of the population in a little more than a month.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His military wisdom and Juche-based tactics foiled all the U.S. operational plans such as \"general Christmas offensive\", \"summer and autumn offensives\" and \"scorched-earth operation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later, Clark, the then commander of the U.S. forces in the Far East and commander of the \"UN Forces\", wrote that the successes achieved by the Korean People's Army in the last Korean War were ascribable to the experienced command of General Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's victory in the war opened up a new era of advance in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle of the world's oppressed nations, giving a great encouragement to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Korean War, peoples of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia had won victories in their resistances against the U.S. imperialists and those of Lebanon and Jordan drove out the aggressors from their territories, while an anti-U.S. struggle was intensified in Cuba and other Latin-American countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why the world progressives have praised Kim Il Sung as the iron-willed Songun commander who led the Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. imperialist aggressors to the victory and the great hero produced by Heaven."

Korea into Human Rights Tundra\r\n Pyongyang, April 16 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute issued a white paper Saturday to denounce the Park Geun Hye group of traitors for turning south Korea into the world's worst veritable hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t The white paper cited facts to prove the south Korean economy faced worst crisis, its people is mired in dire destitution, big disasters occur in an unbroken chain and all kinds of crimes, corruption and irregularities are prevalent in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The document said Park Geun Hye pushed the south Korean economy into the worst catastrophic phase, far from achieving \"economic prosperity\" which she trumpeted about so loudly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the conclusion of the humiliating \"Free Trade Agreement\" 83 percent of trade items of south Korea were nudged out of competition and more than 50 percent of export-oriented businesses are suffering losses. The reeling economies in the neighboring countries caused the export volume of south Korea, a key factor which keeps its economy afloat, undergo a continued dwindling. It showed 12.2 percent cut-down in February this year as against the same month last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The yearly average economic growth rate for the past three years of Park Geun Hye in office failed to reach two thirds of that during the years of Kim Dae Jung and Roh Moo Hyun, far less than that during the Lee Myung Bak regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBig businesses which faced bankruptcy later last year number 54, 37 percent increase from 2012, and the number of big businesses which are not able to pay interests with their own business profits stands at 567. More than 2,000 minor businesses producing export goods went bankrupt en masse which splashed to the overall manufacturing field, leading to the shutdown of over 90 000 minor businesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present the number of jobless people stands at over 4.5 million or 23.3 percent increase from that three years ago, and the number of underemployed hits 10 million. The jobless rate of young people, in particular, hits the record high of 12.5 percent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The total amount of debts of south Korea runs into astronomical figures, the amount its population has to pay for several years without any consumption. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe shutdown of the Kaesong Industrial Zone put over 6,000 businesses on the verge of bankruptcy and left 124,000 workers unemployed overnight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The action taken by south Korea to scuttle the north-south economic cooperation reportedly brought direct or indirect losses worth tens of billions of USD to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During Park Geun Hye's three years of office the south Korean people have been driven into the slough of poverty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The absolute paupers in south Korea now number over 5.7 million and there are millions of people who are unable to get rid of poverty no matter how hard they work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gap between the rich and the poor in income has become 12 times wide though it was 8.8 times ten years ago and a handful of the rich holds 45 percent of total income, making south Korea the worst region in Asia in terms of inequality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Park Geun Hye's assumption of office the whole land of south Korea has been torn with huge disasters and accidents, causing uneasiness and horror among the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example is the sinking of ferry Sewol in April 2014 that shocked the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year alone 2 740 cases of ship-related accidents occurred, which is twice as many as that in 2012, leaving 112 dead or missing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In less than one year and a half since Park took office, more than 50 big accidents of various kinds occurred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today south Korea tops the world's list of traffic accidents.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe number of workers who suffered due to industrial disaster in 2014 numbered over 240 on a daily average, over 90,000 in total in a year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All kinds of crimes, corruptions and irregularities have become endemic in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since Park's coming to power, the number of crimes of various kinds was recorded over 6 000 on a daily basis and over 2 million on a yearly basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The size of illegal economy relying on prostitution, gambling and drug-trafficking has snowballed to reach 390 billion USD or 26 percent increase from 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe yearly number of those committing suicide is over 15,000, making south Korea top the world list.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group which reduced south Korea into the veritable hell and decadence-infested cesspool is still talking about \"human rights\" of someone and trumpeting about \"economic growth with emphasis on job creation\" and \"building happy and lively society\". But this is the height of impudence and hypocrisy, the white paper stressed."

The U.S. administration bereft of impartiality had better review its policy over the sensitive international issues, the issue of global security, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail and joint military drills are the source of pushing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has posed a ceaseless nuclear threat to the DPRK, deploying nuclear weapons in south Korea and staging frantic nuclear war drills against the DPRK for over half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even at this time the largest-ever U.S.-south Korea nuclear war saber-rattling is under way in south Korea for invading the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Key Resolve joint military drill, a combined command exercise in which all U.S. man-killing nuclear hardware and special operation forces were involved, came to an end but Foal Eagle 16 joint drill, rehearsal for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK under the simulated conditions of an actual war, is going on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces staged \"operation for advancing into inland depth of the north\", \"operation for occupying Pyongyang\", \"beheading operation\", etc. in the land and seas by mobilizing special operation forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their nuclear war rehearsal for aggression clearly proves once again what is the root cause of escalating tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear weapons is not a threat but an inevitable self-defensive option for protecting the country and nation from the nuclear disaster to be brought by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's bolstering of nuclear deterrence is the most just and realistic way for ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, the biggest hotbed in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stronger the striking capability of the DPRK's nuclear weapons grows, the more powerful the capability to deter aggression and war will become.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing can deny the validity of the DPRK's measures to bolster up its nuclear deterrence for self-defence."

            "content": "IRP revela crimenes de lesa humanidad de banda de Park Geun-hye \r\nPyongyang, 16 de abril (ACNC) -- El Instituto de la Reunificacion de la Patria (IRP) hizo publica el dia 16 una carta blanca para revelar con datos concretos los tremendos crimenes de la banda traidora surcoreana de Park Geun-hye que convirtio el suelo surcoreano en el infierno humano. \n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la nota, en el Sur de Corea la economia se encuentra en la peor crisis, la poblacion vive en la penuria, ocurren sucesivamente los accidentes tragicos y reinan los crimenes, las depravaciones e inmoralidades de toda indole. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye llevo la economia surcoreana al dilema, a contrapelo de su insistencia en la \"rehabilitacion economica\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la firma del avasallante \"Tratado de Libre Comercio\", el 83% de las variedades mercantiles del Sur de Corea fue retirado en la competicion comercial y el mas de 50 % de las empresas de exportacion sufre danos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl empeoramiento economico de los paises vecinos afecto a la economia surcoreana, debido a lo cual el valor de exportacion se reduce de continuo, y en febrero de este ano, se disminuyo el 12.2 % mas que en el mismo mes del ano pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante tres anos de mandato de Park Geun-hye, la proporcion anual del crecimiento economico llego a menos de dos tercios que en los periodos de mandato de Kim Dae Jung y Roh Moo Hyun y es inferior que en el tiempo de mandato de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA finales del ano pasado, 54 empresas grandes se enfrentaron con la crisis de bancarrota con el incremento de 37% en comparacion con el ano 2012, las otras 567 no pudieron pagar el credito con sus propias ganancias, y mas de 2 mil companias pequenas y medianas se encontraron colectivamente en la quiebra, causando la bancarrota de mas de 90 mil companias de industria manufacturera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora el numero de desempleados llega a mas de 4 millones 500 con el aumento de 23.3% en comparacion con el ano 2013. Y los subempleados llegan a 10 millones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, la tasa de desempleo de los jovenes marca el record de 12.5%. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora las deudas del Sur de Corea llegan a la cifra astronomica que la poblacion surcoreana debe pagar durante varios anos sin hacer algun consumo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la ruptura de la Zona Industrial de Kaesong, mas de 6 mil empresas caen en la crisis de bancarrota y mas de 124 mil obreros quedaron desempleados en un dia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa destruccion de la cooperacion economica con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea causo los danos directos o indirectos valorados en decenas de mil millones de US$.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante tres anos de mandato de Park Geun-hye, la vida de la poblacion surcoreana se ha empeorado mas que nunca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora en el Sur de Corea mas de 5 millones 700 mil personas pertenecen a la capa de pobres absolutos y unos millones de personas no se liberan de la pobreza aunque trabajan mucho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa diferencia de ingreso entre los ricos y los pobres se aumento a 12 veces desde 8.8 veces de hace 10 anos y un punado de los ricos ocupa el 45 por ciento de toda la ganancia, de manera que el Sur de Corea se evalua como pais con la mas  grave desigualdad en la region asiatica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues de que Park Geun-hye ocupo Chongwadae, en el territorio surcoreano ocurrieron sucesivamente la catastrofe de gran tamano y los accidentes haciendo temblar por la inquietud y el susto a los habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejemplo tipico es la gran catastrofe del hundimiento del barco \"Sewol\" de abril de 2014 que espanto a todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En 2015 ocurrieron 2 mil 740 accidentes maritimos de barcos, 2 veces mas que 2012 y 112 personas murieron o desaparecieron.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En un ano y medio y pico del mandato de Park Geun-hye ocurrieron mas de 50 accidentes de gran tamano de varios tipos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy en dia el Sur de Corea se llama como primera region del accidente de trafico en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El numero de obreros damnificados por las calamidades industriales en 2014 llego a mas de 240 personas como promedio diario y a mas de 90 mil en un ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta en boga toda clase de depravaciones e inmoralidades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Despues de la toma del poder por parte de Park Geun-hye, ocurrieron cada dia mas de 6 mil incidentes criminales de todo tipo y mas de 2 millones cada ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El tamano de la economia ilegal con la prostitucion, el juego de azar, el narcotico y otros negocios llega a 390 mil millones al aumentarse en 26 por ciento en comparacion con 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora el Sur de Corea se llama primer \"reino de suicidio\" en el mundo con mas de 15 mil suicidas en un ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aunque convirtio el Sur de Corea en el infierno de la humanidad y el fondo de zanja corrupto, la banda de Park Geun-hye aboga por los \"derechos humanos\" de alguien y todavia disparatea sobre el \"crecimiento de la economia poniendo en su centro el empleo\" y la \"construccion de la sociedad feliz y vigorosa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto es la culminacion de cinismo."
