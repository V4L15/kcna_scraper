This is an act trampling down the desire of the May 18 uprisers and a challenge to the South Korean people who are fighting in the spirit of the uprising.\r\n   Though the present regime is styling itself a \"people's  government,\" it has already revealed its true colors as a traitorous regime surpassing the \"civilian\" dictatorial regime in the anti-democracy, anti-nation and anti-reunification nature.\r\n   The history proves that the desire of the Kwangju uprisers can be realised only through the struggle against the U.S. and the group of pro-U.S. flunkeyists, traitors and fascists.\r\n   All the people should blame the United States, the real tuler of South Korea, for the tragic Kwangju bloodbath, make it apologize for the massacre and put an end to its colonial rule through a powerful anti-U.S. struggle.    \r\n\r\n"

So, it is nonsense that Ri Tong Gu and others called for \"leftist revolution and violent demonstration\" on May Day.\r\n   Such a sedition charge can be invented only by those who try hard to brutally suppress workers' struggle for democracy and vital rights.\r\n   The puppets are making desperate efforts to divert elsewhere public resentment against them, only to reveal their true colors as fascists little different from their predecessors.\r\n   The puppets had better know that if they continue suppressing the people's righteous struggle with such a plot which cannot work on the awakened people, they will meet a disgraceful end.    \r\n\r\n"
