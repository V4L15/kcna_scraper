In order to achieve this aim, the U.S. insists that its forces should stay in South Korea as \"war deterrent forces' because of the possible start of a war by someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In other words, the United States seeks to convince the South Korean people of the need for the U.S. forces presence in a bid to perpetuate  it and ignite a war at the best time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The projected \"commemorations of the half centenary of the Korean War\" are to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. bellicose elements' loudmouthed \"possible conflict\" and strengthened \"military cooperation\" with the South Korean authorities are intended to exacerbate the situation  and increase the danger of war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The U.S. warmongers are the chief architect of the Korean division and arch criminal escalating tensions. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article describes this as a hypocritical act of covering  up the true face of the U.S., a source of arms race and escalating tensions, and of trying to realise the policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. President proposed to allocate 305.4 billion dollars as military spending in the government budget for fiscal 2001 recently submitted to the congress. If  this is approved, the U.S. annual military spending will increase to the maximum for the second time after the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the final strategic aim of the U.S. to obliterate the world's independent forces against imperialism and to reduce the world into the unipolar world under its control by pursuing the policy of strength. The U.S. plans to allocate a huge amount of money for military expenditure to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is engaged in the development of the \"missile defence\" system and tries to amend or repeal the \"ABM\" treaty it signed with the former Soviet Union in 1972. When things go as it wishes, the present international disarmament process will come to a stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. conducted another sub-critical nuclear test on Feb. 3 and is pushing ahead with the development of researches and development of new nuclear weapons. That is a vicious challenge to humankind aspiring after disarmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though the U.S. is talking about \"peace\", it is escalating tensions to retake its position in various countries and regions around the world and to maintain and expand its domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S has amassed armed forces in northeast Asia, staging war maneuvers and is attempting to stage a military adventure against the DPRK by mobilizing all the armed forces  in the U.S. mainland and the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is running amuck to dominate and subordinate other countries and nations with the loudmouthed \"disarmament\" and \"peace\" as the people's struggle against domination and subordination is gaining momentum and the moves towards the establishment of a new international order are strengthened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The world's revolutionary people should have a good understanding of the U.S. changed method of aggression and its danger and heighten their vigilance against its loudmouthed \"disarmament\" and \"peace\". \r\n\r\n"
