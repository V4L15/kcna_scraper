This reflects his wrong conception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. says that it has no hostility toward the DPRK, but it has not yet departed from the inveterate conception of confrontation. That is why it regards the launch of a satellite for peaceful purposes as a launch of long-range missile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK invited foreign experts and journalists to clearly observe its satellite launch so as to prove with transparency that it is part of scientific and technological work for peaceful use of space irrelevant to any military purpose. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK also invited experts of the U.S. National Aeronautics Space Agency so that they can witness for themselves the peaceful nature of the satellite launch in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and the U.S. took much effort to sign an agreement, creating a favorable situation. There will be no reason whatsoever for the DPRK to launch a long-range missile at this time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the behests of General Secretary Kim Jong Il to launch a working satellite to mark the 100th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung and it is a routine work that was planned and has been pushed forward from long ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks, the DPRK consistently maintained that a moratorium on long-range missile launch does not include satellite launch for the peaceful purposes. As a result, the DPRK-U.S. agreement dated February 29 specified a moratorium on long-range missile launch, not \"launch of long-range missile including satellite launch\" or \"launch with the use of ballistic missile technology\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   The DPRK will not give up the satellite launch for peaceful purposes, which is a legitimate right of a sovereign state and requirement essential for economic development\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. chief executive said that he has no hostility toward the DPRK. If it was sincere, he should drop the confrontation conception of standing in the way of the DPRK, though belatedly, and make a bold decision to acknowledge that the DPRK also has a right to launch satellites. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the U.S. applies double standards to the DPRK's satellite launch or not will prove the sincerity of the U.S. chief executive's remarks."

            "content": "MINRX rechaza la pauta de doble rasero en el lanzamiento de satelite \r\nPyongyang, 27 de marzo (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que el presidente estadounidense acuso injustamente a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de su plan de lanzamiento del satelite artificial con fines pacificos, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio el dia 27 la siguiente respuesta a la ACNC: \n\t\t\t\t\tEl maximo gobernante de Estados Unidos censuro el plan de la RPDC de lanzar el satelite cientifico-tecnico con fines pacificos como \"provocacion que amenaza la paz y la seguridad internacionales\", lo cual parte de un concepto erroneo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. habla de que su pais no tiene la voluntad hostil a la RPDC, pero no se ha liberado de la anacronica concepcion de enfrentamiento, razon por la cual considera el lanzamiento  de tal satelite de esta como lanzamiento de misil de largo alcance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara mostrar con transparencia que el lanzamiento del satelite no tiene nada que ver con algun  objetivo militar sino es una labor cientifico-tecnica para el uso pacifico del cosmos, hemos invitado hasta a los especialistas y periodistas de otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que hemos invitado a los especialistas de la Administracion Nacional de Aeronauta y del Espacio de EE.UU., ellos podran confirmar con sus propios ojos en nuestro pais el lanzamiento del satelite con fines pacificos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC ha aprobado dificilmente el acuerdo con EE.UU. y hecho transcurrir favorablemente tambien la situacion. Por eso no tiene ninguna razon ni necesidad de lanzar misil  de largo alcance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLanzar un satelite de usos practicos con motivo del centenario de natalicio del Presidente Kim Il Sung es el legado del Dirigente Kim Jong Il y una labor normal planeada y promovida desde hace mucho tiempo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las conversaciones de alto nivel RPDC-EE.UU. hemos insistido invariablemente en que el lanzamiento del satelite artificial con fines pacificos no se incluye a la suspension provisional del lanzamiento de misil de largo alcance. Como resultado, en el acuerdo del 29 de febrero RPDC-EE.UU. esta anotada la \"suspension provisional del lanzamiento de misil de largo alcance\", lejos de \"lanzamiento de misil de largo alcance incluso el de satelite\" o \"lanzamiento mediante el uso de la tecnologia de misil balistico\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo renunciaremos jamas el lanzamiento del satelite con fines pacificos que constituye el derecho legitimo de Estado soberano y el requisito para el desarrollo de la economia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el maximo gobernante estadounidense no tiene la voluntad hostil a la RPDC, como dijo, debe liberarse de la concepcion de enfrentamiento de dimpedir el avance de esta y reconocer con bravura que la RPDC tambien tiene, al igual que otros paises, el derecho a lanzar el satelite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe distinguira la sinceridad de la hipocresia de las palabras del maximo gobernante estadounidense, segun EE.UU. aplique o no la pauta de doble rasero sobre el lanzamiento del satelite con fines pacificos de la RPDC."
