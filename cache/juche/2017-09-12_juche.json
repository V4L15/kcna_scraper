They call for increasing it to over 1 ton.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are bluffing that the increase of the warhead weight to over 1 ton would be enough to \"destroy the fortified commands and underground installations of the north with ease\" and \"get possessed of military deterrence capable of coping with the threats from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It seems that the puppet forces totally lost the ability of the discerning the situation and the sense of direction, being upset by the eventful successes made by the DPRK in completing the nuclear force of the country and its continued tough offensive against the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now ICBMs of the DPRK go across continent and oceans and fly into space and the detonation of super power thermonuclear weapon H-bomb is shaking the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the might of our strategic weapons that they have been put on a high scientific and ultra-modern basis capable of making precision strikes at any enemies wherever they might be and from which direction they may come in attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous to try to find a way out in increasing the missile warhead weight by clinging to the master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will only bring into bolder relief the deplorable plight of the colonial stooge at the beck and call of the U.S., being unable to make its own decision over even such issue as the warhead weight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the DPRK took measures for bolstering its nuclear force targeting the U.S., the south Korean puppet forces resorted to reckless military provocations raising louder hue and cry than others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. used to bind the puppet forces in fetters of \"missile guidelines\" and never allowed them to move even an inch without its approval.
