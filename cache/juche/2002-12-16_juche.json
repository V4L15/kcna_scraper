They even went so far as to openly declare a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not a weak country which will give in to pressure and war threat from any country or abandon its independent option. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK regard their dignity and sovereignty as their life and soul and never tolerate those who encroach upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who dare unleash a war can not escape from the merciless strike by our armed forces built up under the army-based policy wherever they may be in the earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces and their followers should not act rashly, mindful that our warning is not an empty word.    \r\n\r\n"

In this regard South Korean organizations on Dec. 12 issued commentaries and a statement denouncing the U.S. , according to a news report.\r\n The south headquarters of the national alliance for the country's reunification in a commentary said that the U.S. piracy is a dangerous act as the U.S.  hard-line hostile policy toward the north has entered the phase of using strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing the dangerous act of confrontation aimed at a war we have once again confirmed who is chiefly to blame for the war crisis on the Korean Peninsula, the commentary said, dismissing such undisguised move of the U.S. as nothing but a trick to inflict war calamities upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It held that the united states should stop anti-north provocations at once, act as a party concerned for the realization of the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula, conclude a non-aggression treaty with the north and guarantee it in practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-U.S. , anti-war and anti-nuke joint conference in a commentary condemned the recent case as the U.S. violation of international law and such encroachment upon the sovereignty of the north as invasion of the territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly know that if it tries to continue interfering in the �gpresidential election�h and other internal affairs of Korea while straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula, the Korean people will never tolerate it, the commentary stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The (South) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions in a statement said that the U.S.  groundlessly captured the north's ship, motivated by a scheme to throw a wet blanket over the ever-mounting anti-Americanism in South Korea in the wake of the murder of schoolgirls and intervene in the �gpresidential election�h as well as a purpose to interrupt all things going on against the intention of the U.S.     \r\n\r\n"

It asserted that it is difficult to successfully conduct inter-Korean economic cooperation and make public a joint press release unless �gnuclear issue�h is solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis rendered the agreement reached by the two sides through a two-day discussion vain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that the meeting ended without any result because the U.S.  put unreasonable pressure upon the South Korean authorities as part of its interference in their internal affairs under the pretext of the Dec. 12 statement issued by a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry as regards the U.S. stop of supply of HFO that had been under way under the DPRK-U.S.  Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a buzz in South Korea that the meeting proved unproductive owing to the outside pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. blustered that neither overland tour of Mt. Kumgang nor inter-Korean exchange is possible without a prior-consent of the �gUN Forces.�h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Senior officials of the U.S. departments of defense and state flew into Seoul one on the heels of the other to force the South Korean authorities to slow down the mine-clearing and advised them not to promote north-south economic cooperation unless �gthe nuclear issue�h is solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these actions taken by the U.S.  to interfere in and hamstring north-south economic cooperation are an undisguised infringement upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation and moves to bar the nation from achieving reconciliation, cooperation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be wholly accountable for having rendered the meeting fruitless and obstructed the efforts to reenergize economic cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is preposterous to assert that our nuclear power bases pose a threat while nuclear power plants in other regions and countries raise no problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's measure to resume the operation and construction of its nuclear facilities to generate electricity does not pose any threat to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.  is deliberately straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula as evidenced by the piracy committed by it against a DPRK trading cargo ship on normal voyage for trade in the wake of its stop of heavy oil supply. All this is intended to calm down mounting anti-Americanism and drive a wedge between the north and the south in a bid to freeze the favorably developing inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean people are called upon to heighten vigilance against such moves and condemn the U.S. so as to foil them.    \r\n\r\n"

Theirs is an entirely just struggle reflecting the unanimous desire of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, styling itself the state with the �gworld's best human rights record,�h cracked down upon this just struggle of South Koreans, stunning the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. police walked away a Korean woman resident in the U.S.  when she was on a protest sit-in strike together with the America-visiting group of South Koreans led by priest Han Sang Ryol, in front of the White House. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable challenge to the Korean nation demanding the punishment of the GI killers and one more barbaric act of touching off the nation's bitter hatred and wrath against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also a clear proof that the U.S. is keen on humiliating, mocking at and hating the Korean nation as it has not yet sincerely repented of the GIs' killing of girl students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. undisguised insult, persecution and suppression of Koreans not only in South Korea but in its mainland are touching off the Koreans' towering indignation at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK takes a very serious note of the recent U.S.  police violence because it is an issue not confined to an overseas Korean but a violation of the dignity and sovereignty of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should certainly be made to pay for the blood shed by Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should apologize to the Korean people hundred times, clearly aware that gone are the days when it could violate the life and dignity of South Koreans as it pleased while lording it over South Korea after occupying it.    \r\n\r\n"

The assertion is a base move to isolate the DPRK internationally and a cunning trick to justify the U.S.  efforts to stifle the DPRK with nuclear arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK put forward a landmark proposal to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. with a view to clearing the Korean Peninsula of military confrontation and tensions and preventing a war, the DPRK has exercised maximum patience and self-restraint even under the worst situation where the U.S.  put the AF on the verge of collapse and is posing real nuclear threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should be mindful that this is not an expression of the feeble-mindedness and weakness of the DPRK at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains unfazed as it has made full preparations to cope with the confrontation and clash with the Yankees. \r\n The army and people of the DPRK with burning hatred for the Yankees are in full readiness to fight a death-defying battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will get nothing in the showdown with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well advised to be aware of this, rectify such a historic mistake as breaking the AF and adopt a proper option.    \r\n\r\n"
