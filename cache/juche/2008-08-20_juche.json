            "content": "KCNA Terms Ulji Freedom Guardian Criminal Saber-Rattling \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces are staging Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercises currently underway according to the U.S. war scenario are premeditated war actions aimed at a preemptive attack on the DPRK and an adventurous saber-rattling to escalate military confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is instigating the bellicose Lee Myung Bak \"government\" to incite confrontation with fellow countrymen in a bid to ignite a new war on the peninsula at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. changed Ulji Focus Lens, the codename of the joint war exercises, into Ulji Freedom Guardian as part of the arrangements for the transfer of the \"rights to command the wartime operations\" due in 2012 and brought about a change in the \"commanding system\" so that the south Korean military might spearhead the operations. This is aimed to prepare the south Korean puppet army as a shock brigade for a war of aggression against the DPRK from A to Z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks the sinister purpose of increasing the independent capacity of the south Korean puppet army to plan and carry out operations in a bid to boost the ground operation capacity by using it as a bullet shield and raise the effect of the U.S. forces' medium- and long-range precision strikes and rapid task strikes at strategic bases in the DPRK in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces and the south Korean puppets have staged DPRK-targeted coordinated ground operations and drills for air strikes one after another, systematically expanding their scales and contents. This time they launched commanding post exercises by use of latest equipment with nearly 70,000 troops involved. These are grave war maneuvers driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea blustered that the transfer of the rights to command the wartime operations to the south Korean army would help tighten the south Korea-U.S. alliance and the first Ulji Freedom Guardian exercises would provide a good opportunity for doing the job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The on-going war exercises have brought to light their aggressive and dangerous nature as they are aimed at rounding off the military preparations of the U.S. forces and the south Korean puppet army for invading the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is busy staging war exercises to attack the DPRK on the ground and in the sea and the air almost everyday, while talking about the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations at the negotiating table. It is, at the same time, equipping the south Korean puppet troops with ultra-modern war hardware, egging them on to confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-south Korea war exercises are military actions quite contrary to the requirements of the reality and the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the U.S. talking that it has no intention to attack the DPRK has neither persuasive power nor truth and it is no more than a deceptive artifice to disarm the army and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better act with reason, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by its anti-DPRK military hysteria designed to torpedo talks and harass peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He thus taught his family members to live a worthy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe not only let his sons and grandsons take part in revolutionary struggle but also fought resolutely against the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFrightened by the increasing influence of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army organized and led by President Kim Il Sung, the Japanese imperialists came to the native home in Mangyongdae and forced him in every conceivable way to make his grandson \"convert\". But he remained faithful to the revolutionary family's principles and nation's soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEven after the liberation of the country, he diligently did farming, saying to the family members that from now on our family members should strive harder to raise good crops and that as they were flesh and blood of General Kim Il Sung, they should work harder to show an example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHis words that \"we can live without money, but not without humanity\", \"a man should die fighting the enemy on the battlefield\" and \"a man is useful as a man only when he works\" were his consistent creed of life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas have added shine to the era of independent reunification, achieving landmark successes unprecedented in the history of the movement for national reunification through national cooperation under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The October 4 Declaration for the Development of the North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity, a programme for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, was adopted in October last year amid the enthusiastic support and approval of all compatriots, putting the cause of national reunification on a new historical stage in the efforts to achieve independent reunification, peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that it has become an irresistible trend of the times for the nation to get reconciled and go united and head for peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration will always serve as a landmark in the era of independent reunification and a banner for winning victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to achieve independent reunification and peace and prosperity, requirements of the era and desires of the compatriots, only when the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration are upheld and implemented. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea is swimming against the trend of the times towards reunification by pursuing the north-south confrontation in collusion with foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National reconciliation, unity and independent reunification are what the general public in south Korea wish. The strength of the united popular masses is inexhaustible and no force on earth can match it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the reactionaries of history may work, the June 15 era of reunification will make a steady dynamic advance and the Koreans are sure to emerge victorious in their struggle for independent reunification, peace and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "ATCC denuncia \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" que agrava tension\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 19 de agosto (ATCC) -- Estados Unidos inicio finalmente con las fuerzas belicistas del Sur de Corea el ejercicio militar conjunto \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" segun su plan de guerra contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta maniobra resulta el premeditado acto provocativo orientado a asestar el ataque preventivo a la RPDC y aventurero alboroto para agravar el enfrentamiento militar y la tension en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pues, EE.UU. pretende desatar a toda costa la nueva guerra en esta area instigando al belicoso \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak a la confrontacion fratricida.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con vistas al traspaso del \"derecho de mando de las operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\" que se realizara en 2012, el imperio renombro \"Ulji Focus Lens\" como \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" a fin de cambiar el \"sistema de mando\" de modo que el circulo militar surcoreano tomara el control de las operaciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi que este ejercicio militar se propone a preparar al ejercito titere surcoreano como brigada de choque en la eventual guerra de agresion al Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl siniestro objetivo de EE.UU. consiste en cultivar la \"capacidad de planificacion y cumplimiento de operaciones\" independientes del ejercito titere surcoreano para fortalecer la capacidad de ejecucion de operaciones terrestres teniendolo como escudo en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana y elevar la efectividad del ataque preciso de mediano y largo alcances y del golpe rapido y movil de las tropas norteamericanas contra los puntos estrategicos de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEfectivamente, en los ultimos tiempos, las tropas norteamericanas y los titeres surcoreanos realizaron de continuo las operaciones terrestres combinadas y el ejercicio del golpe aereo teniendo como su blanco a la RPDC y ampliaron de manera sistematica su dimension y contenido. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEsta vez, ellos desarrollan el ejercicio del puesto de mando movilizando a cerca de 70 mil efectivos y equipos sofisticados. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEsto deviene un grave acto provocativo de guerra que lleva la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana a la coyuntura critica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl comandante de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea dijo que \"el traslado al ejercito surcoreano del derecho de mando de las operaciones en el tiempo de guerra fortalecera mas la alianza Sur de Corea-EE.UU.\" y que el \"ejercicio 'Ulji Freedom Guardian' que se realiza por primera vez ofrecera una buena oportunidad\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con esta maniobra militar quedo evidenciado el caracter agresivo y peligroso de los ejercicios militares conjuntos EE.UU.-Sur de Corea que se libran con el proposito de ultimar los preparativos militares para agredir al Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. habla de frente a frente de la mejora de las relaciones con la RPDC y, a las espaldas, desarrolla diariamente el ejercicio belico para atacarla en la tierra, el mar y el cielo y arma con equipos belicos de punta al ejercito titere surcoreano azuzandolo a la confrontacion con el Norte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tales movimientos militares chocan con la exigencia de la realidad y van en contra de la corriente de la epoca actual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La realidad demuestra claramente que el \"juramento\" de EE.UU. de \"no tener la voluntad de atacar\" a la RPDC no es convincente y verdadero y no pasa de ser una artimana para desarmar al ejercito y al pueblo de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe reflexionar seriamente de las consecuencias de su fanatismo anti-RPDC que destruye el dialogo y la paz y actuar con razon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "CRPP condena ejercicio militar \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 19 de agosto (ATCC) -- El portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 18 una declaracion en la cual califico el ejercicio militar conjunto Estados Unidos-Sur de Corea \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" de declaracion de confrontacion con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y de desafio frontal a todos los coreanos y los pueblos del mundo amantes de la paz que anhelan el alivio de tension y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSi bien EE.UU. y los belicistas titeres surcoreanos tratan de justificar ese ejercicio diciendo que es para el \"traspaso del derecho de mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra\" y para la \"defensa\", esto no pasa de ser una sofisteria para ocultar su caracter belicoso, senala el documento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nProsigue que su verdadero objetivo es reorganizar a las tropas agresoras y completar el sistema de operaciones combinadas en la agresion al Norte de Corea suponiendo el \"tiempo de emergencia\" en la Peninsula Coreana para introducirlo luego en la guerra real en cualquier momento. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLa situacion actual pone en claro que la \"paz\", la \"estabilidad\" y la \"mejora de relaciones\" anunciadas tanto por EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos no pasan de ser palabras vacias para distraer a la opinion interna y externa y que no hubo ningun cambio en el intento de ellos de atropellar por via militar a la RPDC, recalca la nota. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRevela que las extremadamente peligrosas e imprudentes maniobras belicas anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y la banda de Lee Myung Bak agravan la confrontacion militar y el peligro de guerra nuclear en esta peninsula y entenebrecen las perspectivas de la solucion del problema nuclear y del desarrollo de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no estaran jamas con brazos cruzados ante esas provocativas maniobras sino responderan con las medidas de autodefensa mas fuertes, advierte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEllos deben actuar con prudencia al pensar seriamente en las graves consecuencias que tendra su aventurerismo belico anti-RPDC, concluye.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
