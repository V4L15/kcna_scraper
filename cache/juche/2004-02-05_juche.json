Under this situation the people can never realize their desire and demand for independence nor achieve the peaceful development of the world in the new century unless their blatant aggression and interference are checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-war struggle is the main form of the struggle for world peace at present and its principal target is the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are the chieftain of aggression and war and the principal disturber of peace in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to avert a war and achieve the world peace without a struggle against the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world remains so disturbed and peace and order are harassed due to the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Few countries desirous of independence are free from the U.S. threat of military intervention and aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the anti-imperialist, independent peace-loving forces of the world fight against the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war is it possible to avert a war and ensure world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of all countries of the world should lift their anti-war, anti-U.S. voices and bind Yankees hands and foot to keep them from starting a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Wrong is the logic that one may exert little effort and others should make greater efforts in the struggle for peace. Remaining indifferent to others shedding blood is little short of inviting the danger of aggression to oneself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any country ceases to struggle for peace or vacillates in the struggle or budges from it, this will result in weakening the struggle for peace against war and causing its setback. There will be lasting peace when the moves of the U.S. imperialists for aggression and war are checked and they are dismembered in all parts of the world.    \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang warned that if the tour is suspended, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities would be held wholly accountable for the consequences to be entailed by it.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@The tour of Mt. Kumgang now underway between the KAPPC and south Korean Hyundai Asan is a symbol of the inter-Korean economic cooperation. The start of the tour helped wipe out the long-standing mistrust and misunderstanding between the north and the south and laid a foundation of reconciliation and cooperation between them and in this course they witnessed such  landmark events as the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tour of Mt. Kumgang that had gotten brisk amid people's interest and support after it started thanks to the nation's noble patriotic idea and will for reunification has reached such a state of depression that its prospect remains unpredictable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever since the beginning of the tour, a joint undertaking between compatriots, the U.S. has disturbed it overtly and covertly, displeased with it. The U.S. has left no means untried to hamstring the payment for the tour, a publicly recognized international practice, grumbling about \"its diversion to a military purpose.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. was chiefly responsible for the death of the pioneer of the tour of Mt. Kumgang as it instigated the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces to kick up a \"racket of special inspection of the remittance to the north.\" As a matter of fact, the south Korean authorities should have taken measures to revitalize the tour to meet the demands and interests of various circles in south Korea in protest against the U.S. hindrance to the inter-Korean economic cooperation. \r\nThe north can not keep the road of tour open any longer now that the payment for the tour is being steadily delayed due to the south Korean authorities' indifference and tourists are no longer available due to the suspension of the tour by sea. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
