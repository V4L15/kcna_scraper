And, from the beginning of the new year, braving bitter cold, he has been continuing his journey of field guidance to units of the Korean People's Army and various sectors of the national economy to touch off a great leaping forward on all fronts of the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation by giving the fullest scope to the mental spirit of the people and the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Having made a never-ceasing forced march of field guidance last year    for the prosperity of the country, he visited the Guard Seoul Ryu Kyong Su Tank Division 105 of the KPA and congratulated its officers and men in the new year and showed them deepest benevolent affection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the valiant training of  the soldiers of an artillery  unit on his way of Songun leadership, he said the socialist motherland is invulnerable and the cause of building a great, prosperous and powerful nation is sure to be accomplished as it has the matchless great army that has become steel-strong in a nearly eight decade-long arduous struggle.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making a round of the just completed Wonsan Youth Power Station, he bestowed the highest praise on the officials and working people in Kangwon Province as forerunners of self-reliance who built the structure of the Songun era by their own efforts in the hard time when the country were undergoing a grim test. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had warmly supported the determination of the people of Kangwon Province to resolve the power problem by their own efforts and called at the construction site several times, encouraging the builders to heroic feats, and today he put them on the peak of glory. This warm love of the leader is stirring up the revolutionary zeal and militant morale of the entire army and people in the new year's march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nearly ten units have been reported to have been honored with his field guidance in the new year, which include the Taean Heavy Machine Complex and the Kum Song Tractor Plant seething with a new revolutionary upsurge amid the trust of the Workers' Party of Korea which set the working class up as the hero of the history of the great upsurge and the main combat unit in the building of a great, prosperous and powerful nation.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJuche 98(2009) will hold a brilliant place in the history of the country as a year of a new revolutionary upsurge thanks to the energetic field guidance given by Kim Jong Il day and night from the first morning of the new year to adorn the centennial of Kim Il Sung's Korea in the year number of Juche with a great victory of people-centered socialism."

Korean Warmongers' Call for Confrontation with DPRK Blasted\r\nPyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The puppet minister of Defense, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other warmongers of south Korea have recently not bothered to let loose outbursts calling for making full preparations for the third West Sea skirmish and punishing someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such outbursts can be let loose only by those who worked out a scenario of a war against fellow countrymen while crying out for supporting traitor Lee Myung Bak's anti-DPRK confrontational policy by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than traitor Lee Myung Bak who brought the belligerency of the military bosses to such phase. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was disclosed that recently the traitor reproached those of the Ministry of Unification for mentioning economic cooperation when receiving a report on the performance of its work, shouting hoarse that one should not think that economic cooperation would help improve the south-north relations just as what happened in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His assertion that economic cooperation would not help improve inter-Korean relations means, in essence, one should not have an idea of having even economic cooperation. Clear is what the traitor is going to do after completely checking economic cooperation and totally freezing the north-south relations, not content with pushing the north-south dialogue to a total stalemate through extreme confrontational policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee and the puppet military warmongers had better pay heed to the warning issued by the General Staff of the Korean People's Army that its military retaliatory step will be implemented by the limitless merciless striking power of the strong revolutionary armed forces of Mt. Paektu and a resolute action which can be hardly countered by any up-to-date means in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee Myung Bak should have a proper understanding of the north-south relations. He should drop such foolish way of thinking as regarding the north-south cooperation as a sort of undertaking to offer something to the north, given that he has been thrown into a tight corner by public criticism due to the bankruptcy of businesses and a great number of unemployed,  the aftereffect of the world financial crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To be a politician, one should properly know who one's partner is. As Lee lacks this ability, he only does something unsuccessful and allows himself to be bellicose which gets him nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day when he has a fit of belligerency will be recorded in history as his doom's day."

This is an undisguised negation of inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation and an open declaration of the all-out confrontation with the DPRK. Leading newspapers Tuesday observe this in signed commentaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors has categorically opposed the inter-Korean declarations and has not uttered even a word about \"the north-south joint declaration\" nor has shown any idea of discarding the old attitude of confrontation with the DPRK since the beginning of the new year, either. This is a clear proof that it has only an ill-intention to stand in confrontation with the DPRK in utter disregard of national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group brought the inter-Korean relations of reconciliation and unity, which had developed in the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" back to those of distrust and confrontation in the period before the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration. It cannot escape a stern judgment of the nation for the above-said crime only. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It raised a hue and cry over the \"emergency situation\" to bedevil the inter-Korean relations, thus hurting even the supreme dignity of the DPRK and pushing the situation to a brink of war.  The group should be held fully accountable for this crime, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers of the puppet military dared put spurs to the preparations for \"preemptive strike\" and \"punishment\" of the DPRK under the motto of remaining true to the \"idea of the ruler,\" and have undisguisedly perpetrated intrusions into its territorial waters in the West Sea of Korea and steadily rendered the situation tense through frantic arms buildup and exercises for a war of aggression against it. These are dangerous actions to ignite the said war at any cost in league with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is now running the whole gamut of sleight of hand to evade its responsibility for having driven the inter-Korean relations into the worst crisis but this will get it nowhere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppets persist in their moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK, lending no ear to the solemn declaration of its revolutionary armed forces that they would mercilessly shatter the puppets' moves for confrontation with it, they will not be able to escape disgraceful destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson urges the Lee group to stop the above-said moves, apologize for its wrongdoings before the nation and step down, though belatedly."

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The legitimate dispatch of the MSDF's warships to the waters off Somalia which has been under hot debate in Japan since last year is becoming a reality. This is a new dangerous step for the Japanese militarists' military expansion overseas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an invariable ambition and strategic aim of the Japanese militarist forces to realize the military expansion overseas. The said step is prompted by such aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are seeking another sinister aim through their intention to dispatch the above-mentioned warships to the sea off Somalia under the pretext of \"combating piracy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's present Constitution bans both the exercise of \"right to collective self-defence\" and the military operation overseas for being a war criminal state and a defeated nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese chief executive asserted that the dispatch of the MSDF's warships to the sea off Somalia aimed at \"combating piracy\" is an issue quite different from the \"right to collective self-defence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If those warships clash with armed pirates in the sea off Somalia, they will have no option but to use force against them. In that case, this would be obviously a use of force overseas, a gross violation of the present Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the Japanese reactionaries are craftily working to convince the world that the use of force by those warships dispatched overseas for the above-said mission is something \"unavoidable.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is employing such artifice to create a favorable environment for military expansion overseas and legalize the SDF's military operation overseas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to squarely watch the world and drop its poor trick to legalize its military expansion overseas."
