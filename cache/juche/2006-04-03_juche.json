The DPRK is fully demonstrating its sovereignty and dignity in the fierce political and economic stand-off with the U.S. imperialists as they are backed by the invincible armed forces. \r\n The history of the struggle waged by the army and people of the DPRK to defend socialism from the moves of the U.S. imperialists against it goes to prove that the road of Songun alone leads to defending the human cause of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The exploits performed by him in the glorious days provided the Korean people with an eternal foundation for building a great prosperous powerful nation and accomplishing the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideas, line and policies set out by him with his clairvoyant wisdom, always mixing with people and sharing weal and woe with them serve as unshakable guidelines for the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great prosperous powerful nation being built by the Korean people is a Juche-oriented great prosperous powerful nation as it will be guided by the ideas and line of the President. The DPRK has not committed any slightest error in its efforts to bring about the greatest success in building Korean-style socialism as he laid down all guidelines for every unit and field.

Herein lies a sure guarantee for successfully materializing generation after generation the ideas and cause of the President who is always alive with the country and the nation and Korean-style socialism.\r\n Minju Joson underscores the need for all Koreans to successfully carry forward and accomplish the glorious revolutionary traditions of the Workers' Party of Korea so as to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation on this land as early as possible and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But rather they are asserting that the case has nothing to do with the Japanese government and spreading a wrong public opinion the DPRK, a victim, is at issue. \r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a commentary today. Their assertion stems from the trick peculiar to ill-natured and brazenfaced Japan, the commentary points out, and goes on:\r\n The abduction of DPRK citizens by those of Japan's NGO is irrefutably a blatant violation of human rights and a crime against humanity. The abductors must be directed and paid by a plot-breeding agency of the Japanese government to do such wrongs. Evidently, they did follow the way the Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted and kidnapped Koreans in the past. Their abduction of DPRK citizens is a continuation of the Japanese imperialists' forcible drafting and kidnapping of Koreans, and it is a double inhumane and unethical crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never pardon such crime committed by the Japanese abductors against its citizens. Their behavior must be punished by the relevant law of the DPRK as it was a gross violation of the relevant articles of the DPRK criminal law and criminal procedure law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should promptly take relevant steps to unconditionally extradite the criminals wanted by the DPRK and prevent the recurrence of such case. If it refuses to do so, the matter will become more complicated and Japan will be wholly held accountable for all the consequences arising therefrom.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a very dangerous development and an unpardonable act of treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' moves to go nuclear cannot but be a serious development as they gravely threaten peace on the Korean Peninsula, the destiny of the nation and the security in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the U.S. has zealously backed and defended south Korea's moves for nuclear weaponization although it has persistently pulled up the DPRK over its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed fact about south Korea's development of a nuclear-powered submarine once again brings to light the U.S. wicked habit of seeking an axe to grind and its brazenfaced and shameless double-dealing tactics of judging everything on the basis of its view on value to meet its own interests for aggression.\r\n The fact that the U.S. is cooperating with the south Korean authorities in the development of nukes against the DPRK by instigating them more urgently requires it to bolster up its nuclear deterrent to defend the dignity, sovereignty and the security of the nation and intensify its nuclear activities for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities will be held wholly responsible for the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless and dangerous cooperation in the nuke development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
