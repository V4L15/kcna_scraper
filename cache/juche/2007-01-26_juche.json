            "content": "U.S. Smear Campaign against DPRK Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry on Thursday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the recent smear campaign conducted by the U.S. against the DPRK over UN organizations' aid to it:\r\n The DPRK has maintained good relations of cooperation with different bodies of the United Nations for several decades. And aid projects of the above-said bodies, including the UNDP, in the country have been carried out strictly in conformity with the UN regulations and in a transparent way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the United States is kicking up another anti-DPRK racket over not much aid funds of the UNDP from the outset of the year to meet its dirty political aims. It talks about \"offer of illegal funds\" and cries out for \"investigating aid projects\" and \"shelving aid program\", asserting for no reason that the DPRK might have used the aid funds for the development of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has made every possible effort to put serious sanctions and blockade against the DPRK. And it is now seeking to intensify pressure on the DPRK and tarnish its image externally by means of blocking the legal aid projects of UN organizations with unjust reasons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the UNDP has denied, the U.S. assertions admit of no argument as they are a sheer fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n News services of different countries have said that the U.S. hard-liners, who set in motion the unilateral financial sanctions on the DPRK as soon as the September 19 joint statement was published and drove the six-party talks to a deadlock, invented what it called \"suspected diversion of illegal funds\", timed to coincide with the DPRK-U.S. talks in Berlin. Such comment is by no means accidental. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will continue to develop the cooperative relations with the UNDP and other bodies of the UN. However, it will not allow any attempt to politicize the aid project nor accept conditional or unjust aid at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be wholly accountable for all consequences to be entailed by its ongoing reckless campaign against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves for Retrogressive Revision of Constitution under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The Korean Jurists Committee Thursday made public a white paper stripping bare the reactionary and illegal nature of the moves of the reactionaries of the land of Japs to retrogressively revise the constitution in a bid to undisguisedly justify their policy to turn Japan into a military power and launch overseas aggression by throwing away the mask of \"a pacifist state\" which it has so far professed to be. \r\n The moves to rewrite the constitution stepped up by the island country under the pretext of \"making a constitution suited to the 21st century\" is not an issue confined to the internal affair of a country but a serious issue as it jeopardizes peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula but the rest of Northeast Asia and the world and an unpardonable criminal act, the paper noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe above-said moves of the land of Japs are a wanton violation of the obligation under international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper cited the \"Potsdam Declaration\" and the UN Charter to prove in detail that such moves are criminal acts of openly challenging the international conventions which stipulate the position of Japan as a war criminal state and a defeated nation and acts diametrically running counter to the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of the island country are foolish enough to assert that their moves to rewrite the constitution are reasonable in view of international law, insisting that the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" stipulated in the UN Charter belongs to the legitimate right of each country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a World War II criminal state this island country owes too much to the international community under international law as it has to fulfil more commitments under international law than rights it is entitled to enjoy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The land of Japs has not yet made any honest repentance or settlement of the crimes it committed during the war of aggression though it imposed unspeakable misfortune and sufferings upon humankind. However, it is talking about the \"contribution to global peace and stability\" and exercise of such right as the \"the right to collective self-defense\" under international law despite the fact that it still remains recorded as an enemy state in the UN Charter. This is nothing but a brazen-faced abuse of international law that can be perpetrated only by the reactionaries of the island country characterized by shameless and crafty nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the above-said move of the land of Japs is a serious crime as it threatens the peace and security of the world, the paper roundly exposed its aggressive and bellicose nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the \"pacifist constitution\" this land enjoyed security, accumulated wealth and made economic progress until today. Nevertheless, the incumbent chief executive and ruling parties are working hard to replace it by a militarist constitution aimed at pursuing aggression again and justifying war under the unreasonable pretext that the existing constitution is outdated after the lapse of so many years. This is an unpardonable crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the chief aim sought by the reactionaries of the land of Japs through the revision of the constitution to regain the right of belligerency of which it was deprived after its defeat in the Second World War and turn the \"Self-Defence Forces\" into the world's elite armed forces in a bid to justify its overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves stepped up by those reactionaries for militarization and overseas expansion quite contrary to the world peace and security are clearly evidenced by the fact that they enacted a lot of laws related war in contravention of the spirit of the \"pacifist constitution\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last more than decade alone witnessed the promulgation of the \"law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping activities\", \"law on emergency in the surrounding areas \", \"law on special measures against terrorism\" and \"law on emergency\" and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper urged the authorities of the island country to behave themselves, keenly aware that their reckless moves for militarization and overseas expansion will only lead them to shameful destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Ambition to Grab Tok Islet under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The land of Japs is shameless enough to so frequently assert \"dominium\" over Tok Islet. In this regard Rodong Sinmun Thursday in an article cites facts to prove that its assertion is losing its justification as the days go by.\r\n Its brazen-faced claim to Tok Islet is related to its aggressive strategy for existence in the new century, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is keen to stage a comeback to Korea with its military invasion of the islet as a prelude.\r\n The reactionaries of this island country are putting main emphasis on a military option to grab Tok Islet on the basis of their calculation that it is favorable for turning Japan into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They consider the claim to the islet as a good pretext for turning Japan into a military power and realizing their ambition to reinvade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their claim is also aimed at attaining their political objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to Japan's behavior blindly toeing the U.S. line that it is ridiculed by the world people as an \"imbecile diplomat\" and \"political dwarf.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's inveterate subservience to the U.S. cannot but be the biggest impediment to its efforts to emerge a political power.  It opts for territorial dispute to hide this drawback and justify its policy. It is sparking off territorial disputes with its neighboring countries including the Tok Islet of Korea, Diaoyu Island of China and the southern Kuriles of Russia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to achieve its sinister aim through these disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, such move of Japan is as foolish an act as building a skyscraper on the sand. Japan's distortion of history and its loudmouthed \"dominium\" over Tok Islet would get it nowhere. It will be ridiculed and censured by the international community as a grabber of other's land and robber. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tok Islet will always remain part of the inviolable territory of Korea no matter what claim Japan makes to it. Japan would be well advised to give up its foolish daydream, bearing deep in mind it will have to pay dearly for its reckless moves to grab Tok Islet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
