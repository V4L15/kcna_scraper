She received systematic education, going through the \r\nfaculty for preliminary education at Pyongyang University of Music and Dance, its specialized course, \r\nuniversity faculty and doctoral institute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She is calm and sentimental in her character, but has an exceptional passion for music. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her heart was always afire with the ardent enthusiasm to live in such a way as to honor the noble feats performed by her maternal grandfather and other fighters of the People's Army in the hard-fought battles during the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why she often played the piano concerto \"To the Road of Decisive Battle\" before the audience to express her feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Later, she came to have the chance to study at Moscow State Conservatory Named after Tchaikovsky.\r\n Proud of being a daughter of Songun Korea, she did her best to put her artistic skill on such a high level in those days that she could make her debut in the international concours. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She successfully presented \"Arirang\" to the high acclaim of the audience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her presentation truthfully represented her boundless reverence for President Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who put an end to the distress-torn national history and opened up a new history of the Arirang nation. Theaudience was esmerized by her fascinating and admirable play as it led them to a beautiful world of music  The concours jury decided to award the certificate of the winner to her who was enthusiastically applauded by the whole audience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She sent a letter of thanks to Kim Jong Il, tears of motion rolling down her cheeks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, according to a survey, there are over 1,500 enterprises related to forcible  drafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Labor and military conscription was forced not by ivilians but by the government. So the truth behind the remains cannot be probed through investigation by a small number of enterprises alone. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should sincerely look back on the past and make an overall investigation  into the remains by all means possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Law on Past History\" Recently Adopted in S. Korea Termed Unpopular \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) - The \"law on the past history\" that had long remained a controversial issue between the ruling and opposition camps formally passed through the south Korean National Assembly recently. But it turned out to be an unpopular one as it is quite \r\ncontrary to its original purport. It was a product of the compromise between the two camps. The law calls for ncluding what they call \"violence by pro-north and pro-communist forces\" denying and antagonizing the \"true nature\" of the south Korean system among the objects of the probe into the past crimes.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south Korean political camp adopted this legislation, which takes issue even with the just struggle  of the pro-reunification patriotic forces, defying the unanimous demand of various public circles in south Korea for probing the truth behind past crimes. This is another dangerous provocation and a crime against reunification because it is aimed at debasing the righteous patriotic struggle of the south Korean people and fanning up the north-south confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The law justifies the hideous fascist outrages committed by the dictatorial regimes of south Korea against the nation and reunification in the past under the pretext of preserving the \"true nature of the system\" \r\nand brands the pro-reunification progressive patriotic figures as criminals and objects of investigation, making \r\nprofound confusing of assailants and victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This legislation cannot be called \"a law on adjusting the past history\" but should be termed \"law on \r\nwhitewashing the past crimes.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was due to the trick of the south Korean Grand National Party that the \"law on the past history\" \r\nstopped short of meeting the people's desire though it drew so great attention of the south Korean public.\r\n What the south Korean National Assembly did as regards this law goes to clearly prove once again that \r\nas long as the GNP remains in south Korea, progress and reform are hardly achievable and the south \r\nKorean people can never enjoy an independent life and democracy. The GNP has already become\r\nbusy with its moves to win the next \"presidential election\". The desperate efforts made by this party \r\nto seek the carriage of the bill clearly indicate what serious consequences will be entailed by its success in the\r\nelection.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is not in a position to wag its tongue about others' penal system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Truth to tell, the U.S. is an empire of devils with the most pernicious and brutal penal system where murder and looting are a part and parcel of culture. It was the first in the world to enforce and maintain the punishing\r\nmethod of binding the limbs of prisoners to electric chairs to torture and kill them. This method has a history of one \r\nhundred and scores of years since it was effected in the U.S. in 1890. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of sarcasm that the U.S. is crying for \"human rights\" and \"democracy\" while covering up its crimes and true colors as the hideous kingpin of human rights abuses. This is an insult to and mockery of true\r\nhuman rights and democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. criticism of the DPRK's national law, which entirely agrees with its conditions and the interests and \r\ndemand of its people, can never be tolerated as it is an act to vilify and pull down Korean-style socialism. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not distort and decry and point an accusing finger at the national laws pertaining to the \r\nsovereignty of other countries, but abolish,first of all, its most cruel and brutal penal system and methods and \r\nstop aggression, human rights abuses and interference in others' internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the U.S. to seek the \"overthrow\" of the DPRK's system by despicable and malicious means is a daydream of an \r\nidiot as foolish as attempting to cover the sun with a palm.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The principle of national independence is, indeed, the key to the solution of the national problem. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's cause of reunification to rejoin the blood veins of the divided nation and achieve national \r\ncohesion is a matter of the Korean nation itself and a matter of the national sovereignty both in name and\r\nreality. The Korean nation can defend the country's peace and propel the cause of reunification only when \r\nit holds fast to the principle of national independence not allowing aggression and interference of any outsider \r\nand exercises its independent rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is the indispensable prerequisite to building up the driving force of the \r\nnation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe driving force of the country's reunification is none other than the whole Korean nation in the north, \r\nthe south and overseas and its might is immediately the might of its unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideological banner for strengthening the unity of the internal patriotic forces for reunification is national \r\nindependence. It is the mental source which helps display the inexhaustible strength of the Korean nation. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the obtaining situation in which the U.S. imperialists are past control in their criminal moves for \r\naggression and war against the DPRK and their interference in Korea's reunification, it is the supreme task no \r\none can shun to hold fast to the principle of national independence and fight in close unity under the banner of \r\npatriotism and national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
