He laid it down as an important task in democratic reforms and wisely led the struggle for its fulfillment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He promulgated \"Law on Agrarian Reform in North Korea\" on March 5, Juche 35 (1946), thus setting up the peasants once maltreated and humiliated as the masters of land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agrarian reform was carried out in a matter of 20-odd days after its promulgation. It was an epoch-making event in which the land owned by the landlords who accounted for mere 4 percent of the total farm households was confiscated without compensation and distributed free to the masses of peasants who made up more than 80 percent of the north Korean population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also opened a new history of irrigation on this land to satisfy the age-old desire of the peasants, now the master of land, for water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his wise leadership the Phyongnam, Ojidon and other irrigation channels were successfully built to turn the country into \"a land of irrigation\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exploits performed by the President in the turn of the earth of socialism have been carried forward successfully under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. \r\n Regarding land rezoning as a gigantic nature-remaking project and a patriotic cause of eternal value for the prosperity of the country, Kim Jong Il put forth the original idea of land rezoning to glorify the President's feats in the agrarian reform through all ages and ultimately wipe out the remaining feudal features of land and led its realization at the head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n True to his grandiose idea, soldiers and people of the country transformed the farmland in Kangwon Province and then in North Phyongan and South Hwanghae Provinces, Pyongyang city and South Phyongan Province into large standardized fields by giving full play to the revolutionary soldier spirit to unfold a new history of a great transformation of nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In February Juche 86 (1997) General Secretary Kim Jong Il spread a blueprint  to convert the irrigation system in the western coastal area into a waterway system of natural flow suitable to the features of standardized fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, the Kaechon-Thaesong Lake and the Paekma-Cholsan waterways, the largest in scale in the nation's history of irrigation construction, took shape as monumental structures worthy of being a pride in the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national historic feats of the peerless great persons associated with the socialist land will shine through generations along with Songun Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are even blustering that it is seriously \"mistaken\" if it calculates it can produce a better agreement with the next U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today terms this a provocative move to scuttle the six-party talks and lay an obstacle in the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to deteriorate the existing hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and bring the situation on the peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hardliners are not seeking the negotiated settlement of  the nuclear issue on the peninsula but working hard to attain their sinister aim with a strong-arm policy by  shifting onto the DPRK all the responsibilities for the delayed implementation of the points agreed at the six-party talks, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are blustering that the new U.S. regime would never pardon the DPRK while talking nonsense that it is delaying the implementation of the above-said points. This is a short-sighted and foolish ruse to frighten and stifle it with pressure and blackmail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous and ridiculous for them to float rumor that the DPRK pins any hope on the next U.S. president. It is a very wrong way of thinking for them to regard their one-sided hard-line policy toward the DPRK as a cure-all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better clearly understand that if the U.S. opts for the one-sided hard-line policy toward the DPRK, the bilateral relations will reach an extreme phase and everything go up in smoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does what it should do and refrains from what it should not do no matter what others may say. The U.S. conservative hardliners are sadly mistaken if they calculate they can wrest any concession from the DPRK with a strong-arm policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to discard a foolish delusion and behave with reason in the realistic way of thinking.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the fruition and victory of his independent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKim Jong Il has pursued the Songun politics in all fields amidst the unceasing acute standoff with the U.S. This was something unprecedented in the world history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He foiled the moves of the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces to stifle the DPRK in the most difficult period of the \"Arduous March,\" the forced march, and protected the destiny of the country and the nation by dint of the Songun politics, thereby demonstrating the dignity and might of the DPRK to the full and bringing about a historic turn in building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics helps frustrate the U.S. imperialists' strategy for world domination and dynamically promote the triumphant advance of the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest honor and fortune for the world progressives to hold Kim Jong Il, political elder of the 21st century and great politician, in high esteem, concluded the article.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
