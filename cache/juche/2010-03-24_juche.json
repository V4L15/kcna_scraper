This was a historic landmark in developing the nation's science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists in the field of agricultural science researched into the first filial generation of rice of Korean style and introduced it into farming, guaranteeing a bright prospect of rice farming. They also bred species of high-yielding crops including the first filial generation of maize and seed bean and established virus-free seed potato production system in recent years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also researched and introduced were efficient cultivation methods including the method of cold-bed nutritive rice seedlings cultivation, sparse planting culture and double-cultivation suited to the double cropping as well as a new manuring method more than two times as effective as the preceding method.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also among the successes are the development of phosphobacterial fertilizer capable of converting phosphor compounds in the soil into those absorbable by crops and new non-poisonous and environment-friendly bio-agricultural chemical Avermectin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The February 8 Vinalon Complex put all the production processes on modern lines and completed a computer control system of Korean style suited to the specific features of chemical industry, thus mass-producing vinalon and hundreds of varieties of chemical goods essential for light industry and agriculture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists in the field of light industry provided firm scientific and technological guarantees for improving the people's standard of living.  Those in the field of foodstuff processing industry developed such new kind of compound bacteria as peculiar fermentation agent and pickling agent in food processing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The scientists and technicians developed CNC technology, making it possible to manufacture high-speed, high-precision and intellectual high-performance CNC equipment as they please. This laid a firm foundation for putting the nation's machine-building industry on the level of cutting-edge science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA Korean-style steel-making system has been established at the Songjin Steel Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex made such spectacular success as building a Juche iron furnace relying on raw materials and fuel found in abundance in the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t UHP electric arc furnaces were built by Korean workers by their own efforts and with their own technology in a brief span of time. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean-style computer operation system has made rapid progress and, on this basis, the high-performance information processing machine, the cutting-edge technology, has been rounded off and new and efficient applied programs have been steadily developed on a high world level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's \"KCC Go\" program boasts the high level of IT development and its great potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Material and technological foundations have been laid to establish an innovative style of social, economic and cultural life such as business management based on IT, unmanned production technology process, electronic commerce and remote-control education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A particular mention should be made of the manufacture of STM which signified a breakthrough in the researches into Nano technology and development of goods based on Nano technology.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe scientists in the field of bio-engineering have put basic technologies including the gene analyzing technology, biotic information technology and clarification of chondriosome functions on an advanced level of the world and are now widening the sphere of their application. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The development of new technology of marine survey made it possible to conduct the survey of sea bed resources, marine observation and other work on a high level under a long-term plan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists have also researched into and developed the technology of drawing three dimensional diagram by laser and precision measurement technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The workers and technicians in Taehung have completed the production system relying on indigenous resources and technology, successfully putting the magnesia clinker industry on a Juche basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The field of medical science established an online medical service system across the country and developed an air purifying and sterilizing device which is now used in the public health services and succeeded in manufacturing anticancer drug based on Koryo medicinal herbs found in abundance in the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean scientists and technicians developed a large water disinfector and the technology of exploring sea bed artesian water in Korean style.

After their departure from Korea the U.S. forces landed in south Korea and split the Korean nation, viciously blocking its concord and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Flunkeyism and reliance on foreign forces have done enormous harm to the Koreans in their efforts to achieve national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the deplorable reality, a product of the sycophantic and treacherous policies of dependence on foreign forces enforced by the successive rulers of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean ruling forces have thrown a stumbling block in the way of independent reunification by pursuing sycophancy and dependence on foreign forces in contravention of the June 15 joint declaration and the Oct. 4 declaration and the idea of \"By our nation itself\". DPRK-targeted war exercises were staged in south Korea without let-up, escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula. This is mainly attributable to the treacherous stand and approach of the south Korean authorities depending on foreign forces to hurt fellow countrymen in collusion with them in violation of the principle of national independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces will bring the Korean nation nothing but continued confrontation and division and escalated tension and danger of a war. National independence is the only way for reunifying the divided country and achieving peace and prosperity."

Only when the Korean people steadily develop the latest science and technology with their own efforts and wisdom in their own style, can they more strikingly demonstrate the validity and vitality of the line of the Workers' Party of Korea on building an independent national economy and bring about eye-opening changes in the building of a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is possible to successfully attain the grandiose goal for building an economic power when the level of technical equipment of the nation's economy is put on a higher stage through the wide introduction of the world-level cutting-edge technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present stirring reality goes to patently prove that a shortcut to achieving a leaping advance in production and hitting the target of building an economic power earlier than scheduled lies in actively placing the national economy on a modern and IT basis on the basis of the latest science and technology."

These huge naval forces for aggression are busy with naval mobile drills, exercises for torpedo operation, mine-sweeping operation and naval bombardment in coordinated operations with groups of warships of the puppet navy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with these combined naval maneuvers, the U.S. imperialists deployed overseas-based fighter-bombers, pursuit-assault planes, planes for special operation, electronic jamming planes and rescue planes in air bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea. They are now busy with air battle drills and exercises for striking ground targets, providing close air support and carrying out airlifting missions in coordinated operation with flying corps of the south Korean puppet air force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers of the south Korean puppet army got more frantic in war exercises in the forefront area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 105mm and 155mm artillery groups and tank groups of the puppet army deployed in the areas of south Cholwon County, Phaju City and Rinje County fired at least 300 shells on March 22 and 23, whipping up a war atmosphere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this period the south Korean puppet army hurled \"commandoes\" of the special warfare command into operation theatres along the forefront for madcap spying training.
