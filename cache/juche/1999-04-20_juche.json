The U.S. recently let the South Korean authorities float the rumour that the DPRK \"recognized\" the presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea as \"peace-keeping forces.\" In this way it  tries to build up public opinion that there is a change in the DPRK's stand toward the withdrawal of the U.S. troops.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Synchronizing with it, the South Korean rulers incoherently remarked that the U.S. troops should remain even after the reunification of Korea and that  the issue of their withdrawal would not be adopted as a formal agenda item at the 5th round of \"four-party talks.\"   Refuting such argument, the news analyst stresses:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The DPRK has insisted on the withdrawal of the U.S. forces since they occupied South Korea, and this position is invariable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The presence of the U.S. forces in South Korea is intended to perpetuate their colonial rule over South Korea and stifle the DPRK by force of arms. So, durable peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula can never be expected as long as the U.S. forces remain in South Korea.   The purpose of the \"four-party talks\" is to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula. Accordingly, the withdrawal of the U.S. troops should be taken as a top agenda item at the talks, and if not, the talks will be unnecessary.&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. will face a bitterer denunciation by peoples if it  perpetuates its military occupation of South Korea, going against the will of the Korean people, the paper warns. \r\n\r\n"

They are massively producing these weapons with the help of the U.S., while introducing  those types of weapons from the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spokesman said:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a wanton violation of the international law which bans the development, possession and use of biological and chemical weapons. It is a premeditated move of the South Korean authorities to ignite a new war on the Korean peninsula at any cost and use these weapons as well as nukes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee bitterly condemns the South Korean authorities for stepping up the moves to stockpile biological and chemical weapons in collusion with the U.S., branding it as an unpardonable criminal move to plunge the Korean nation into ruin and humankind into disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are now spreading a rumour about the north's non-existent \"possession of biological and chemical weapons\". This is nothing but a foolish attempt to conceal their preparations for bio-chemical warfare.   The DPRK will never remain an onlooker to South Korea's bio-chemical war preparations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement expressed the belief that international organizations and organizations of various countries that oppose aggression and war and love peace and the world's peaceloving people would extend full support and encouragement to the Korean people in their just struggle against the criminal bio-chemical war preparations of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n"

As is known, the issue of national reunification is the greatest national task of the Korean people which brooks no further delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His talk about \"distant future\" directly mirrors his separatist stand which means, in fact, he does not wish reunification.

His activities are consistent with loyalty and filial piety towards the President Kim Il Sung. Ample evidence of this is that he has devoted great efforts and energies to deepening and developing the President's revolutionary ideas.   For example, his work \"On the Juche Idea\" shows his boundless loyalty, outstanding ideological and theoretical wisdom, rich philosophical knowledge  and inexhaustible enthusiasm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In the work he scientifically and theoretically clarified the philosophical principle, socio-historical principles and guiding principles of the Juche idea and proved that the President's revolutionary ideas are an undivided system of ideas, theories and methods of Juche.

Its  composition and ideological contents and logical  evolution are consistent  with the revolutionary outlook on the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In the work, Kim Jong Il, the great philosopher possessed of extraordinary philosophical judgement and rich philosophical knowledge, gave a perfect exposition of the intrinsic nature of man which no one had found for thousands of years.   The work is the result of his unusual ardor and tireless ideological and theoretical activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One day, looking up at the Tower of the Juche Idea by the Taedong river-side, he said that if the books he read to formulate the President's revolutionary ideas were stacked up in good order, they would be as high as the pedestal of the tower.   His teachings eloquently show that he devoted great efforts and energies to systematizing the president's revolutionary ideas.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such a great work as the work consummating of the Juche idea  was published thanks to his tireless meditation and inexhaustible enthusiasm.
