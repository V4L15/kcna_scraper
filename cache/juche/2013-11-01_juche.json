He also instructed officials to have pictures of the fallen fighters carved on their grave stones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said commanding officers and sailors thus came to enjoy immortality thanks to his profound loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un laid a flower before the cemetery and paid silent tribute to the memory of the fallen fighters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Senior officials of the party and army who accompanied him placed flowers before the cemetery and observed a moment silence in honor of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the cemetery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching stone pictures of the fallen fighters one by one,  he said that he felt as if they had risen up to greet him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the cemetery built in a quiet and sunny place with blue sea ahead, he said that the cemetery is located in a very good place as it is near from where the unit is stationed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that sailors of the unit have now become able to sail for performing their combat duties as requested by the fallen fighters after bidding farewell to them, adding that he felt much relieved after having a burial ceremony for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that he could hardly go to sleep, when thinking they died at so young ages, though the defence of the country is accompanied by sacrifices. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that he felt heartbreaking when thinking of the fallen fighters who served in the navy, their hearts burning with the dream and hope to perform feats with great ambition and their parents grieved at their deaths and their wives who had waited for their return from voyage. He added what bitter sorrow they might feel as he felt so painful.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After watching the cemetery, he said that there should be the name of the owner of each grave, adding he would like to be that owner and asked officials to carve his name on the grave stones. I will feel relieved a bit only when my name is carved on them, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the martyrs are his comrades-in-arms and comrades, he stressed that although they died before realizing the lifetime desires of the  great Generalissimos under the leadership of the supreme commander, they showed all service personnel how a soldier should carry out the order of the country through their heroic deaths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary spirit of the martyrs who readily dedicated their precious lives to defending the country's sea will always live on, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that not only the sailors of the unit but all the service personnel of the KPA should learn from the exploits and noble spiritual world of the  martyrs who firmly defended their posts till the last moments of their lives and carried out the combat order at the cost of their lives."

They went the lengths of blustering that they would certainly achieve together with Park Geun Hye what was wished by him to attain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group's disgusting farces are anachronistic foolish acts contrary to the trend of the times and an unpardonable mockery and challenge to the south Koreans and all other compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There was no such precedent in which a dictator met such a miserable end, forsaken by all the people, as what Park Chung-Hee did, the bulletin noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even today the south Korean people are troubled with the nightmare in those times whenever they hear the word of the \"yusin\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group staged such ruckuses as extolling Park Chung-Hee and embellishing his \"yusin\" dictatorship, instead of feeling ashamed of the wicked dictator who met a tragic death, cursed by all Koreans.

Korean Authorities Denounced for Abusing Sports for Inciting Confrontation \r\n Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the National Reconciliation Council released a statement Friday in connection with the fact that the south Korean puppet forces fanned up anti-DPRK hysteria even in the sports sector, enraging the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t At a sports contest in Inchon, Kyonggi Province, south Korea a short time ago, the puppet forces formed \"players' team of five provinces of the north\" with human scum who deserted their homeland and fled to the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean chief executive addressed the contest, unaware of where to draw the line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This act of hostility toward the DPRK going against sports spirit aspiring after justice and peace and the desire for national reconciliation and unity is a serious politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK and an intolerable mockery of its dignity and social system, the spokesman said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The National Reconciliation Council vehemently denounces this as a vicious and despicable confrontational rowdyism aimed to oppose national reconciliation and unity and to push the north-south ties into irrevocable catastrophe on behalf of all the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans are strongly calling for normalizing the north-south ties at an early date and achieving the unity of the nation in the basic spirit of \"By our nation itself\" stated in the north-south joint declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the grave anti-DPRK acts that take place on a daily basis in south Korea arouse serious concerns about the prospect for the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is something abnormal to form the \"players' team of five provinces of the north\" with those who deserted their families and homes and betrayed the party and homeland which brought them up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's why they are snubbed and rejected even in south Korea, being branded as betrayers and traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive, who emitted venom by delivering even an \"address\", is a good match for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She spoke loudly of \"confidence-building\" before the public at home and abroad but behind the scene she incited confrontation, patronizing human scum. This leaves the people skeptical about the future of the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A special mention should be made of the anti-DPRK farce that was staged in a stadium in Inchon, venue of the 17th Asian Games.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces insulted sports whose mission is sound mental and physical training for harmony, unity, justice and peace. This casts doubt on the successful hosting of the games next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no vouch that the games will not be a theatre for inciting hostility toward the DPRK in the light of the present situation in south Korea and the wicked mind of the puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never tolerate the puppet forces' act of abusing sacred sports for escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will follow the attitude of the south Korean authorities."
