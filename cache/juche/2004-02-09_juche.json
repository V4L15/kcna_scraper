As recently disclosed, they extorted funds from enterprises by trucks and squandered them in the \"election\" and stuffed their pockets for their greed for power and luxurious life. Not content with it, they even plundered the school funds and thus drove the economy and the people's living into bankruptcy and inflicted huge damage on school education. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As to diplomatic security, he laid stress on \"pursuing the diplomatic policy of admitting the U.S., not pro-U.S. nor anti-U.S.\" But his remarks are meant to unconditionally follow the U.S. as shown in his visit to the U.S. his master, during which he vowed to dispatch troops to Iraq and said that the U.S. military base in south Korea should be tranferred as demanded by the U.S. even at the cost of the huge amount of blood taxes of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to soothe or calm down the south Korean people's desire for political reform and anti-GNP will. Only ruin is left for the GNP, a traitorous party.    \r\n\r\n"

His exploit shines as an exploit of world history which is of great significance in accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence, cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He developed and completed the socialist idea of Juche and instilled the precious ideological and spiritual pabulum into the mind of the people when some countries which were building socialism were at a loss for their ideological degeneration and stagnation in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Korean revolution has entered a new historical era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The task of the times to defend the country and the nation and build a great prosperous powerful nation despite the persistent challenges of the imperialists has been brilliantly carried out as  Kim Jong Il set forth the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of Kim Jong Il's leadership lies in that he has held fast to ideology and put the ideological work above other work in all fields of the revolution and the construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the ideological theory of Juche that the idea decides on everything and comprehensively clarified the justness of the revolutionary principle of placing the ideological work above all other work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has also energetically led people to carry out with the might of ideology the tasks arising in all fields of the revolution and the construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His leadership, which has turned the misfortune into blessings and adversity into a favorable condition by giving priority to the ideological work, serves as a basic guarantee for the Korean revolution to emerge victorious even under the complicated situation in which socialism collapsed in several countries.    \r\n\r\n"

This is the historic position of Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea distinguished from the preceding revolutionary ideas.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There have been many ideas and theories in the human history of thought. But no idea was so perfect in scientific and theoretical terms and so eternal in vitality as Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea holds a unique position in the development of the revolutionary ideas of the working class. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unlike the preceding theories, he evolved the system and contents of his idea, taking the Juche idea, the first of its kind in human history, as the basis of the world outlook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unlike Marxism-Leninism which clarified the conditions for the emancipation of the working class, Kim Il Sung's revolutionary idea elucidates the strategies and tactics for national, class and human liberation in our era. It also raised a theory on the leadership method for the first time in the revolutionary theory of the working class and systematized its unique composition. This is an important exploit of his idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea is also different from the preceding theories in historic period, because it reflects the requirements of the revolutionary practice in the new historical era in which the popular masses carve out their destiny independently and creatively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea represents the highest stage in the development of the revolutionary idea of the working class. This is because it is based on the new man-centered philosophical principle, has a scientific and revolutionary composition system and contains rich and diverse contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary idea serves as the eternal guiding idea, theory and method representing both the present era and the future of human emancipation. The theoretical and practical exploits of this idea have been carried forward and enriched with new principles and theories by leader Kim Jong Il's Songun idea, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
