He went to the lengths of pulling up the north, claiming that the north side attributed the recent situation in south Korea to the U.S. manipulation and instigation and it was \"interfering in the internal affairs of south Korea.\"\r\n The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in its information bulletin No. 863 issued on March 19 in this regard said that this was something beyond common sense as this way of thinking and speaking are unbecoming for an official in charge of inter-Korean relations and reunification issue in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: We put forward a constructive proposal on holding the working meeting in the area of the north side, prompted by the patriotic desire to develop the inter-Korean relations and continue dialogue and contact whatever the cost though south Korea is in a state of anarchy due to the power vacuum and it is under an abnormal situation where dialogue and negotiations cannot be held properly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south side took issue with the north side, asserting that it was to blame for the abortive contact, instead of expressing gratitude to its dialogue partner for having made sincere efforts to save the inter-Korean dialogue from the danger caused by the disturbance in the south. These remarks can be made only by a person who is unable to properly judge the present reality and the essence of the problem. Moreover, it is nonsensical to talk this or that about the north's principled stand toward the situation created in the wake of the passage of the \"motion on impeachment\" through the \"National Assembly\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that a handful of rightist conservative forces such as the \"Grand National Party\" are no more than puppets and the United States is behind them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly want the improved inter-Korean relations, they should not groundlessly slander their dialogue partner but positively respond to the north's proposal that took the south Korean reality into consideration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
