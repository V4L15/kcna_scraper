Amid the spreading of the story about \"war in August\" along with such belligerent remarks as \"preventive war\" and \"preemptive attack\", Trump said \"north Korea will be faced with fire and fury\" and \"if a war breaks out, it will be fought on the Korean peninsula and if thousands die, it will also be on the peninsula.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's perfect success in the ICBM-ready H-bomb test conducted on September 3 was the greatest victory which put the country on the status of a world-class nuclear power and provided a creditable military guarantee for putting an end to the history of the U.S. imperialists' nuclear blackmails.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn September 12 the DPRK finished the project for making its medium-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 combat-ready, thus clarifying that its final goal is to keep balance of force with the U.S. in actuality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn September 19 Trump dared cry out for \"totally destroying\" the DPRK in the UN arena, unheard-of rubbish, only to stun the world public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK clarified its toughest countering will to deal with the U.S most ferocious declaration of war with fire surely and definitely.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Second Plenary Session of the 7th Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea on October 7 once again clarified the principled stand of our Party and state to preserve the noble mission and nature of the DPRK's nukes which its people gained through a hard struggle and to protect peace and security of the Korean peninsula and the region and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOn November 29, the DPRK succeeded in the test-fire of new type ICBM Hwasong-15 reflecting its tremendous might as a world-class military power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. persistent moves against the DPRK in political, economic, military, diplomatic and all other fields till the end of this year could not stop even a moment the advance of the DPRK confident in the victory of its cause.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks to Juche Korea which is standing in the outpost for preserving independence, justice and socialism with the nuclear treasured sword of justice, a nuclear war threatening the world was prevented and the desire of mankind for peace preserved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK, an undeniable new strategic state and nuclear power of Juche, declares:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDo not expect any change in its policy. Its entity as an invincible power can neither be undermined nor be stamped out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK, as a responsible nuclear weapons state, will lead the trend of history to the only road of independence and justice, weathering all tempests on this planet."

            "content": "ACNC publica informacion detallada sobre la situacion de Peninsula Coreana en 2017\r\nPyongyang, 30 de diciembre (ACNC) -- La Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea publico el dia 29 la informacion detallada relativa a la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana en el ano 2017.\n\t\t\t\t\tSu texto principal va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion de la Peninsula Coreana es una miniatura de la politica mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa administracion Trump presento la solucion del problema nuclear de Corea como primer punto de su politica diplomatica y de seguridad y definio la politica sobre la RPDC como \"maxima presion y compromiso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiciendo abiertamente que la \"manera de acercamiento a Corea es precisamente el ataque preventivo\", ella recurrio a la politica mas intransigente que la mantenida por los ejecutivos antecesores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, el enfoque de la sociedad internacional se ha centrado en la Peninsula Coreana desde el principio de este ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl indicar el rumbo de marcha de la Corea socialista para el Ano Nuevo, nuestro Partido y Estado declararon oficialmente su posicion de principios de que mientras EE.UU. y sus seguidores no dejen de ejercer la amenaza y chantaje nucleares sobre la RPDC ni de desarrollar los ejercicios de guerra con la excusa de que es una tradicion efectuarlos anualmente, la RPDC seguira fortaleciendo la capacidad de autodefensa nacional y de ataque preventivo centrada en las fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 12 de febrero, se realizo con exito el lanzamiento de prueba del cohete balistico tierra-tierra de largo y mediano alcance \"Pukguksong-2\", nuevo sistema de arma estrategica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 18 de marzo, salio exitosa de primer intento la prueba estatica de reaccion del motor de gran capacidad, lo cual anuncio el nuevo nacimiento de la industria coheteril de tipo Juche y la preparacion de solida base para completar las fuerzas armadas nucleares del Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos dias 4 y 28 de julio, se inyectaron seguidamente en el cielo los ICBM tipo \"Hwasong-14\" que pueden atacar el corazon de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe adoptaron una tras otra nuevas leyes de sancion sobre Corea y las \"resoluciones de sancion\" de la ONU y circularon los chismes como la \"guerra preventiva\", \"ataque preventivo\" y \"guerra en agosto\". En tales circunstancias, Trump disparateo que Corea enfrentara las \"llamas y furia\" y la \"guerra se desatara en la Peninsula Coreana y aunque mueran miles de personas, eso sucedera tambien ahi\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl exito fulminante en la prueba de la bomba H instalable en el ICBM, efectuada el 3 de septiembre, puso a nuestra patria en la primera fila de las potencias nucleares de talla mundial y dio la garantia militar de poner punto final a la historia de chantaje nuclear de los imperialistas yanquis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 12 de septiembre, se realizo otra vez el lanzamiento de prueba del cohete balistico estrategico de mediano y largo alcance \"Hwasong-12\", lo cual insinuo que nuestra meta final es tomar equilibrio real de fuerza con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 19 de septiembre, Trump se atrevio a pronunciar en el escenario de la ONU el peor disparate de \"destruccion total\" de nuestro Estado dejando consternada a toda la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Corea del Juche expuso su posicion superintransigente de que respondera sin falta con el fuego a la declaracion de guerra mas brutal de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa segunda sesion plenaria del septimo periodo del Comite Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, realizada el 7 de octubre, declaro otra vez la noble mision y caracter de las armas nucleares de la RPDC, conquistadas a cambio de la lucha tenaz del pueblo coreano, y la posicion de principios de nuestro partido y Estado de defender la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y del resto del orbe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 29 de noviembre, se disparo el nuevo ICBM \"Hwasong-15\" demostrando a todo el mundo la inagotable fuerza de la RPDC, potencia militar de talla mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ofensiva de EE.UU., que no paro hasta el fin de este ano en todos los dominios como politica, economia, plano militar y diplomacia, no pudo detener ni un momento la marcha vigorosa de la RPDC, bien convencida del triunfo de su causa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que la Corea del Juche con el medio nuclear de justicia defendio la linea avanzada de defensa de independencia, justicia y socialismo, se previno este ano la guerra nuclear que amenazaba el mundo y se defendio el anhelo de la humanidad sobre la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, nuevo Estado estrategico y potencia nuclear del Juche que nadie puede negar, declara asi:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que no nos esperen ningun cambio!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa figura sustancial de la Corea poderosa no se puede eliminar ni exterminar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo responsable poseedora de armas nucleares, la RPDC conducira la corriente de la historia al unico camino de independencia y justicia frustrando todos los desafios de este planeta."
