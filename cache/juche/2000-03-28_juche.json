They prefer traditional Korean food on holidays such as lunar new year's day, Tano (the 5th day of the 5th lunar month) and the autumn festival despite several years of shortage of food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Special attention is paid to dressing suited to their way of life.

He creates everything in Korean style,  the style of Juche, not copying foreign styles in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the creations made by him are distinct, unique and innovative in their nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Everything created under  his leadership is the result of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another feature of his outstanding creative activities is that they are very wide-range and diverse as they involve all fields of the revolution and construction in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All realms of the world and all spheres of the revolution and construction are objects of his very wide-range and diverse creative activities.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They involve not only ideological and theoretical fields but party and state construction, economic and cultural construction and building of armed forces and so on.     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His outstanding creative activities are characterized by the fact that he sets a high goal and most admirably attains it at an exceptionally high speed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unimaginably high is the speed at which he creates new things. Whatever he creates is of global significance. He creates the best things of great value not only at present but in the distant future of mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il is possessed of rare disposition and ability as a great genius of creation and construction. No one can match him in intellect and talent, organizational ability  and leadership art, revolutionary zeal and sweep. Endowed with all this, he has performed so great exploits on behalf of the times and humankind as an unprecedentedly  great master of creation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people under the leadership of Kim Jong Il will continue building gigantic edifices in the future, too, that no one else can do. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities' ridiculous farce assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A \"cenotaph\"  to the GIs killed in the Korean War is expected to be erected near River Rimjin flowing through Phaju close to panmunjom under \"full cooperation\" from the South Korean authorities. The erection of the \"cenotaph\" is reportedly meant to mark 50 years since the U.S.  launched a war of aggression against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary describes this as a burlesque to call back the departed soul of the GIs who died a dog's death in the war of aggression. It is  intended to embellish the U.S. aggressors and incite a second war to invade the DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities decided to erect the \"cenotaph\" to the U.S. war dead in South Korea which is dyed with the blood of those fellow countrymen killed by them and are keen on the project at a time when all the countrymen are shaking with burning hatred against the U.S. imperialist ogres and their pledge to take revenge upon them. This is an intolerable treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This thrice-cursed crime can be committed only by flunkeyists, war servants and traitors without equal who are keen on currying favour with the U.S. and Japan, their masters, even by selling off the national pride and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History and the nation will never pardon and connive at this insult and mockery. \r\n\r\n"

It is the unanimous wish of the world that the DPRK-Japan talks will proceed smoothly to open a new phase of peace and security in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But there are highly disturbing developments before the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Tokyo metropolitan governor of Japan Shintaro Ishihara on March 7 talked rubbish that \"Japan would destroy North Korea at one blow.\" He might be aware what implications his anti-DPRK statement will have for the DPRK-Japan talks. His outbursts cannot be considered as his personal view only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKanji Nishio, chairman of the \"Society for New History Textbook\", in the book \"the People's History\" denied Japan's responsibility for an apology and compensation and revealed its wild ambition for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are kicking up such a row as staging a drill under the simulated conditions of the \"intrusion of mysterious ships\" under the pretext of \"taking security measures\" for the G-8 summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pursuant to its new strategy of \"giving importance to the southwest,\" Japan is rapidly redeploying its \"Self-Defense Forces\" in the western region facing the DPRK and reorganizing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These facts make the people worry about the future of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recent moves of the Japanese reactionaries suggest that they do not truly stand for a dialogue. They are seriously mistaken if they think they can expect understanding from their dialogue partner even after coming out to it with daggers in their belts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan truly wants a dialogue, it should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and honestly comply with the DPRK's just demand for its settlement of past wrongdoings.  \r\n\r\n"

And they are openly distributing a book \"history of the people\", praising the blood-stained history of the Japanese imperialists who occupied Korea and other Asian countries by force of arms and committed unprecedented crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is one more crime that can never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries, who are running amok in hostility toward the DPRK, is to escape the atonement for their past wrongdoings, realise their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" and lay an artificial obstacle in the way of the DPRK-Japan talks that has been arranged with so much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should stop a foolish act of doubling crimes, sincerely reflect on all its crimes of the past and apologize and compensate for them, which is a right conduct for Japan itself. \r\n\r\n"
