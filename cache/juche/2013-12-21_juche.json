Korean Military's Confrontational Moves\r\n Pyongyang, December 21 (KCNA) -- The puppet military of south Korea has recently kicked off a campaign for putting a ban on more than 50 songs, including the traditional song of the nation \"Arirang\", in army units after branding them as \"seditious\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Defense Ministry\" ordered each unit to delete those songs from medium, banning their introduction into barracks. Consequently, in units and at their karaoke rooms one can see only notice \"Banned\" if any of those songs was selected.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, Minister Kim Kwan Jin and other brasshats of the puppet ministry told the \"National Assembly\" Legislation and Judiciary Committee that the step was taken for maintaining \"military discipline\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Arirang\" is a famous song popular among the Koreans both in the north and south from long ago. Included in those \"seditious songs\" are folk songs \"The Nodul Riverside\", \"Platycodon\", \"Milyang Arirang\" and \"Ballad of the Pheasant\" and \"Balsam\", a song of the enlightenment period, as well as songs created and already spread in the north and the south of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some of the folk songs were designated as \"seditious ones\" because they were arranged in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Such action is now arousing strong protests and criticism from among the people of different social standings in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Articles and comments have been posted on different websites one after another to accuse the south Korean puppet military group of having deprived the people of the right to sing even a song at will. One of the articles deplored that it is not free for anyone in south Korea to read a book or sing a song, recalling that the year of 2008 witnessed the list of \"seditious books\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A journalist said that \"Arirang\" is a song liked by the Koreans through generations and he could not understand why it was branded as a \"seditious song\". Meanwhile, a publicist queried that any piece of music should be \"seditious\", if it is sung by a singer in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean public has denounced the measure as a reminder of the era of \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship, which had ruthlessly trampled upon the people's freedom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities of south Korea, not content with barring the people from singing the songs reflecting the desire of all Koreans for national reunification, went the length of defiling the nation's cultural heritages only for confrontation among the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such disgusting step is a separatist and fascist act that could be done only by those steeped in conception of antagonism toward the fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group should keep in mind that only shameless self-destruction awaits them."

Korean Authorities' Sycophancy toward US\r\n Pyongyang, December 21 (KCNA) -- The puppet chief executive of south Korea, when recently meeting with the U.S. vice-president on a tour of it,  begged for closer cooperation for the denuclearization of the north, blustering that alliance with the U.S. is a core axis of stability and peace and it is developing in depth. The puppet prime minister of south Korea also cried out for all-inclusive strategic alliance in the 21st century and close cooperation. The puppet group announced a \"proposal for expanding the air defense identification zone\" with the U.S. approval.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Saturday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" is not a core axis of stability and peace as touted by the puppet group but a shackling and country-selling alliance for helping the U.S. carry out its policy of domination and interference in south Korea and aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is becoming vociferous about development and all-inclusive strategic alliance in the 21st century, far from scrapping the south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\". This is aimed to reduce south Korea into a U.S. colony and, at the same time, boost cooperation with its U.S. master under the pretext of the nuclear issue and do harm to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the puppet group begged its U.S. master for close cooperation in its moves for \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"denuclearizing the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's announcement of the above-said proposal with the U.S. approval is a revelation of its sycophancy toward the U.S. The U.S. approval is designed to use the group as a stooge for carrying out its strategy for dominating Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only a disgraceful defeat and self-destruction await the group depending on foreign forces and escalating confrontation, clinging to the coattail of its American master."
