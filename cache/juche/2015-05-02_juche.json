Much upset by this, the U.S. representative at the UN went reckless, calling on the secretariat to disconnect mike and threatening to call police. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strange things happened in the hall. Some of the \"defectors\" stood up and made odd shouts. They were not able to properly read English texts of speeches written by the U.S. only to become a laughing stock in the hall. This once again brought to light vulgar efforts of the U.S. to hype and internationalize the \"human rights issue\" and the true nature of the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By staging the recent \"seminar\" the U.S. took one more infamous step in the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket kicked up in the international arena including the UN with the above-said \"defectors\" involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, the U.S. wooed the UN General Assembly and the UN Human Rights Council into adopting anti-DPRK \"human rights resolutions\" on the basis of \"testimonies\" made by \"defectors from north Korea\" last year and this year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But when one \"defector\" who was the main testifier admitted that he made false testimony, the \"human rights issue\" much touted by the U.S. proved to be a fabrication in the eyes of the world community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent \"seminar on human rights\" goes to prove that how desperately the U.S. is working to tarnish the dignity and image of the DPRK by citing fictitious \"human rights issue\" and invent a pretext for interfering in the internal affairs of the DPRK and launching aggression against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the UN is allowing the prestige and honor of the world body to be defamed, oblivious of its mission and duty and taken in by false testimonies of human scum, under the U.S. command and manipulation though it should enjoy trust by ensuring equal sovereignty and international impartiality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN let its assistant secretary general take part in the political \"seminar\" against its member nation and make reckless remarks in favor of the U.S. This eloquently proves that the principle of objectivity and impartiality, which keep the UN alive, is violated and the UN arena has turned into a theatre of rowdyism of political tricksters and confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the facts once again warn that the U.S. and the UN will face bitterer disgrace and more vehement international criticism if they go reckless, harboring criminals and \"defectors from north Korea\"."

En marzo, aprobó otra vez la \"resolución de DDHH\" anti-RPDC en la 28ª reunión del Consejo de DDHH de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el \"fugitivo norcoreano\", que se ofreció como \"testigo\" principal, reconoció que sus testimonios son falsos, así que se conoció en todo el mundo que el \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC, de que hablaba tanto EE.UU., no pasa de ser un invento fraudulento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de ello, EE.UU. volvió a abrir el \"seminario de DDHH\" en su desesperado intento de manchar la dignidad y la imagen de la RPDC y preparar el pretexto de intervención y agresión.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede soslayar el hecho de que lejos de su misión de garantizar la igualdad de soberanía de los países y la imparcialidad internacional, la ONU se gana la deshonra dejándose engañar por los testimonios falsos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ONU envió al asistente del secretario general de la ONU al \"seminario\" político contra un país miembro para que pronunciara discurso como portavoz de la posición de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho es una prueba de que la ONU se convirtió en una escena caótica de fraudes políticos y el campo de confrontación faltando a sus principios vitales de objetividad e imparcialidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra que si EE.UU. y la ONU siguen amparando a los \"fugitivos norcoreanos\", delincuentes y escorias humanas, sufrirán la vergüenza y la crítica más grandes en la arena internacional."
