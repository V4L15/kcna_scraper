It has closely cooperated with the international organization since it acceded to the International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can attain its sinister political goal through the above-said action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no desperate actions can the U.S. prevent the DPRK from building a socialist power by dint of its tremendous military muscle and in the indomitable spirit of self-reliance and self-development."

He did not make an apology for it and even declined the request made by the governor of Okinawa Prefecture for meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Like master, like man. Even the U.S. soldiers and their civilian employees seem to regard Japanese men including politicians as imbeciles of a colony unable to protect their own women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The de factor ruler of Okinawa Prefecture under the military occupation of the U.S. is Americans, not Japanese.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Davis, the spokesman for the U.S. Defence Department, concerning the request made by the Okinawa Prefectural governor on revising the status of forces agreement between Japan and the U.S. in the wake of the occurrence of the recent case, openly expressed a stand not to respond to it, saying that the U.S. forces have approached Japanese side's concerns with improvement, not with revision, and they will continue to approach it the same way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even though its citizens including women are being exposed to insult and meeting death, not sleeping comfortable sleep due to the U.S. forces' crimes, Japan fails to make even a single shout at the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just the Japanese citizens who are suffering due to the senseless politicians who serve the U.S. and fail to make even proper words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, Prime Minister Abe \"invited\" the American boss to Hiroshima, the land of distress where approximately 260 000 innocent people lost their lives due to the A-bomb dropped by the U.S. for the first time in human history, and kowtowed to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the Japanese ambassador to the U.S. went so stupid as saying he would not like to say anything of Obama who did not apologize for the A-bomb dropping.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan looks so miserable that it has to eat boiled crow even though its life security is seriously threatened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is fated to continue to please his American master with its underwear down."

            "content": "RPDC condena maniobras de EE.UU. para aislarla y bloquearla\r\nPyongyang, 4 de junio (ACNC) -- El pasado dia primero, el Departamento de Finanzas de EE.UU. publico que designara oficialmente a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea como \"jurisdiccion de principal preocupacion de lavado de dinero\" y elaborara los reglamentos de medidas especiales para aislarla mas en el sistema financiero internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz del Comite Nacional de Coordinacion de la RPDC sobre el Anti-lavado de Dinero y Anti-Financiacion del Terrorismo, en una declaracion fechada 4, condeno y rechazo categoricamente la conducta de EE.UU. calificandola como otro crimen ilegal que viola la soberania y el derecho a  subsistencia de la RPDC y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa dicha designacion por EE.UU., fracasado en lograr su objetivo mediante la injusta \"resolucion de sanciones\" de la ONU, persigue el astuto proposito de fabricar sanciones por separado y adicionales violando cruelmente la Carta de la ONU y la ley internacional para remediar el defecto de la \"resolucion de sanciones\" de la ONU y realizar el bloqueo total contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio demanda a los paises vecinos de la RPDC a ejercer mas la presion sobre esta, gritando la \"ejecucion de sanciones\", pero no hacemos caso de esta tonteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTampoco es sorprendente el metodo habitual de EE.UU. que intenta tildarnos de \"pais de proliferacion nuclear\", \"pais violador de DDHH\" e incluso \"pais de lavado de dinero\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo debe conocer bien y tratar con vigilancia las viles maniobras de EE.UU., opuestas al hecho de que la RPDC y la Fuerza Encargada de Accion Financiera se colaboran bien en el sector de prevencion del lavado de dinero y la financiacion del terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPartiendo de la posicion consecuente contra el lavado de dinero y la financiacion del terrorismo, la RPDC establecio el ordenado sistema estatal organizando la Direccion de Control Financiero y la Direccion de Informacion Financiera para prevencion del lavado de dinero conforme a la regla internacional, aprobo la ley contra el lavado del dinero y la financiacion del terrorismo y sigue colaborando con la organizacion internacional ingresando a la Convencion Internacional sobre la Supresion de la Financiacion del Terrorismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una gran equivocacion si EE.UU. piensa en que pueda lograr su malsano proposito politico mediante la designacion a la RPDC como \"jurisdiccion de principal preocupacion de lavado de dinero\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor mucho que se desespere, EE.UU. nunca podra impedir el avance de la RPDC que construye la potencia socialista con el inquebrantable poderio militar y el espiritu indoblegable de autofortalecimiento."
