Calls for Bringing into Bloom Socialist Culture in Songun Era \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 10 (KCNA) -- All the party members and other working people should further develop and bring into fuller bloom the socialist culture in the era of Songun as required by the developing reality in which a high-pitched drive and leaping advances are reported, in order to strikingly demonstrate the invincible spirit of Juche Korea. This call is made by Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in an editorial. \r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea in the joint slogans published on the 60th anniversary of the WPK put forward militant tasks to further develop and bring into bloom the socialist culture in the era of Songun era with the revolutionary soldier culture as an example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to study hard leader Kim Jong Il's idea and line on building the socialist culture in the era of Songun reflected in the joint slogans and turn out as one in the drive to implement them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier culture represents the struggle and advance, revolutionary optimism and joy created in the most difficult days of the \"Arduous March,\" the forced march. It is, at the same time, brilliant culture created in the crucible of the struggle to defend socialism as it frustrated the vicious moves of the U.S. imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the gun roar of Songun. Only when everybody earnestly learns from the revolutionary soldier culture, a valuable treasure in the era of Songun, and brings it into full bloom, can the revolutionary soldier spirit be accepted by the whole society and all the people as fighting spirit and remarkable leap forward effected in the all-out charge for building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for everybody to earnestly acquire the revolutionary soldier culture Kim Jong Il created in the way of endless inspection of units of the Korean Peopleï¿½fs Army and practice it in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When singing songs and dancing, one should prefer to sing songs and perform dances the KPA servicepersons do with ardent patriotism, warm comradeship, optimism and revolutionary enthusiasm and strive hard to fully apply the revolutionary soldier spirit in one's work and life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. bellicose forces recently decided to deploy an unmanned reconnaissance plane Hunter in south Korea.\r\n In particular, it is speeding up the introduction of the missile defence system (MD) while boosting the U.S.-Japan joint military cooperation under the absurd pretext of coping with the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. They have buckled down to deploying \"X Band Radar\", modern type surveillance equipment, in Japan as part of the plan to introduce the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in its signed commentary terms them deliberate and premeditated moves to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war as they are dangerous military moves aimed at a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These actions of the U.S. are nothing but hostile acts against the DPRK and peace because they only chill the good atmosphere of peace and reunification and reconciliation and cooperation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula, increase the tension and escalate the danger of military clash, the commentary notes, and goes on:\r\n Moreover, the U.S. bellicose forces are bolstering their aggressor troops in and around south Korea at a time when the talks are going on to solve the nuclear issue and put an end to the military stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves what U.S. much-touted \"peace on the Korean Peninsula\" means.\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to prove its intention not to invade the DPRK in practice by giving up its scenario for aggression against it on the basis of a cool-headed point of view on the reality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It serves as a banner further inspiring all the Koreans to the struggle for national reunification.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters for national reunification are not only a banner of Korea's reunification but also the most just and realistic program for the struggle to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country, the article notes, and goes on:\r\n The three charters serve as a banner of national reunification as they indicate the principles and ways to settle the issue of reunification of the country most smoothly and in the shortest span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of national independence is the basic idea and kernel of the three charters. That is why the three charters have great attraction, arousing the unanimous support from all the Koreans and spreading the hot air of reconciliation, unity and independent reunification across the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters fully reflect the desire and demands of the nation as they clarify, through the most aboveboard and reasonable proposal, the actual possibilities and ways of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean nation is glorifying the new history of independent reunification with the birth of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration, which calls for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by the united efforts of the Korean nation, has been absolutely supported by all the Koreans as a milestone for independent reunification because it materialized the three charters clearly indicating the principles and ways for national independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should invigorate the movement for national reunification as required by the joint slogans, an embodiment of the patriotic stand and will for reunification, and thus open up a turning phase of independent reunification this significant year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As the joint slogans clarified, the will and policy of the DPRK to consistently wage a resolute struggle to defend peace and realize the humankind's idea of peace remain unshakable.\r\n It is an intrinsic demand of our socialist society to implement the idea of peace. There are neither classes nor strata that show interest in a war and pursue it in our country where the popular masses have become the masters of the state and society and everything serves them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people experienced the disasters of the horrible war launched by the U.S. imperialists and are building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation despite the endless moves of the U.S. imperialists for aggression. For this type of people nothing is more precious than peace. Their firm peace-loving stand and struggle for it proceed from this conception. \r\n The peace the DPRK desires rules out slavish submission.  It ardently loves peace and never wants a war but will exercise its sovereignty and strongly retaliate by force of arms against anyone coming to invade and conquer it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
