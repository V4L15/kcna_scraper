They should not be buoyed by militarist fever but see the reality before action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese government turns away its face from the present changed reality and resorts to militarist policy to follow in the wake of its ancestors, it will run head-on into stiff resistance by the Korean and Asian peoples and it is bound to meet a more shameful doom than in the past.    \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Kim Jong Il's Russia visit\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 28 (KCNA) -- As widely reported, Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, recently paid an official visit to the Russian federation.\r\n Kim Jong Il's Russia visit is a historic event of great significance as it marked a milestone for the DPRK-Russia friendship and the cause of independence in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This visit opened a new chapter in the history of the development of the traditional DPRK-Russia friendly relations and provided a banner for ensuring global peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the most important aspect in the visit is that the DPRK-Russia Moscow declaration was adopted thanks to the political determination of the top leaders of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the declaration after President Putin's Pyongyang visit last year is, first of all, clear evidence of the validity and vitality of the independent foreign policy the Workers' Party of Korea has consistently pursued. it once again proved that the DPRK-Russia relations are growing stronger and developing in the spirit of mutual respect and understanding, friendship and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking note of the fact that the 1972 ABM treaty serves as a cornerstone of strategic stability and a basis for the further reduction of strategic offensive weapons, the top leaders of the two countries expressed the resolution to make every possible contribution to strengthening the international stability and they affirmed that the DPRK's missile program is of peaceful nature and, accordingly, poses no threat to any country that respects its sovereignty. \r\n This dealt a telling blow to the u.s. moves to establish the \"Missile Defense\" system (MD) aimed at unchallenged world domination and its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and Russia will strongly and decisively counter the U.S. moves for establishing MD to militarize space and spark nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two top leaders reached a consensus of views on the fact that to support the Korean people in their efforts to settle the issue of the country's reunification independently and peacefully by themselves according to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration will contribute to solving the issue of Korea's reunification and stressed the fact that the pullout of the U.S. forces from South Korea is a pressing issue in ensuring peace and security in the Korean peninsula and in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reaffirmed the validity of the DPRK independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and stability have not yet been settled on the Korean peninsula even after the demise of the Cold War entirely due to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and the U.S. troops' presence in South Korea which provides military backing to the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification for the U.S. troops to stay in South Korea any longer as the north and the south agreed to solve the issue of national reunification independently by the efforts of the Korean nation in the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should no longer budge from its obligation as the party responsible for the solution of the Korean issue and make a bold option to withdraw its troops from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only then is it possible to ensure peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two leaders agreed on the detailed orientation and measures to boost bilateral cooperation in different fields such as politics, economy, military affairs, science and technology and culture and a number of relevant agreements were signed to implement them. This is an auspicious event for the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intimate relations between the two leaders are getting closer and the enthusiasm to boost the friendly ties is growing stronger than ever before among the broad public circles and peoples of the two countries. This gives a powerful impetus to the development of the bilateral friendly relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditional relations of friendship and cooperation between the two peoples which have steadily developed generation after generation, century after century will grow stronger and develop in the spirit of the agreement reached between the two leaders.    \r\n\r\n"

The commentary goes on:\r\n This sabre-rattling goes to prove that the united states is leaving no means untried to stifle the DPRK by force anytime while talking about \"dialogue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hard-won peace and reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula was thrown into the danger of collapse after the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A very dangerous situation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula where the state of armistice may collapse and a war may break out anytime due to the war hysteria of the bellicose elements of the bush administration and their stepped-up hard-line policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States truly stands for the peace and reconciliation process on the Korean peninsula it should stop all its military moves threatening the DPRK and increasing the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should withdraw its forces from South Korea, away from the conception of regarding the DPRK as its \"principal enemy\" and hostile policy towards it and strive to create a sound atmosphere of dialogue by withdrawing all the unilateral preconditions.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean Grand National Party's anti-north diatribe under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland on August 27 issued a statement assailing some forces of South Korea for bringing charges against those who participated in the \"2001 Grand Festival for National Reunification\" held in Pyongyang as representatives of South Korea.\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful grand Pyongyang festival which drew together personages of organizations from all walks of life in the north and the south of Korea and abroad, the first of its kind after the country's division, is commanding absolute support and warm welcome at home and abroad as a significant festival which made a great stride forward toward achieving the cause of independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, seriously disturbing developments are taking place in South Korea. The historic significance of the festival is grossly distorted and representatives who participated in the festival are charged with absurd \"prominent acts\". North-south confrontation is thus incited in contravention of the spirit of the June 15 north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural that the representatives are commanding nation's unreserved praise and welcome as they conducted praiseworthy activities for reunification and patriotism during their stay in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the opening and closing ceremonies held in front of the monument to the three charters for national reunification, the representatives of the south side attended it only as observers as they were organized by the north side. We have already made this clear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their participation in the ceremonies should never be called into question as personages of different political parties and those from all walks of life of the south side attended as observers the functions held on October 10 last year in celebration of the 55th founding anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the visit should be called into question as claimed by the Grand National Party it would mean that mutual visits are unthinkable to say nothing of joint functions between the north and the south where differing ideologies and systems exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By recklessly working to distort the significance of the Pyongyang festival and incriminate representatives the party seeks to nullify the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and push the situation on the Korean peninsula back to that in the days of inter-Korean confrontation and attain their despicable political ambition to go \"unchallenged\" in internal political strife. This is its true intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that allowing these things to go on would dampen the hard-won spirit of reconciliation and unity and bring the inter-Korean relations back to the state of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Right-wing conservatives of the grand national party are well advised to ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless acts and behave with discretion facing up to the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should lend an ear to the just voices of the South Koreans from all walks of life in their movement for reunification and patriotism and refrain from bringing charges against pro-reunification patriotic figures as what the anti-reunification elements are now doing diametrically runs counter to the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

It also stressed that the withdrawal of U.S. forces from South Korea is very urgent for ensuring peace and security in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Korean nation's will to reject outside forces and achieve the independent reunification of the country by its united efforts at any cost in the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This will of the nation has been affirmed in the Moscow declaration, which reflects the unshakable will of the workers' party and people of Korea to valiantly remove any obstacles and reunify the country at an early date under the banner of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a local executive of the U.S. imperialists' policy for division of Korea, its troops in South Korea are desperately obstructing Korea's reunification while inflicting untold misfortunes and pain upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the inter-Korean relationship has turned into that of reconciliation after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the U.S. imperialists are intensifying the anti-DPRK smear campaign and its criminal hostile policy toward the DPRK to bring the north-south relationship back to confrontation and tense situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. forces is the demand not only of the Korean nation but also of the world community.
