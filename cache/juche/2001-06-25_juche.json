The payment was approved after groups of victims of Nazism filed suits in U.S. federal district courts against forced labour.\r\n The government and business of Germany alloted over 10 billion mark for such payment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This positive development shows the determination of the German government to urgently settle the compensation issue on the principles of international law and humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, Japan's attitude is quite different from Germany's though similar lawsuits were brought to U.S. federal district courts by former \"comfort women for the imperial Japanese army.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities have lavished money and raised unreasonable conditions one after another to turn down those lawsuits, taking the public by surprise. They are lost to shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crime related to the issue of \"comfort women for the Japanese army\" is so shameless and hideous crime against humanity that it is hardly comparable to the forced labour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before their defeat in the war, the Japanese imperialists killed or buried alive most of more than 200,000 Asian women, mainly Koreans, who were forced into sexual slavery, to destroy evidence proving their crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such disgraceful history of shocking atrocities can neither be erased nor denied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese authorities are seeking to hush up this case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts prove that Japan is a morally vulgar and shameless, abnormal country, which can never be recognized by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can become a member of the international community only when it makes full compensation for forcing over six million young and middle aged Koreans to do mediaeval slave labour, as well as for the crime related to the \"comfort women for the Japanese army\" on the principle of international law.    \r\n\r\n"

They should heighten vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression. They should always keep themselves in an alerted and mobilized posture, aware that the U.S. imperialists may ignite a war against the DPRK any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they provoke another Korean war, all the party members and other working people will fight like a-match-for-a-hundred fighters to mercilessly wipe out the aggressors and achieve the national reunification, their historic desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial underscored the need to expose and denounce all the treacherous forces of the nation standing in the way of implementing the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and deal a telling blow to them by the concerted efforts of the pro-reunification patriotic forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should honestly fulfil its commitments and duties, make a radical switchover in its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and withdraw its troops from South Korea without delay, the editorial concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
