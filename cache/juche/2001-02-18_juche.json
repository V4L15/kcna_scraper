Outside forces are not interested in the reunification of Korea, but in its division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Korean people pool their efforts and will can they settle the reunification question, and they should do so under all circumstances. Everything can go on well when they solve the reunification question by their own efforts in that sense of responsibility and with that consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no doubt that the door of reunification will be opened when the whole nation pool their efforts from the transparent independent stand that they are responsible for the reunification of the country in the spirit of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to open the door of the reunification by the Korean nation's efforts in the spirit of the joint declaration it is imperative to steadfastly maintain the stand of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is a fundamental principle of national reunification. Only when everything is subordinated to the dignity and interests of the nation from the steadfast stand of national independence can the reunification question be properly settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to open the door of reunification by the Korean nation's efforts it is also necessary for the whole nation to unite under the banner of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Korean nation is firmly united can they fully discharge their responsibility and role as the driving force of reunification, remove all the obstacles lying in the way of national reunification and bring about a dawn of reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
