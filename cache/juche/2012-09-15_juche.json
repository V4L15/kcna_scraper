But, the landing was deterred for three days by a KPA coastal artillery company on Wolmi Island, making them take 14 days to reach Seoul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Western media, too, viewed the operation as a failed one in comparison with the forces mobilized in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the operation, which the south Korean regime praised as one for \"national salvation\", the U.S. troops killed over 1 300 citizens in Inchon City only in a day, September 16, 1950. Earlier, when they were fleeing southward, attacked by the KPA, they murdered more than 5 000 innocent people in the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prior to the landing, the commander of the U.N.

But, the disclosed fact proves that it was the shameless deception. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the provocative action was made public to the media, the regime of south Korea upset by it made such poor excuse that \"concept of preemptive attack for the right to self-defense\" was first applied to UFG. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, UFG was the typical war drill for invasion the purpose of which was to mount a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK and implant the corrupt \"liberal democratic system\" into it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors to seek a foolish dream backed by outside forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Preemptive attack is not a monopoly of invaders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army has already rounded off the preparations for the final battle in line with the operation plan of the Supreme Command. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the warmongers dare provoke the DPRK, its army and people will deal an annihilating strike at the enemies by venting their pent-up grudges and hatred and win victory in the just sacred war for national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies' preemptive attack on the DPRK will end in their bitter defeat."

Why? It is its ulterior intention to justify its confrontation policy and shift the responsibility for the collapse of the inter-Korean relations onto the north in a bid to prolong its remaining days, taken aback by the mounting resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to settle accounts with it through a great war for national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the Lee group of traitors escape a stern punishment by history, warns the commentary."

            "content": "Russian Paper Carries Russian Writer's Impressions of DPRK \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The 32nd issue of the Russian paper Patriot carried an article written by Russian writer Rabrentsi Gurzhiyev who took part in celebrations of the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article is titled \"Tears of joy, 10 days that stirred me.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The paper carried a photo of the dear respected Kim Jong Un waving back to columns of the military parade from the tribune of honor of Kim Il Sung Square.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The writer said in his article that he was deeply moved to see many things in the DPRK while staying there for emotion-charged ten days, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When we said we would go to Pyongyang, a woman of our delegation was questioned by her friend why she liked to go to the DPRK far away from Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hearing this, she answered without hesitation that she wanted to feel in the DPRK that she is also a human being. Because one can hardly feel the real value as a human being in the society based on a bourgeois view on value.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When watching the military parade held at Kim Il Sung Square we felt tears of joy in our eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It fully demonstrated before the whole world the invincible might of the Korean People's Army which makes enemies tremble with fear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While visiting Kim Il Sung University and others, we once again realized that the level of education is really high in the DPRK and its education policy is advantageous and this country is the eastern one of good manners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We keenly felt that the DPRK is the future of mankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Koreans work hard and firmly defend the sovereignty of their country. They spend their holidays with joy, enjoy arts and love their children. They also feel happy in their life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foreign visitors to the DPRK would learn that the people of this country like songs very much. The musical talents and cultural level of Koreans strike foreigners with admiration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Giving his impressions of various parts of Pyongyang he visited, the writer continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We visited the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital where we saw splendid jewel-studded floor. This helped us know well about the noble intention of Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was done so to make every child born in the world feel the beauty of their beloved motherland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a legend-like story about the happy people full of national self-respect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Nurseries, kindergartens and schoolchildren's palace we visited once again reminded us of Kim Il Sung who said the children are the kings of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people have foiled the vicious moves of the imperialists with the might of the Songun policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They never yielded to any trial but made redoubled efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people are united close around their party and leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What we felt most keenly while staying in the DPRK is that its people absolutely trust their leaders and remain true to their leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This never happens of its own accord.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This unity has been achieved because the great leaders of the Korean people Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il pursued the policy for their people and Kim Jong Un loves his people more than anybody else and devotes his all to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had the honor of hearing his speech at the square.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is the steadfast determination of the Workers' Party of Korea to make the best people in the world who have remained loyal to the party, weathering all sorts of ordeals, fully enjoy prosperity and wealth in the socialist society without tightening their belts again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I have never heard from any foreign leaders such words full of boundless love for the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On a trip to this country I happened to meet a person going to Pyongyang from Austria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was the man quite indifferent to the socialist idea. So I could not help asking him why he came to have the idea of going to Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He answered my question as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is something in the DPRK which one can hardly find in any capitalist countries. This is independence. Beautiful landscape and famous spots can be found in any part of the world, but the socialist feeling which makes one live by one's own efforts is marvelous, indeed. That is why I like this country. There are difficulties in the DPRK, too, but the people of this country are weathering all of them cheerfully. For me, all these realities of the DPRK are astonishing and rare, indeed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I would like to say something to our readers before concluding my story.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people are neither sufficient in everything nor free from hardships but they are optimistic about victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Korean style socialism is the best one and sure to triumph.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the conclusion I have drawn from my Pyongyang visit."
