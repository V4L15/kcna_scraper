Kim Jong Un also set forth the policies of rejecting outsiders, firmly maintaining the stand of By Our Nation Itself so as to defend the security and peace of the nation and create an atmosphere for improving the north-south relations, it added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has made every possible sincere effort for the improvement of the north-south relations since the outset of this year, it noted, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The positive measures taken by the DPRK for mending the north-south relations throughout the year would have brought about bigger progress in the relations if they had not faced blatant challenge and obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces who have stood for confrontation with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But to our regret, the reality has been quite different.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The information cited facts to prove that the south Korean authorities responded to the DPRK's proposal and efforts for improving the north-south relations and opening up a landmark phase for national reunification by pooling the efforts of the nation with harsher policy for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations have not made even an inch of progress, the danger of a war further increased and confrontation and distrust deepened this year due to the puppet forces' racket for confrontation with the DPRK, the information said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the moves for confrontation with the DPRK stepped up by the south Korean authorities, pushing the north-south relations into a catastrophe, is their absurd ambition for \"unification of social systems.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"unification of social systems\", \"change of the social system in the north\" and \"collapse\" much touted by the puppet forces are nothing but a pipe dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that their policy for confrontation with the DPRK will not be beneficial to the improvement of the north-south relations but will only bring self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the review of the north-south relations this year and a serious lesson that persistence in confrontation will only push the north-south relations into a catastrophe and that it will never help hold dialogue and improve the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should rectify its wrong confrontation policy and make a switchover in its policy if they truly hope for the dialogue and have the willingness to opt for the improvement of the north-south relations."

Dijo asi tambien a los extranjeros con que se ha reunido.\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, pronuncio otros chismes tales como el \"desarrollo nuclear del Norte de Corea constituye el mayor factor de inestabilidad en el Noreste Asiatico y seria amenaza para la paz del mundo\", \"es contradictoria la politica de impulsar paralelamente el desarrollo de arma nuclear y la construccion economica\" y \"no se puede lograr el desarrollo economico sin desnuclearizacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsimismo, expresa ridiculamente que \"le duele mucho la deplorable situacion de DDHH de la poblacion norcoreana\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa chismografia que dice Park a pesar de las repetidas advertencias de la RPDC es una provocacion imperdonable que monta en colera al ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC, subrayo el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual divulgado el dia 19.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mandataria surcoreana debe cuestionar primero a Estados Unidos, que trata de provocar la guerra nuclear de agresion a la RPDC con decenas de miles de armas nucleares, pedir disculpas por los ejercicios de guerra nuclear que realiza en contubernio con su amo norteamericano, y no repetirlos nunca mas en lo adelante, insistio el comentarista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla habla tanto de la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte\" dejando a un lado sus crimenes, lo que demuestra su fachada de lacaya del amo gringo, apunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tProsiguio que si Park esta interesada de veras en el problema de DDHH, debe condenar primero a EE.UU. criticado ahora por la opinion publica mundial por los asesinatos sucesivos de jovenes negros y las torturas escalofriantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, ha de reflexionar sus crimenes de haber convertido el Sur de Corea en la tierra privada de DDHH, concluyo."
