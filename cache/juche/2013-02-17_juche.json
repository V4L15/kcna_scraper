This is despicable political gangsterism which should be severely punished by world conscience. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Visits to homeland and democratic national education are elementary human rights which should be granted to Koreans in Japan under international law. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Second World War, the Japanese imperialists forcefully drafted lots of Koreans to Japan to force them into slave labor. Japan, a war criminal state, has bounden moral and legal duties to ensure legitimate rights for their descendents in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are many countries which have overseas organizations. There is no such rogue state as Japan in the world as it deprived the overseas Koreans' organization and its officials of the elementary rights to visits, and has enforced national discrimination policy and openly made political blackmail against young schoolchildren to take revenge on the state to which it is hostile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now conscientious Japanese of the elder generation say that even the UN urged Japan to stop discrimination and that they can not but feel shame of the authorities' harsh and base suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan when comparing it with the DPRK government's policy for the Japanese people and schools just after Japan's defeat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As was recollected by them, after the defeat of Japan the Japanese in Korea received humanitarian treatment though they were citizens of a war criminal state, which is quite contrary to the treatment of the Koreans in Japan at present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese authorities have imposed sufferings upon Koreans in Japan generation after generation, far from repaying for favor in kind. This criminal act should be referred to the international court and settled. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should behave themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The suppression of Chongryon, legitimate overseas citizens organization of the DPRK, and Koreans in Japan is another wanton violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and it can never be tolerated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Koreans in Japan have the invincible homeland with powerful national strength. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The homeland will always stand by the overseas citizens. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries will have to pay dearly for the step taken by them."
