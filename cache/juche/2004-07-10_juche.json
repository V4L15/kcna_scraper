            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Condemned for Blocking Visit of S. Korean Del. to North \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) released a statement to the press on July 8 denouncing the south Korean authorities for disallowing a south Korean non-governmental delegation to visit Pyongyang to pay homage to President Kim Il Sung on the occasion of the 10th anniversary of his demise.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pak Yong Gil, widow of the late Rev. Mun Ik Hwan, and other personages of various social standings of south Korea intended to visit Pyongyang on this occasion to pay homage to the father of the nation in conformity with the good manners and customs handed down by ancestors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was quite natural in view of moral laws, the traditional etiquette of the nation and idea of the June 15 joint declaration as it is an expression of the boundless respect and reverence for the President who devoted all his life to the liberation of the country and the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities, however, took such an inhuman action as blocking the visit of the delegation to Pyongyang before its departure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The CPRF condemns with bitter national resentment the rude and immoral action taken by the south Korean authorities to bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the period before the publication of the June 15 joint declaration on the strength of the outmoded anti-communist, anti-north law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that a lot of south Koreans have already visited the Kumsusan Memorial Palace to pay respectful homage to the President since the publication of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolutely intolerable is the action taken by the south Korean authorities to disallow the visit of the delegation to the north even ignoring the precedent of visits to the palace which have been placed on a traditional basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This action is of more serious nature as it was committed in the era after the publication of the declaration when visits of compatriots have become brisk between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe south Korean authorities attempted to downplay the significance of the June 15 joint declaration by kicking up the unjustifiable row of \"special inspection\" and are now keen to reject even the system of the north, part of the same nation and a dialogue partner. The north can never remain a passive onlooker to such insolent acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south seems to work hard to bring the inter-Korean relations back to those in the period of the anti-national and inhuman \"civilian government\" before the publication of the declaration as soon as a new \"prime minister\" and \"minister of Unification\" took office. The north cannot but hold it fully accountable for this development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The north does not have any intention to deal any more with those who deny its system nor consider it as their dialogue partner. It has no idea of permitting visits of those blocking even elementary visits of personages between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will let those reckless guys ignorant of courtesy and morality know well that they have no future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities will feel very shameful and regretful for manifesting such political and moral vulgarity and committing such anti-reunification rash acts as denying their dialogue partner, challenging the nation's supreme dignity and going against the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The responsibility for the possible deterioration of the north-south relations will totally rest with the south Korean authorities keen to bring the ties back to those in the period before the publication of the declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
