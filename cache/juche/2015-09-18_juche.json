Watching dwelling houses for people springing up like mushrooms after rain thanks to the devoted struggle of service personnel to thoroughly implement the order of the Party through thick and thin, I feel freed from all cares and worries, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Being told that the living of the people in the afflicted area was brought to normal as the Party took important measures one after another for the recovery from the flooding and sent a lot of foodstuff, daily necessities, etc. to them and they were deeply touched by the repeated loving care shown by the Party for them, he noted that it is the bounden duty of the WPK to take warm and responsible care of the destiny of the people whom President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il regarded as Heaven in their lifetime and officials should not be complacent with the work for the people, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said it is a great success that service personnel and people have wound up, in the main, projects for repairing the inundated houses for thousands of families and temporary rehabilitation of power, telecommunications and railway networks in the city since the start of the recovery drive by their concerted efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is his determination to build dwelling houses more wonderful, modern and better than the old ones for the people in the afflicted area, he gave an instruction to dynamically push ahead with the construction of dwelling houses as a main thrust of the recovery drive in the city.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ardently called on all builders to wind up the drive at the highest level without fail before the 70th founding anniversary of the WPK by fully displaying the spirit of devotedly implementing the decisions of the Party, the spirit of flattening even a mountain and emptying even a sea, and thus make the rousing cheers for socialism, the WPK and single-minded unity heard in the sky in October.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the people of the DPRK are the best in the world as they believe in and invariably follow the WPK only, he ardently called on the officials to dedicate themselves to the work for the happy future of those people, always remembering their trust and expectation and take warmer care of them, true to the noble intention of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice-Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Ri Il Hwan, department director of the WPK Central Committee, and Jo Yong Won, vice department director of the WPK Central Committee."
