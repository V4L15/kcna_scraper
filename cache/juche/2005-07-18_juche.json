To this end, developing countries should develop south-south cooperative relations.

Not a few remarkable achievements were registered. Some developing countries have retained supremacy in ultra modern scientific and technological field. If developing countries strengthen cooperation and exchange in those fields while consolidating their achievements, they can make great progress by themselves, without calling for help from the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are desperately working in every way to hinder developing countries from advancing under the uplifted slogan of collective self-reliance but in vain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The position of developing countries is rising and their right to say and influence are increasing in the international arena and their collective efforts are promoting the socio-economic progress and development in the new century. This is exerting great influence on the trend of global independence in the new century as it displays the validity and vitality of south-south cooperation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
