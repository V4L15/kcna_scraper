Indeed, it is a blatant challenge and an open declaration of a war against the DPRK which has made every sincere effort for peace and peaceful reunification of the country because it is an unpardonable treacherous act to stamp out the ideology and system in the DPRK and introduce the corrupt system of colonial rule in south Korea even to the DPRK in league with foreign forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is keen to cover up this poor scenario of confrontation which betrays its criminal intention to do harm to the DPRK in collusion with foreign forces with the veil of the glossy watchwords of \"co-existence and co-prosperity\" in a bid to mislead the public opinion.

But Lee Myung Bak has rushed headlong into confrontation with fellow countrymen after adopting \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as his \"policy toward the north\" while sidestepping and negating the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing it. It was none other than the Lee Myung Bak group that defiled \"By our nation itself\" as \"chauvinist nationalism\" and debased the June 15 era in which the nation is advancing along the road of reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification as \"the lost decade\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the group behaved so foolishly against the nation and reunification as negating the above-said declarations and opposing their implementation, the DPRK made advices and served warnings sufficient enough to convince it. But the group defied them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Needless to say, such moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen have compelled the north side to take such crucial measure as it had already informed the south side. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppets have been hit hard at home and abroad for getting frantic with such confrontation, unaware of the DPRK's spirit that it does whatever, when determined to do. The above-said reckless remarks were made by them out of embarrassment. This, however, only brings to light their anti-reunification intention to push the inter-Korean relations to a more catastrophic phase. Every sin brings its punishment with it. The group would be well advised to drop its sinister plot to hide the blame for having brought the inter-Korean relations to a stalemate and mislead the public opinion, concludes the commentary."
