            "content": "Japan's Reckless Anti-DPRK Racket Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries' reckless moves to apply sanctions against the DPRK and put pressure on it only escalate their confrontation with the DPRK and drive the situation on the Korean peninsula to a grave phase. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of Japan diametrically run counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both sides committed themselves to observe international law and stop doing anything threatening the security of the other side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are getting evermore zealous in their moves to lay an international siege to the DPRK, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become more clamorous for economic sanctions at a time when the U.S. is set to stage five multinational exercises this year to lay an international siege to the DPRK. This is not just an accidental coincidence. Lurking behind the Japanese reactionaries' clamour for sanctions against the DPRK and pressure on it, is a sinister aim to fish in troubled waters, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy toward it. It is their true intention to escalate the hostile moves against the DPRK and bring down its socialist system in line with the U.S. imperialists' policy to tighten the economic sanctions against Pyongyang and increase pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified more than once that it would regard any sanctions and blockade against it as a declaration of a war and would take corresponding measures for self-defence. However, the Japanese reactionaries are openly seeking to escalate sanctions and pressure against the DPRK. This can not be construed otherwise than a revelation of their deliberate and premeditated provocation intended to push the DPRK-Japan relations of confrontation to an extreme pitch of tension and launch a new war on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that if a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula it will spill over into Japan close to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should bear in mind that they will meet inescapable consequences if they continue acting under the pulls and pressures of the U.S., their master, without any political principle and following its policy of sanctions and pressure against the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
