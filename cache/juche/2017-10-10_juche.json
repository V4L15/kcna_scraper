This is nothing but a criminal attempt to do harm to the fellow countrymen in the north by force of arms with the backing of their U.S. maser - the worst treachery to deteriorate the crisis of igniting nuclear war, quite indifferent to the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with brushwood on their backs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to bear in mind that its strategic assets deployed in the Korean peninsula are the primary targets of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All of the puppet forces running amuck with the back of their American master will die of by-blow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The escalation of the rotation deployment of the assets will be the suicidal option to accelerate their doom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces had better ponder over the miserable result of their reckless provocation."
