This call is made by a signed article of Rodong Sinmun Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity is what keeps the nation alive and serves as an engine propelling the cause of reunification, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Koreans, a homogeneous nation, the issue of unity is vital to the nation and indispensable for the national prosperity. Koreans should go united not only for their existence but for national prosperity and the demonstration of the might of the nation to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National unity is essentially required by the nature and characteristics of the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans were not split because of any contradictions and conflicting elements within the nation. The issue of Korea's reunification is not aimed to eliminate any contradictions within the nation or remove institutional antagonism but to rejoin the blood ties of the nation severed by the foreign forces and achieve national reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unbearable national misfortune and tragedy for the Koreans to have been forced to live separated in the north and south for over six decades due to the outside forces. All Koreans should go united in order to put an end to this tragedy of the national history at an early date. The reconciliation and unity of the entire nation precisely mean the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Outsiders and ultra-right conservatives of south Korea, their lackeys, have spoken ill of \"By our nation itself,\" the idea common to the nation, by hook or by crook, displeased with it. Lurking behind this is their sinister intention to deter the Koreans from achieving the national unity and foster antipathy and confrontation among fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should work harder to achieve the unity of the entire nation on the basis of the achievements made in the course of the struggle for unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
