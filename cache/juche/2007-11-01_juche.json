Irony is that Japan is busy painting itself as a victim, while shutting its eyes to its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's oft-repeated hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\" is aimed to shirk off its responsibility to redeem its past crimes come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that Japan's much touted \"abduction issue\" would only bring its despicable political and moral nature into bolder relief and invite thorough international isolation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

U.S. troops are said to be posted at the joint ground tactical control station, which is a mobile information processing system deployed in Japan, to perform the duty of watching the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the other hand, the U.S. agreed with Israel to jointly develop a multistage missile defense system to intercept \"long- and short-range missiles from Iran and Syria\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Minju Joson Wednesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is proof of the desperate efforts of the U.S. to grab a definite military strategic edge at strategic vantages by the means of reinforcing the military cooperation system with its \"allies.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks to guarantee its monopolistic domination at strategic vantages worldwide by keeping a tight military grip on its \"allies\" in Northeast Asia and Middle East where the thrust of big powers is noticeably intensified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n It is the strategic consideration of the U.S. that it could constantly ensure its military influence in the given areas, if it bound Japan and Israel to a \"military cooperation\" system dubbed missile defence system under the cloak of their \"security.\" This is the reason why the U.S. is kicking up quite a dust in establishing missile tracking devices in Japan and jointly developing a system for intercepting long- and short-range missiles with Israel under the pretext of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK, Iran and Syria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that there is no change in the real nature of the U.S. in seeking to dominate the world with strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy of military standoff and strategy for world supremacy will bring only catastrophic consequences to the U.S. itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
