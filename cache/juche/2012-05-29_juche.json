            "content": "FM Spokesman Blasts US Human Rights Report\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement on Tuesday denouncing the U.S. for malignantly slandering the DPRK and other independent countries opposed to its hegemony in the \"2011 human rights report\" on May 24:\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the inveterate bad habit of the U.S. to regard the human rights issue as a political tool for realizing its strategy for world domination. The U.S. considers any country kowtowing to it as \"guiltless\" but declares any country opposed to its domination \"guilty\" without verifying truth about human rights. This is the real picture of the trial of human rights issues repeated by the U.S. every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is always mentioned in this report as it is the state which the U.S. antagonizes more than any other country. The U.S. unchanged human rights racket against the DPRK is, in essence, a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK to isolate and stifle at any cost its socialist system chosen by the Korean people themselves and, at the same time, a hideous human rights abuse denying the choice by the people of a country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We bitterly condemn the despicable human rights report worked out by the U.S. styling itself the so-called \"law-governed state\" and \"an intelligence-gathering power\" on the basis of \"rumors\" concocted by a handful of traitors and criminals to earn living expenses after running away from their country and families.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that many countries of the world are scathingly denouncing the U.S. human rights report as the height of politicization of human rights and double standards and a dustbin of all distortions and fabrications. By nature, the U.S. has resorted to all military threats and nuclear blackmail against the DPRK in a bid to stifle it by force of arms for decades. But they compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons and bolster up its nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is raising \"human rights issue\" and \"issue of people's living\" these days. High-ranking officials of the U.S. are letting loose a spate of remarks in an attempt to create an impression that they are interested in the living of the people of the DPRK but it is the U.S. which has most persistently and desperately obstructed its efforts to develop economy and improve the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On April 15 the dear respected Kim Jong Un solemnly declared at home and abroad that it is the steadfast resolution of the Workers' Party of Korea not to let the Korean people tighten their belts again but make them fully enjoy wealth and happiness under socialism. The next day the U.S. took such criminal action as slapping economic sanctions against the DPRK again by taking issue with its satellite launch for peaceful purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the gangster-like logic of the U.S. that those countries which it antagonizes should not be allowed to increase defence capabilities and to this end they should be barred from having access to technology or materials for dual use even if they hinder peaceful economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is paying lip-service to the \"people's living\" while hindering the DPRK's economic development in actuality. This is part of the U.S. foolish psychological operation to make a crack in the single-minded unity of the DPRK and destabilize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has no moral qualification to raise a human rights issue or an issue of people's living to the DPRK as long as the U.S. sticks to its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brutally suppressed those toiling masses who staged Occupy the Wall Street demos and anti-war demos in protest against the capitalist system under which the rich gets richer and the poor poorer and the war policy of the authorities and massacred hundreds of thousands of innocent civilians in different parts of the world through aggression and interference. This world's worst human rights abuser the U.S. is behaving as if it were \"a human rights judge.\" This reminds one of a thief shouting \"Stop the thief!\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. continues vulgarizing the human rights issue as a political lever for achieving its selfish purpose as now, it will never be able to escape international isolation as shown by the widespread international criticism of this report."

            "content": "Japan's Claim to Tok Islets Termed Nonsensical\r\n Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) -- The Department of History of Kim Il Sung University Monday released a detailed report branding Japan's claim to Tok Islets as brigandish sophism devoid of any legal and historical propriety.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the report, historical data clearly proves that Tok Islets have been part of the inviolable territory of Korea from ancient times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Inhabitants of Koguryo and Silla positively advanced into Ullung Island and Tok Islets in the periods of not only ancient times but the Three States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, Koguryo expanded its territory even to Chongha region of Silla (Phohang City in Kyongsang Province) from late in the fifth century to early in the sixth century. This fact goes to prove that in that period people of Koguryo put Ullung Island and Tok Islets under their control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kobe (glass with high stem) used by the Koguryo people was discovered on Ullung Island recently. This is just an example clearly proving the above-said fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear from such fact that the then inhabitants of Usan State including Ullung Island and Tok Islets were people of Koguryo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's historical data dealing with the middle, modern and contemporary history say that Tok Islets belonged to Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets began to appear in Japan's historical data from the 17th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then Tok Islets had been recorded as part of the territory of Korea in almost historical data of Japan for nearly 300 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's historical data compiled in the 17th century contain the facts that Tsushima and the Tokugawa shogunate governments formally recognized before and after the An Ryong Bok case that the island and the islets were part of the inviolable territory of Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Different types of maps manufactured by Japan in the middle age describe the island and the islets as part of the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the \"Geographical History of the Three States\"                        clearly specifies in Japanese by the side of Ullung Island and Tok Islets that they are part of the territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ullung Island and Tok Islets are marked as part of the territory of Korea in a lot of maps produced by Japan in the modern age.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is noteworthy is that Japan marked Tok Islets as \"Song Islets\" (Matsushima) (meaning a lot of pine trees grow) till the 19th century but from the early 20th century it replaced the name of Tok Islets by \"Juk Islets\" (Takeshima) (meaning a lot of bamboo trees grow) under the influence of British who miswrote them instead of using the original name of Ullung Island.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fact alone clearly shows that the then Japanese had no elementary understanding of Tok Islets and they are not part of the territory of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ullung Island and Tok Islets are recorded as part of the territory of Korea even in Japan's historical data dealing with its modern geography.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  \"Encyclopedia of Japan\" published in Japan in 1960 refers to Tok Islets as follows: Japanese call Tok Islets Takeshima but Koreans call them Tok Islets and they are known to Europeans and Americans as Rocks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even according to the Japanese legal data, the \"ordinance No. 24 of the Prime Minister's Office\" promulgated on June 6, 1951, and the \"ordinance No. 4 of the Ministry of Finance\" promulgated on February 13 of the same year stipulated that Tok Islets never belonged to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's historical data for nearly 300 years patently prove that Tok Islets are part of the inviolable territory of Korea. They also term Japanese reactionaries' claim to Tok Islets absurd and brigandish sophism quite contrary to historical facts. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historical data of Europe and the U.S. also prove that Tok Islets belonged to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Data of Europe about Tok Islets include maps which Europeans drew after the mid-18th century during the voyage of the East Sea of Korea when they saw for themselves Tok Islets and Ullung Island, maps drawn on the basis of old ones after recognizing them, navigation charts and other sailing directions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the Russian navigation chart \"map of the East Sea of Korea\" marked Ullung Island and Tok Islets and put under it a drawing showing the shape of the islets, a clear indication that they belonged to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets as well as Ullung Island are marked as islands of Korea in the sailing directions \"Guide to voyage\" (1895, 1928) drawn by the navy of France, the sailing directions \"sailing directions of China\" (1858, 1861, 1864) and the \"Guide to Chinese coast voyage\" (1873, 1884, 1892) drawn by British people and \"Guides to voyage to Japan, Korea and their adjacent coastal waters\" also mark Tok Islets along with Ullung Island as islands of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were two confidential documents of the U.S. government which recognized Tok Islets as Korea's and they were declassified by the U.S. State Records Census Bureau in April 2005. One of them was the document which had been sent to the then south Korean \"prime minister\" by a brass hat of the U.S. troops in south Korea in June 1951 asking for use of Tok Islets as a drill ground of the U.S. air force. This means that the U.S. which occupied Japan when it was defeated recognized Tok Islets as part of Korean territory not Japanese and Japan was also aware of this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 1995, a map manufactory of the U.S. government produced the sailing direction \"Voyage guide to Korea and U.S.\" This marked Tok Islets and Ullung Island as Korea's with an explanation about Tok Islets and two drawings on the islets attached. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This shows that the U.S. has long recognized Korea's dominium over Tok Islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A map drawn in 1946 discovered in the U.S. also clearly marked Tok Islets as Korea's. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As shown by historical data, Tok Islets are part of the inalienable territory of Korea as it can never be a dispute in any case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world recognizes Korea's dominium over Tok Islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The participants of an international symposium on Tok Islets held in Washington in May 2009 unanimously said Korea's dominium over Tok Islets was beyond any doubt as there were historical materials proving that Tok Islets were part of the Korean territory in the period of the Three States and Japan-made maps (1700-1800) marked Tok Islets as part of Korea's territory. Nevertheless, Japan asserted \"dominium\" over Tok Islets in 1905 first and Japan's assertion is sophism devoid of any historical ground. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being hard facts, the Japanese reactionaries persistently talk about \"dominium\" over Tok Islets, which is ridiculous from the historical viewpoint and in the light of international law. Their ulterior intention is to make Tok Islets a target of dispute and pave the way for reinvasion of Korea under this pretext. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should not be allowed to touch even a stone on Tok Islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets will always stand as part of the inalienable territory of Korea."
