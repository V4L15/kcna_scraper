These actions brought to light once again his intention to pursue the anti-DPRK and anti-reunification confrontational policy, persistently refusing to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear that it is impossible to expect any Red Cross undertaking between the north and the south and any discussion on the humanitarian problem as long as the man serving the Lee group in its anti-DPRK confrontational  moves remains the boss of the Red Cross of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group will be held fully responsible for all the consequences to be caused by its action to the Red Cross undertakings between the north and the south in the future."

            "content": "Anniversary of October Resistance for Democracy Observed\r\n Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today dedicates a signed article to the 29th anniversary of the October resistance of youth and students and other people of south Korea for democracy. \n\t\t\t\t\t The resistance was an eruption of the pent-up grievance of the south Korean people against the ferocious \"Yusin\" dictatorial rule and a massive anti-imperialist, anti-fascist resistance for democracy for bringing about independent and democratic new politics and life, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resistance was triggered off by the anti-\"government\" demonstration staged by students of Pusan National University on October 16, 1979.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. imperialists who enforced a harsh colonial rule over south Korea after illegally occupying it and brought down the chieftain of the ill-famed \"Yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It taught a serious lesson that the south Korean people can win a decisive victory only when they put an end to the colonial rule of the U.S. imperialists and thoroughly eliminate the remnants of the pro-U.S. stooges by combining their struggle for democracy against dictatorship with the anti-U.S. struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' military presence in south Korea and the harsh treacherous rule of the south Korean conservative ruling forces and achieve independent reunification, peace and prosperity under the uplifted banner of national independence and unity in the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" This is the way of realizing the cherished desire of the participants in the October resistance for democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is working hard to reinforce its colonial ruling system and revive the era of fascist dictatorship in south Korea with the help of the Lee Myung Bak regime, while driving this clique of traitors to confrontation with compatriots. As proven by the reality, it is impossible to achieve independence, democracy and reunification, the desire of the fellow countrymen in the south, unless the U.S. domination and intervention are brought to an end. Independence against the U.S. is the only way out for the south Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Lee Myung Bak is a cancer-like being standing in the way of achieving independence, democracy and reunification as he is little different from the erstwhile fascist dictators who were severely  judged by the people for perpetrating acts of treachery, backed by foreign forces. The soul of the participants in the October resistance for democracy who did not yield to dictatorship and injustice is still alive and calls on the people from all walks of life in south Korea to a just patriotic struggle to put an end to the rule of the traitorous clique."

Who on earth would be ready to deal with an assailant? As long as such guy as Ryu remains the president of the Red Cross it is impossible for the separated families and relatives to have even a ray of hope that a reunion may take place in the future. Lee Myung Bak will be held fully accountable for this as he appointed that guy as president of the Red Cross.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee quite often talks about \"sincerity\", but nobody lends an ear to it.

Lee had better stop such folly worth a subject of caricature.
