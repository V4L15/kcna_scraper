The north and the south are obliged to properly control the hard-won phase of reconciliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans and history are watching whether the north-south agreement specified in the joint press release is implemented or not."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Denounced for Creating Complexity in North-South Relations\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Thursday as regards the fact that the south Korean chief executive during her foreign trip let loose such disturbing remarks as describing a series of incidents that occurred in the area along the Demilitarized Zone as the \"north's provocations\" and expressed \"thanks for the constructive role\" played by someone:\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans are feeling relieved as the serious crisis that could have led to an armed conflict between the north and the south was tided over and they are unanimous in their hope that the joint press release that was agreed at the north-south high-level urgent contact would be fulfilled with sincerity to create a new environment for improving the relations and achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Red Cross working contact is slated to take place for the reunions of separated families and relatives in coming September 7th under the north-south agreement and other preparations are also in the making for the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities are repeatedly uttering wild remarks chilling this atmosphere, thereby creating complexity in the north-south relations again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive who set on her foreign trip on Sept. 2 falsified the truth about the recent situation while talking about \"provocation by the north in the DMZ\" and asserting \"tension might escalate any moment\". She went the lengths of mentioning the \"constructive role\" played by someone, a seriously insult to the DPRK, and sophism devoid of elementary political awareness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As unanimously estimated by the public at home and abroad, the DPRK proposed the north-south high-level urgent contact on its own initiative from a transparent independent stand in reflection of the fundamental interests and the desire of the nation and provided a dramatic occasion of achieving peace on the Korean Peninsula and improving the north-south relations with sincere efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean chief executive, defying this stark reality, let loose ill words while making eyes at others during her foreign trip. This clearly proves that she pursues north-south confrontation in reliance on someone despite her lip-service to reconciliation and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ill-boding remarks being heard from her juniors are problematic but what is all the more serious are irresponsible remarks the chief executive is unhesitatingly making in breach of the spirit of the north-south agreement and the trend of the times. These are very serious development making it hard to judge issues high on agenda for repairing the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, one may say the north-south relations are like thin ice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the DPRK advised the south Korean authorities to keep and take good control of the north-south ties that were put on the track of reconciliation and detente with much effort and to specially guard against those forces displeased with the process to improve the ties with particular attention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean chief executive has an elementary political insight, she should be careful about her behavior and words that can turn the tide of the situation against will in such a sensitive time as now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should also clearly remember that the force promoting the improvement of the north-south ties and preserving peace on the peninsula are the Korean nation itself, not outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities persist in utterances seriously rattling the nerves of the dialogue partner while peddling the internal issue of the nation abroad, the north-south relations cannot but suffer from the repetition of the evil cycle of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whether the hard-won north-south agreement is substantially implemented to pave the path for improving the relations or not and whether the situation again reaches an extreme phase or not entirely depend on the attitude of the south Korean authorities."

            "content": "CRPP advierte a autoridades surcoreanas\r\nPyongyang, 3 de septiembre (ACNC) -- Durante su visita a ultramar, la mandataria surcoreana dijo irrazonablemente que el incidente ocurrido recientemente en la zona desmilitarizada fuera \"provocacion del Norte\" y que \"expresa agradecimiento al papel constructivo\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) respondio el dia 3 a la ACNC como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, todos los connacionales consideran como buena suerte lo que se controlo la crisis muy tirante en el umbral del  choque armado entre el Norte y el Sur y desean unanimemente que se ejecute sinceramente la informacion conjunta del contacto urgente de alto rango Norte-Sur y se prepare nuevo ambiente de la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el presente acuerdo Norte-Sur, se preve efectuarse el dia 7 de este mes el contacto practico de la cruz roja Norte-Sur para el encuentro de los familiares y parientes separados y se preparan los programas proximos para la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las autoridades surcoreanas siguen soltando en estos dias los disparates opuestos a este ambiente y crean de nuevo la complicacion en las relaciones intercoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, durante su gira a ultramar, la mandataria surcoreana tergiverso el dia 2 la verdad de la crisis creada hace poco soltando los disparates difamantes a su contraparte y carentes de elemental juicio politico de que \"el Norte provoco en la zona desmilitarizada y puede agravar la tension en cualquier tiempo\" y mencionando hasta el \"papel constructivo\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo todo el mundo estima unanimemente, nosotros presentamos, con la firme posicion independiente y con iniciativa, el contacto urgente de alto rango Norte-Sur al reflejar el interes fundamental y el anhelo de toda la nacion y con muchos esfuerzos sinceros, preparamos la oportunidad de cambio dramatico por la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, la mandataria surcoreana tergiversa tal hecho hasta en el ultramar lanzando con el alma negra tal o cual disparates y adulando a alguien, lo que muestra patentemente que de boca ella habla de la reconciliacion y cooperacion, pero de hecho persigue solo la confrontacion fratricida bajo el amparo de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs problematico que en el nivel inferior se lanzan los disparates erroneos y hasta la mandataria dice las palabras irresponsables opuestas al espiritu del acuerdo N-S y a la corriente de la epoca, lo que dificulta conjeturar siquiera los inmediatos programas de relaciones N-S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancamente dicho, las actuales relaciones intercoreanas son iguales a un hielo delgado que pudiera romperse en cualquier momento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, la RPDC aconsejo a las autoridades surcoreanas que mantengan y controlen bien las relaciones N-S dirigidas dificilmente a la reconciliacion y relajacion. Tambien subrayo la necesidad de mantener la vigilancia y prestar peculiar atencion a las fuerzas que no aplauden la mejora de  relaciones N-S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la mandataria surcoreana tiene la basica vision politica, tendra que hablar y actuar con prudencia para no destruir las relaciones intercoreanas en esta circunstancia tan aguda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla debe tener presente que la fuerza capaz de promover el mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas y defender la paz de la Peninsula Coreana, la tiene no la fuerza extranjera sino nuestra nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas siguen lanzando los disparates muy difamantes a su contraparte llevando al exterior los asuntos internos de la nacion, las relaciones intercoreanas volveran a caer en el circulo vicioso de  confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAbrirse el camino de la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas mediante la ejecucion sustancial del acuerdo N-S preparado a duras penas o llevarse otra vez a la extremidad la grave situacion depende enteramente de la postura de las autoridades surcoreanas."
