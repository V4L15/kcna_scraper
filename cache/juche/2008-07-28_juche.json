            "content": "National Meeting Held to Mark 55th Anniversary of Victory in War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture on Saturday to celebrate the 55th anniversary of the victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were senior officials of the party, the army and the state, the chairman of a friendly party, officials of the party, armed forces and power bodies, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media, persons of distinguished services in the war, servicemen's families, those who distinguished themselves in assisting the army, working people in Pyongyang, overseas compatriots and the chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there on invitation were diplomatic envoys of various countries, representatives of international organizations and members of the military attaches corps here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A report was delivered by Vice Marshal of the KPA Kim Il Chol, member of the DPRK National Defence Commission and minister of the People's Armed Forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n July 27, Juche 42 (1953) is shining as the day of the second liberation of the country in the annals of the sacred struggle of the Korean people for sovereignty, independence and socialism as they defeated the U.S. imperialist aggressors and defended the sovereignty of the country and the nation, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK inflicted a shameful defeat upon the imperialist aggressor forces including the U.S. imperialists in the Fatherland Liberation War. This was a shining victory of the revolutionary faith, prodigious grit, the Juche-oriented military idea and outstanding commanding art of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung developed and enriched the unique military theories and war methods which he put forward during the anti-Japanese armed struggle, as required by the modern warfare and in conformity with the specific conditions of the war. He thus defeated the enemies' numerical and technical superiority with the strategic and tactical superiority based on the political and ideological advantages, leading the hard-fought war to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the war the KPA firmly held the initiative in it, inflicting an irretrievable politico-military defeat upon the aggressors and winning signal successes in every battle that startled the world people. This was a clear proof of the Juche-oriented military idea and matchless wisdom, the might and invincibility of the outstanding commanding art of Kim Il Sung who frustrated the \"weapon all-mighty theory\" of the imperialists and set a genuine example in the anti-imperialist revolutionary war by skillfully applying the original military theories in every period of the war and at its each phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last Fatherland Liberation War, many peace-loving countries and progressive peoples of the world actively supported the army and people of the DPRK in their just war both materially and morally. The Chinese people sent volunteers to help them with blood. The Korean people always remember this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il has firmly preserved and successfully carried forward the undying exploits Kim Il Sung performed by winning the victory in the war. Kim Jong Il has pursued the Songun policy in all fields by most correctly reflecting the requirements of the times and the revolutionary development in the 1990s of the last century when the DPRK was undergoing manifold rigorous trials. This marked an event to be specially recorded in the history of the development of the Korean revolution and the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today our revolutionary armed forces are providing a sure military guarantee for the victory in the struggle to build a rich and powerful country and in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. standoff, having war deterrent powerful enough to deter any aggressor forces from daring attack them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all party members, the servicepersons of the KPA and other people to firmly preserve and uphold the exploits Kim Il Sung performed by winning the victory in the war and carry forward the cause of the President and thus glorify the present era of Songun as an era of fresh victory in the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. standoff and a new era of prosperity of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A grave situation is now prevailing in Korea due to the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their followers to start a new war, the reporter noted, and went on to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. conservative hardliners and south Korean warlike elements ignite a new war of aggression seeking confrontation in spite of our repeated warnings, the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize to the maximum the military potential built up generation after generation to deal at the aggressors blows a thousand times heavier than those done to them during the last Korean war and surely achieve the historic cause of national reunification and conclude the confrontation with the U.S. with a final victory of Songun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter also demanded the Japanese reactionaries properly understand the will of the DPRK and behave themselves, pondering over the disastrous consequences to be entailed by their hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He declared that no force on earth can block the revolutionary advance of the KPA and people under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il and their just cause is sure to triumph.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, the army strong in idea and faith, which has carried forward the ever-victorious traditions and the DPRK has greeted the great era of Songun in which it is dynamically pushing forward the revolution and construction by dint of the great unity between the army and people with the KPA as the core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will always emerge victorious, demonstrating its dignity as an invincible socialist power, thanks to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il and the revolutionary army and people who have grown strong in mental power, weathering out the stern tempest of the anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in an editorial notes that the DPRK is the precious gain of the revolution defended by the President with arms. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are struggling hand in hand to accomplish the common cause despite difficulties and trials.

It should face up to the trend of history and drop its anachronistic design to stifle the DPRK by force. Rodong Sinmun Sunday urges this in an article dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the Korean people's victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' numerical and technical superiority was shattered to smithereens in the war by the politico-ideological and strategic and tactical advantages of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean war was a barbarous war for aggression and hideous state-sponsored terrorism the U.S. perpetrated for the purpose of demonstrating its might and containing the socialist forces after emerging the boss of imperialists at the end of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists hurled into the Korean war armed forces huge enough to fight a world war only to suffer a defeat. Their superiority in terms of numerical strength and military technique proved futile before the tremendous mentality and indomitable will of the army and people of the DPRK who rose up as one with matchless resolution and will to wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces to the last man and defend the beloved homeland at any cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists suffered the defeat in the war because of their mental and moral corruption and vulgarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There still remain in the U.S. political circle the forces seeking to pursue strong-arm policy obsessed by strength-almighty doctrine. They wish to see a new war break out in Korea and are making desperate efforts to launch it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has boosted its capability for self-defence in every way to cope with the U.S. imperialists' frantic war moves to tide over a serious crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politico-ideological might of the DPRK has grown so remarkably that it can hardly be compared with what used to be in the last Korean war. No force on earth can match the army and people of the DPRK single-mindedly united around Supreme Commander of the KPA Kim Jong Il, the article concludes.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Whoever has the soul of the Korean should not turn away from the great national unity &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group's \"policy toward the north\" is a treacherous and anti-reunification policy aimed to block national reconciliation and unity, rejecting fellow countrymen and cooperating with outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traitorous nature of the Lee group rejecting national unity and cooperation and seeking cooperation with outsiders is brought into bolder relief by the daily escalated moves to knock into shape the \"triangular military alliance\" among the U.S., Japan and south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group's \"policy toward the north\" is fostering extreme distrust between the north and the south and destroying national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that it is impossible to promote the great national unity, much less advancing the cause of national reunification, as long as pro-U.S. stooge and fascist dictator who turned his back on the country and the nation is allowed to stay in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intolerable is the traitorous group's \"policy toward the north\" as it pushes the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe and blocks the national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will frustrate whatever desperate moves of traitors and hold aloft the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration whose validity and vitality have been fully proven through practice and thoroughly implement them in order to pave the wide avenue for independent reunification and peace and prosperity, concludes the article.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto devino la orgullosa victoria de la conviccion revolucionaria, el coraje incomparable, la autoctona idea militar y el destacado arte de mando del Presidente Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al desarrollar y enriquecer las originales teorias militares y metodos de combate creados en el periodo de la Lucha Armada Antijaponesa conforme a la demanda de las batallas modernas y las condiciones concretas de la guerra, el Presidente condujo a la victoria la severa Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria superando la supremacia numerica y tecnica de los enemigos con la ventaja estrategica y tactica basada en la superioridad politico-ideologica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Durante esa contienda belica, el EPC infligio irremediable derrota politico-militar a los agresores tomando con firmeza el control de la guerra y logro brillantes meritos en todos los combates que sorprendieron a todo el mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene una prueba contundente del poderio y el caracter invencible de la autoctona idea militar, la extraordinaria estrategia y el destacado arte de mando del Presidente quien quebro la \"teoria sobre la omnipotencia de las armas\" de los imperialistas y creo el verdadero ejemplo de la guerra revolucionaria antiimperialista aplicando diestramente los originales principios militares en cada periodo y cada etapa de la guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDurante la pasada Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria numerosos paises y los pueblos progresistas del mundo enviaron activamente su apoyo material y espiritual al ejercito y el pueblo de Corea, enfrascados en la justa guerra, y el pueblo chino  despacho a la guerra coreana el ejercito de voluntarios para ayudar con la sangre al pueblo coreano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No lo olvidamos siempre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   El Dirigente Kim Jong Il, quien defiende resueltamente y desarrolla con brillantez las inmortales hazanas de victoria del Presidente Kim Il Sung realizadas en la guerra materializo globalmente la politica de Songun (priorizacion militar) reflejando mas correctamente la demanda de la epoca y el desarrollo de la revolucion en la decada de 1990 cuando se acarreaban a nuestra patria multiples pruebas. Esto fue un evento especial que se registrara en el desarrollo de la revolucion coreana y en la historia de lucha antiimperialista y antiyanqui. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias, dispuestas de la poderosa capacidad de disuasion de guerra a que ninguna fuerza invasora se atreve a atentar, garantizan en lo militar la construccion de la rica patria y el triunfo en la confrontacion antiimperialista y antiyanqui &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los militantes del partido, los oficiales y soldados del EPC y otros habitantes deben defender con firmeza las hazanas de victoria del Presidente Kim Il Sung realizadas en la guerra, continuar la causa de el y hacer de la epoca del Songun de hoy   la de nueva victoria en la confrontacion antiimperialista y antiyanqui, y la nueva de prosperidad de la Republica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ahora en nuestro pais se crea la grave situacion debido a las maniobras de provocacion de una nueva guerra de los imperialistas yanquis y las fuerzas satelites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si las fuerzas ultraconservadoras de EE.UU. y los belicistas surcoreanos se entregan a la confrontacion y desatan una nueva guerra de agresion pese a las reiteradas advertencias de la RPDC, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea pondran en accion toda la potencialidad militar consolidada  a lo largo de anos y siglos y asestaran a los invasores demoledores golpes incomparables con la pasada guerra coreana, lograran sin falta la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria y haran balance general con la victoria final de Corea del Songun en la batalla de confrontacion antiyanqui. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tambien los reaccionarios japoneses deben justipreciar la voluntad de la RPDC, reflexionar de la catastrofica consecuencia que emane de su politica de hostilidad a Corea y actuar con prudencia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEn el mundo no hay tal fuerza capaz de obstaculizar el avance revolucionario del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea que disfrutan de la direccion del Songun del Dirigente Kim Jong Il y es definitiva la victoria de nuestra justa causa.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "ATCC demanda cambio del Acuerdo de Armisticio por el de paz\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 26 de julio (ATCC) -- Debido al sistema de armisticio que se establecio hace 55 anos en la Peninsula Coreana, la nacion coreana vive bajo la constante amenaza de guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A pesar de que la actual situacion de la Peninsula Coreana es extremadamente aguda, no hay ningun aparato juridico e institucional para garantizar la paz y la estabilidad de esta area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es que Estados Unidos desvirtuo las restricciones legales del Acuerdo de Armisticio que garantizaban en sentido juridico la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la decada de 1950, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y EE.UU. firmaron el referido acuerdo que establecio los compromisos legales de parar todos los actos hostiles y contribuir a la solucion pacifica del problema coreano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, debido a los descarados actos traidores del imperio, este acuerdo se convirtio en papel mojado y se crearon en la Peninsula Coreana la tension cada vez mas agravada y la coyuntura de guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. violo sistematicamente el acuerdo infringiendo flagrantemente su contenido y paralizando completamente las funciones de los aparatos de armisticio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la decada de 1950, declaro la anulacion unilateral de la clausula D del articulo 13 del Acuerdo de Armisticio e introdujo los armamentos modernos y mas de mil artefactos nucleares de todo tipo en el suelo surcoreano convirtiendolo en el gran arsenal, la base avanzada nuclear de mayor tamano en el Extremo Oriente y la cabeza de puente para la provocacion militar contra la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora, se estan dando los movimientos de EE.UU. para reducir sus fuerzas armadas en otros lugares del mundo, pero sucede lo contrario en la region de Asia y el Pacifico que abarca la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En las periferias de esta peninsula se emplazan concentradamente el portaaviones de propulsion nuclear y otras fuerzas armadas modernas de EE.UU. y frecuentan los ejercicios belicos liderados por este contra la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene una flagrante violacion a los articulos del Acuerdo de Armisticio que estipulo claramente no amenazar ni chantajear reciprocamente introduciendo las fuerzas armadas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Debido a cientos de miles de casos similares, el armisticio se mantiene a duras penas en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Bajo el actual sistema de armisticio, no se puede prevenir el estallido de conflicto armado o guerra catastrofica por alguna contingencia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para poner fin al estado de armisticio,  es preciso cambiar el Acuerdo de Armisticio por el de la paz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene la clave para eliminar el enfrentamiento militar y el peligro de la guerra y asegurar la paz y la seguridad en la Peninsula Coreana  y el resto de la region de Asia y el Pacifico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El problema de relajar la tension y eliminar el peligro de guerra en esta peninsula puede ser resuelto solo cuando EE.UU. abandone su politica hostil a la RPDC y concierte con esta el tratado de paz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como que EE.UU. es una parte signataria del Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, deviene realmente el sujeto que debe debatir la sustitucion del acuerdo en cuestion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, el ha venido negando o haciendo vista gorda de todas las justas y realistas propuestas de la RPDC para la paz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por tal actitud irresponsable, el Acuerdo de Armisticio se queda inutilmente hasta la fecha. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe ver correctamente la corriente de la historia y la tendencia del desarrollo de la situacion y tomar pronto la valiente decision de sustituir el Acuerdo de Armisticio con el de la paz.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
