However, they are now legalizing overseas aggression, throwing away the deceptive signboard of \"peace.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They seek to retrogressively revise the present constitution, which bans possession of combat armed forces, and the right of belligerency and right to military action, and thus drastically increase the combat capabilities of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" and conduct aggressive military actions in any areas outside Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the new \"guidelines\" and bills related to it, the Japanese reactionaries have expanded the sphere of Japan's \"right to security\" and military action into the Asia-Pacific region and legalized the \"SDF's\" overseas actions. \r\nThis is a prelude to their scenario on overseas aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan tries to repeat its past history in which it invaded Korea and other Asian countries and committed monstrous massacre and plunder.\r\n   The Asian people should heighten vigilance against the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggressive moves and check and frustrate them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Minju Joson says the Japanese reactionaries should stop such moves for overseas aggression at once, mindful that they will lead to their self-destruction. \r\n \r\n"
