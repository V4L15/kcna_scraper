            "content": "Japanese reactionaries' moves for overseas aggression\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- Newspapers here today carry commentaries denouncing the Japanese reactionaries' moves for overseas aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's ruling quarters have revealed their intention to retrogressively revise the existing constitution with \"bills on emergencies in areas surrounding Japan\" passed through the house of representatives as an occasion, so as to gratify the design of overseas aggression, Rodong Sinmun notes, and says:   The \"bills\" are aimed at guaranteeing by law the wartime system and participation in military action of Japan for implementing the aggressive \"Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ruling quarters of Japan have so far advocated \"peaceful nature\" and mission of the constitution, describing Japan as a \"peaceful state,\" and stated it would not conduct nor take part in any military actions.   However, they are now legalizing overseas aggression, throwing away the deceptive signboard of \"peace.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They seek to retrogressively revise the present constitution, which bans possession of combat armed forces, and the right of belligerency and right to military action, and thus drastically increase the combat capabilities of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" and conduct aggressive military actions in any areas outside Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the new \"guidelines\" and bills related to it, the Japanese reactionaries have expanded the sphere of Japan's \"right to security\" and military action into the Asia-Pacific region and legalized the \"SDF's\" overseas actions. \r\nThis is a prelude to their scenario on overseas aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan tries to repeat its past history in which it invaded Korea and other Asian countries and committed monstrous massacre and plunder.\r\n   The Asian people should heighten vigilance against the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggressive moves and check and frustrate them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Minju Joson says the Japanese reactionaries should stop such moves for overseas aggression at once, mindful that they will lead to their self-destruction. \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean authorities' arms buildup denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued an information bulletin on Saturday denouncing the U.S. and the South Korean authorities for getting more frantic in their arms buildup in South Korea under the pretext of the Yugoslav crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The bulletin said:    The U.S. war hawks urgently sent to South Korea 12 F-15E fighter bombers belonging to the third flying corps from Alaska and armed forces over 200 strong including pilots. In early last month, they put on alert mobile attack operation forces including a landing contingent of U.S. marines in Okinawa,  carrier constellation in its mainland, wings comprising F-15 and F-18 fighters and B-52 strategic bombers to cope with the emergency on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers staged a joint wartime reinforcement exercise in April. Some time ago, they decided to purchase planes of the latest type from France and are now putting spurs to increasing the combat readiness of army units.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The large-scale arms buildup of the U.S. and the South Korean rulers is intentional and premeditated moves to unleash a war in Korea any time in pursuance of their win-win strategy and \"5027 operation plan\", the second Korean war scenario.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.'s massive shipment of aggression forces in South Korea under the pretext of filling up a \"vacuum in combat forces on the Korean peninsula\"  is designed to  increase military tensions on the Korean peninsula through their potential threat and provocations against the DPRK and take this opportunity of making a preemptive attack on the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that the war now raging in the Balkans was provoked by the U.S. who are pushing ahead the \"5027 operation plan\" and win-win strategy, the bulletin points out:     It is not difficult to guess that this war will engulf even the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. unleash a war of aggression in defiance of our repeated warnings, our army and people will not miss this opportunity but wipe out all aggressors and achieve the historical cause of national reunification.\r\n   The South Korean rulers who  go berserk as bullet-shields for the U.S. will not escape from a forlorn wandering spirit in this just war, warns the bulletin. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
