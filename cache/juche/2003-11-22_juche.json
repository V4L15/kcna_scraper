If you join in the aggression on Iraq under the U.S. pressure, you will be sent to a more criminal war than it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal called for rousing the popular masses to the struggle against the troop dispatch, strongly demanding the withdrawal of the decision on the troop dispatch and vehemently denouncing the U.S. pressure for troop dispatch.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He said he cannot but ask a question in return who threatens whom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The serious crisis of war prevailing in the Korean peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward north Korea, he noted, asserting that for this reason north Korea had no choice but to prepare a nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. peace activist John Pepper said Bush's Korea policy was a one-sided hard line. The U.S. administration has pursued the hostile policy for the purpose of \"overthrowing the system\" or \"replacing the regime,\" indifferent to dialogue or negotiation with the DPRK, he said, stressing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To strive for the normalization of the DPRK-U.S. relations is what the U.S. citizens should do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the seminar the federations informed its participants of their activities for peace in the Korean peninsula in all parts of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
