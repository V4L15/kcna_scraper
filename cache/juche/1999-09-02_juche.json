            "content": "Special communique of KPA general staff \r\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 2 (KCNA) -- The general staff of the Korean People's Army today announced a special communique \"on proclamation of the Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The special communique reads: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unstable tense military situation persists on the Korean peninsula in which a war may break out any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This situation has been getting more grave since the June 15 exchange of fire at the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Right after the west sea armed conflict we took initiatives to call six rounds of DPRK-U.S. general officer-level meetings, in order to prevent recurrence of conflicts in the waters at issue and ease the tense situation, and made every possible effort to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Especially, we advanced a realistic proposal to define the Military Demarcation Line at the west sea through dialogues and contacts between the two responsible parties, grasping the stark situation in which the military conflicts at the west sea are mainly ascribable to the different assertions of the two warring sides as to the maritime demarcation line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, we proposed to the U.S. forces side the detailed procedures such as date and place of working-level contact, number of participants and form of the contact, and have made our sincere efforts to realize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We also expressed our generous intention to allow the participation of the South Korean puppets in the contact, in consideration of their desire to take part in the discussion of the matter, though they are not a signatory to the Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. forces side is interested in the relaxation of the military tension on the Korean peninsula even the least, it should respond to our proposal and our proposal on detailed procedures on the working-level contact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces side, however, shunned the discussion of the issue in contravention of the AA and turned down our proposal on the working-level contact, leaving it to the defunct north-south joint military commission. It has craftily worked to maintain the \"Northern Limit Line\" unilaterally fixed by it in our territorial waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    As known to the world, the \"Northern Limit Line\" is an illegal line drawn by the U.S. forces side unilaterally in our territorial waters in defiance of the Korean Armistice Agreement and the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its insistence on keeping the \"Northern Limit Line\" is as brigandish as drawing a line in other's courtyard by stealth and arguing that it is its own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accordingly, the U.S. forces side's insistence on keeping the \"Northern Limit Line\" constitutes a grave encroachment upon the sovereignty of our republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The behavior of the U.S. forces side to avoid the discussion of the matter shows that it gave up by itself its authority and duty under the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under situation where the U.S. forces side is insisting on keeping the illegal and brigandish \"Northern Limit Line,\" avoiding the discussion of the issue, although we intend to settle the issue of Military Demarcation Line at the west sea through negotiations, the KPA general staff solemnly declares in defence of inviolable waters under our military control as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   1. The Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea will be an extension line of the provincial boundary line (A-B) between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do stipulated in the Armistice Agreement. The line links the point (37 degrees 18 minutes 30 seconds N, 125 degrees 31 minutes 00 second E) equidistant from \"A\"  point and Tongsan point, the tip of Kangryong peninsula under the DPRK control, and from Kul-op Island under the U.S. military control = the point (37 degrees 1 minute 12 seconds N, 124 degrees 55 minutes 00 second E) equidistant from Ong Island under the DPRK control and from Sogyokryolbi Island and Sohyop Island under the U.S. military control = the point southeast of it (36 degrees 50 minutes 45 seconds N, 124 degrees 32 minutes 30 seconds E)= and the maritime demarcation line between the DPRK and China. The waters north of the line will be waters under the KPA side's military control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   2. We declare that the brigandish \"Northern Limit Line\" unilaterally defined by the U.S. forces side inside our territorial waters of the West Sea of Korea is invalid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  3. Our self-defensive right to the Military Demarcation Line at the West Sea of Korea will be exercised by various means and methods. \r\n\r\n\r\n090201 - Kim Yong Sun meets delegates of S.
