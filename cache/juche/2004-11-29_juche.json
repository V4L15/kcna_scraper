It charged that this is, in fact, little different from a bid to stamp out the trade union of public servants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organization declared that it would join regional joint measure committees in holding a rally for checking discipline against the trade union of public servants all at once in all areas and continue to wage the struggle for checking the presentation of a legislation bill on the trade union of public servants to the \"National Assembly\" and for withdrawal of the disciplinary measure.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 28 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the south Korean Ministry of Defense made public a \"cooperative self-reliant national defense plan\" for the ROK army to take over \"10-point military duty\" from the U.S. troops as regards the \"relocation\" of the U.S. troops in south Korea.\r\n Minju Joson Sunday in a signed commentary says that the south Korean authorities' talk about cooperation and self-reliance in the plan is no more than sophism to cover up their criminal acts of keeping standoff with fellow countrymen, pursuant to the U.S. policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"cooperative self-reliant national defense plan\" is a product of the south Korean authorities' policy of following the U.S. and keeping north-south confrontation, the news analyst says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' official announcement of the plan can never be overlooked as it is an anti-national, anti-peace and anti-reunification crime intended to play a shock brigade in materializing the U.S. policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the era of reunification following the June 15 joint declaration when the entire Korean nation is pooling its efforts to advance toward independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces are overtly talking about inter-Korean \"reconciliation and cooperation\" while covertly whetting the sword of aggression to stifle the DPRK militarily. Their moves for confrontation pursuant to the U.S. policy will only precipitate their destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they truly worry about the security of the nation and want self-reliant national defense, they should not join the U.S. in its war moves for invasion of the north, but take a decisive step to force the U.S. troops out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will carefully watch their action in the future.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Koreans will never achieve national reunification should they allow outside forces to interfere in their affairs, who persist in their desperate moves against reunification in a bid to perpetuate the division of the Korean nation. In order to achieve the reunification of the country its people should strongly oppose and reject outside forces' interference in the issue of reunification from the steadfast independent stand of the nation and realize national cooperation through their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of peaceful reunification calls for achieving the peaceful reunification of the country through dialogue and negotiations, reconciliation and cooperation without recourse to arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are differing ideologies and systems in the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, they do not create any conditions for using force of arms. National reunification can surely be achieved peacefully through dialogue and negotiations in spite of differing ideologies and systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAchieving reunification by federal formula is the best way for peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity calls on all Koreans to achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the country by their concerted efforts, united close under the banner of national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification is sure to come when the north and the south achieve unity and all Koreans at home and abroad get united. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve great national unity, the Koreans should place the common interests of the nation above anything else, transcending difference in the ideology and system, and unite on this basis. The Koreans who have ardent patriotism and desire for reunification are quite capable of achieving great national unity despite the differing ideologies and systems.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a clear proof of the unreasonable and criminal nature of the far-fetched method employed by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hard-line conservatives of the U.S. claimed that the underground structures in Nyongbyon area of the DPRK were underground nuclear facilities. This, however, could not convince those with the normal way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also asserted that there was something inside the DPRK underground structures only to pay a dear price for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have drawn a proper lesson from it and behaved itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, it is now busy with the false propaganda aimed to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and realize its ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A typical example is the U.S. much publicized story about the \"suspicious extraction of enriched uranium\" by the DPRK. The U.S. does not hide its intention to use the human rights issue, missile issue, the issue of reduction of conventional armed forces and the religious issue as pretexts for stifling the DPRK even after the settlement of the nuclear issue. This clearly proves how frantic the U.S. has become in its moves to provoke the second Korean war. The U.S. far-fetched assertions will get it nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop using the worn-out and threadbare brigandish far-fetched method.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It issued a stern warning to those reptile papers involved in this smear campaign, stating that such thing has never happened and will never happen in the future in the DPRK either as what they claimed is baseless and the story floated by them is just part of a psychological warfare launched by the U.S. and other forces hostile to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, even after the DPRK's clarification of the matter media in the U.S., Germany, Russia and other countries again cited this issue in spreading more misinformation in a bid to make the story sound plausible and true. They went the lengths of spreading sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has lashed the Korean army and people into great fury as it is a crucial issue related to the authority of the supreme headquarters of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to make it clear once again that the on-going smear campaign is part of the anti-DPRK psychological warfare waged by the U.S. and its allies in an effort to impair the high authority of the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and create the impression that the DPRK is fraught with a serious problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those hack writers are no more than slaves of power and money as they are so politically insensitive that they know nothing about the nature of the peculiar society in the DPRK and the ideological awareness and sentiment of its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il represents the destiny of the Korean people and that of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people have never thought of their present and future apart from him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their trust in their leader and respect for him have become immutable and absolute in practice throughout the course of the victorious and glorious advance of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their faith to entrust their destiny and future entirely to the leader and accomplish the cause of socialism has grown stronger with the passage of times. Herein lie the solidity and invincibility of the socio-political foundation of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as foolish an act as trying to cover the sun with a palm for the enemies to slander the headquarters of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The misinterpretation of this noble ideological awareness and sentiment of the Korean army and people is nothing but the most serious misunderstanding of the reality of our society the enemies have ever made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those hack writers who took the lead in the anti-DPRK trumpeting are well advised to stop at once their mean practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
