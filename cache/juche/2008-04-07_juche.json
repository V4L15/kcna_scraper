They include the matters of founding a unified state through the unity of the whole nation, achieving unity on the basis of patriotism and the spirit of national independence, promoting co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests, halting all political disputes that foment division and confrontation between fellow countrymen, attaining the trust and unity between the north and the south, and not rejecting each other because of differing isms but joining hands with each other to achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Dae, vice-president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, in a report delivered at the meeting said that the work serves as a patriotic programme for reunification as it reflected the noble intention of the President to defend the sovereignty and peace of the country and accomplish the cause of Korea's reunification, the greatest desire of the nation, by uniting all fellow countrymen under the banner of great national unity. It is the guidelines for the great unity of the whole nation that should be always held fast to, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter recalled that by putting forward the above-said programme the President enabled the Korean nation to wage a more dynamic struggle to achieve the independent reunification of the country with a clear aim and orientation, firm confidence and courage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that General Secretary Kim Jong Il formulated the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme and the proposal for founding a Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo as the three charters for national reunification and encouraged all Koreans in the struggle to materialize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accusing the present ruling authorities of south Korea of becoming evermore undisguised in sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with the DPRK, swimming against the trend of the era of independent reunification, he called on all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to firmly unite to frustrate the reckless moves of the anti-reunification forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the Songun politics of the WPK serves as a great patriotic banner and a treasured sword for defending the nation as it helps independently carve out the destiny of the country and the nation, the reporter underscored the need to positively support and uphold the politics. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Apology and Reparation for Past Crimes Urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 6 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the Foreign Relations Committee of the Philippine House of Representatives adopted a resolution on the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution strongly demanded that the Japanese government admit the crime related to the \"comfort women\", committed by the Imperial Japanese army during the Second World War, as a historical fact and make an official apology and bear responsibility for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun on Sunday says in a signed article: This proves that those seeking to repeat the crime-woven history while turning their back on the people are bound to face the thrice-cursed denunciation of the people and isolation anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Loud voices demanding the repentance and responsibility from the Japanese government for the above-said crime can be heard now on international arenas, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity and reactionary nature of the crime lie in that it was committed to mercilessly violate the dignity and rights of human being and ethics and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are resorting to all sorts of tricks in a bid to bury the crime into oblivion of history at any cost, far from admitting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind Japan's negation and distortion of its crime-woven past is its sinister intention to justify and repeat its history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists scheme to invade Korea and then occupy other Asian countries as they did in the past when they staged the war for aggression on the continent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Japanese reactionaries are provoking a territorial dispute, insisting that the Tok Islet of Korea belongs to Japan. It is a link of their moves to ignite a war for the reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will be treated as a sworn enemy and an object to be overthrown by the Korean people as long as Japan seeks to stage comeback to Korea, refusing to repent of its past crimes of aggression. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its calculation was to contain the Islamic countries and put the Mideast region under its complete control by seizing Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. assertion that Iraq has \"weapons of mass destruction,\" which it cited as the main reason for starting the war of aggression against Iraq, proved to be a sheer lie. It was nothing but a pretext for provoking the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war has not brought any democracy, stability and prosperity to that country but thrown it into an uncontrollable mayhem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces who seek their pleasure in man-hunting are indiscriminately arresting, torturing and killing innocent civilians as a revenge for the casualties they suffered in face of the Iraqi resistance forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive \"war on terrorism\" has inflicted not only serious political, economic and military wounds but bloodshed upon the U.S., too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been neither aggressor nor criminal who allowed himself to be trussed up. The international community should force the U.S. imperialists, the war criminals, to stand trial by history and mete out a severe punishment to it. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n"
