It is a great achievement that constructors have built the factory meeting the need of the new century in a short span of time, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A rapid increase in the number of vehicles requires the increased production of different kinds of tyres, he said, underscoring the need to boost the production of tyres of diverse sizes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Noting that an effective use of the existing production capacity would make it possible to increase the manufacture of tyres, he called on the factory to wage a vigorous drive to operate in full capacity so as to keep the production going at a high rate and, at the same time, raise the quality of products, while paying attention to the maintenance of equipment and technical management. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Praising the workers of the factory for keeping its inside and outside neat and tidy, he said that the working class in the DPRK should take the lead also in introducing the culture created by soldiers in the Songun era.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Meanwhile, it is ceaselessly staging large-scale war exercises in different parts of the world, increasing the danger of war.\r\n Commenting on such moves, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Cold War the United States has pushed ahead with the reorganization and relocation of the U.S. military forces mainly to establish its domination over the Asia-Pacific region, massively deploying modern military equipment in the region. And it has ceaselessly conducted all-round military exercises aimed at preemptive attack, intentionally rendering the situation strained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RIMPAC-2006, the joint military exercises now under way in the waters of the Pacific, is also a naval offensive operation, pursuant to the U.S. strategy for domination over the Asia-Pacific region, and an escalation of the U.S. aggressive moves for a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is more frantically increasing the military spending and intensifying the arms buildup and war provocations under the deceptive pretext of \"preventing terrorism\" and \"guaranteeing peace\", bringing the situation to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the new century military expenditure is drastically increasing worldwide and new arms race being accelerated due to the U.S. imperialists' reckless war moves for aggression and their ambition for domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States does not want peace at all, but only seeks to oppress other countries and dominate the world by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing the U.S. imperialists can cover up their criminal nature as a chieftain of aggression and war and an enemy of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop at once such reckless moves of seriously threatening and destroying the world peace and stability and accelerating new arms race.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Even after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the U.S. imperialists frantically staged provocative nuclear war exercises against the DPRK, steadily modifying and supplementing their war scenarios against the DPRK from \"OPLAN 5027\" to \"CONPLAN\", \"OPLAN 5030\", \"New OPLAN 5026\", \"OPLAN 5027-04\", \"OPLAN 5029\" and \"OPLAN 8022-02.\" The DPRK-targeted nuclear war exercises staged with the mobilization of aggressor troops every year have further grown in their scale than those held in the period when the inter-Korean confrontation was acute. This fact alone clearly reveals the anti-Korean reunification nature of the U.S. imperialists. Precisely for this reason the peace on the Korean Peninsula has been exposed to a constant threat and a brake has been put on the inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation for the last six years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should more bravely turn out in the struggle for independence against the U.S., well aware that without the struggle against the U.S. imperialists, a main obstacle to the advance of the era of June 15 reunification, it is impossible to defend sovereignty and the right to existence nor is it possible to achieve national reunification.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan eagerly begged the U.S. for its support to the former's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council but it was snubbed by Washington. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the truth of the U.S.-Japan alliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to bear in mind that to toe the U.S. line and flunkeyism towards it would only lead it to self-destruction.
