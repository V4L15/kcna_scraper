            "content": "Unity of grass-roots movement called for in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Delegates of grass-roots movement organizations in South Korea reportedly had round-table talks at the meeting hall of the (South) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions (KCTU) on December 28 last year to review the grass-roots movement in 2002. Among the organizations were the South Korean People's Solidarity, the South Korean Alliance for Democracy and Reunification, the South Korean Federation of Peasants Associations, the KCTU and the Democratic Workers' Party.\r\n At the talks they said that the main trend of the struggle in 2002 was an anti-war, peace struggle staged in protest against Bush's statement about \"axis of evil\" made at the beginning of last year and his tour of South Korea and then an anti-U.S. struggle launched over the GI killing of the two South Korean schoolgirls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such mass anti-U.S. struggle of South Koreans took place mainly because their will for national unity has increased since the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration and their anti-Americanism ran higher than ever before, they stated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also referred to the fierce struggle waged by workers, peasants, civil servants and other people for their vital rights and to the desire for reunification that grew stronger with the August 15 Grand Meeting for National Reunification and the 14th Asian Games as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They expressed the resolution to develop the anti-U.S. campaign on a higher stage and continue the vigorous movement for the abrogation of the Security Law and the evil Labour Law and against \"globalization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing the need to strengthen solidarity among grass-roots movement organizations and lay an organizational basis for progressive political forces to this end, they called for achieving victory in 2003, too, with the organizational unity of the grass-roots movement.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA urges U.S. to drop its anachronistic policy toward DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces should clearly know that their strategy to dominate Korea is a pipe-dream, stop the provocative and military pressure and withdraw their aggression forces from South Korea without delay, urged the Joint New Year Editorial published by newspapers  Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi on the occasion of the New Year, 2003.\r\n Last year they listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and as a target of their nuclear attack instead of giving up their anachronistic policy toward it, while openly calling for a \"preemptive attack\" in a desperate bid to increase their military pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Korean people have resolutely smashed the aggressive offensive of the enemies with a revolutionary principle and reliably defended the dignity and honor of the DPRK by further augmenting the might of the single-hearted unity under the banner of the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that last year the Korean people made a new leaping advance in building a powerful nation despite difficulties and consolidated the revolutionary base of socialism though the international situation remained complicated and the country was beset with manifold ordeals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. bellicose forces, turning aside such reality, have worked hard to put international pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\". This clearly indicates to the world how desperate they have become in their moves to dominate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some circles of the U.S. seem to calculate that they can achieve their criminal purpose of the strategy to dominate Korea by increasing the pressure upon the DPRK, while talking about the \"tailored containment strategy\" under the pretext of its non-existent \"nuclear issue\". Nothing is more foolish and reckless than this calculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is persistently making futile efforts to isolate and stifle the DPRK, whiling away time, instead of accepting the latter's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. this, however, will only precipitate its self-destruction. \r\n Already half a century ago the army and people of the DPRK won a brilliant victory over the U.S. and its allies in the great fatherland liberation war. And this year marks the 50th anniversary of this victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is much stronger than what it was 50 years back and the single-hearted unity of the party, the army and people based on the idea of giving top priority to the army will remain unbreakable with the passage of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised not to forget the lesson drawn from the history of the DPRK-U.S. relations and the present reality but to give up its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately withdraw its aggression troops from South Korea.  \r\n\r\n"

And it should officially declare nonaggression on the DPRK and express its willingness to conclude a relevant treaty with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should also have constructive and equal dialogue in a patient and unremitting way, instead of confrontation, and take into consideration that the \"nuclear suspicion\" raised between the DPRK and the U.S. cannot assume international character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. intentionally aggravates the political situation and resorts to such a trick in a bid to bring the DPRK to its knees, force its will on this country and deprive this country of a legitimate right to defend its security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Like the U.S. and any other states, the DPRK has a legal right to get its security guaranteed and defend itself, the article said, adding: its army-based policy makes it possible to increase the defensive power of the country and defend it from any possible military aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people led by Kim Jong Il will attain their historic purpose for defence of the country, thus proving the justice of great history in practice, the article said.    \r\n"

We have the right to intercept and take whatever action we believe appropriate in the circumstances.\"\r\n These outbursts clearly indicate what an alarming phase the Bush administration's illegal and inhuman hostile policy toward the DPRK and its unilateralism have reached as they are little short of a declaration that it would commit more piratical acts against DPRK trading cargo ships in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Toward the end of last year the U.S. mobilized huge forces to stop, search and seize in broad daylight DPRK trading cargo ship Sosan on its routine voyage in the open sea, evoking worldwide criticism and scoff at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that the DPRK is developing and producing missiles to protect itself from constant military threat posed by the U.S. and exporting them for a commercial purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK has never concealed this fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If its production and export of missiles are as dangerous as proliferating weapons of mass destruction as claimed by the U.S., it is the U.S. which is totally to blame for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. tops the world's list in producing and selling the weapons of mass destruction and it is raking up biggest profits in arms sale. Such being a stark fact, the U.S. committed piracy against the DPRK ship with missile parts and building materials on board which were to be delivered to a foreign country under a legal trading contract made with that country. Far from making an apology and compensation for the piracy the U.S. is calling for intercepting and searching DPRK ships. This is a height of impudence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that such piracy is being committed as part of the U.S. tailored containment strategy against the DPRK. \r\n The strategy means total economic sanctions aimed at isolating and stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sanctions mean a war and the war knows no mercy. The U.S. should opt for dialogue with the DPRK, not for war, clearly aware that it will have to pay a very high price for such reckless acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should apologize and compensate for its piracy against the ship as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
