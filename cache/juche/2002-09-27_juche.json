He said the DPRK-Japan summit talks would be an important occasion to ease the tensions on the Korean Peninsula and ensure the stability of the region. \r\n Meanwhile, Denmark, the chair-country of the EU, on Sept. 19 welcomed the DPRK-Japan summit talks, saying reconciliation and normalization between the two countries are what not only their peoples but the international community hope for.    \r\n   \r\n"

If the mid-east issue is to be settled comprehensively and fairly, Israel should unconditionally withdraw from all its occupied Arab territories.    \r\n\r\n"

Their death cannot but be great sorrow to bereaved families and the DPRK government is known to have done its best to alleviate their grief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what matters here is that the Japanese side's excessive row over this issue may lead the situation to that beyond control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are bereaved families of several million young and middle-aged Koreans whose whereabouts are not yet known though over half a century has passed since they were forcibly taken to Japan in the past and those of hundreds of thousands of Korean women who had their chastity violated after being forced into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. They are now undergoing unbearable sorrow and pain. \r\n This horror story of history is not comparable to the issue of several Japanese. arguing over the two issues, standing in confrontation, carried away by emotion, would entail unpredictable consequences.    \r\n\r\n"
