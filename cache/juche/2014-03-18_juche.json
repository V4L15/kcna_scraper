They also quoted a Chinese woman nurse as saying that a medical officer of the Japanese Ground Force visited a station in Manchuria every Friday for a regular medical check-up and the station housed 150 women, including 130 Koreans, and all of them were suffering from venereal disease.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The documents go to prove that the Imperial Japanese Army was directly and systematically involved in the sexual slavery, considering the abducted women to be munitions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the sexual slavery by the Japanese imperialists was an extra-large inhumane crime committed with the Japanese government and military involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, the 1993 Kono's statement, prompted by the sense of guilt, admitted the crime. The United States, the master of Japan, too, imposed a ban on entry into the U.S. territory against 16 Japanese war criminals related to the sexual slavery in December 1996, and the ban has taken effective still now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the right-wing forces of Japan still deny the existence of the sexual slavery system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, the present Japanese government has called for re-examination or verification of Kono's statement, arguing that \"comfort women issue is faked-up one\" and \"government's direct involvement should not be admitted\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The argument is tantamount to intolerable challenge to and mockery of the international community pressing Japan to make apology and reparation for the crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' denial of the sexual slavery reveals their attempt to flee from responsibilities for the crimes and represents their revanchist ambition for re-invasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan, seized with wild dream, persists in its move to justify the past crimes despite of the warning of the international community, the consequences would be really miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The persistence will only bring bigger shame to Japan than what it suffered at a UN Human Rights Council session in Geneva."

Una  enfermera china declaro que un medico militar de las fuerzas terrestres japonesas realizaba cada viernes el chequeo medico en las instalaciones de esclavitud sexual en Manchuria. Anadio que por culpa de los satiros japoneses, todas 150 mujeres retenidas alli, inclusive 130 coreanas, cogieron enfermedades venereas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos documentos testimonian que en el pasado, las tropas japonesas administraban directa y sistematicamente a las mujeres secuestradas considerandolas como materiales de logistica y obligandoles una vida sexual asquerosa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi el caso de esclavitud sexual deviene archicrimen antietico cometido organizada y forzosamente bajo la participacion del gobierno y el circulo militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa declaracion de Kono de 1993 lo reconocio aceptando la opinion publica internacional y sintiendo la culpabilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor este hecho historico ineludible e inocultable, hasta EE.UU., amo de Japon, prohibio en diciembre de 1996 entrar en su pais a 16 criminales japoneses de guerra involucrados en dicho crimen y mantiene esta medida hasta la fecha.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, las fuerzas derechistas japonesas siguen negando la existencia del regimen de esclavitud sexual.    \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, bajo el actual gobierno insisten en revisar la declaracion de Kono y verificar el caso diciendo que el \"problema de consoladoras sexuales es un hecho inventado\" y \"no se debe reconocer la intervencion directa del gobierno\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo esto constituye un desafio y burla intolerables a la sociedad internacional que  lo condena y urge a Japon pedir disculpas e indemnizar por el respecto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa negativa de los reaccionarios japoneses es  una expresion coherente de su ambicion de liberarse de la responsabilidad de los crimenes del pasado y lanzar la reagresion revanchista para repetir a toda costa tales actos horribles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon suena con lo irrealizable. Si sigue tratando de justificar sus crimenes del pasado desoyendo la advertencia de la sociedad internacional, ese pais tendra consecuencias catastroficas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, pasara la verguenza mucho mas grande que la sufrida en la reunion del Consejo de DDHH de la ONU sesionada en Ginebra."
