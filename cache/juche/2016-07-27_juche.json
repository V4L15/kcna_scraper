However, no one has regarded her group as partner for \"diplomatic cooperation\" but as colonial lackeys of the U.S. and a herd of rabid dogs desperate in biting the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the Park group of traitors and sycophants without an iota of national self-esteem has suffered shame and humiliation while going here and there like a hungry dog to hurt the compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea, which turned into a complete colony of the U.S. due to the Park group's treacherous policy of depending on outsiders, is reminiscent of Korea dating back to late 19th century to early 20th century when the country was ruined as a theatre of the scramble among big powers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going diplomatic crisis facing the group is an inevitable lot of those who have prolonged their remaining days by treachery and reliance on outsiders without any correct political philosophy and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is bound to meet final ruin for its acts of treachery."

            "content": "RPDC se esforzara mucho por defender paz mundial, ratifica canciller Ri Yong Ho\r\nPyongyang, 27 de julio (ACNC) -- El gobierno de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea eliminara de raiz el peligro de guerra nuclear, que impone EE.UU., apoyandose en el poderoso disuasivo nuclear y desplegara con dinamismo la lucha por defender la paz de la region y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi dijo el canciller Ri Yong Ho, jefe de la delegacion de la RPDC, en su discurso pronunciado en la reunion ministerial del Foro Regional de la Asociacion de Naciones del Sudeste Asiatico (ASEAN).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al cada vez mas sustancial peligro de choque en la Peninsula Coreana, se pone muy tensa la situacion general del Nordeste Asiatico, dijo Ri y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el VII Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, efectuado en mayo pasado, el Presidente Kim Jong Un presento la estrategia quinquenal para el desarrollo de economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa meta de esta estrategia consiste en preparar la base de desarrollo economico sostenido y mejorar decisivamente la vida del pueblo mediante la reactivacion de la economia nacional en su conjunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presento tambien en ese conclave la autoctona linea de lograr la reunificacion de la patria con el modo federativo bajo la bandera de independencia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo tarea inmediata y remedio para implementarla, se propuso para el Norte y el Sur de Corea aliviar el estado de confrontacion militar y resolver todos los problemas a traves del dialogo y negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC procedio al cumplimiento de la estrategia quinquenal y realiza nuevos esfuerzos por mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas mediante el dialogo y negociaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la situacion toma la corriente diferente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe incrementa sin precedentes la amenaza militar contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe introducen sin cesar en la Peninsula Coreana los bombarderos y submarinos nucleares, el THAAD y otras propiedades estrategicas de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl intento de EE.UU. de aplicar la hostil sancion economica anti-RPDC constituye otro factor de la tensa situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl tomar la decision estrategica de que a la ilimitada amenaza nuclear de EE.UU., hay que responder obligadamente con el disuasivo nuclear, ya nos pusimos dispuestos a las sanciones de todo tipo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la Carta de la ONU, el Consejo de Seguridad puede tratar las circunstancias correspondientes solo cuando se rompan la paz y seguridad internacionales o exista tal amenaza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ningun articulo de la ley internacional ni en la Carta de la ONU existe la definicion de que la prueba de armas nucleares y otras o el lanzamiento de satelite artificial constituyen amenaza para la paz y seguridad internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el Consejo de Seguridad definio a sus caprichos como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" solo en cuanto a la prueba nuclear y lanzamiento de satelite de la RPDC y aprobo la \"resolucion\" de prohibicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con esto, la RPDC solicito oficialmente al Secretariado de la ONU la aclaracion de la legalidad de la \"resolucion de sancion\", pero el segundo no puede explicarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi un pais es digno miembro de la ONU, juzgaria con sensatez prestando atencion a la falta o no de la imparcialidad y moralidad del Consejo de Seguridad en la \"resolucion de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. no hubiera hostilizado a la RPDC, la Peninsula Coreana no se habria convertido en la zona candente del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente Kim Jong Un subrayo en el VII Congreso del PTC que EE.UU. debe anular su anacronica politica hostil anti-RPDC, cambiar el acuerdo de armisticio por el convenio de paz y retirar del Sur de Corea sus tropas agresoras y equipos belicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY aclaro que el gobierno de la RPDC mejorara y normalizara las relaciones con los paises que respeten nuestra soberania y nos traten de manera amistosa aunque eran hostiles en el pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. marcha en la direccion opuesta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, cometio el peor acto hostil de ofender la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC cuestionando el inexistente \"problema de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa la declaracion de guerra que niega la coexistencia con la RPDC, Estado soberano, y cerrar totalmente las puertas de dialogo con esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo hemos previsto tambien y nos hemos preparado tanto para el dialogo como la confrontacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos dispuestos a mostrar que no podra estar a salvo si un pais grande intenta acosar y perjudicar a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. pagara un precio horrible."

            "content": "ACNC comenta la diplomacia vergonzosa de autoridades surcoreanas\r\nPyongyang, 27 de julio (ACNC) -- Ignorantes de su miserable situacion, los compinches de Park Geun-hye andan pregonando por doquier del mundo la llamada \"diplomacia en la cueva de tigre\" que causa la burla y criticas dentro y fuera del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todo el mundo, la region del Nordeste Asiatico es la muy delicada donde se enredan los intereses de las potencias principales del mundo. Debido a la cada dia mas renida disputa por la hegemonia entre las potencias, la region acapara la atencion de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, a causa de la reciente decision de emplazamiento de THAAD que entrego el suelo surcoreano como base avanzada nuclear para la realizacion de la estrategia de EE.UU. de dominar Asia-Pacifico, se aumento mas el peligro de nueva guerra fria en la Peninsula Coreana y la region del Nordeste Asiatico y se agudizan la guerra psicologica y la discrepancia entre EE.UU. y los paises perifericos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeten la nariz en esa disputa los compinches de Park hablando de la \"diplomacia en la cueva de tigre\" sobre los \"Estados intimos del Norte (de Corea)\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPoniendo carteles baratos a sus irrealizables politicas diplomaticas como \"proyecto de construccion de nueva Eurasia\", \"iniciativa de paz del Nordeste Asiatico\" y \"diplomacia en la cueva de tigre\", los titeres surcoreanos trataron de hacer creer que ellos cumplen algun papel en la region donde se agudizan las disputas por la hegemonia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual mandataria y otras autoridades surcoreanas se movilizaron todas en la \"diplomacia de presion al Norte\" en contubernio con las fuerzas ajenas calificando de \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" las medidas de la RPDC de fortalecer su poderio militar con disuasivo nuclear como eje.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImpotentes de alcanzar su objetivo criminal mediante la \"sancion\" anti-RPDC que desarrollaban con EE.UU. y otros \"aliados\", se entregaron a la \"diplomacia de presion para atraer a los paises amigos y simpatizantes con el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl intervenir hace poco en la reunion cumbre Asia-Europa, Park mendigo el apoyo a su politica conflictiva anti-RPDC chismeando que \"hay que inducir el cambio correcto del Norte\" y \"esforzarse por la ejecucion de medidas de sancion y la cooperacion en cuanto al problema nuclear del Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de tomar el poder, la traidora Park Geun-hye realizo en mas de 20 ocasiones el viaje al extranjero practicando la diplomacia de colaboracion anti-RPDC y pronunciando en escenarios internacionales las palabras enganosas como \"acompanante estrategico\" y \"cooperacion internacional\". Pero nadie considera a la horda traidora de Park como \"colaboradora diplomatica\" sino grupo de lacayos coloniales de EE.UU. y maniacos de enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs merecido que Park, psicopata que no tiene ni la minima conciencia nacional, haya sufrido la verguenza en sus giras extranjeras para danar a la parte connacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Sur de Corea se ha convertido en la colonia completa de EE.UU. debido a la diplomacia vendepatria y de dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras de los titeres surcoreanos y ahora esta sujetado a las potencias perifericas, lo cual hace recordar el periodo a finales del siglo 19 - a principios del siglo 20 cuando Corea se arruinaba por la pugna de potencias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual crisis exterior de los titeres surcoreanos es el destino inevitable de los que mantienen la vida con el servilismo a grandes potencias y la dependencia de las fuerzas extranjeras sin tener su propia filosofia politica ni la postura independiente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park Geun-hye sera condenada al arruinamiento definitivo por sus actos vendepatrias."
