            "content": "U.S. Warmongers' Scheme for Preemptive Attack Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces present in south Korea recently blustered that it is needed to streamline the procedure for the deployment of reinforcements from the U.S. mainland in the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. In the meantime the U.S. Department of State called for tightened strategic alliance in the 21st century in a vice-minister-level \"dialogue on strategy\" with the south Korean puppets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on such behavior, Rodong Sinmun today brands it as an intentional provocation of the U.S. imperialists aimed at preemptive attack on the DPRK and permanent presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is clamoring about the peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on Korean Peninsula so as to create the impression that it is \"interested\" in it, the news analyst of the daily says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. schemes to rapidly dispatch huge reinforcements of its forces to the Korean front from its mainland in the \"event of contingency\" on Korean Peninsula. This clearly shows once again that the U.S. call for \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\" or \"talks\" is a trick to deceive the public opinions at home and abroad and that the U.S. is persistently seeking only preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preemptive attack on the DPRK just means a war. The U.S. war-thirsty forces' recent clamor for streamlining of the deployment procedure for its reinforcements is little short of the dangerous signal flare fired to round off the preparations for provoking the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. scheme for preemptive attack on the DPRK is a betrayal of totally overturning the September 19 joint statement, in which both sides committed themselves to mutual respect and peaceful coexistence, and it is a reckless anti-peace deed of bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces present in south Korea serve as the foremost military means supporting the realization of the U.S. strategy for aggression on the DPRK and Asia by force. That is why the U.S. warmongers are seeking the permanent presence of their forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality has proven the validity of the measure taken by the DPRK to bolster its self-defensive capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has the right to choose military action for its self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. opts for preemptive attack on the DPRK arrogantly, this will create irrevocably serious situation and the former would be entirely held responsible for its consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces would be well advised to clearly know who their opponent is and abandon their reckless scheme for preemptive attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In token of apology and reparation to Libya Italy returned marble statue \"Venus of Cyrene,\" a cultural treasure it looted from Libya in 1913. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attitude is inconceivably mean when it is compared with the trend towards settling past wrongs that prevails in the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, like Germany and Italy, is a war criminal state which provoked World War II, bringing immeasurable misfortune and pain to the Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, in particular, committed hideous crimes against humanity by imposing unprecedentedly huge human and materials losses to the Korean people, while keeping Korea under its occupation for more than four decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, Japan caused so tremendous losses to the Korean people that all its wealth is not enough to adequately compensate for them and it has to kneel down before them hundreds of times to ask for forgiveness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, Japan is adding to its crimes perpetrated against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries neither admit their past crimes nor make any apology for them but are justifying the acts of aggression perpetrated by Japan against Korea and other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is the fact that the Japanese reactionaries are stepping up their hostile policy toward the DPRK, picking up unessential issues concerning the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations in a bid to evade their responsibility to make apology and reparation for the crimes at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better behave itself, bearing in mind that it will have future only when it redresses its past crimes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 24 (KCNA) -- South Korea is the worst tundra of human rights in the world as the political freedom, democracy and right to existence are most savagely trampled down there. Such serious human rights abuses in south Korea should never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday urges this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea has the poorest human rights record because of the U.S. military presence and colonial domination over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has enforced a colonial enslavement policy for more than six decades, keeping south Korea under its military occupation in disregard of the will and wishes of the Korean nation. The U.S. imperialists' presence and domination deprived the south Korean regime of any political independence and have seriously infringed upon the sovereign rights and interests of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socio-political foundation in south Korea itself is not aimed at guaranteeing the sovereign rights of the people. This bars the south Korean people from becoming true masters of the political life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Constitution\" in south Korea stipulates that the people shall be guaranteed \"freedom\" and \"rights\" but this is sheer hypocrisy in actuality.  Freedom of the people's political life is ruthlessly violated on the strength of the fascist law in south Korea. To cite an example, the \"National Security Law\" is an unprecedented fascist law which savagely violates the people's freedom of ideological activities and rights to socio-political activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The rights to assembly and demonstration are the political rights which people are entitled to enjoy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Lee Myung Bak group in south Korea are mercilessly trampling upon such rights of the people. The right to existence is the most elementary right of a human being. The south Korean people are, however, denied even this right. The number of jobless people is on the steady increase due to the unpopular economic policy of the group of traitors in south Korea and, consequently, the life of the working people is getting harder as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can enjoy the genuine political freedom and rights only when the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are forced out of south Korea and independence and democracy is achieved in the south Korean society.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
