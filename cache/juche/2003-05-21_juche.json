The nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula should be settled through dialogue and negotiations on the principle of equality and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., though it clamours for a diplomatic solution to the nuclear issue, actually opts for destroying the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not take the new bold proposal advanced by the DPRK at the recent Beijing talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue for an expression of weakness. The U.S. should drop its wrong viewpoint that it may bring the DPRK to its knees only by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A war will be unavoidable in the Korean Peninsula if the U.S. keeps nuclear pressure on the DPRK and military threat and blackmail to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula is settled or not depends on whether the U.S. takes a bold decision to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK or not. The outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S. including the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula will be settled if the U.S. gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK and takes an honest stand toward dialogue, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n"

It is speeding up the advance for the building of a great prosperous power and the independent and peaceful reunification with the Songun policy as a weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is making much ado about the threat from the DPRK. It is a deliberate move of those displeased with the reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation to block the reunification process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy makes it possible for the DPRK to emerge victorious in any confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our reunification movement can make a vigorous advance only when all Koreans resolutely stand up against the U.S. imperialists' moves against reunification under the uplifted banner of the Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea is a strong spirit of offensive as it calls for staunchly fighting to protect one's dignity and self-esteem in any case and it is based on the revolutionary stand that one should be ready to die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK is bound to go bankrupt and the peace of the Korean Peninsula and the security of the nation will surely be guaranteed as long as the great Songun policy is enforced.    \r\n\r\n"

He also cried out for increasing the defence capacity of Japan allegedly to cope with the DPRK's \"nuclear weapons program\" and the development of long-range missiles.\r\n His recent outbursts are part of Japan's anti-DPRK smear campaign intended to fan up the anti-DPRK sentiment now growing in the Japanese society, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishiba's talk about the DPRK's non-existent \"threat of terrorism\" and \"threat and blackmail\" is a link in the whole chain of premeditated and deliberate moves on the part of the Japanese ultra-right reactionaries to attack the DPRK and reduce the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration to a dead document so as to evade its commitment to redeem its past and keep the bilateral relations from warming up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His outbursts are just the echo of the assertions made by the U.S. pursuing the policy of stifling the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unchanged ambition of the Japanese reactionaries to join the U.S. in its moves for a war of aggression in a bid to step up the conversion of Japan into a military power aimed at realizing overseas expansion and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarist fanatics' attempt to provoke the DPRK with such nonsense is as foolish an act as inviting misfortune. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe army and the people of the DPRK are fully determined to force Japan to pay for its crimes in the past a thousand times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOnce an opportunity presents itself they will not miss the chance but vent their pent-up grudge against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to ponder over their suicidal act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
