The speed of Pyongyang, the speed of Vinalon and other world-startling speeds of advance were created one after another with the flow of the history of great Chollima upsurge which began in the 1950s.\r\n   When all the people redouble their efforts and create the speed of forced march, the history of great Chollima upsurge will continue and our country will shine as a \"country of Chollima.\"\r\n   The present forced march for final victory is a fierce decisive battle with the enemy.\r\n   It is high time we advanced dynamically, doing in a day what would take a hundred days.\r\n   Only when we create a new Chollima speed, forced march speed can we rapidly vitalize the economy of the country and consolidate our political, military and economic fortresses like an impregnable fortress. When the speed of forced march is created, we can frustrate the anti-socialist moves of the enemy.\r\n   We should extensively create the speed of forced march in all  fields and units.   Only then can socialism will definitely win and our country will become an impregnable fortress which any enemy  dare not violate.    \r\n\r\n"
