This is a clear proof of the vitality of the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is a great country that is triumphing thanks to the idea and politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these realities of Korea have been possible because he has wisely led the Korean revolution with his peculiar army-centred revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A seminar on the subject of \"Comrade Kim Jong Il, The Distinguished Elder Statesman\" was also held by the youth group for the study of the Juche idea in Democratic Congo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers highly praised his leadership feats.    \r\n\r\n"

But it is nothing but a gimmick to mislead the world public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's projected formation of more flotillas of ships fitted with new type missiles is not for national defense and public security but for surprise military attacks on other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the Japanese reactionaries cover up their true intention to make an effective use of those flotillas with great striking power and high maneuverability in carrying out a war of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that this development is timed to coincide with their moves to work out a new \"great arms build-up program\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the adoption of the \"program\" they seek to revise article 3 of the \"Law on the Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) in a bid to stipulate its participation in \"U.N. Peace-Keeping Operations\" as its main duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would enable the \"SDF\" to conduct any military operation overseas any moment going beyond the limited sphere of national defense and public security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an open secret that the Japanese reactionaries intend to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK before any other countries this is evidenced once again by the fact that the existing flotillas and flotillas to be newly created have or will have their bases in coastal areas facing the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not difficult to guess what dangerous consequences will be entailed by their plan to strike the Korean peninsula where huge armed forces are standing in confrontation.    \r\n\r\n"
