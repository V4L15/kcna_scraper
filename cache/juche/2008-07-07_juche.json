It also serves as an all-powerful treasured sword for winning victory in all fields of revolution and construction despite any grave situation and ordeal. This is the important idea that runs through the work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The publication of the work helped the servicepersons and people of the DPRK enshrine the firm faith that Songun is a science and undisputed truth and serves as an invincible socialist banner and provided them with effective ideological and theoretical guidelines for giving full play to the invincible vitality of the Songun politics, the Songun revolutionary line of the Workers' Party of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to Kim Jong Il's Songun politics the political and ideological might of our revolutionary ranks has grown exceptionally stronger and our country came to demonstrate its might as an invincible socialist military power which no formidable enemy can provoke and the country could greet the year of historical turn in the building of a rich and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on all party members and other working people to cherish deep in their minds the firm faith that the Songun revolution steered by Kim Jong Il always leads to victory and prosperity and fully embody the ideas and theories clarified in the work and thus make a positive contribution to giving full play to the advantages and might of Korean-style socialism. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is impossible to achieve and uphold the sovereignty of the country and the nation without a material guarantee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Economic independence makes it possible for each country and nation to independently shape line and policies in conformity with their actual conditions and implement them by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when a country builds an independent national economy and achieves economic self-reliance can it develop relations with other countries on the principle of independence and equality and mutual respect and benefit and settle all issues related to international relations according to its own judgement and faith. It is possible to fully ensure the authority and political independence as a sovereign independent state only when they are materially guaranteed by economic self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In order to achieve economic self-reliance it is necessary to adhere to the principle of self-reliance, train native cadres and scientific and technological intellectuals, develop science and technology and boost economic and technological cooperation with those countries desirous of economic independence and the developing countries and strengthen south-south cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle of the developing countries to protect their sovereignty and achieve economic self-reliance is gaining in scope and strength as the days go by and many successes have been made in this respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls on these countries to achieve economic self-reliance on the basis of the achievements already made and carry on their strenuous struggle to promote independent development and social progress.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have displayed their tremendous vitality in the practice of the Korean revolution for their scientific accuracy and truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the theories, strategies and tactics of the Juche-based revolution are finding a more striking manifestation in this complicated world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said traditions serve as an encyclopedic treasure as they contain the richest practical experience and exploits performed in the revolution and construction in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President's invincible experience and exploits serve as a powerful treasured sword for successfully solving any difficult and complicated issues arising in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the precious gains provided by the President including the invincible revolutionary party, matchless armed forces, the single-minded unity and the best socialist system centering on the popular masses serve as examples of the times to be admired by all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said experience and exploits comprehensively clarify realistic issues for urgent solution of which is required by the era and the revolution and reflect the immutable law governing the revolution.

This is no more than rhetoric intended to deny the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the Lee group's confrontational watchwords of \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" are concerned, they are no more than a product of the deliberate and premeditated smear campaign to stoke mistrust and hostility between the north and the south and push the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even before taking over the \"power\" following the puppet presidential elections, the group of traitors laid down what they called \"four principles to govern the work with the north.\" They stipulated in the principles that they would not push forward the working talks and cooperation projects upon which agreements had already been reached between the preceding \"government\" and the north, before their \"pragmatic value and propriety\" are discussed with the \"committee for the transfer of the presidential office\" in advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was exactly for this reason that a series of working contacts including the first meeting of the north-south panel committee for cooperation on railways and the first meeting of the north-south panel committee for cooperation on roads ended without any fruit although they were held in Kaesong late in January and in mid-February. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the Feb. 25 \"presidential inauguration\" as a momentum the Lee group officially adopted \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" as its \"policy toward the north,\" dropping a check-bar on the inter-Korean relations in all fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group's moves to break off relations with the north have resulted in scuttling more than 20 north-south dialogue including the second north-south premier talks and the second meeting of the north-south vice-premier-level joint committee on economic cooperation slated to take place within the first half of this year and cooperation projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that they suspended all north-south cooperation projects agreed upon between the authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group made it impossible to carry out an agreement to dispatch a north-south cheering group to Beijing Olympics by north-south railways, to say nothing of the reconstruction and repair of roads and railways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon coming to power, the group unilaterally suspended the cooperation in shipbuilding, disregarding the favor shown by the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the issue of setting up \"a special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea\", the group prevented south Korean businessmen from conducting even a field survey, a challenge to the north's sincere efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stood even in the way of implementing the agreement on \"passage, communications and customs clearance\" reached between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They put a brake on the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone, openly asserting that it is difficult to expand the project unless the \"nuclear issue\" is settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After taking office traitor Lee recklessly found fault with the \"nuclear issue\" and openly disclosed its stance for confrontation with the north, blustering that \"there should be a switchover in the attitude toward the north\" and \"he would not follow in the footsteps of the preceding government\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group is persecuting those organizations and people of different social standings aspiring after alliance with the north and reunification including the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration after branding them as \"leftist forces\" in a bid to incite confrontation with fellow countrymen. A wholesale purge and suppression of them are now going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group has become evermore frantic in invoking the fascist law, claiming \"it is premature to abolish the 'National Security Law'\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 25 this group staged the largest-ever anti-DPRK charade in south Korea and abroad and instigated ultra-right conservative organizations to kick up an extremely malignant confrontational racket against the DPRK there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee clique has acted quite contrary to the agreement reached between the north and the south in which they agreed to put an end to the military relations of hostility and closely cooperate with each other to ensure detente and peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North-targeted war exercises have become more frequent than ever before and arms buildup has been further stepped up since the emergence of the Lee regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the Lee group is made up of worst traitors bringing misfortune and tragedy to the nation and it is a cancer-like entity hindering the north-south relations and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation can never pardon the above-said traitorous and anti-reunification acts of the Lee group but will keep strict tabs on them.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
