He also supported and encouraged the just cause of the world oppressed people including the Arab people both materially and morally. That is why he always lives in the hearts of humankind as the sun of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Syrian people who regard the Day of the Sun as their holiday extend warmest congratulations to the fraternal Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the friends of the DPRK around the world deeply respect Kim Jong Il, the great leader of the Korean people, as the sun of the 21st century as he has courageously led the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation with the might of Songun despite the vicious attack and threat of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on the international community to positively support and encourage the Korean people in their struggle to reunify the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Logic of Evil Flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- Heavyweights of the U.S. administration came out to justify their assertion that north Korea must scrap its nuclear program first and their logic of an \"axis of evil\".\r\nIn a nutshell, their assertions mean that all their demands are right and whatever the DPRK does is wrong and, therefore, there can never be any compromise or reward to the DPRK. Their assertions are little short of forcing the DPRK to completely dismantle its nuclear program first and remain calm barehanded. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing it as a trick of American empire style reminding one of the nature and temperament peculiar to a wolf and fox, the news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the theory of the \"axis of evil\" set out by Bush is concerned, it is sheer nonsense as it made profound confusing of justice and injustice and good and evil. However, the U.S. ruling quarters took pains to defend this. This can not but be a challenge to history, an insult to justice, truth and conscience and a vicious provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same holds true for their brigandish demand that the DPRK dismantle its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Consistent is the DPRK's principled stand on the nuclear issue and it is quite just. The formula of \"action for action\" and \"reward in return for freeze\" proposed by the DPRK is the most effective and best way for the settlement of the nuclear issue. The DPRK exerted flexible and sincere efforts for the solution of the nuclear issue on the basis of this formula at the recent six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is set to maintain this formula in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. are on an equal footing as far as the settlement of the nuclear issue is concerned. The DPRK is not obliged to move first and the U.S. has no right to demand the former do so. In the light of the root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and the background against which it surfaced and the responsibility for solving the issue, it is the U.S. which should move first as it is chiefly accountable for it. However, it is demanding the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, shifting the blame onto it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an American style bullying peculiar to the U.S. styling itself the world's super power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly understand the principled stand of the DPRK and stop insisting on its brigandish demand based on its contradictory and unrealistic assertion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. Congress has already approved the spending of 15 million dollars to intensify the research into nukes capable of deeply penetrating into underground facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the Bush administration lifted the more than decade-old ban on the research into nukes and has pushed forward its moves to develop smaller nukes as evidenced by the organization of teams for ultra-modern warheads tasked to develop new type nuclear warheads and improved version of warheads at three nuclear research groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of developing nuclear weapons which fully reflects its ambition for world supremacy is a wanton violation and a challenge to the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves for the development of nuclear weapons to monopolize nuclear weapons and increase nuclear capacity have been escalated since the emergence of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report on the nuclear posture submitted by the U.S. Department of Defense in January 2002 said the U.S. should have a tactical and \"flexible\" nuclear capacity to cope with any unforeseen incident and stressed the need to develop smaller nukes aimed to destroy underground facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is stepping up its arms race and moves to make nuclear weapons ultra-modern and conventional, fully disclosing its true colors as the largest nuclear criminal in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is made the main target of the present U.S. nuclear strategy. The U.S. is working hard to put pressure on the DPRK with nukes and mount a preemptive strike at its major underground military facilities, economic objects, organs, enterprises, etc. with smaller nukes anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These undisguised moves of the U.S. for the development of nuclear weapons compel the DPRK to channel greater efforts into increasing its defence capacity to cope with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. escalated nuclear threat and blackmail would only prompt the DPRK to bolster its deferent force.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
