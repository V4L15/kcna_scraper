In the training a joint operation of the naval and air forces was carried out along with an anti-ship, anti-air and anti-ground live-firing drill.\r\n   The training, which took place at the time of \"change of regime\" in South Korea, indicates that the warmaniacs are still seeking confrontation and increased tension.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

He also said \"north Korea's surprise attack\" is the first target of vigilance.\r\n   Their outcries over \"north Korea's surprise attack\" revealed their intention to start another war on the Korean Peninsula under its pretext, Rodong Sinmun says, and continues:\r\n   With the united states trying to attack the DPRK with military force, we can never sit with folded arms.\r\n   We do not reject dialogue and negotiations. But we cannot allow them to be used as means of testing and stifling us.\r\n   If the U.S. warhawks attempt to play a military gamble behind the scene of talks, we will cope with it with greater strength.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
