He promulgated various \"proclamations\" and evil laws to legalize the establishment of his military dictatorial system and to preserve and round it off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He reinforced such repressive bodies as the CIA, covered the whole of south Korea with a dense network of police forces and agents and cooked up a series of spyring cases including the case of the People's Revolutionary Party and the case of the National Democratic Youths and Students League by perpetrating murderous tortures and conspiracy. He brutally suppressed the patriotic parties and public organizations aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification and mercilessly killed pro-reunification and pro-democracy personages and people from all walks of life, creating a terror-ridden atmosphere throughout south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the progressive UPP was disbanded by the conservative remnants of \"yusin\" this time, one can hardly tell who will be their next target.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But history is fair.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The miserable end of the ferocious \"yusin\" dictator taught a serious lesson. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group, finding itself in the worst ruling crisis, is making desperate efforts to escalate confrontation with compatriots in the north.
