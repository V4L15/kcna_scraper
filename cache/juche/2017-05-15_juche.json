            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Test-Fire of New Rocket\r\n Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- A test-fire of new ground-to-ground medium long-range strategic ballistic rocket Hwasong-12 was successfully carried out on Sunday by scientists and technicians in the field of rocket research, who are bravely advancing toward a new goal to be proud of in the world, true to the far-sighted idea of Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea, chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, for building a nuclear power.\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un guided the test-fire on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking at Hwasong-12, he expressed his satisfaction over the possession of another \"Juche weapon\", a perfect weapon system congruous with the military strategic and tactical idea of the WPK and the demand of the present times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire was conducted at the highest angle in consideration of the security of neighboring countries. The test-fire aimed at verifying the tactical and technological specifications of the newly-developed ballistic rocket capable of carrying a large-size heavy nuclear warhead. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the order of Kim Jong Un, the new rocket Hwasong-12 was launched at 04:58 on Sunday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rocket accurately hit the targeted open waters 787km away after flying to the maximum altitude of 2,111.5km along its planned flight orbit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire proved to the full all the technical specifications of the rocket, which was newly designed in a Korean-style by defence scientists and technicians, like guidance and stabilization systems, structural system and pressurization, inspection and launching systems and reconfirmed the reliability of new rocket engine under the practical flight circumstances. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also verified the homing feature of the warhead under the worst re-entry situation and accurate performance of detonation system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un hugged officials in the field of rocket research, saying that they worked hard to achieve a great thing. And he had a picture taken with officials, scientists and technicians who took part in the test-fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Highly appreciating again their devotion for manufacturing the Korean-style medium long-range strategic ballistic rocket, he gave a special thanks to them on behalf of himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said with confidence that the successful test-fire of Hwasong-12, a demonstration of high-level defence science and technology of the DPRK, is of great and special significance for securing peace and stability in the Korean peninsula and the region and is the greatest victory of the Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He declared that the DPRK is a nuclear power worthy of the name whether some one recognizes it or not. He stressed the DPRK will keep strict control over those engaging themselves in nuclear blackmail with its nuclear deterrence which has been unimaginably and rapidly developed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. massively brought nuclear strategic assets to the vicinity of the Korean peninsula to threaten and blackmail the DPRK, but the coward American-style fanfaronade militarily browbeating only weak countries and nations which have no nukes can never work on the DPRK and is highly ridiculous, he said, stressing that if the U.S. dares opt for a military provocation against the DPRK, we are ready to counter it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most perfect weapon systems in the world will never become the eternal exclusive property of the U.S., he said, expressing the belief that the day when the DPRK uses the similar retaliatory means will come. He continued that on this occasion, the U.S. had better see clearly whether the ballistic rockets of the DPRK pose actual threat to it or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. awkwardly attempts to provoke the DPRK, it will not escape from the biggest disaster in the history, he said, strongly warning the U.S. should not to disregard or misjudge the reality that its mainland and Pacific operation region are in the DPRK's sighting range for strike and that it has all powerful means for retaliatory strike. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave the scientists and technicians in the field of rocket research the order to continuously develop more precise and diversified nukes and nuclear striking means, not content with the successes, and make preparations for more tests till the U.S. and its vassal forces make a proper choice with reason."

            "content": "U.S. Is to Blame for Consequences of Anti-DPRK Sanctions: Chief of Law Institute\r\n Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- The chief of the Law Institute of the DPRK Institute of International Studies released a statement on Monday over the fact that the Trump administration of the U.S. seeks to slap new sanctions on the DPRK, pursuant to its policy called \"maximum pressure and engagement\".\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 4, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a new anti-DPRK Sanctions Act, the keynote of which is to ratchet up sanctions on the DPRK to the maximum and impose sanctions on the foreign businesses, organizations and individuals that have business deals with it and employ its workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. is seeking unprecedented sanctions, pressure and diplomatic blockade against the DPRK by pressurizing and blackmailing other countries and their businesses and individuals not to have normal diplomatic and economic and trade relations with the DPRK under the \"sanctions resolution\" of the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement denounces this as an unethical crime violating all the principles of international law including the UN Charter as it seeks the most vicious aim of deteriorating the economy of the DPRK and the people's living under the pretext of \"nuclear non-proliferation\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such sanctions have not just begun today. It is a wanton violation of international law and an impudent mockery of the international community that the U.S. is persisting in the moves to justify sanctions against a sovereign state by its domestic law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more serious is that the U.S. seeks to realize its world hegemonic ambition under the pretext of such sanctions, the statement points out, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries under naval threats and pressure from the U.S. to break ties with the DPRK and stop their economic and trade activities with it are largely at strategic rivalry with the U.S. or located at vantage points of geopolitical importance. Most of them have already been exposed to various forms of sanctions by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts go to prove that the Trump administration is seeking to kill three birds with one stone: The U.S. scheme is to stifle the DPRK, a stumbling block in implementing its strategy for world hegemony, by citing the DPRK's exercise of independent rights as \"threat\" and \"provocation\" to global peace and security and to tame the countries disobedient to it and put the strategic bases under its control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the passage of the illegal Anti-DPRK Sanctions Act shows that such elementary principles and institutional mechanisms on international relations as respect for sovereignty, non-interference and peaceful settlement of a dispute have almost disappeared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation evidently proves that the U.S. has already gone beyond the pale in arrogance and shamelessness to gratify its hegemonic ambition and that it is impossible to expect any peace and stability in the earth when such rude action is allowed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To remain vigilant against the U.S. sanctions and pressure on the DPRK and struggle against them is the way for defending the sovereignty of each country and ensuring global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should not test the DPRK's perseverance any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence and preemptive strike capability are aimed at the U.S. trying to antagonize, isolate and stifle it. Accordingly, they can never be any political or economic bargaining chip and they will never be abandoned though the U.S. ratchets up the sanctions and pressure to the utmost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Trump administration truly want to adopt a new policy towards the DPRK, drawing a lesson from the preceding administration's failure, it should go for change of the Armistice Agreement between the DPRK and U.S. into a peace accord and total removal of the hostile relations so as to help ensure lasting peace of the Korean peninsula and furthermore global peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it persists in anti-DPRK sanctions without understanding its rival, the administration will have to take full responsibility for the ensuing catastrophic consequences."

            "content": "War Moves of S. Korean Group of Traitors under Fire\r\n Pyongyang, May 15 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday in a commentary discloses that the south Korean puppet warmongers, taken aback by the DPRK's racially increased military muscle, are getting hell-bent on the introduction and development of various types of weapons and military equipment, pursuant to the U.S. scheme for \"special operation\" and \"preemptive strike on the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Such moves are nothing but last-ditch effort to make up for their military inferiority and get rid of the abyss of ruin, seized with extreme horror and uneasiness in face of the tremendous might of the DPRK which emerged a nuclear power in the East and the world's military power, the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korean puppet forces tout much about \"nuclear and missile threat from the north\". It is preposterous and shameless sophism aimed to justify their reckless aggression scheme and ignite a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of traitors is a hideous enemy of the nation who should be no longer allowed to survive as it is only keen on the nuclear war moves against the north, in conspiracy with foreign forces, challenging the desire and aspiration of all the fellow countrymen for peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has the will and capability to cope with any war and operation chosen by the U.S. and is fully ready for any mode of attack from the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet warmongers should be mindful that they will face a miserable destruction, though they zealously act a shock brigade for realizing the U.S. scheme for \"special operation\" and \"preemptive strike on the north\" while introducing lethal weapons and war equipment."

Ademas se reafirmo en las condiciones de navegacion real la confiabilidad del motor de cohete nuevamente desarrollado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, en un riguroso ambiente de reirrupcion del proyectil se comprobaron la caracteristica de la induccion final teledirigida de la cabeza de combate y la exactitud de la operacion del sistema de explosion de la ojiva nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Maximo Dirigente abrazo a los funcionarios de la rama de investigacion elogiando sus esfuerzos y se fotografio junto con los funcionarios, cientificos y tecnicos participantes en la prueba. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEvaluo reiteradamente a los fabricadores del cohete balistico estrategico de mediano y largo alcance a nuestro estilo y les dio el agradecimiento especial en su propio nombre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl gran exito del lanzamiento de prueba de Hwasong-12, que demuestra la talla de las ciencias y tecnicas de industria de defensa nacional de nuestro pais, tiene gran y especial significacion en la preservacion de la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y la region y resulta una gran victoria del pueblo coreano incomparable con nada, dijo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIndudablemente nuestro estado es una digna potencia nuclear, declaro y enfatizo que respondera al chantaje nuclear de los enemigos con el disuasivo nuclear desarrollado con una velocidad inimaginablemente rapida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque EE.UU. nos amenaza y chantajea hablando tanto de la llamada presion e introduciendo en los alrededores de la Peninsula Coreana los pertrechos estrategicos nucleares, no podra salir con la suya en nuestro pais, destaco e ironizo la fanfarronada cobarde de estilo norteamericano que viola de manera militar a los paises sin armas nucleares y las naciones debiles. Advirtio a EE.UU. diciendo que la RPDC esta totalmente lista para la atrevida provocacion militar de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl sistema de armas mas perfeccionado en el mundo no seria el objetivo monopolizado de EE.UU. y vendra sin falta el dia en que podremos utilizar los correspondientes medios de represalia, destaco y anadio que en aquella ocasion EE.UU. vera con sus propios ojos si los misiles balisticos de la RPDC amenazan o no a su pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no podra evitar la calamidad nunca probada si se atreva a atentar a la RPDC, ratifico y envio fuerte advertencia a EE.UU. que no deba despreciar ni malentender la realidad de que su propio territorio y la zona operacional de Pacifico estan en alcance de golpe de la RPDC y que esta cuenta con todos los poderosos medios de represalia implacable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstimulando a los cientificos y tecnicos de la rama, el Maximo Dirigente les dio la orden de fabricar mucho mas las armas nucleares de alta precision y diversificadas y los medios de ataque nuclear y acelerar los preparativos de ensayo necesarios hasta cuando EE.UU. y las fuerzas seguidoras vuelvan en si y seleccionen una opcion correcta."
