This is related to the Japanese authorities' approval of the controversial history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We demand once again that the Japanese authorities stop at once the anachronistic and criminal moves to tamper with history which are going against justice of the international community and human desire, admit the legal responsibility for all the past crimes including those related to the sexual slavery for the army and fulfil a relevant obligation.    \r\n\r\n"

GIs occupied Sinchon county to kill more than 35,383 innocent people, or one quarter of its population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made desperate efforts to stifle the DPRK and bring the Korean people to their knees with the mobilization of huge armed forces of aggression and through criminal atrocities but surrendered to the Korean people and people's army who turned out as one in the struggle, rallied close around the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., far from drawing a due lesson from the defeat in the Korean War, has maliciously challenged the peace-loving DPRK's sincerity and efforts for reunification while persistently committing new war provocations pursuant to the hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration has brought grave obstacles to the favourably developing inter-Korean relations and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will answer the U.S. imperialists' \"hardline countermeasure\" with toughest countermeasure, anti-DPRK confrontation with merciless retaliation against the U.S. they will wipe out all the aggressors and achieve the historic cause of national reunification if the U.S. imperialists dare take the road of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should discontinue the reckless moves for confrontation and war against the DPRK, apologize for the crimes committed against the Korean nation and immediately quit South Korea, taking along its troops, nuclear weapons and other combat equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then followed speeches made by war veteran Ri Pok Su, former unconverted long-term prisoner Ham Se Hwan and student Kwak Kum Ju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers said that if the U.S. war maniacs unleash another war of aggression, the Korean people and people's army will annihilate all the provokers and aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yankees should not act rashly, aware of the fighting spirit of the Korean people to annihilate the enemy, they warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An anti-U.S. demonstration took place at the end of the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the rally were Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, and officials concerned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
