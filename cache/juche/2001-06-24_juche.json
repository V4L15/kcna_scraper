This is related to the Japanese authorities' approval of the controversial history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We demand once again that the Japanese authorities stop at once the anachronistic and criminal moves to tamper with history which are going against justice of the international community and human desire, admit the legal responsibility for all the past crimes including those related to the sexual slavery for the army and fulfil a relevant obligation.    \r\n\r\n"
