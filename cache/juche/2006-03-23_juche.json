It is the root cause of aggression, war and arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such aggressive nature of the Bush administration finds a more striking manifestation in its policy towards the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration again cried out for a \"preemptive attack\" at a time when it let loose a string of balderdash against the DPRK after labeling it part of an \"axis of evil\" and an \"outpost of tyranny\" and is increasing such physical pressure as financial sanctions and joint military exercises against it. This brings to light the Bush administration's intention to invariably pursue its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n The Bush administration is talking about the \"six-party talks\" and the like but, in actuality, is not interested in them at all. It is the calculation of the U.S. that it will evade the fulfillment of such commitment as the provision of light water reactors it made in the September 19 joint statement even if the talks are resumed.\r\n We made nuclear weapons to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat.\r\n The Bush administration is sadly mistaken if it thinks the DPRK will yield to the outside pressure and surrender to it when Pyongyang is steadily driven to a tight corner. \r\n It is our traditional fighting method to react to the increasing pressure head-on, without making any detour. The same method will be applied to countering the U.S. \r\nA preemptive attack is not the monopoly of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

One may draw a conclusion from the voting outcome that gone are the days when the U.S. could lord it over the international arena, dictating this or that, and it is finding itself in the mire of international isolation.\r\n Today things are not going on as the U.S. wishes and desires and its high-handed and arbitrary practices get it nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the human rights situation in the world today that any crime committed by the strong is considered as a good deed while a good deed made by the weak is regarded as an evil doing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, it is hard to vouch that the creation of a new Human Rights Council to replace the UN Commission on Human Rights would put an end to the politicization of human rights issues, the application of double standards and high-handed and arbitrary practices as regards those issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the reform of the human rights body has entered the phase of implementation, it is necessary to bring about a fundamental change in the UN's activities to protect human rights and improve their performance. The new council should impartially handle human rights issues on the universally accepted principle of respect for one's sovereignty and thus make a substantial contribution to improving the human rights performance.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
