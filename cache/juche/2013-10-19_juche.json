It is a clear evidence that the reckless moves of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK while posing a military threat to it have already gone beyond the limit. Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\tWe cannot but take a serious note of the fact that the entry of George Washington into the West Sea of Korea is aimed to prove effectiveness of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\", a reckless scenario for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, and supplement and complete it, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean warmongers signed with the U.S. the document of \"tailored deterrence strategy\", crying out for \"coping with nukes of the north\", an act little short of formulating their aggressive attempt to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inter-Korean relations are being pushed into a deadlock again and tensions on the Korean Peninsula screwed up.

The prevailing touch-and-go situation clearly proves before the international community who is senseless provoker and warmonger keen on escalating the tension on the Korean Peninsula and bringing a dark cloud of a nuclear war to hang over there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is nonsense and gangster-like sophism for the warmongers to clamor about someone's \"abandonment of nukes\", though they have gone frantic in their moves for igniting a nuclear war against the DPRK while introducing nuclear strike means into the Korean Peninsula one after another."

            "content": "IS Director's Anti-DPRK Outbursts under Fire\r\nPyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- Nam Jae Jun, director of the puppet Intelligence Service (IS) of south Korea, addressing a recent plenary meeting of the Intelligence Committee of the \"National Assembly\", talked nonsense about \"the north's test of long-range missile propeller and forward-deployment of new type multiple launch rocket system\". He even hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, raising a hue and cry over \"declaration of reunification by use of forces\" and the like. \n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Saturday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not be overlooked is that these tricksters, who used to mislead the public opinion by distributing misinformation on the DPRK among media behind the scene in the past, are now making public appearances to take the lead in the anti-DPRK smear campaign and false propaganda. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has long been the main job of the IS to block the improvement of the north-south relations and incite hostility towards fellow countrymen in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe IS was shrunk up by the loud voices of the Koreans calling for reunification that shook the whole land of Korea in the wake of  the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. But, it is now working with blood-shot eyes to revive the \"yusin\" dictatorship and bring the north-south relations to a collapse, backed by the present chief executive. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Nam Jae Jun is a main player in the campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNam let loose a whole string of unspeakable invectives against the DPRK on the basis of hackneyed misinformation at the puppet National Assembly. Lurking behind his backbiting was a sinister intention to tarnish the image of the dignified DPRK, chill the mounting desire of the south Korean people for achieving reunification through alliance with the north and escalate the north-south confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNam, who served the \"yusin\" dictator from when he was young, brought to light his bad temperament. No matter how vociferously the tricksters may trumpet, no one will believe them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is ridiculous, indeed, for Nam to float sheer lies. Equally miserable is the plight of the puppet chief executive of south Korea counting on such guy in his dotage."
