Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To struggle for independence against imperialism is a mode to keep Korean-style socialism alive and provides a fundamental source of all victories. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to hold more tightly the arms of revolution, the weapon of anti-imperialist class struggle, and firmly defend Korean-style socialism and eternally glorify it without the slightest vacillation no matter which way wind may blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prospect of the Korean revolution remains bright as long as it is led by Kim Jong Il, invincible and iron-willed commander, who is invariably holding high the torchlight of revolution lit in the early days of the Korean revolution, the editorial concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Denial of History Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- A professor of the London University of Britain some time ago released a paper refuting the Japanese reactionaries' preposterous sophism that Japan's colonial rule provided a foundation for the economic growth of Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper served as an indictment stripping bare the shamelessness and impudence of the Japanese reactionaries who tried to justify the past history of Asian aggression by the Japanese imperialists and, as if it were not enough, have the cheek to beautify it as something that laid a foundation for the economic growth of Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The shameless act of distorting and denying stark historical truth and insulting and making a mockery of human ethics and conscience and justice is bound to lash all people into wrath and be ridiculed and censured by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an undeniable historical fact that the Japanese imperialists invaded Asian countries including Korea by force of arms, committed shuddering crimes against humanity and engaged themselves in robber-like economic looting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are beautifying the history of their Asian aggression, claiming that it was beneficial and provided a foundation for economic growth. This is the height of shameless distortion of history and a mockery of the Asian people and world conscience and deception to fool them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a downright sophism which can be uttered only by the Japanese reactionaries steeped in the militarist view on history and aggressive consciousness to the marrows of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asian people are the most unbiased judge of Japan's past history. They know better than anybody else of the crimes of aggression and war committed by the Japanese imperialists as they directly witnessed them and suffered from them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries had a shred of conscience and an iota of will to make a clean break with the crime-woven past, they would not dare commit such brazen and arrogant act as to zealously justify the Japanese imperialists' aggression on and colonial rule over Asian countries. The Japanese reactionaries' vicious distortion of history clearly proves that they are dreaming of reinvasion of Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Projected \"Defense White Paper\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Japan recently worked out and announced an outline of the projected \"defense white paper\" for this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries clarified in the outline that the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" would participate in the \"UN peace-keeping activities\" as a main player. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not the first time that Japan announced such military policy scenario. But this outline is of very dangerous nature and merits serious attention in the light of its content and the fact that it is the first of its kind since the Defense Agency was upgraded into the Ministry of Defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outline is nothing but a military operation scenario aimed at escalating the moves of the Japanese militarists for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have already adopted and effectuated a variety of laws including the \"law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping activities,\" the \"law on overseas troop dispatch,\" the \"law on emergency in surrounding areas\" and the \"law on special measures against terrorism,\" thus legalizing Japan's participation in military actions including the use of force overseas. Moreover, they expanded the sphere of SDF's overseas activities from 1,000 miles fixed in the 1970s to 2,000 miles linked with the Indian Ocean. They have pushed forward overseas troop dispatch in real earnest under the pretext of \"providing logistic support\" to the U.S.-led \"war on terrorism\" since 9/11, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have perpetrated all these actions for realizing their wild ambition for overseas expansion under the signboards of the \"UN peace-keeping activities\" and \"international contribution.\" SDF was given the chance to cultivate its capability and test the power of weapons produced in Japan in the battles in which SDF was involved under the signboard of \"international contribution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's much touted \"international contribution\" is nothing but sophism to justify its invasion of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that in the above-said outline of the \"defense white paper\" Japan completely discarded the signboard of \"making contribution\" which it has so far advocated for form's sake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of the outline lies in that the \"white paper\" is aimed at helping the SDF emerge a main player in the \"UN peace-keeping activities\" so that it may openly conduct joint military operations with the U.S. against a certain country and region any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that they decided in the outline to have the missile defense system (MD) in place as early as possible for the purpose of intercepting ballistic missiles flying in the direction of Japan under the pretext of the DPRK's missile launch, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their loudmouthed \"missile threat\" from the DPRK is to serve their sinister political and military purposes. The Japanese militarists are keen to realize their invariable ambition to stage a comeback to Korea through joint military operations with the U.S. as they did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this goes to prove that the above-said outline is nothing but a scenario for reinvasion of Korea and a doctrine of aggression which calls for launching military offensives against the Asian continent and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's overseas expansion is arousing concern of the international community as it is becoming a dangerous reality at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as daylight that Japan is set to embark upon the road of aggression to realize its old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to stop its rash acts, well aware that its reinvasion leads to a shameful defeat and self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kom secret camp in the Mt. Paektu secret base to get information on the enemy's situation in and around Pochonbo and make full preparations for operation to advance into the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At 10 p.m. on June 4, Juche 26 (1937) the President sent a gun report for zero-time to the night sky of Pochonbo. The gunshot was a greeting presented to the motherland and a signal calling the Korean people to the battle for defeating brigandish Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese police substation was fired severely first and then the subcounty office, post office, forest conservation office, fire hall and other enemy's administrative centers were engulfed in flames upon the attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news of the battle spread instantly not only to the whole country but to the world, making Pochonbo historic land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the Pochonbo battle, the enemy met wholesale deaths again in Mt.  Kouyushui and Jiansanfeng. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Korean people won a victory in the Pochonbo battle thanks to the President's confidence and superb strategy, today they are winning victory after victory in the showdown with the US imperialists under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il with confidence and matchless courage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the confidence in sure victory and mettle of the Korean servicepersons and people that they will be certain to win a victory, frustrating all sorts of stifling moves of the enemies, under the great Songun revolutionary leadership of the brilliant commander of Mt.

Pues ellos la conocen mejor porque sufrieron en carne propia la agresion y los crimenes de guerra de los imperialistas nipones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si los reaccionarios japoneses tienen un pedazo de conciencia y la voluntad de separarse de su pasado criminal, no incurririan en acciones tan atrevidas y arrogantes para justificar la agresion y el colonialismo sobre los paises asiaticos por parte de los imperialistas de su pais. Esta obstinada tergiversacion de la historia de los reaccionarios japoneses muestra claramente que ellos suenan con agredir de nuevo a Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
