Korea Military Nexus\r\n Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the second foreign and defense ministerial talks between the U.S. and south Korea took place in Washington. At the talks the south Korean side agreed on the joint operation of the anti-missile system with the U.S., citing \"missile threats\" from the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Friday in a bylined commentary says in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group begged for U.S. sustained provision of the \"extended nuclear deterrence\" and the U.S. responded to it. This is a clear revelation of the adventurous attempt of the warmongers at home and abroad to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fully shows the criminal nature of the U.S. and south Korea which threaten the existence and security of the Korean nation while intensifying the military cooperation and conspiracy for invasion of the DPRK under the pretext of the non-existent \"threat from it\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that at the talks the south Korean side actively fell in with the U.S. while vociferating about \"expansion of the scope of the three-party security cooperation\" among the U.S., Japan and south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The evermore intensified moves of the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for military conspiracy with the U.S. and Japanese masters aim at realizing the wild ambition for invasion of the DPRK by rounding off the formation of the \"triangular military alliance\" for aggression pursuant to the U.S. Asia strategy. These dangerous and reckless moves are aggravating the situation of not only the Korean Peninsula but also the rest of Northeast Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that the Lee group getting hell bent on military collusion with the U.S. and Japan bereft of reason is an arch criminal aggravating tension and harassing peace."

Por eso, empunara mas firmemente el fusil del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA los provocadores les espera un castigo inimaginablemente severo."
