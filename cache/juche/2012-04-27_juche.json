            "content": "Chongwadae Senior Presidential Secretary's Outbursts under Fire\r\n Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Friday made public the following information bulletin No. 996:\n\t\t\t\t\t Chon Yong U, senior presidential secretary for diplomacy and security of Chongwadae, at a seminar sponsored by the \"Institute for National Security and Strategy\" under the puppet Intelligence Service impudently mentioned the august names of the peerless great men of Mt. Paektu, describing the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its system as \"hereditary.\" He went the lengths of malignantly defaming the pent-up grudge of the army and people of the DPRK all-out to wipe out the rat-like Lee group as a \"new phase of accusations against the south.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Chon dared to trumpet about \"limit\" and \"change\" in the DPRK, disclosing his undisguised aim to escalate the confrontation of systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is another hideous provocation pushing the inter-Korean relations to an extreme pitch of tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Chon uttered as a lackey of Chongwadae, the den of rats, suggests that the Lee group is much upset by condemnation of its high treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Chon, he is the closest confident of traitor Lee Myung Bak and wicked confrontation maniac. When the DPRK launched Kwangmyongsong-2 in 2009, he jabbered \"he couldn't understand the north as it squandered money for space development at hard time for it.\" When he was vice minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade in 2010, this guy called for \"sanctions against the north\" while trumpeting about \"someone's collapse.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee let even Chon make reckless remarks in an effort to save his face even a bit and justify his vicious moves to escalate the confrontation by misleading the public opinion as he was driven into a tight corner by the might of the angry service personnel and people of the DPRK and the domestic and foreign public condemnation of his thrice-cursed high treason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent disclosure of more scandals of his confidents such as Choe Si Jung, former chairman of the Broadcasting and News Agency Committee, threw Lee and his group into a bottomless predicament. The smear campaign kicked off by Lee was aimed at preventing the public attention from being focused on him in a bid to weather his ruling crisis and rally the conservative forces and turn the situation before the \"presidential\" election favorable to him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why south Korean media and political circles and even the puppet ruling quarters are critical of Chon's remarks, commenting they were prompted by \"ignorance and misjudgment of the north\" and \"it is not good to repeatedly rattle the nerves of the north\" and \"they were designed to bring about a turn in the phase for tiding over the internal crisis\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The outbursts let loose by Chon indicate that Lee Myung Bak is making desperate efforts by setting in motion even his mandarins, finding it hard to escape thunder-like strikes after daring point an accusing finger at the sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for the group of traitors to talk about someone's \"limit\" and \"change\" after being cursed and denounced before meeting a punishment for its crimes against the nation and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Lee group which has been put into a critical situation by the mindset of south Korean people and the resentment of all Koreans. It is the group which should undergo changes and deserves punishment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a saying call a spade a spade. If Chon wants to talk about heredity, he should take issue, first of all, with the heredity of \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship rejected and opposed by the south Korean people. If he wants to talk about changes, he should refer to the call for abolishing the corrupt unpopular system and the pro-U.S. regime for confrontation with fellow countrymen, the unanimous demand of the people from all walks of life, and respond to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For Chon to act in collusion with Lee Myung Bak more dead than alive to shake his fist towards the sun is as foolish an act as digging his own grave. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group's invectives are nothing but squeaks made by the rats before meeting deaths in face of the angry people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more desperately this group of rats does mischief, bitterer hatred and resentment it will touch off among the service personnel and people of the DPRK and the further it will precipitate their doomsday. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will wipe out not only the boss of the rat-like traitors but also his yes men who hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership and its system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who hurt the dignity and the system should bear in mind that they will not be able to escape the most miserable death in face of the strikes of the Songun army of the DPRK as is the case with the ratty Lee Myung Bak."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun exhorta a exterminar a los traidores a la nacion\r\nPyongyang, 27 de abril (ACNC) -- En un articulo individual difundido este viernes, el diario Rodong Sinmun senala que todos los compatriotas del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar deben levantarse unanimemente en la lucha patriotica pannacional por aniquilar a la banda de conservadores surcoreanos, que comete actos de provocacion cada vez mas grandes en contra de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, y por abrir las posibilidades de desarrollo independiente de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa camarilla es la fuerza mas reaccionaria que obstaculiza el desarrollo independiente de la nacion manteniendo su vida con el servilismo a las fuerzas extranjeras, comienza el articulo y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como tomara el poder, pregonando la \"epoca de nueva cooperacion que no cuestiona el pasado\", el traidor Lee Myung Bak hizo vista gorda de los crimenes cometidos en el siglo pasado por el imperialismo japones contra el pueblo coreano y de los pasos de reaccionarios japoneses encaminados a usurpar el islote coreano Tok.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee vendio a su amo norteamericano los intereses de los habitantes surcoreanos y en contubernio con EE.UU., libro frenetica campana conflictiva anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye quien tomo el control del \"Partido Saenuri\" es hija del infame dictador de \"renovacion\" proyanqui y projapones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla pretende ocupar la proxima \"presidencia\" con el apoyo de sus amos gringo y japones. La camarilla de conservadores surcoreanos esta integrada por tales elementos proyanquis y projaponeses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos traidores a la nacion convierten el Sur de Corea en una sociedad cada vez mas reaccionaria desafiando a la aspiracion del pueblo a la independencia, democracia y reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda ratonesca de Lee Myung Bak intenta infundir en la sociedad surcoreana la hostilidad a los connacionales y aplacar el entusiasmo de sentenciar al actual \"poder\" traidor calumniando siniestramente el digno sistema de la RPDC y ofendiendo atrevidamente su maxima dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa liquidacion de las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas del Sur de Corea es la demanda apremiante de la epoca y premisa fundamental del mejoramiento de relaciones intercoreanas y la paz y reunificacion independiente del pais."
