            "content": "Japanese Prime Minister's Reckless Remarks Accused \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- The reckless remarks made by Abe openly denying the coercive recruitment of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army are nothing but a crafty and shameful attempt to conceal the Japanese imperialists' crimes against humanity and evade state responsibility for the crimes, an unbearable mockery of the victims of the crimes and their bereaved families and an unpardonable challenge to all the Koreans and other members of the international community urging Japan to make an apology and compensation for them. A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland declared this in a statement issued on Sunday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  His outbursts are nothing but vituperation intended to justify Japan's past crimes and accelerate militarization for reinvasion and most insolent remarks making a mockery of justice and human conscience, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the whole world is condemning Japan's above-said crimes as the worst flesh traffic in the 20th century and the most hideous sexual slavery unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prime minister of a country dared again deny the sexual slavery. This clearly indicates how vulgar and shameful the Japanese reactionaries are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, Japan dares make a bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council and pull up the dignified DPRK. Can there be any more hateful and cursed country of brutes than it? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan coerced hundreds of thousands of Korean women into providing sex to the imperial Japanese army and hurled millions of young and middle-aged Koreans into battle fields and slave labor sites, killing many of them. It is nonsensical, therefore, for the descendents of Samurais to talk about someone's \"abduction\" and the like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Korean people should not pardon this spate of remarks made by the Japanese reactionaries but roundly expose the crimes committed by Japan against the Korean nation and force it to pay for all its wrongdoings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Imperialists' Suppression of Struggle for National Liberation Disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 11 (KCNA) -- After illegally occupying Korea the Japanese imperialists revised the penalty rules of the \"Maintenance of the Public Order Act\", Japan's fascist domestic law, to make it better serve the purpose of their fascist colonial rule over Korea and, on this basis, enacted various special criminal laws such as the \"Law on the Supervision over Korean Political Criminals for Public Peace\" and the \"Law on the Preventive Detention of Korean Political Criminals,\" mercilessly cracking down upon Koreans' anti-Japanese national liberation struggle. Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan applied the \"Maintenance of the Public Order Act\" to suppressing the national liberation struggle in other country. This was an unjustifiable criminal act in view of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a publicly accepted principle governing the international relations to disallow any measure and action to be taken to suppress and restrict by force of arms the right of each country and nation to sovereignty and independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indelible crimes the Japanese imperialists committed against the Korean people by faking up and enforcing such fascist laws as the above-said act can never be tolerated no matter how often an old generation is replaced by a new one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries have added to their crimes up to this date since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists, far from making any apology and compensation to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that last year they became more desperate than ever before in their crackdown upon the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), an overseas citizens organization of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their suppression of Chongryon has become unprecedented since the outset of this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a wanton violation of international law and inhumane and fascist brutality. Their reckless suppression and terrorism against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan are a repetition of the Japanese imperialists' brutal crackdown upon the Korean people's anti-Japanese national liberation struggle and little short of committing double or treble crimes against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely force Japan to pay for its hideous past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Warhawks' Anti-DPRK Saber-Rattling under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- RSOI and field mobile exercises the U.S. and the south Korean warlike forces are going to stage by mobilizing huge troops and the latest war hardware are a blatant challenge to the trend of the situation on the Korean Peninsula turning favorable and a serious provocation against the DPRK. A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) declared this in a statement on Saturday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The projected provocative saber-rattling is an uncouth act little short of leveling a gun at the dialogue partner and an anachronistic act aimed to stem the trend towards reconciliation and improved relations and restore the relations of confrontation and hostility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war maneuvers planned by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities, while saying one thing and doing another and playing double-dealing tactics, make the DPRK skeptical about whether they were sincere when they reached all the agreements with the DPRK and they are now willing to put them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the authorities of the south side have perpetrated such perfidy as announcing the plan for such joint war exercises with the U.S. as soon as they went back after agreeing to exert common efforts to implement the February 13 agreement, ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and improve the north-south relations, guided by the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, at the recent ministerial talks. This behavior has touched off towering indignation of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should immediately cancel their plan to stage the anachronistic and reckless anti-DPRK saber-rattling, clearly understanding that the war moves will only becloud the prospect for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and bring destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
