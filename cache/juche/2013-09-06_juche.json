Korean Regime's Anti-DPRK Smear Campaign Slammed\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The puppet south Korean regime is harshly suppressing a lawmaker from the Unified Progressive Party and others concerned on absurd charges of plotting rebellion.\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Intelligence Service (IS) and other fascist riff-raffs searched the houses and offices of those concerned of the Unified Progressive Party and put them into custody. And no sooner had a coterie of the \"Saenuri Party\" cooked up a motion calling for the arrest of a lawmaker from an opposition party at the puppet National Assembly than the IS committed such harsh atrocity of throwing him into prison.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in an information bulletin No. 1040 Friday said it is the first time since the end of the military dictatorship that the serving National Assemblyman was arrested and taken into custody by the regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What arouses bigger anger is that the puppet south Korean regime is stirring up confrontation with its fellow countrymen in the north, groundlessly pulling up the DPRK over the case, the information bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Justice Minister and other die-hard confrontational maniacs of the \"Saenuri Party\" are now working hard to deliberately link the case with the DPRK, while talking about the \"formation of an underground revolutionary organization guided by the Juche idea\" and the \"forces seeking to overthrow the social system through cooperation with the north\". The IS and the prosecution are also loudly crying out for directing the focus of investigation into proving the relations between the DPRK and the Unified Progressive Party and the conservative media are kicking up the smear campaign, talking about \"the north's ambition for reunification through communization\" and \"camouflaged programme of the north's Workers' Party\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative forces' attempt to deliberately link this case with the north is an intolerable mockery of its efforts for dialogue and peace and will to repair the inter-Korean relations and an unpardonable provocation to them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is going on in south Korea clearly indicates that it is none other than the puppet regime and the U.S. that are to chiefly blame for unstable situation and escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fascist confrontation maniacs are sadly mistaken if they think they can stifle the pro-reunification patriotic forces and progressive democratic forces of south Korea and put brake on the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations and stem the trend of the situation in the vicinity with such despicable plot. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop such foolish racket as pricking their own eyes. Should they persist in their repressive campaign which will seriously affect the inter-Korean relations, they will be wholly responsible for it."
