Jiang Zemin, General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, on his election as General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n   The message dated October 8 says:\r\n   Upon hearing the happy news that you have been elected General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, I sincerely extend warm congratulations to you on behalf of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and myself.\r\n   Since comrade Kim Il Sung passed away three years ago, the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have rallied closely around the WPK Central Committee under your leadership and carried out comrade Kim Il Sung's behests.\r\n    With iron will and strong determination, the people of the DPRK have overcome all kinds of difficulties and hardships through their own efforts.\r\n   The people of the DPRK have continued the successful march along the road of building their motherland, striving for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   China and the DPRK are friendly neighbors linked by common mountains and rivers. There exists a time-tested traditional friendship between the two parties, two countries and two peoples, which was personally fostered and developed by the leaders of older generation of our two countries.\r\n   Defending and consolidating this traditional friendship and developing the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative ties are not only in the fundamental interests of the two parties, two countries and two peoples, but also of great significance for promoting peace, stability and development on the Korean Peninsula, in northeast Asia and even the whole world.\r\n   We will, as always, make unremitting efforts to further strengthen and develop the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative relations.\r\n   We believe that with our joint efforts, the Sino-DPRK traditional friendship and good-neighborly ties will surely be developed and passed on from generation to generation, providing welfare to our two peoples and contributing to peace, stability and development in Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n   I wholeheartedly wish you and the WPK greater success in their future work of leading the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

And the puppet army passed a large number of military vehicles and war suppliers through the outskirts of Seoul for a war exercise codenamed \"twin dragon\". Some time ago, the puppet joint chiefs of staff headquarters distributed to all units of the puppet army the plan for war preparation against the north in which the concrete contents are specified for a preemptive strike on the north in the event of \"contingency\", and the puppets committed provocations repeatedly along the Military Demarcation Line and war manoeuvers at the puppet army every day. This is a very ill-boding military movement. Such movement proves that the south Korean bellicose elements made the military adventure a fait accompli and are escalating the preparation.\r\n   Their frantic war manoeuvres against the north are linked with their serious internal confusion.\r\n   Now the Kim Young Sam group are uneasy and irritated by their unfavourable election situation owing to the withdrawal of members from the \"New Korea Party\" and the fall of Kim's image with the approach of the \"Presidential Election\" slated for the end of the year.  So Kim Young Sam is attempting to incite a war fever within the army on the pretext of the fictitious \"provocation\" of the north and let the \"New Korea Party\" remain in power for another term by creating uneasiness and fear among the people.\r\n   The puppets are taking the road of military adventure for another term of office but this will only precipitate their ruin.\r\n   The Korean people and People's Army are sharply watching every movement of the puppets and will mete out a thousandfold  punishment to them if they unleash war against the north. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also advances policies of socialist construction for the eternal prosperity of the country.\r\n   In the 70s he instilled the concrete conception of communist society into the minds of the people and put forward a Party platform to build it. His clairvoyance is, indeed, rare.\r\n   With his ideas and theories indicating the road ahead, the WPK can lead socialist construction to a victory without making a mistake in shaping policies and deviating from them and creditably build an ideal society of humankind on this land.\r\n   He with rare clairvoyance puts forward a strategy to win one victory after another, basing himself on the correctest analysis of the fast-changing situation.\r\n   His clairvoyance is so rare and scientific that he gains a correct knowledge of the trend of the complicated situation that other people cannot predict nor envisage, and loses no time to provide for it.\r\n   The \"pueblo\" incident and the hard-fought struggle to check and frustrate \"team spirit\" joint military manoeuvres and \"special nuclear inspection\" racket brought his rare clairvoyance home to people.\r\n   He with rare clairvoyance envisages in a scientific way the pressing issues of world politics.\r\n   His estimates of the Vietnamese War, the Second Mideast War, the civil war in Cambodia, the gulf war and other events which have taken place since the 1960s are all correct.\r\n   No doubt, the Korean people under the leadership of the far-sighted general Kim Jong Il will certainly win in their struggle to build a powerful country of Juche and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche in Korea. \r\n\r\n"

It is stipulated in the proposal that the country should be reunified by founding a confederal state through the establishment of a unified national government on condition that the north and the south recognize and tolerate each other's ideas and social systems, a government in which the two sides are represented on an equal footing and under which they exercise regional autonomy respectively with equal rights and duties.\r\n   The paper further says:\r\n   In view of the urgent demand of the Korean nation and of the specific conditions of the country the best way of achieving the reunification of the country at an early date is to build a unified national state through confederacy based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments.\r\n   The DCRK founding proposal is the way of reunifying the country on the principle of placing the nation above the differences in ideology  and social system and subordinating everything  to the highest interests of the nation. It is the most realistic, reasonable and fair and aboveboard reunification proposal which makes it possible to reunify the country without seeking one side's superiority and interests and without doing harm to either side, now that different ideologies and systems exist  in the north and south of Korea.\r\n   The country should be reunified by founding the DCRK. \r\nOnly then can the Korean nation establish sovereignty over the whole of Korea, achieve great unity as a homogeneous nation, demonstrate the proud appearance of the nation of the same blood and build a unified national state, independent, peaceloving and neutral, in Korea. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
