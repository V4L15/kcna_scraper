It, therefore, has nothing to do with the defence of human rights and would only stoke confrontation and distrust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The results of the voting showed that many countries said no to the \"resolution\" and this testifies to the fact that the political purpose of the \"resolution\" is regarded as a problem from an objective point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the worst human rights abuse in the present times to occupy other country by force of arms and turn it into a sea of blood. The worst human rights abuser is the country that ignited such a war and the countries that supported it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These countries are crowded with tens of thousands of wanderers, beggars and prisoners and plagued with all sorts of crimes and human rights abuses such as extreme racial discrimination, murder and rape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most shameless hypocrisy in the modern times for such countries to dare talk about \"human rights performance\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK categorically dismisses the above-said \"resolution\" produced by hypocrites and strongly denounces the sinister political aim sought by it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the intention of the U.S. to spark off a new arms race and draw on the experience in which it brought the former Soviet Union to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration is keen to construct a U.S.-led pyramid-like structure for world domination through the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the pretext of joint research and development of the technology of interceptor missile the U.S. is plugging Japan, Australia and other countries into the moves to establish the MD. By doing so, the U.S. wants to shift its heavy financial burden onto those countries and reduce them to its faithful servants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. MD is also designed to put military pressure on the anti-imperialist independent countries and lay a siege to Russia and China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the MD the U.S. also seeks to harm the independence of Europe which has emerged as one pole and, at the same time, help the U.S. munitions monopolies rake up greater profits and tide over the economic crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to form a missile defense network make the international relations more complicated and aggravate the new arms race and military confrontation. This development is naturally arousing concern and vigilance among many countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an anachronistic daydream for the U.S. to realize its wild ambition for domination by throwing a global missile defense network.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Ultra-Right Conservatives' Anti-North Smear Campaign Dismissed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- Riffraffs of at least 40 anti-DPRK human rights organizations in south Korea were recently reported to have kicked up a frantic anti-DPRK ruckus in the wake of the formation of the \"Federation for Human Rights Organizations in north Korea.\" A spokesman for the Council for National Reconciliation issued a statement Thursday denouncing this racket. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the so-called inaugural meeting they declared that they would conduct brisk activities to settle the \"human rights issue in the north\" and pressurized the authorities to take up the issue as a major item at the inter-Korean premier talks. They also kicked up a madcap row against the DPRK in front of Walker Hill Hotel in Seoul at a time when the talks were under way. They slandered the DPRK and incited inter-Korean confrontation, shouting \"No drain on resources,\" \"defense of the National Security Law\" and \"Down with north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The intolerable confrontational racket kicked up by the above-said organizations is nothing but part of a premeditated and undisguised anti-DPRK confrontational campaign of the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces to persistently pursue the hostile moves against the north, bringing the human rights issue to the fore instead of the nuclear issue under the backstage manipulation of the U.S., the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As recognized by the public at home and abroad, the \"human rights issue in the north\" is a product of the despicable anti-DPRK smear campaign staged by the anti-reunification ultra-right conservatives in south Korea under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. conservative quarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only south Korea which is plagued with human rights issue as the pro-U.S. anti-reunification conservative forces are still at large though they are taking issue even with the freedom of expression of thinking and will of the people aspiring after reunification and patriotism and incriminating even the free meeting with fellow countrymen under the pretext of \"defending the NSL,\" a draconic law against human rights, democracy and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, anti-reunification conservatives in south Korea who are no more than human scum are foolish enough to link the sincere efforts of the people in the DPRK to protect the genuine popular system chosen by themselves with the \"human rights issue\" and the like in wanton violation of the north-south agreement and declaration on definitely converting the inter-Korean relations into those of mutual respect and trust.  This is an unpardonable insult and challenge to justice, human rights, reunification and patriotism and an intolerable mockery of the public at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the anti-reunification conservative forces in south Korea have lost any justification to pursue any longer their moves for confrontation with the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue, pursuant to the U.S. policy, they are working hard to stem the trend of the times toward independence and reunification by hyping the \"human rights issue\" and stoking inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their ridiculous row over \"human rights issue\" can never work on anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those hell-bent on the reckless anti-DPRK human rights racket are bound to be forsaken by the nation and meet destruction as their behavior is quite contrary to the aspiration of all the fellow countrymen and the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Portavoz del MINREX rechaza la \"resolucion de DDHH\" anti-RPDC\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 22 de noviembre (ATCC) -- A la pregunta de un reportero de la Agencia Telegrafica Central de Corea, formulada en relacion con la aprobacion de la \"resolucion de derechos humanos\" contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en la reunion del tercer comite del 62o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio este jueves la siguiente respuesta: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la reunion del tercer comite del 62o periodo de sesiones de la Asamblea General de la ONU fue aprobada el dia 20 la \"resolucion\" que censura la \"situacion de derechos humanos\" de la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al igual que en el ano pasado, esta resolucion fue inventada como un producto de la confabulacion entre Japon y la UE, siendo un documento demagogico plagado de fraudes y falsificaciones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La jugada de aprobar tales \"resoluciones\", en que acostumbrados al veto al regimen socialista al estilo coreano centrado en las masas populares, incurren dando espaldas a la realidad irrefutable e invirtiendo lo blanco en lo negro, no tiene nada que ver con la defensa de DDHH y solo agudizara la confrontacion y la desconfianza. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El resultado de votacion demostro que muchos paises estuvieron en contra de la resolucion, lo cual deviene una prueba de que el objetivo politico de ella esta cuestionado objetivamente. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la actualidad, la peor violacion de DDHH es el genocidio, que convierte a un pais en un bano de sangre despues de ser ocupado por las fuerzas armadas. Por lo tanto, los peores violadores de DDHH son el pais que desato esa guerra y sus seguidores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos paises existen decenas de miles de vagabundos, mendigos y reos y se practican extremada discriminacion racial, crimenes y violacion de DDHH de toda clase como el asesinato y la violacion sexual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Seria la hipocresia mas grande de la edad moderna el hecho de que esos paises se atrevieran a cuestionar la \"situacion de derechos humanos\" de alguien. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La RPDC rechaza totalmente esa \"resolucion de derechos humanos\" inventada por esos hipocritas y denuncia categoricamente su malsano objetivo politico.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
