he sent New Year greetings to all Koreans and the progressive people of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2016 was a year of revolutionary and auspicious event and great turn to be specially recorded in the history of the Workers' Party of Korea and the country, he said, referring to the achievements made last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year the Seventh Congress of the WPK was held significantly with splendor as a grand political festival thanks to the high revolutionary enthusiasm of all the party members, service personnel and people and amid deep concern of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Seventh Congress proudly reviewed the glorious history of the struggle of the WPK, which had led the revolutionary cause of Juche to victory under the wise guidance of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, and unfolded a grand blueprint for accomplishing the socialist cause under the banner of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An epoch-making turn was made in bolstering up the national defence capacity of Juche Korea and the DPRK soared as a nuclear and military power in the East that no formidable enemy dare encroach upon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proud victory was achieved in the 70-day and 200-day campaigns to glorify the Seventh Congress of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the heroic struggle of the Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il working class and all other people, the gigantic goals of the 70-day and 200-day campaigns put forward by the WPK were successfully hit and a new breakthrough made in the country's economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new spirit of era for building a powerful socialist country was created and trust in the Party and faith in socialism were more deeply cherished in the hearts of the people during the 70-day and 200-day campaigns.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un underscored the need to achieve the drastic advance in implementing the decision of the Seventh Congress of the Party this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should concentrate all efforts on the implementation of the five-year strategy for national economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year's fighting goals should be hit without fail to open a bright prospect for the five-year strategy and put the overall economy of the country on a higher stage while consolidating the victory gained last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let us accelerate the victorious advance of socialism with the great spirit of self-reliance and self-development as the dynamic force!\", this is a militant slogan we should uphold in the New Year's onward march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to actively wage the all-people charge for attaining the goal of five-year strategy by dint of the self-reliance and self-development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the field of science and technology it is imperative to solve scientific and technological problems arising in updating industrial establishments and putting the production on a normal footing there with a main emphasis on the local production of raw materials, fuel and equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Electricity, metal and chemical industrial fields should take the lead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the coal industry and railway transport fields, a priority should be given to meeting the need for coal and its transport to power plants and metal and chemical factories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important to quickly develop the machine industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A radical turn should be effected in light industry, agriculture and fisheries and thus a greater progress be made in improving the standard of people's living.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the construction field, Ryomyong Street should be completed on the highest level and efforts be focused on the construction of important projects, and more educational and cultural facilities and dwelling houses be built wonderfully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All sectors and units of the national economy should wage a vigorous drive to produce and economize as much as possible under the slogan of self-reliance and self-sufficiency and thus fulfill this year's plan on all indices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole country should turn out for the land management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On all fronts of culture including education, public health, sports and literature and arts, a fresh revolutionary surge should be brought to step up the building of a highly civilized nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The political and military position of socialism should be further cemented as an invincible fortress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel and people should share their thinking and breath with the Party and rally around it in thinking and purpose, morality and sense of obligation and work hard for the prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should resolutely smash the enemies' despicable and vicious moves to dampen the pure and ardent desire of the people for the Party and estrange the people from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also important to bring about a great surge in bolstering up the military capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Victory or defeat in this year's drive for implementing the decision made at the 7th Congress of the Workers' Party Korea depends on the role to be played by the party organizations and working people's organizations, Kim Jong Un said, stressing the need for all the primary party organizations to embody the basic spirit of the First Conference of Chairpersons of the Party Primary Committees and make sure that the spirit of uninterrupted innovation and advance is fully displayed in the all-out charge this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un also called on the entire nation to pave a wide avenue to independent reunification by the united efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to take active measures to improve the north-south relations and defuse acute military conflict and danger of a war between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should solidarize and get united on the principle of subordinating everything to national reunification, the cause common to the nation, and activate the reunification movement on a nationwide scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needed to foil challenges of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad going against the nation's desire for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said that unless the U.S. and its vassal forces stop nuclear threat and blackmail and unless they stop the war exercises which they stage right at our noses under the pretext of annual exercises, the DPRK would keep increasing the military capabilities for self-defence and preemptive striking capacity with a main emphasis on nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will defend the peace and security of the country with its force and make active contribution to defending the world peace and stability, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK and the government of the DPRK will remain loyal to the ideas of foreign policy -- independence, peace and friendship --and make joint efforts to expand the good-neighborly friendship and cooperation with countries advocating independence and realize the genuine international justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un said that he would make devoted efforts to make sure that the days when our people sang the song \"We Are the Happiest in the World\" full of optimism about the future with deep trust in President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il only will become a reality today, not just a past days of history, and solemnly pledged to become a faithful servant serving the people with pure and sincere dedication."

\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes que todo, el envio el saludo del Ano Nuevo a todo el pueblo coreano y los demas progresistas y amigos del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 2016 fue un ano de jubilo revolucionario y de gran viraje que se registrara en letras mayusculas en la historia del Partido del Trabajo de Corea y la patria, dijo el Mariscal y enumero los exitos alcanzados en el ano pasado:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ano expirado, se ha celebrado significativa y solemnemente el VII Congreso del PTC como gran festival politico, gracias al elevado entusiasmo revolucionario de todos los militantes del Partido, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular y los habitantes y bajo la gran atencion de todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl VII Congreso del PTC hizo balance orgulloso de la gloriosa historia de lucha del PTC, que bajo la sabia orientacion del Presidente Kim Il Sung y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il, ha conducido a la senda siempre victoriosa la causa revolucionaria del Juche, y presento el magno proyecto para llevar a feliz termino la causa socialista bajo la bandera del kimilsungismo-kimjongilismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe ha logrado un cambio trascendental en el mejoramiento de la capacidad de defensa nacional de la Corea del Juche y nuestra patria emergio como potencia nuclear y militar del Oriente que disuade a cualquier enemigo por muy poderoso que fuera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe han logrado exitos orgullosos en las campanas de 70 y 200 dias para glorificar el VII Congreso del Partido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado de la lucha heroica de la clase obrera kimilsungista-kimjongilista y todos los habitantes, se alcanzaron enormes metas de las campanas de 70 y 200 dias y se abrio la nueva ruta de avance en el desarrollo economico del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante esas campanas, se creo el nuevo espiritu de la epoca para la construccion de potencia socialista y se hizo mas firme la confianza del pueblo en el Partido y el socialismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un instruyo lograr este ano significativo un avance trascendental en la materializacion de la resolucion del VII Congreso del PTC:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que concentrarse en el cumplimiento de la estrategia quinquenal para el desarrollo de economia nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs preciso alcanzar sin falta las metas de lucha de este ano para abrir buenas perspectivas para el cumplimiento de la estrategia quinquenal y llevar a la etapa elevada la economia nacional en su conjunto consolidando la victoria lograda en el ano pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"!Impulsemos el avance victorioso del socialismo por la gran fuerza motriz que es la capacidad de fortalecernos con nuestros propios medios!\", esto es la consigna combativa a ser levantada este ano en la marcha del Ano Nuevo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe librar con dinamismo la ofensiva de todo el pueblo para conquistar las metas de la estrategia quinquenal con el poderio de autofortalecimiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la rama de ciencias y tecnicas, se debe esforzarse principalmente por resolver los problemas cientifico-tecnicos, que se presentan en la modernizacion de las fabricas y empresas y en la normalizacion de la produccion, dando enfoque a asegurar con recursos nacionales las materias primas, combustibles y equipos necesarios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben ser abanderadas las industrias electrica, metalurgica y quimica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLes corresponde a los dominios de industria carbonifera y transporte ferroviario cubrir con preferencia las demandas de carbon y transporte de las plantas de generacion electrica y las fabricas metalurgicas y quimicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario desarrollar cuanto antes la industria de maquinaria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe desarrollar trascendentalmente la industria ligera, la agricultura y la pesqueria para el mayor avance en el mejoramiento de la vida poblacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el sector de construccion, hay que terminar en el maximo nivel la construccion de la avenida Ryomyong, concentrar las fuerzas en las obras importantes y levantar mucho mas establecimientos docentes y culturales y viviendas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los dominios y unidades de la economia nacional, deben dinamizar la campana para aumentar al maximo la produccion y ahorrar lo todo bajo la consigna de autoconfianza y autoabastecimiento y cumplir en todos los indices el plan de este ano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el pais debe incorporarse a la administracion del territorio nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que adelantar la construccion de potencia civilizada al registrar nuevo auge revolucionario en todos los planos de la cultura, incluso la educacion, salud publica, deporte, literatura y arte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta imprescindible consolidar firmemente la base politico-militar del socialismo como baluarte inquebrantable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los militares y habitantes deben luchar tenazmente por la prosperidad de la patria, unidos firmemente en lo ideologico y en lo moral en torno al Partido manteniendo relaciones consanguineas con esta organizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHan de frustrar rotundamente las sucias y brutales maniobras de los enemigos encaminadas a socavar la fidelidad inmaculada del pueblo al Partido y separar a ambos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imperioso librar una fuerte campana para consolidar las fuerzas armadas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Maximo Dirigente dijo que la victoria o el fracaso de la campana de este ano por materializar la resolucion del VII Congreso del PTC depende del papel de las organizaciones del Partido y las de entidades de masas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecifico que todas las organizaciones primarias del Partido deben hacer reinar el temperamento de la innovacion continua y el avance continuo en la ofensiva general de todo el pueblo de este ano materializando el espiritu principal de la Primera Conferencia de los Presidentes de Comite de Base del Partido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que abrir la amplia via de reunificacion independiente con las fuerzas unidas de toda la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben tomar medidas activas para mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas y eliminar el agudo choque militar y el peligro de guerra entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToda la nacion coreana del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar tiene que solidarizarse y unirse en el principio de sujetar lo todo a la reunificacion de la patria, causa comun de la nacion, y activar el movimiento por la reunificacion en escala pannacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas deben frustrar los desafios de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion internas y externas que nadan a contrapelo de la aspiracion nacional a la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. y sus satelites mantengan la amenaza y chantaje nucleares y no cesen los ejercicios de guerra que se libran en nuestra cara bajo el pretexto de \"anuales\", la RPDC seguira incrementando la capacidad de autodefensa con las fuerzas armadas nucleares como eje y la de ataque preventivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC defendera con las fuerzas propias la paz y seguridad del Estado y contribuira mucho a defender la paz y la estabilidad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el futuro tambien, El PTC y el gobierno de la Republica seran fieles al ideal de su politica exterior de independencia, paz y amistad, ampliaran y desarrollaran las relaciones de buena vecindad, amistad y cooperacion con los paises defensores de la independencia y se esforzaran junto con ellos por establecer la verdadera justicia internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un subrayo que trabajara con abnegacion para que no se quede como un momento de la historia, sino se convierta en realidad de hoy aquella epoca en que todo el pueblo entonaba la cancion \"No envidiamos nada a nadie en el mundo\" confiando en el Presidente Kim Il Sung y el Dirigente Kim Jong Il y viviendo con el optimismo de su futuro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la primera manana del Ano Nuevo prometio solemnemente que sera el servidor verdadero que trabaje para el pueblo con la fidelidad y el alma casta."
