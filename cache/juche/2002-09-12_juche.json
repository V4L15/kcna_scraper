In actuality, however, it is trying hard to confine the north and the south to general exchange and keep them from facilitating main issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is invoking the U.S.-south Korea \"mutual defense treaty\" for keeping its troops in south Korea. But it, contrary to the Korean Armistice Agreement, which stipulates the withdrawal of foreign troops from Korea, and international law, can never be justified.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its hostile policy towards DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 12 (KCNA) -- U.S. high-ranking authorities are now foolishly calling for sanctions against the DPRK while raising a hue and cry over its nuclear and missile development and export and threats from it. This is aimed to achieve its purpose of blockading and strangling the DPRK and monopolizing missiles. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the true intention of the U.S. bellicose forces to disarm those countries which incur the displeasure of the U.S. and have an unchallenged nuclear and missile edge over them. It is also designed to use those weapons to bring other countries to their knees and put the world under its tyrannical rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. evermore loud-mouthed \"missile threat\" from someone would only more glaringly reveal its brazen-faced nature as the chief criminal posing a missile threat to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. call for imposing sanctions against the DPRK only discloses its weakness. If the U.S. continues pursuing the hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, it will react to it with a tougher stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the Juche-oriented mode of retaliation and its dignified principle of independent activities to cross swords or exchange rice cakes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. clings to its hostile policy toward the DPRK in utter disregard of the changing international situation, it will do it nothing good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. ruling quarters are well advised to give up its improper attitude toward the DPRK, deeply pondering over the historical mistakes they have committed by pursuing the hostile policy toward it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
