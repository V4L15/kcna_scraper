Yet, she kowtowed to him repeatedly, expressing gratitude. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Guidance Bureau for the Preservation of National Heritages said in a statement on Thursday that the Park group's act of abusing national historical treasures for confrontation with fellow countrymen is unpardonable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group was so hell-bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen and sycophantic and traitorous acts that it malignantly hurled mud at compatriots, floating the story about \"the north's plunder of treasures\" despite the fact that even their U.S. master admitted that the treasures were taken away by the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable insult and mockery of the inviolable national cultural treasures and an unpardonable provocation to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nine pieces of cultural treasures south Korea received from Obama recently including the \"most valuable treasure of the emperor\" and state seal and stamps dating back to the Korean Feudal Dynasty are just part of many cultural treasures looted by the U.S. imperialist aggressors. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. was obliged to make an apology to the Korean nation for its brigandish and illegal plunder of cultural treasures and return all of them to it, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Park Geun Hye let pro-U.S. stooges of Chongwadae shamelessly claim that \"those treasures were looted by the north\".
