            "content": "KCNA ridicules remarks of U.S. ambassador to Japan \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- U.S. ambassador to Japan Baker said that \"Japan may be required to review its constitution in the near future as it proceeds with technology development with the United States on a Theater Missile Defense system (TMD) and participates in international peace-keeping operations.\" He added that \"the reality of circumstance in the world is going to suggest to the Japanese that they reinterpret or redefine article 9 of their constitution.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Baker's remarks betray the U.S. political ambition to get Japan reexamined article 9 of the present Japanese constitution in a bid to use Japan as a legitimate \"shock brigade\" for the execution of the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy and, at the same time, arouse the international community's strong suspicion about the political entity of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His utterances raise a fundamental question as to whether Japan's claim that it is a \"normal state\" means an independent and sovereign state aspiring after peace or a \"state\" so subject to the U.S. that it depends on the latter how to deal with the constitutional issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As recorded in the history of the 20th century, after its defeat in the war a constitution was instituted in Japan under the control and manipulation by the commander of the U.S. occupation forces and this has served as a legal basis of the state.  Subject to the U.S. politically and militarily, Japan is keen to become a \"leader of Asia\" again with its backing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is participating in the moves to establish the  TMD to increase its military potential and escalating the dispatch of its armed forces overseas under the pretext of \"international peace-keeping activities\". All this is aimed to realize its design for reinvasion of Asia under the U.S. patronage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese constitution remains the last stumbling block in the way of putting such design for aggression and war into practice. However, Japan's ambition is not enough to carry out the constitutional revision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has recently begun undisguisedly interfering in the issue of Japanese constitutional revision in a bid to instigate the Japanese reactionaries to push it forward, prompted by the master-servant relations between Washington and Tokyo for world supremacy and Asian aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Baker added: \"I'm not trying to tell them what they should do.\" His words, however, are no more than American style hypocrisy. All facts go to eloquently prove that Japan is an abnormal state which remains subject to the U.S., and a war criminal state which has not reflected on its wrongdoings, as it was more than 50 years back when it was defined as an \"enemy state.\"    \r\n\r\n"

An intercontinental ballistic missile launched from Vandenberg air force base in California was struck by an interceptor missile launched from Kwajalein atoll of the Marshall islands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The test, the first missile interceptor test since the emergence of the Bush administration, proves that the controversial \"Missile Defence\" system (MD) has, in fact, entered the phase of full-dress establishment. A new global arms race has, therefore, become unavoidable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent moves to establish the MD despite the unanimous domestic and foreign concern and protest is aimed to contain other big powers politically and militarily and establish its sphere of unchallenged domination over them in the 21st century and seek a way out of its domestic economic crisis in arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is citing the non-existent \"Missile Threat\" from the DPRK in order to cover up its true colours. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is compelled to take a counter-action for self-defence by the U.S. deliberate provocation made to it in a bid to attain its sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will have nothing to lose even if all the points agreed upon between the DPRK and the U.S. are scrapped.    \r\n\r\n"
