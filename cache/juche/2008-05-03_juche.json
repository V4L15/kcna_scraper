            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Junkets to U.S. and Japan under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- Lee Myung Bak's recent junkets to the U.S. and Japan were humiliating sycophantic and treacherous ones. He sold off the dignity and interests of the nation and made south Korea increasingly dependent upon the U.S. They were, at the same time, shameful junkets as he cried out for confrontation with the DPRK and war against it, zealously supporting the U.S. in its anti-DPRK racket and moves to invade it and disgraceful visits as he behaved despicably as a colonial stooge, bringing shame to the nation. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a news analyst's article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his visit to the U.S. Lee talked about the \"three principles of the south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and asked his American master to observe them. While visiting Japan, he sought the triangular military alliance, vociferating about \"tightened relations\" among the U.S., Japan and south Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said facts prove that traitor Lee's recent visits were extremely dangerous ones during which he committed himself to increase south Korea's political and military dependence upon the U.S. and undertake a more important duty in carrying out the U.S. world strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the economic field, too, Lee, when addressing a \"briefing on investment,\" called for massively introducing U.S. monopoly capital into south Korea and begged for an early ratification of \"FTA\" in a bid to leave all the south Korean markets to the tender mercy of his American master.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the above-said foreign trips Lee was increasingly assertive that the north should \"dismantle its nukes first\" and was so impudent as to meddle in the DPRK-U.S. nuclear negotiations, clamoring for a \"thorough declaration\" and \"verification.\" \r\n What is more intolerable is that he touted the extremely provocative watchword of \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" which had been rebuffed by the nation for being unrealistic and unreasonable, begging his masters to support it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is another intolerable provocation to the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The brazen-faced diplomacy conducted by Lee is to justify the above-said watchword by enlisting support from his masters and intensify his anti-DPRK smear campaign by pushing forward it under the signboard of \"policy toward the north.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLee proposed to set up the \"north-south liaison office\", a leftover of the era of the Cold War confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a ridiculous farce intended to escape bitter criticism of the anti-north confrontation policy at home and abroad, shirk the responsibility for having bedeviled the inter-Korean ties and pretend to be interested in dialogue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous that during his recent junkets Lee talked about \"threat from the north.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n He talked nonsense that both the south and the north should change. This was nothing but a revelation of his ulterior intention to deny the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and bring the inter-Korean ties back to the era of confrontation as it was aimed at dampening the desire for alliance with the north and reunification growing strong in south Korea, fostering pro-Americanism and bitterness towards the north and reducing all Koreans to playthings of outsiders.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Lee's recent visits were humiliating ones as they brought to light the true colors of the stooge disgustingly kowtowing to his U.S. and Japanese masters, after discarding even a shred of national soul and dignity.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring his recent junkets to the above-said two countries Lee promised to offer everything to his American and Japanese masters, kowtowing to and pleasing them to the disgust of everyone, but  he gained nothing but the ill-fame of being a meritorious subject to the U.S. and Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee's recent visits saliently revealed that the \"pragmatic diplomacy\" much touted by him is nothing but diplomacy for treachery and national ruin as it is aimed at making the nation a scapegoat of foreign forces and realizing his dirty political ambition.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The outcome of Lee's trips to the U.S. and Japan presage the ordeals and catastrophe which south Korea and the inter-Korean relations have to encounter.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon Lee's acts of treachery but will take thorough stock of them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nLee will be held fully accountable for the serious consequences to be entailed by his thrice-cursed acts of treachery and will not be able to escape a stern judgment of the nation.\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Warhawks' Reckless Arms Buildup Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland vehemently denounces the south Korean warlike forces' reckless arms buildup as an outright challenge to the desire and wishes of all Koreans and the world peace-loving people for the peace and reunification of Korea and an act of treachery to stem the trend of the history of the Korean nation toward independent reunification, peace and prosperity. The Secretariat declares this in an information bulletin issued Friday as regards the south Korean warhawks' projected madcap shipment of ultra-modern war means to mount a preemptive strike at the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The information bulletin goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shortly ago, the Lee Myung Bak bellicose regime at a meeting of the Defence Promotion Committee decided to additionally introduce 21 F-15Ks and hundreds of the latest air-to-ground cruise missiles to go with them from the U.S. in the period from 2010 to 2012.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also mulling introducing fighters of the fifth generation equipped with Stealth function in the wake of the projected introduction of F-15Ks and technology related to the establishment of Patriot missile defence system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military warhawks' decision to introduce the above-said war hardware in the wake of outbursts calling for a preemptive strike at the DPRK goes to prove that their scenario for a \"preemptive attack\" is being put into practice as it is an intolerable treacherous act of pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a dangerous phase of war and wrecking peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will strongly counter the U.S. and Lee Myung Bak group's provocative arms buildup and moves to invade the DPRK with the building of more powerful war deterrent.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean warlike regime should stop their rash acts, pondering over the serious impact their arms buildup and the moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK will have on the development of the inter-Korean relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present grim reality eloquently proves how just the DPRK was when it asserted that if the Grand National Party comes to power, the June 15 declaration will be reduced to a dead paper and the whole Korean territory will be engulfed in the flames of war.\r\n"

Lee imploro a su amo el apoyo a los \"tres principios de la alianza surcoreana-estadounidense\" y en Japon busco estructurar la alianza militar tripartita hablando del \"estrechamiento de las relaciones\" EE.UU., Japon y Sur de Corea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Esto demuestra que tal visita del traidor Lee fue una peligrosisima actividad que fortalecio la subyugacion politico-militar del Sur de Corea a EE.UU. y que prometio encargarse de la mision mas importante en el cumplimiento de la estrategia mundial del imperio.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n En lo economico Lee se presento en el \"foro de explicacion de inversion\" donde actuo freneticamente para introducir en gran escala en el Sur de Corea el capital monopolista de EE.UU. y entregar por entero a su amo el mercado surcoreano pidiendole la ratificacion pronta del \"Convenio de  comercio libre\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tambien Lee hablo mucho de la \"teoria de renuncia nuclear, primero\", la \"declaracion estricta\" y \"verificacion\" interviniendo insolentemente hasta en las negociaciones nucleares RPDC-EE.UU.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Para colmo, Lee volvio a divulgar la teoria de \"desnuclearizacion, apertura y 3,000 dolares\" de caracter muy provocativo que por su irrealidad e injusteza fue rechazada por la nacion, e imploro el apoyo de su amo al respecto.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Esto es una provocacion intolerable a la RPDC.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Lo hizo descaradamente para justificar tal teoria e intensificar la conspiracion anti-RPDC portandola  a toda costa como \"politica para con el Norte de Corea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Lee volvio a presentar la proposicion de instalar la \"oficina de enlace Norte-Sur\" que es la caduca remanencia de la epoca de confrontacion de \"Guerra Fria\". Escenifica tal farsa irrisoria para evitar la lluvia de censuras del interior y exterior sobre la politica de confrontacion contra el Norte, eludir su responsabilidad por el empeoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur y fingir tener interes en el dialogo.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Absurdamente Lee hablo del \"chantaje del Norte\" durante su visita a ambos paises.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Charlataneo que tanto el Sur como el Norte deben cambiarse y revelo su designio de hacer desaparecer la tendencia de reunificacion de alianza con el Norte reinante en el Sur de Corea, seguir sirviendo a EE.UU. oponiendose al Norte y entregar toda la nacion coreana como regateo de las fuerzas extranjeras para negar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre y hacer retornar las relaciones Norte-Sur a la epoca de confrontacion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La reciente visita de Lee fue la visita ignominiosa que revelo la abominable fisonomia de lacayo adulador a sus amos norteamericano y japones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Esta vez Lee hizo todo lo posible para halagar a sus amos satisfaciendo las demandas de estos, pero lo que consiguio es solo el titulo de meritorio sujeto proyanqui y projapones.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@En la reciente visita se puso al desnudo que la \"diplomacia pragmatica\" de que habla tanto Lee es la diplomacia vendepatria y traidora encaminada a saciar su sucia ambicion politica haciendo de la nacion una inmolacion de las fuerzas extranjeras.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@El resultado del viaje de Lee por EE.UU. y Japon presagia el infortunio y la desgracia para el Sur de Corea y las relaciones Norte-Sur.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La nacion coreana no tolerara jamas el acto criminal antinacional de Lee y ajustara cuenta  estricta de el.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Lee asumira la entera responsabilidad de las graves consecuencias que emanen de sus perversos  actos traidores y sera castigado severamente por parte de la nacion.\r\n"
