            "content": "KCNA demands halt to Ulji Focus Lens joint military maneuvers\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 20 (KCNA) -- The Ulji Focus Lens joint military maneuvers will be staged in south Korea from August 19 to 30, according to a radio report from Seoul.\r\n Involved in the maneuvers are most of the U.S. Forces present in south Korea and those in Japan, Guam and the U.S. mainland as well as the south Korean army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a dangerous war exercise as it is intended to examine all the preparations for a war against the DPRK and work out a final timetable to make a preemptive attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also an unpardonable criminal act to vitiate a positive atmosphere of dialogues between the DPRK and the U.S. and between the north and south of Korea arranged with much effort and strain again the military situation on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While talking about dialogue with the DPRK, the United States is staging a large-scale war exercise that is incompatible with dialogue. This compels the DPRK to doubt the U.S. will for dialogue and interpret its call for dialogue as a figleaf to cover up its moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is making foolish attempts to contain the DPRK by force of arms behind the curtain of the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, indifferent to it. But this is an anachronistic day-dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the south Korean hawkish forces are taking part in the war maneuvers by taking advantage of the U.S. belligerent forces' invariable hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the inter-Korean relations have been put on the orbit of reconciliation and cooperation with the recent 7th inter-Korean ministerial talks and the August 15 meeting for national reunification as a momentum. The talks between the military authorities of the north and the south were recommended to guarantee peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, the south Korean hawkish forces are staging the war maneuvers targeted against the north, swimming against the trend of the times. This throws a wet blanket over all the dialogues between the north and the south including the proposed talks between the military authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that their intentional and deliberate war exercise will neither seriously affect the projected multi-channel inter-Korean talks nor entail grave consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north wants dialogue for reconciliation and unity between the north and the south but does not beg the belligerent forces for dialogue nor is it afraid of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean hawkish forces keep threatening the DPRK by force of arms. This reality clearly shows how just the DPRK was when it built the revolutionary armed forces equipped with a powerful offensive and defensive means capable of defeating any enemy at a single blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean belligerent forces should not act rashly but stop the reckless war maneuvers against the DPRK at once, properly understanding the faith of the people and army of Korea in certain victory and their steadfast will.    \r\n\r\n"

But it is an open secret that the military drill, an annual event, is mainly targeted against the DPRK as was the case with all other maneuvres staged in south Korea earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An atmosphere of reconciliation, cooperation and dialogue prevails between the north and the south and the overall process of dialogue is making progress to solve the Korean issue thanks to the good faith and magnanimity on the part of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military exercise launched by the U.S. against this backdrop clearly proves that the U.S. is, in fact, leaving no means untried to chill the Koreans' desire for reconciliation and unity between the north and the south and scuttle the process of dialogue, while paying lip-service to the inter-Korean dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to behave itself, pondering over the consequences to be entailed by its reckless actions.    \r\n\r\n"
