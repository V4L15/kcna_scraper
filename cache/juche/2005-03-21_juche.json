            "content": "New Self-running Waterways Appear in Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- Self-running waterways extending more than 280 kms have been built in the DPRK in the last couple of years.\r\n The construction of these waterways which run from rivers and reservoirs to fields of co-op farms has made it possible to water 17,000 hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields without using hundreds of pumping facilities which had been used for irrigation systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In South Hamgyong Province there appeared such-type waterways extending over 88 kms, among them Pochon First-stage Waterway in Pukchong County, Kosochon Waterway and Jungjangchon Waterway in Toksong County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Phyongan Province has sped up the building branches of Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway. Meanwhile, it has finished the projects for Sinhung and Rimsong branch waterways in Jungsan County and waterways in Songdok-ri, Kumphung-ri, Komsan-ri and other areas of Sukchon County in a matter of several months since their start in the last fall. This resulted in the formation of more than 56 km-long waterway across the province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In North Hwanghae Province over 40km-long self-running waterways have made their appearance to irrigate thousands of hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields. Typical of them are Kangan-ri branch waterway No.6 in Unpha County and Haepho branch waterway in Singye County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Hwanghae Province has built over 40 km-long self-running waterways in a matter of two or three years to water over 3,000 hectares of fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar successes in the construction of those types of waterways have been reported from Kusong City, Unjon and Thaechon counties and other rural areas of North Phyongan Province, the suburbs of Pyongyang, Kangwon Province and North Hamgyong Province. This has laid a foundation for watering vast areas of cultivated land without using pumping equipment.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK government has shown its utmost sincerity and magnanimity in the efforts to settle the issue and handed over the remains of Megumi Yokota to the Japanese side at its request. The Japanese ultra right-wing conservative forces, however, cooked up the story about \"false remains,\" challenging the DPRK's sincerity and humanitarianism, in a bid to use it as leverage for its anti-DPRK propaganda and sanctions against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned racket kicked up the Japanese reactionaries is a dangerous move to strain the relations between the DPRK and Japan to an extreme pitch and drive it to a military conflict. The DPRK government has already warned Japan that the DPRK would regard its application of sanctions against it as a declaration of a war. Such stand of the DPRK reflects the will of its army and people not to pardon any infringement upon the national dignity and sovereignty of the country. If the Japanese reactionaries infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, under the pretext of \"people's sentiment\", the army and people of the DPRK will never miss the chance to fully settle accounts with Japan, the sworn enemy of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will strongly react to Japan's ruckus for sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Riff-raffs such as those of the Society of Families of Abductees and the Rescue Society have been busy after working out a plan to hold a large people's rally demanding those economic sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior aim sought by the ultra-right forces of Japan in these moves is to put their plan to apply economic sanctions against the DPRK into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have incited confrontation with the DPRK calling for applying sanctions and totally negated the sincere efforts so far made by the DPRK to confirm the whereabouts of those Japanese whose fate Japan claimed as unknown and the results of such activities. Moreover, Japan suspended the humanitarian aid to the DPRK it had already promised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, a wicked assailant, is now kicking up a row after falsifying the truth and painting itself as a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the issue of \"a few victims of abduction,\" it occurred quite contrary to the will of Koreans against the background of the acute hostile relations between the two countries, a product of Japan's persistent hostile policy towards the DPRK. This is something negligible when compared with the untold misfortune, pain and disasters Japan inflicted upon the Koreans in the past.  Even this issue has already found a solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes Japan committed against the Koreans are a historical pending issue and the most outstanding political issue that await an immediate settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be desirable for Japan to admit its brazen-faced approach towards the abduction issue and feel greatly ashamed of it in face of the international community, though belatedly as it has been so busy spreading the story to kick up a racket for confrontation with the DPRK and for sanctions against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But no one can vouch what sort of other case the Japanese reactionaries will fabricate to renew the campaign over the \"abduction issue\" in a bid to deter the bilateral relations from improving and actively involve themselves in the regional issues politically and militarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community will closely follow up Japan's future attitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
