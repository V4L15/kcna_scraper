Korean Regime Worst Human Rights Abuser\r\n Pyongyang, December 26 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Council for Human Rights in South Korea Saturday released an inquiry report dealing with the human rights abuses committed by the present south Korean conservative forces in 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the report, the pro-U.S. conservative regime of south Korea committed the worst crimes, pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' moves for igniting a bio-chemical war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It continues:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. opened to public the introduction of anthrax germs into its military bases in south Korea on May 27, the south Korean regime was busy seeking a loophole only by feigning ignorance of the relevant information.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pro-U.S. conservative regime was so shameless as to assert that the north has anthrax and pest germs and may use them for terrorist acts and all-out war. This was to justify the crimes the regime committed for carrying out the U.S. scenario for a bio-chemical war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruling south Korean conservatives have kicked up the spiraling racket of human rights abuses the year round through the whirlwind of eliminating the \"followers of the north\", being hell-bent on confrontation with compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the case of knife attack on the U.S. ambassador occurred in Seoul on March 5, the conservative regime groundlessly linked the case with the DPRK, not content with describing the just action of the attacker an \"act of terrorism\". The case led to a wholesale racket of eliminating the \"forces following the north\", a \"witch-hunt\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The racket reached an extreme phase recently, as evidenced by the brutal suppression of the public campaign opposing the regime's plan to introduce \"state-compiled\" textbooks and unpopular rule and demanding democracy and right to existence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Supreme Court decided on closing the progressive internet newspaper Jaju Minbo in February.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime also let the riot police blast water cannon and poisonous tear liquid against peaceful demonstrators to disperse them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The water cannon used by the police against peaceful citizens on April 18 and 24 and May 1 amounted to over 79,000 litres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inquiry report said that the south Korean authorities, in disregard of the people's life and health, failed to take proper preventive measures against epidemics, throwing the whole land of south Korea into appalling confusion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t MERS, which broke out on May 20 by a south Korean who visited a Mid-east country, left 95 people infected, 7 dead and at least 2,890 quarantined as of June 8. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the irresponsible and careless attitude of the south Korean authorities, the infection lasted for more than 200 days, infecting 186 people, killing 38 and quarantining at least 16,000. Even now respiratory diseases of unknown causes spread in south Korea, increasing social instability and horror. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities obsessed with confrontation with the fellow countrymen abducted residents of the north, detained and forced them into \"defection\", separating them from their families against their will. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing materials disclosing the uproar of unemployment killing working masses, shocking cases of maltreating children, human rights abuses in the south Korean mercenary army and \"anti-north human rights\" racket, the inquiry report went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2015 the south Korean conservative ruling quarters committed human rights abuses in an organized, systemic and indiscriminate way. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the international community branded south Korea as \"the worst tundra of human rights on the globe.\""

Tambien hoy en dia se aumentan la inquietud social y el pavor debido a que se propagan sin parar las enfermedades de aparatos respiratorios cuyo origen es desconocido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas, enloquecidas por la confrontacion fratricida, cometen sin vacilacion alguna los crimenes antieticos y anti-DDHH de destruir las familias  armoniosas y separar a fuerza sus parientes mediante la seduccion, el rapto, la retencion forzosa y la coaccion de \"sumision\" a los habitantes de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa informacion revela con datos los crimenes de violacion de DDHH de las fuerzas conservadoras en el poder incluyendo el gran disturbio de desempleados, el espantoso maltrato infantil, la violacion de derechos humanos en el interior del ejercito mercenario colonial y la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de los criminales de DDHH, y prosigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi, los actos violadores de DDHH se cometieron organizativa, sistematica y desesperadamente este ano en el territorio surcoreano por las fuerzas conservadoras en el poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy natural que la sociedad internacional califique el suelo surcoreano de \"infierno de DDHH mas horrible de este planeta\"."
