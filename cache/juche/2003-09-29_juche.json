It stressed that when the U.S. signs a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK and withdraws its armed forces from south Korea, it is possible to denuclearize the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is good to see the hostile relations between the two countries terminated and diplomatic relations established between them. But even if this does not happen the DPRK has no reason to worry about it. The Japanese ruling quarters should know well that the normalization of the relations between the two countries can by no means serve the purpose of meeting their political interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that the Japanese government insists on the issue of abduction as its main policy regarding its diplomacy towards the DPRK and as a precondition for the normalization of DPRK-Japan relations goes to prove that Japan is not interested in the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and, on the contrary, regards it troublesome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's violation of the declaration only pushes the bilateral relations to a grave phase of confrontation and jeopardizes peace and security in the region. This would be harmful to Japan, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better liquidate its crime-woven past as early as possible and stop employing a sleight of hand in dealing with the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should discard such wrong way of thinking as regarding the normalization of the bilateral relations as a \"benefit\" and \"present\" to be given to the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His outbursts, therefore, can not be construed otherwise than a desperate shrill cry of a psychopath on his death bed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rumsfeld whose political faith is to establish the U.S. style world order by strength is known to be a typical stupid man for professing \"neo-conservatism\" censured and mocked at worldwide. He is, therefore, not a guy who the DPRK can deal with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rumsfeld asserted with acrimony that one who does not follow the U.S. view on value can never coexist with it but must die. One can easily assess the political line of the Bush administration which includes such a dangerous international dictator as that guy &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the U.S.which has the right to judge the international justice, its sovereignty remains supreme and that of those countries challenging the U.S. view on value must be overthrown. This is what Rumsfeld, a principal proponent of the U.S. theory of neo-conservatism, advocates. He is cursed and hated worldwide for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy pursued by the U.S. neo-conservatives to hold hegemony over the world and steadily increase their unchallenged control over the international issues is rejected in different parts of the world for its reactionary and anachronistic nature. It is considered to be trash of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by the U.S. Iraq policy which has gone totally bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is true that the DPRK has economic difficulties. But that is attributable to the economic blockade and sanctions imposed by the U.S. pursuant to its decades-long hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These difficulties are temporary and there are ways to cross over them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has its socialist system of its own style chosen by its people themselves and a solid economic foundation and strong potentials they have created for scores of years with much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No smear campaign can ever keep the DPRK from going its own way with strong pluck and faith in sure victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
