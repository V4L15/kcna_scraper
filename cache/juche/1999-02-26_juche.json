Korea-Japan \"working-level negotiation\" denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 26 (KCNA) -- The South Korean rulers meekly accepted brigandish demands of the Japanese side for drastically reducing joint fishing waters at a \"working-level negotiation\" with the Japanese reactionaries which was recently held in Seoul as a follow-up of the \"fisheries pact.\"   Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean \"people's government\" puts its preceding dictators in the shade in selling the interests of the nation to the Japanese masters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Last year, the South Korean rulers signed the treacherous \"fisheries pact\" with Japan in return for \"promising cooperation\" in the anti-DPRK campaign and thus sold off the inviolable territory and territorial waters of the country.   Even according to conservative data, the South Korean fishermen have to suffer annual losses of 1,072.5 billion won under the \"pact.\"   The sycophantic attitude taken by the South Korean rulers at the recent \"working-level negotiation\" is a flagrant infringement upon the vital rights of local fishermen.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This misdeed glaringly reveals once again the sycophantic nature of the present South Korean rulers who are as treacherous as \"5 traitors of 1905.\"   They had better give up their servile flunkeyist and traitorous misbehaviour before facing stern punishment by history and people and rescind the treacherous \"pact\" at once.   The DPRK will never pardon the Japanese reactionaries who are depriving South Korean fishermen of their vital rights in conspiracy with pro-Japanese flunkeyists and traitors instead of liquidating the crimes committed against the Korean nation in the past. \r\n\r\n"

They said they wanted to \"make North Korea suffer from starvation for several years\" and that it would \"be better to destroy its system.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese utterances are not only a revelation of their sinister intention to stifle the DPRK which has suffered from the shortage of food caused by years of natural disasters but also a frontal challenge to food aid rendered by different countries and international organizations to it in the noble idea of humanitarianism.   We take a serious view of the fact that such remarks were made by young dietmen of the Liberal Democratic Party at a meeting of the \"crisis management project team\" and that the head of the organization is Fukushiro Nukaga, former director-general of the Defense Agency who took the lead in the anti-DPRK campaign over the \"DPRK's launch of an artificial satellite\" last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The rightwing reactionaries of the team are now getting overheated with the campaign to hurt the DPRK under the pretext of the  so-called \"missile threats\" from the DPRK. In fact, their outcries over \"threats,\" \"crisis\" and \"security\" are nothing but a smokescreen to cover up their ulterior intention.   What they truly seek is to disintegrate the DPRK from within, isolate and stifle it and pave a way for reinvasion of Korea at an early date.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is more glaringly evidenced by their provocative remarks that it would \"be better to destroy the system of North Korea.\"   All this goes to prove that \"improved relations between the DPRK and Japan,\" \"resumption of talks\" and \"humanitarian assistance\" clamored about by the Japanese government officials whenever an opportunity presented itself are nothing but a sheer lie and a wicked double-dealing tactics to deceive public opinion.   It also proves that the rightwing reactionary forces of Japan tainted with deep-rooted antagonism toward the DPRK are tenaciously trying to push the DPRK-Japan relations to the phase of confrontation of strength, military confrontation, and thus attain their design to stage a comeback to Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan must clearly know that its sustained hostile policy toward the DPRK and its pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to a showdown, military confrontation will only heighten stronger our hatred and the  spirit of revenging upon and annihilating the enemy a hundred and thousand fold. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
