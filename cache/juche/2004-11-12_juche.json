Unity and solidarity of all are the only way to victory, he stated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the end of the rally the protesters staged a demonstration with placards reading: \"Fight! Let us win the three rights of labor of public servants!\"  The public security authorities cracked down upon the demonstration of the unionists by mobilizing even a special police unit.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Myohyang in May Juche 36 (1947) and October 1949, he indicated the road to be taken by the Buddhists in the liberated country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When temples were destroyed and the believers' living was deteriorated during the three-year-long Korean War started by the U.S. imperialists, the President took steps to restore the ruined temples and stabilize their life even though the country's economic situation was difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met officials of the Korean Federation of Buddhists on several occasions and encouraged them to contribute to the patriotic cause of national reunification. And he paid deep attention to the believers, visiting the Pobun Temple in Mt. Ryongak, Chonju Temple in Yaksandongdae of Nyongbyon County, Kwanum Temple in Mt. Chonma, Songbul Temple in Mt.
