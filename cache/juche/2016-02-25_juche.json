Those who voted for Park, deceived by her commitments, are regretting their irresponsible behaviors. Even the conservative quarters which she regards as her support base are becoming increasingly critical of Chongwadae. However, the Park' group is making desperate efforts to prolong its remaining days by using repressive machines, instead of stepping down.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is sparking off the stronger protest among the south Korean people all out in the anti-\"government\" actions, spitting at Park, the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park has committed too many hideous crimes to enumerate for the past three years of her office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Every sin brings its punishment with it and a trouble should be rooted out as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not far off is the day when Park would meet a miserable end in face of the fierce struggle of the south Korean people to force her regime to pay for its crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how desperate the Park regime may become in its moves to stay in office, it can never escape the people's severe punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the strong demand of the nation that the Park regime be sternly punished for committing thrice-cursed crimes against the country and nation."
