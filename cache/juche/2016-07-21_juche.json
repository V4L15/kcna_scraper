What's more, the international \"cooperation\" which Park has touted so vociferously is now proving more bankrupt than ever before. This is a hard reality today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the recent trip of Park must be called the one to escape protest of the south Koreans angered by the humiliating decision to deploy THAAD and to evade public criticism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park roamed about abroad like a rabid dog while slandering her fellow countrymen after reducing south Korea to a mayhem. She is a trouble-maker and malignant tumor which all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad have to eliminate at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So pitiful is Park as she makes desperate efforts to do harm to her fellow countrymen, touring this or that country, being unaware of how much the international community snubs and rejects her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that Park who is finding herself in the abyss of ruin, being driven into a tight corner inside and outside, openly revealed her attempt at \"unification through absorption\" while making such remarks that \"unification is the way of recovering freedom and human rights of someone and a starting point in building a world without nuclear weapons\", being unaware of where she stands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the puppet group ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK with the backing of the U.S. while dreaming of \"achieving the unification of social systems\", we will mercilessly wipe out the provocateurs through a great and just war for reunification and achieve reunification of our own style. This is our firm stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the south Koreans today are strongly demanding Park step down as early as possible before the nation faces greater disaster, saying it is sickening to have just a glance at her.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What awaits Park adding to her high treasons is only a stern punishment by history, warned the statement."

But it can never cover up its true colors as a group of international terrorists and human rights abusers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely unpardonable is the hideous unethical and treacherous crime of the puppet group that is forcing their children to be separated from their parents against their will and seeking to make them fall victim to the farce of confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group has to immediately stop the unbearable mental and physical persecution of the woman citizens of the DPRK and cruel \"defection operation\" and send them back to the embrace of the DPRK unconditionally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will continue to press for proactive measures to roundly disclose the truth behind the group abduction committed by the puppet group and realize the repatriation of the abductees."

Esto es la realidad de hoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe hecho, la ultima visita al extranjero de Park debe ser calificada de huida para eludir las protestas y condenas de la opinion publica surcoreana, enojada por la humillante decision sobre el emplazamiento de THAAD en suelo surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa traidora, que convirtio el suelo surcoreano en un campo de danza macabra y calumnio en varios paises a la parte connacional, es rompecabezas y ente canceroso para todos los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar que deben eliminarla cuanto antes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs miserable la situacion de ella que no sabe que su conducta es ridiculizada y repudiada por la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas ridiculo del caso es que Park, quien se encuentra en la crisis de arruinamiento, haya expuesto publicamente su intento de \"unificacion mediante la fusion de regimenes\" disparateando que la unificacion es la \"via para recuperar la libertad y derechos humanos\" de alguien y el \"punto de partida de un mundo sin armas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC tiene la firme posicion de librar la justa guerra de reunificacion para aniquilar implacablemente a los provocadores y lograr a su manera la reunificacion, si los titeres surcoreanos desatan la guerra nuclear contra la RPDC bajo el amparo de EE.UU. y con la vana ilusion sobre la \"unificacion mediante la fusion de regimenes\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que la poblacion surcoreana reclamara la retirada pronta del abominable poder de Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe espera a la traidora, que abulta su expediente criminal, la severa sentencia de la historia."

            "content": "Camarilla de Park Geun-hye no puede ocultar la verdad de secuestro, insiste entidad norcoreana\r\nPyongyang, 21 de julio (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que los titeres surcoreanos mantienen apartadas a las ciudadanas norcoreanas, secuestradas forzadamente, con el pretexto de la \"seguridad personal\" de sus familiares, el portavoz del Comite de Medidas Emergentes para el Rescate a las Victimas de Secuestro Forzado de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 21 a la ACNC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, las entidades progresistas del Sur de Corea, incluso la Union de Abogados por una Sociedad Democratica, y una organizacion de los DDHH de la ONU pidieron la entrevista con las ciudadanas norcoreanas que fueron secuestradas en colectivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los titeres surcoreanos negaron esa peticion pretextando la \"seguridad personal\" de los familiares de victimas, y por otra parte, instigan a las escorias humanas a pronunciar disparate, segun el cual si se dan a la publicidad las \"mujeres que salieron voluntariamente del Norte (de Corea)\", se pondra en peligro la seguridad de sus familiares en el Norte. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una sofisteria para ocultar la verdad de su escalofriante crimen de rapto colectivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA peticion encarecida de los familiares de victimas, hemos exigido fuertemente en varias ocasiones a las autoridades surcoreanas que permitan el viaje de aquellos a Seul por via de Phanmunjom para encontrarse con sus hijas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora ellos solicitan reiteradamente el encuentro con sus hijas expresando gran indignacion de los titeres surcoreanos que siguen reteniendolas por la fuerza hablando de la \"fuga colectiva del Norte con la voluntad libre\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo obstante, los titeres surcoreanos ofenden a aquellos pretextando la \"seguridad personal\" que no pasa de ser un embuste barato para manchar la imagen de la muy digna RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los titeres surcoreanos no hubieran secuestrado a la fuerza a las ciudadanas norcoreanas, no tendrian la razon de no presentarlas todavia a mas de 3 meses del incidente ni negar la peticion de entrevista a puertas cerradas de las entidades internacionales de DDHH. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ha revelado a traves de la reciente conferencia de prensa con un lacayo del Servicio de Inteligencia del Sur de Corea, detenido por sus actos hostiles anti-RPDC, los titeres surcoreanos recurren a la campana intrigante anti-RPDC enganando a la opinion publica como si fueran \"fugitivos voluntarios\" los moradores norcoreanos secuestrados con engano y seduccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque los titeres surcoreanos pretextan la \"seguridad personal\" de los familiares de victimas a fin de justificar su crimen de tenerlas apartadas y encarceladas, no pueden ocultar nunca su asquerosa naturaleza de terroristas internacionales y criminales anti-DDHH. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imperdonable el crimen antietico y antinacional de la camarilla surcoreana que separa forzadamente a los padres y sus hijas y utiliza a estas en la intriga de enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos deben dejar de inmediato los insoportables maltratos mentales y fisicos y la operacion de \"sumision\" sobre las secuestradas y devolverlas sin falta a la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTomaremos de continuo las medidas para revelar la verdad del secuestro colectivo y lograr sin falta la devolucion de nuestras ciudadanas."
