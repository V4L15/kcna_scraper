            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Clarifies Stand on New Measure to Bolster War Deterrent \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 3 (KCNA) -- The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued the following statement Tuesday solemnly clarifying the DPRK stand on the new measure to be taken by it to bolster its war deterrent for self-defence:\r\n The U.S. daily increasing threat of a nuclear war and its vicious sanctions and pressure have caused a grave situation on the Korean Peninsula in which the supreme interests and security of our State are seriously infringed upon and the Korean nation stands at the crossroads of life and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. has become more frantic in its military exercises and arms build-up on the peninsula and in its vicinity for the purpose of launching the second Korean war since it made a de facto \"declaration of war\" against the DPRK through the recent brigandish adoption of a UNSC resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  At the same time it is making desperate efforts to internationalize the sanctions and blockade against the DPRK by leaving no dastardly means and methods untried in a foolish attempt to isolate and stifle it economically and bring down the socialist system chosen by its people themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The present Bush administration has gone the lengths of making ultimatum that it would punish the DPRK if it refuses to yield to the U.S. within the timetable set by it.\r\n Under the present situation in which the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK have reached the worst phase, going beyond the extremity, the DPRK can no longer remain an on-looker to the developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already declared that it would take all necessary countermeasures to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation from the Bush administration's vicious hostile actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Foreign Ministry is authorized to solemnly declare as follows in connection with the new measure to be taken to bolster the war deterrent for self-defence: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, the field of scientific research of the DPRK will in the future conduct a nuclear test under the condition where safety is firmly guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to pull out of the NPT as the present U.S. administration scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and seriously threatened the DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK officially announced that it manufactured up-to-date nuclear weapons after going through transparent legitimate processes to cope with the U.S. escalated threat of a nuclear war and sanctions and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The already declared possession of nuclear weapons presupposes the nuclear test. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. extreme threat of a nuclear war and sanctions and pressure compel the DPRK to conduct a nuclear test, an essential process for bolstering nuclear deterrent, as a corresponding measure for defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, the DPRK will never use nuclear weapons first but strictly prohibit any threat of nuclear weapons and nuclear transfer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A people without reliable war deterrent are bound to meet a tragic death and the sovereignty of their country is bound to be wantonly infringed upon. This is a bitter lesson taught by the bloodshed resulting from the law of the jungle in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nuclear weapons will serve as reliable war deterrent for protecting the supreme interests of the state and the security of the Korean nation from the U.S. threat of aggression and averting a new war and firmly safeguarding peace and stability on the Korean peninsula under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will always sincerely implement its international commitment in the field of nuclear non-proliferation as a responsible nuclear weapons state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, the DPRK will do its utmost to realize the denuclearization of the peninsula and give impetus to the world-wide nuclear disarmament and the ultimate elimination of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK has been exposed to the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail over the past more than half a century, it proposed the denuclearization of the peninsula before any others and has since made utmost efforts to that end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S., however, abused the idea of denuclearization set out by the DPRK for isolating and stifling the ideology and system chosen by its people, while systematically disregarding all its magnanimity and sincerity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultimate goal of the DPRK is not a \"denuclearization\" to be followed by its unilateral disarmament but one aimed at settling the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and removing the very source of all nuclear threats from the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in the principled stand of the DPRK to materialize the denuclearization of the peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will make positive efforts to denuclearize the peninsula its own way without fail despite all challenges and difficulties.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Human Rights Abuses Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 3 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, the second meeting of the UN Human Rights Council heard a report from the UN special rapporteur on racism and racial discrimination stripping bare Japan's human rights abuses and discussed it.\r\n Citing concrete facts, the special rapporteur testified that deep-rooted chauvinism and racial discrimination still remain in Japan and ascribed this to the biased historical view of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Minju Joson analyst Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ignoring facts, the representative of Japan at the meeting resorted to a hundred and one subterfuges, claiming shamelessly that it was a policy of Japan to respect all the foreigners and that, though there were some mistakes, they were being corrected, bringing considerable improvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the meeting sharply criticized Japan, expressing wrath at its brazen attempt to shift its crimes onto others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Representatives of Japanese non-governmental organizations present at the meeting also called on the countries participating in the meeting to continue to pressurize Japan to practically eradicate racial discrimination, not being hoodwinked by the Japanese government's lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan finds itself decried not only at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is branded as \"an evader of past crimes\" by its allies, too. To cite a graphic example, a draft resolution on the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army was submitted to the International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives and the committee adopted with unanimous approval the resolution urging Japan to admit its responsibility for the drafting of the \"comfort women\" and pay compensations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a deserved treatment of Japan, \"a political dwarf,\" which refuses even to honestly repent of its past crimes including extra-large crimes of human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can not evade greater disgrace, isolation and rejection in the international arena, unless it lends an ear to the demand of the times and makes an honest apology for its past crimes and settles them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 3 (KCNA) -- Results of the \"intermediate investigation\" were recently published by the Committee for Probing the Truth behind the Past History of the south Korean Police Office to disclose the truth about \"the case of the south Korean National Liberation Front\" and the \"case of the Association of the Protected\" in south Korea.\r\n The south Korean people have long staged vigorous actions in demand of the settlement of the past. As a result, there appeared mechanisms for probing truth about past crimes at the Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Defence, the Ministry of Justice and the Police Office in August two years ago to start the investigation into the cases that had long been shrouded in mist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the end of the last year there began the disclosure of a series of the mysterious cases such as the \"case of the People's Revolutionary Party\", the \"case of the National Democratic Youths and Students League\" and the \"East Berlin case\" the clarification of which had been urged by the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today in a commentary says that the recent disclosure of the truth behind the above-said cases were the result of the struggle waged by the south Korean people to liquidate the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Grand National Party\" in south Korea is a group of man- killers whose predecessors were Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee who orchestrated such anti-communist dramas as the above-said cases and sacrificed guiltless people for the upkeep of their power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the reason why the GNP gentry are so dead set against the liquidation of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is the aim sought by it. The GNP clan should not be allowed to come to power as they are groundlessly accusing the north and working hard to force people to fall victim to conspiratorial cases in a bid to gratify their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should wage a more dynamic struggle for the settlement of the past, a struggle to probe the truth about all the crimes perpetrated by the successive fascist ruling quarters, in combination with their actions for frustrating the bid of the GNP to seize power, urges the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, however, launched another orbiting solar observatory, rescinding the decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was intended to step up the conversion of the country into a military power under the cloak of \"scientific researches.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are whipping themselves into frenzy to realize in the new century at whatever cost their old dream of \"the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to carry into reality in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan does not hide the fact that the recent launch almost confirmed the technology of a rocket propelled by solid fuel. The solid fuelled rocket plays an important role in developing missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not much penetration is needed to guess what the launch of an orbiting solar observatory is aimed at, considering that this technology may be introduced into strike missiles in \"contingency\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries do not reflect at all on their own heedless act and ambition while raising terrific outcries over the normal missile launch exercises of our army for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is getting all the more unscrupulous in its inborn bad habit of trying to feather its own nest by hurling calumny at others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's frenzied launch of an orbiting solar observatory is a criminal act of gravely and apparently threatening peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Asia, being a link in the whole chain of its preparations for staging a comeback to this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persists in its madcap drive to turn itself into a military power and launch into aggression overseas, it will only lead it to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
