It is also a heinous treacherous crime to quell the ardent desire of the Korean nation for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south of Korea are the homogeneous nation with one and the same blood vessel, so the basic mode of settling the issue should be dialogue and negotiations, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation is aspiring after peace and peaceful reunification more than any others as it has been subject to constant danger of war, being divided into two parts at the hands of foreign forces.

The danger of a nuclear war on the peninsula is increasing to the extremes as the south Korean puppet forces have crafted the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" together with the U.S. and are applying it to the anti-DPRK joint military exercises under various codenames. They are unhesitatingly quenching the aspiration of the nation in disregard of the trend of the times for the sake of their ambition for escalating confrontation with the DPRK. Such reckless criminal racket is again plunging the inter-Korean relations into a deadlock and seriously threatening the peace and security on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that they are wantonly quelling the aspiration and desire of all Koreans for improving the inter-Korean relations and achieving the reunification of the country while going against the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should clearly understand that in case they go against the era and people's mindset, they will meet a miserable end."
