This is the lesson taught by the course of the six-party talks which repeated setbacks and failures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The proposal for concluding a peace agreement already advanced by the DPRK last year is the most effective step for confidence building as it helps wipe out the distrust between the DPRK and the U.S. and, furthermore, a powerful engine providing a guarantee for realizing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are convinced that to strive to conclude a peace agreement is a right orientation both in view of the special security situation on the peninsula and in the light of the defense of the regional peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula stipulated in the September 19, 2005 joint statement is a process of turning the whole peninsula into a nuclear-free zone on the basis of totally defusing the substantial nuclear threat to the peninsula from outside in a verifiable manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the main party responsible and capable of removing the root cause of the nuclear issue on the peninsula as it was spawned by the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear war threat to the DPRK from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is self-evident that to discuss the denuclearization issue in the absence of the main party concerned while distorting the essence of the issue would only lay an artificial hurdle in the way of  settling the issue and this cannot be a genuine dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities are, however, reacting to the sincere proposals of the DPRK on building confidence through dialogue and negotiations and its efforts to resume the six-party talks with confrontation moves and military provocations. Yet, they are spreading misinformation that the DPRK is to blame for the tensions and the failure to open dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the international community is unanimous in expressing deep concern over the tense situation on the peninsula, the joint military exercises being staged by them in south Korea with huge nuclear attack means involved cannot but be provocations and blatant provocations in view of their purpose and nature of coping with someone's \"contingency.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the present south Korean authorities came to power, the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration warmly hailed and supported by all the fellow countrymen and the international community was totally suspended, the inter-Korean relations were extremely deteriorated and an atmosphere of a war against fellow countrymen is running higher. All their hostile acts against the DPRK have recently gone beyond such tolerance limit that they went the lengths of perpetrating the hideous provocations: They hurt the dignity of the leadership of the DPRK and its inviolable system. All facts go to clearly prove who truly wants dialogue and peace and who incites confrontation and war atmosphere on the peninsula."
