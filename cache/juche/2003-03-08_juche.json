            "content": "KCNA refutes Bush's bellicose remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush Tuesday said in an interview with 14 newspapers from around the country that if the diplomatic effort fails to solve North Korea's \"nuclear issue,\" \"a military option is its last choice.\"\r\n  He referred to the \"military option\" again after he disclosed that the \"United States is keeping all options on the table in dealing with North Korea.\" It is a very dangerous war outcry driving the military situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war as it is an undisguised revelation of the U.S. intention to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK's nuclear facilities for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the U.S. much-publicized \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula is concerned, it can surely be solved if the U.S. has a will to settle it through dialogues and negotiations with the DPRK. \r\n By nature, the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" is a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK as it is a fiction Washington dreamed up in a bid to disarm Pyongyang and bring it to its knees by forcing it to scrap its nuclear program before dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In peddling the fiction about the DPRK's \"nuclear development\" the U.S. sought to contain the DPRK and bring it to collapse by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end the U.S. launched a large-scale \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercise in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-led joint military maneuvers are a replica of the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercise in view of their scale, nature, purpose and method of training and a test nuclear war, a preliminary war to seize the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This sabre rattling is under way at a time when the DPRK-U.S. confrontation is escalating and going beyond the danger line. This goes to prove that the scenario for a preemptive attack on the DPRK on Bush's table is being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's remarks on \"military option\" are little short of a signal to go into action against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that on-going large-scale military exercises will not go over to a nuclear war any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is following the dangerous military moves of the U.S. with a high degree of revolutionary vigilance and getting fully ready to go into action.\r\n The DPRK wants peace but never begs for it. It neither wants war nor avoids it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people and the people's army of the DPRK will react to the U.S. \"military option\" with a strong counteraction and counter an all-out war with an all-out war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. unleashes a war despite the DPRK's repeated warnings it will wipe out the aggressors to the last man by promptly using as many combat means as the U.S. mobilized. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. pulled out of the ABM treaty, opposed setting up an international criminal court, refused to implement the \"Kyoto Protocol\" for global environmental protection, etc. it is, therefore, giving rise to great concern in protecting the existence and security of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, the U.S. is going to launch at any cost a war against Iraq to which the world is opposed, causing a deep concern not only in the U.S. but among its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. moves to start a new war on the Korean Peninsula are arousing greater concern among the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. talk about \"international concern\" as part of its persistent anti-DPRK campaign is no more than a base subterfuge to charge it with \"nuclear weapons development\" under the signboard of \"global peace\" in a bid to invent a pretext for a preemptive strike at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. threatening the existence of humankind and the world peace with unilaterialism and arbitrariness in violation of justice and the principle of equality in the international relations will stand more bitterly condemned and rejected by the world people.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the June 15 Joint Declaration was adopted and the era of independent reunification has begun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad will work hard to accomplish the cause of national reunification under Kim Jong Il's steermanship and thus glorify dignity and honor of Kim Il Sung's nation.    \r\n\r\n"
