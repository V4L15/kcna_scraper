            "content": "Kim Jong Il receives letter from Ri In Mo \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il yesterday received a letter from Ri In Mo, incarnation of faith and will, on the occasion of the New Year.\r\n   The letter described the 1900s as a century of great change and victories and glory in which a history of faith and will unprecedented in the history of the Korean nation spanning 5000 years was made and the people, once trampled down, rose high in the centre of the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this century our people achieved the country's liberation with faith and will, humbled the arrogance of the U.S. imperialists for the first time in history and demonstrated the might and dignity of Juche Korea by overcoming manifold challenges of the imperialists and ordeals, the letter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our people stood up in the indomitable spirit which no other nations could ever possess in human history because they were fortunate enough to acclaim the peerlessly great three commanders of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   You praised me as a man of faith and will which I hardly deserved.  But the supreme incarnation of faith and will is precisely you, the illustrious commander, who defended our socialism as firm as an iron wall, standing singlehandedly against the imperialist allied forces of the world, and brought about a great turn in building a powerful nation, thus most brilliantly adorning the 1900s as a century for Kim Il Sung's Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Without you, how our people could stand up after the demise of President Kim Il Sung and greet with joy the New Year 2000 with confidence and optimism about future like today? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even though I am living in the twilight, I will always follow you with singlehearted loyalty and filial piety to the last moment of my life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unanimous are the ardent wishes of our people, who look up to and believe in you only in joy or sorrow or hardships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They pray for the longevity of you for a bright future of Kim Il Sung's Korea which will always stand as a powerful and prosperous nation.    \r\n\r\n"
