Korea\r\n Pyongyang, April 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean police has arrested students for staging demonstrations in demand of a legal action against Kim Young Sam, according to reports.\r\n   This is an unpardonable anti-national atrocity which is enraging all the fellow countrymen.\r\n   During his assumption of office, Kim Young Sam committed many heinous crimes against the nation and plunged South Korea into a financial crisis. Accordingly, he must be brought before court for stern judgement by the nation.\r\n   It is only too natural that South Korean students are staging demonstrations in demand of a legal action against Kim Young Sam after forming death-defying groups for arresting him.\r\n   Nevertheless, the puppet police of the present regime styling itself as a \"government for people\" is ruthlessly cracking down upon students' demonstration. This frantic crackdown means that the present regime is backing Kim Young Sam, keeping mum about his indelible crimes.\r\n   The South Korean puppets should stop the brutal suppression of students at once, clearly mindful that if they go against the will of the people, they cannot go scotfree.    \r\n\r\n"

It would not be good for the DPRK-U.S. dialogue if the United States keeps its troops in South Korea. \r\n   The United States should ponderover this.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

After the film show he analysed merits and demerits of the film, quoting dialogues of the film, before asking the diplomat to give his impressions of the film.\r\n   The diplomat said that the film well depicted  part of World War 11 which left 50 million people dead. General Kim Jong Il with a smile said that the number of the dead is not 50 million but 55 million to be exact, the number of the wounded is 90 million and two billion people of 60 countries participated in the war.\r\n\r\n   And he added data of the first world war in detail.\r\n   One day in late 1986, President Kim Il Sung asked officials how many U.S. troops participated in the \"Team Spirit\" nuclear war exercise which was staged every year from 1976. Nobody could tell the correct figure, but General Kim Jong Il answered the number of the U.S. troops who were mobilized in the annual exercise for 10 years.\r\n   The President was pleased with a light joke saying that there was everything in the \"store of knowledge\" of General Kim Jong Il and there may be a document on \"cat's horn\".\r\n   Boundless mental faculties of General Kim Jong Il come from his gifted memory.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
