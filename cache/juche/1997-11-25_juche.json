He has already been sentenced to death politically by the people. In addition, he was cold-shouldered by the \"presidential\" candidate of the ruling party appointed by him. He is now a \"lonely ruler\" and a living political corpse. Even if he can wind up his term of office, there is no guarantee for his \"security\" after his retirement. He knows well that the people will never pardon him, for he ruthlessly cracked down upon Hanchongryon and other patriotic democratic forces from the first days of his office.\r\n   This is why he seeks to spend his days safely after his retirement by emasculating Hanchongryon and other patriotic democratic forces when he is in power.\r\n   However, the Kim Young Sam group's brutal crackdown upon Hanchongryon will only precipitate their ruin rather than set them on their legs.    \r\n\r\n"

Command\" in south Korea and to withdraw the U.S. forces from there are basic requirements for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula, declares Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n   It is only too clear that if the tension is to be eased on the Korean Peninsula and peace is to be ensured there, it is imperative to dissolve the \"U.N. Command\", withdraw the U.S. troops, replace the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and establish a new peace-keeping system, the author of the article says, and continues:\r\n   The dissolution of the \"U.N. Command\" and withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea mean removing the hotbed of war from the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   Establishment of a new peace-keeping system will put an end to the state of hostilities between the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the United States and make a turning-point to ensure a lasting peace.\r\n   The 30th U.N. General Assembly Session adopted a resolution of our side and a U.S.-proposed resolution on dissolving the \"U.N. Command\" if conditions are created. \r\n   As the DPRK made a proposal for establishing a new peace mechanism, it can be said that full conditions called for by the United States have been created.\r\n   All pretexts used by the united states to justify the existence of the \"U.N. Command\" and the occupation of south Korea by its troops have gone out of existence.\r\n   In the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, the U.S. promised to make joint efforts for the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula and its peace and security.\r\n   What the U.S. must do now is to make a bold decision to disband the \"U.N. Command\" and withdraw its troops from south Korea rather than to try to trump up any excuse or pretext.\r\n   The United States must do things helpful toward the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula by putting the resolutions of the 30th U.N. General Assembly Session into practice.    \r\n\r\n"

The unconverted long-term prisoners should have already been sent back to the northern half of Korea at the time when POWS were exchanged with the cease-fire in Korea, they noted.\r\n   If the fascist regime refuses to send the unconverted long-term prisoners back to the northern half of Korea at an early date, it will be condemned and punished by the world people, they stressed.\r\n   Referring to the conversations with Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan on the phone they had in Moscow on November 20, Kim Jong Sim and Kim Ryong Je said that their fathers are fighting for the repatriation to the northern half of Korea, not yielding to the fascist suppression.\r\n   The meeting adopted appeals to the UN commission on human rights, international organisations of human rights and south Korean organisations for democracy and human rights and letters to the UN Secretary-General, the U.S. President and the U.S. Congress.\r\n   Discussed at the meeting was the orientation of the work of the measure committee.    \r\n\r\n"

He formed a group of lecturers with war veterans in November Juche 72 (1983), saying that if the veterans who distinguished themselves in the Fatherland Liberation War give lectures with their combat stories, they will be glad and the lecture will be more impressive. \r\n   \"Unless comrade Kim Jong Il had put forward war veterans, we would have already died or been sitting idle at home. We feel as if we had grown young thanks to him,\" said hero Kim Sang Hun on behalf of all the war veterans of Korea.\r\n   Foreign visitors envy them, saying that their lectures will be very valuable in the education of the younger generation.    \r\n\r\n"
