This changed situation compelled the Japanese authorities to set about the work for unearthing the remains and investigating the case. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBrutal mass killings including the experiments on human bodies perpetrated by the Imperial Japanese Army against Korean people and other Asian people in the past were unprecedentedly hideous crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's settlement of its past crimes is a legal and moral duty and a historical task whose fulfillment should neither be delayed nor dodged any longer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan should probe the truth behind such hidden crimes as the horrible experiments on human bodies committed by the unit, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities seem to persistently evade the settlement of the crimes, calculating that their past crimes will remain buried into oblivion and forgotten by people with the passage of time and the replacement of the old generation by a new one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is, however, a gross miscalculation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in the past will always remain recorded as crimes and they will snowball unless Japan goes on without settling its past crimes, warns the commentary."
