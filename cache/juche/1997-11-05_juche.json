Korean defector interviewed\r\n Pyongyang, November 5 (KCNA) -- South Korean Jong Min (46) met Korean and foreign reporters here today at which he said: the north is an authentic homeland of the Korean nation, which engages itself in politics, economy and culture in its own way.\r\n   A few days ago, he came over to the north from the south.\r\n   Before defecting to the north, he worked as a band singer, member of the council of the Ansan city, Kyonggi Province, sports association, member of the \"National Congress for New Politics\" and as a businessman.\r\n   He said:\r\n   \"On arriving in the north, I greeted a great event of electing the General Kim Jong Il as General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, the historic event in which the Korean nation has come to have the general as the recognised outstanding leader of the nation who will lead the destinies of the 70 million fellow countrymen and as the great sun of reunified country who will add lustre to the 21st century.\r\n   \"I have come over to the northern half of the country to live a true life under the socialist system in which the feelings and spirit peculiar to the nation are kept alive.\r\n   \"The south Korean society whose politics, economy, culture and morality have gone to ruin is doubtlessly part of our country. However, only foreign things do exist in the south.\r\n   \"The successive south Korean \"presidents\" after the country's liberation were all hunting dogs of the United States, butchers who killed fellow countrymen, swindlers who deceived the people and thieves who amassed only their wealth.\r\n   \"The north has preserved excellent traditions of the nation, not being affected by foreign fashions.\r\n   \"This is a result of the independent politics, the Korean-nation-first spirit of   President Kim Il Sung and the General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   \"It is none other than the general who defends our nation and country.\r\n   \"He is the destiny, reunification and future of our nation.\"\r\n   Referring to musical art in the south, Jong Min said that south Korea's music is a narcotic and venomous poison which mentally degenerates people and makes them mental fanatics.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a manifestation of its war policy to stifle the DPRK behind the curtain of dialogue, the paper says, and goes on:\r\n   The U.S. has promised not to make military threat and attack the DPRK and is conducting some contacts and negotiations with it.\r\n   But, the point at issue is that its hardline conservative forces are using this as a smokescreen to cover up their policy of stifling the DPRK, more frantically resorting to the way of strength. The \"Foal Eagle\" field training is part of their scheme.\r\n   And what cannot be overlooked is that the U.S. uses \"Foal Eagle\" as a way to fill up the blank caused by cancelled \"Team Spirit\" nuclear war exercises.\r\n   This is well illustrated by the fact that its warhawks have made the current \"Foal Eagle\" the largest-scale joint field training and converted it into prelimiary nuclear war by involving in it the forces who had participated in the \"Team Spirit\".\r\n   Such deeds prove that they do not want dialogue and peace.\r\n   We do not want a war but will not beg for peace.\r\n   We will take strong and merciless countermeasures to those who attempt to stifle the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. bellicose forces would be well advised to stop reckless military demonstration under our eyes.    \r\n \r\n"
