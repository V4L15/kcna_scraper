            "content": "DPRK FM Blasts Japan's Adoption of \"Amendment to Law on Foreign Exchange\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement today, denouncing the House of Representatives of Japan for passing the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" through the Diet on Jan. 29.\r\n The amendment stipulates that the remittance to the DPRK and trade with it shall be stopped when necessary and that Japan shall apply sanctions against the DPRK single-handed without any UN resolution or any international agreement under the pretext of \"ensuring peace and security of Japan\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing this as a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration in which both sides committed themselves to observe international law and not to do any act of threatening the security of the other side, the statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n World history never knows such an untrustworthy country as Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was only 16 months ago that Japan requested for Koreans' forgiveness, saying that \"the Japanese side admitted, in a spirit of humility, facts of history that Japan caused tremendous damage and sufferings to the Korean people through its colonial rule in the past and expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, it is now set to apply sanctions against the country that fell victim to it in the past with a dagger in hand. How can one understand this in a normal way of thinking although the Japanese-style ethics is so crafty? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to an unpredictable phase by legislating on economic sanctions against the DPRK as a state policy. \r\n Its move will not be confined to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This development will bring peace and stability in Northeast Asia to a catastrophic phase and further deteriorate the situation on the Korean peninsula that has grown tense due to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the US. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government and the ruling camp of Japan are expecting someone to make any concession, prattling that the adoption of this bill \"would deal an unimaginable economic and psychological blow at north Korea\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, is so foolish as to make such a serious miscalculation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has always considered its sovereignty as its life and soul throughout its history and does not know any precedent of abandoning its principle, yielding to others' pressure or allowing itself to be a slave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan expects the DPRK to cave in to the threat of such a war criminal state as Japan, everybody will have a good laugh over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As Japan sows so shall it reap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will not remain a passive onlooker to Japans act of seriously infringing upon its sovereignty and putting Tokyo's hostile policy into practice through economic sanctions and blockade while talking about its participation in the six-way talks, but take necessary counter-measures against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's mettle to return retaliation for retaliation and react against the hard-line policy with the toughest measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will be wholly responsible for all consequences to be entailed by its foolish moves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It deteriorated as the United States threatened the DPRK, a non-nuclear state, with nukes and attempted to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has delayed and obstructed the solution to the issue, insisting on its assertion that \"the DPRK should abandon its nuclear program first\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly stands for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue, it should not insist on its unreasonable assertion but accept the DPRK-proposed package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether the U.S. accepts the DPRK proposal or not is a touchstone showing whether it hopes for the peaceful solution to the nuclear issue or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should drop its double-dealing tactics and take an honest approach.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP Shows Signs of Ruin\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- One more scandal of the Grand National Party of south Korea has been brought to light some days ago. So Chong Won, former representative of the GNP, obtained a housing bond worth 1 billion won directly from the chairman of the Han Hwa Group.\r\n Now the GNP has no face to raise its head any longer and is seeking a loophole, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time the GNP politicians dropped ultra-right conservative ideas and such bad habits as extorting truck-loads of money, though they are left behind in civilization and enlightenment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismayed at the truth of illicit funds disclosed more glaringly day by day from the outset of the year, the GNP clan vociferated again about the outdated \"theory of political coloring\" and cried out for a \"constitutional reform\" and \"hearing on presidential election funds\" all of a sudden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is at the point of death for which it is entirely to blame. This situation was a result of its anti-popular policy, treacheries and sycophantic and submissive behavior. Such being a stark fact, the GNP politicians are well advised to understand their position and behave themselves with conscience before the public and the people, if they have an iota of reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Hong Sa Dok, chief for General Affairs of the GNP, hurled a string of vituperation at the chief executive's side in a bid to divert to it the public criticism focused on the party. Not content with this, he, a few days ago, went to the lengths of making reckless remarks that the \"foolish people\" wrongly chose the president at the last presidential election. This caused such a furor that \"petitions\" were submitted to accuse him. This indicates that the GNP's fate is at stake and this traitorous party has shown signs of ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From a historic and organizational point of view the GNP has no way to go any further and it is bound to go to doom for its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe GNP's destruction is unavoidable.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Warns against Japan's Moves for Overseas Aggression\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are now getting into full stride in their moves for overseas aggression, oblivious of the lesson of history.\r\n No sooner had the Japanese chief executive expressed his willingness on January 26 to dispatch a main unit of the \"Self-defence Forces\" to Iraq following an advance unit than Defense Agency Chief Ishiba ordered the main unit to Iraq. This gave the green light to military operations of a large unit of the SDF equipped with such heavy weapons as armored vehicles, recoilless artillery pieces and portable anti-tank bombs in combat areas overseas as a shock brigade of the U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that the Japanese reactionaries have shaken off the veil of the \"UN peace-keeping operations\" they had been wearing and opened up a prelude to overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' dispatch of the SDF combat troops to Iraq was prompted by their shrewd intention to give a helping hand to the U.S. in its awkward position and earn profits in the division of interests including oil. Another important aim sought by them in the troop dispatch is to build a framework for turning Japan into a military giant and militarizing it and secure a justification for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are now driving the Japanese society to the Right with all speed by whitewashing Japan's past history of aggression, paying visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and spreading ultra-nationalism while establishing the Missile Defense System, launching spy satellites and trying to have access to nuclear weapons in a bid to emerge a military power at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Very disturbing developments brought to Japan today by the Japanese right-wing forces remind one of the eve of Japan's aggression of Korea and Asian continent in the past century and this indicates that the Japanese reactionaries' ambitious moves to militarize the country and turn it into a military power for reinvasion have been adopted as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What remains to be done by them now is to work out a war constitution whereby to mobilize all human and material resources as the final step to the completion of their preparations for a war of overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In last November the Japanese chief executive openly called for revising the constitution and elevating the status of the SDF to Defense Ministry. And Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party Abe in his Fuji TV appearance on Jan. 8 cried for exercising right to collective self-defence and revising the constitution. All these were part of the attempts to remove the last roadblock in the way of reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that Japan has so far gnawed away little by little at Article 9 of the present constitution which bans the possession of a regular army and war by adopting \"law on emergency,\" \"law related to Japan-U.S. defence cooperation guidelines\" and \"law on anti-terrorism.\" But it is the first time for the chief executive and heavyweights of the ruling party to openly call for the exercise of right to collective self-defence and the revision of the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that once the Japanese society got militarized and turned into a military power such fascist elements as Tojo would appear on the scene and launch reinvasion, holding sway over the Japanese politicaldom &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea and other Asian countries are not what they were in the past when they were trampled underfoot and plundered by the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries will never be able to evade a miserable lot if they keep pushing for militarization to become a military power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
