            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Says No to Japan's Revision of Law on Punishing Organized Crime\r\n Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, both houses of Japan's Diet passed a draft amendment to the law on punishing organized crime. The revised law includes a provision on \"crime of preparing terror\" dealing with a \"crime of conspiracy\" to punish a crime in the stage of planning. The law is set to take effect from July.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Friday says that Japan's revision of the above-said law is dangerous as it is aimed to legalize strict monitoring and political crackdown upon media and progressive forces at home under the pretext of preventing terror and crime and thus accelerate the militarist fascistization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the political aim of the Japanese ruling quarters to revive the hideous fascist system and call back the departed soul of the era of Japanese imperialism, the paper says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by such sinister scheme, the Japanese reactionaries had retrogressively revised or cooked up lots of fascist laws in recent years\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace and security in the Asia-Pacific region are put at peril when the fascist system is consolidated in Japan. It is by no means fortuitous that international public is branding the revision of the law on punishing organized crime as a reckless move for speeding up the military fascistization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should be mindful that militarization and fascistization will bring to them only the same miserable fate as Tojo and Hitler's.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They would be well advised to cool their heads heated by militarism and behave with prudence and self-control."
