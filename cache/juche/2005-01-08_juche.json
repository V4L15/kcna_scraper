            "content": "Settlement of Japan's Past Crimes Brooks No Further Delay \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The past history of Japan is characterized by continental aggression and plunder to destroy other countries and nations and gratify its insatiable greed for expansion and that history is full of the most hideous crimes ever known against humanity including Koreans and many other Asian peoples, observes Minju Joson Friday in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is historical shame on Japan that it has not yet settled its past crimes although it is nearly 60 years since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. All the successive governments of Japan have approached its past crimes with very improper attitude and doggedly shied away from their settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' shameless attempts to cover up Japan's crime-woven history and repeat it are a very serious criminal act of adding a bigger crime to what it had already committed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only Japan which has not yet shaken off the disgraceful name of an \"enemy state\" in the international arena and it is for this reason that many countries in Asia and other parts of the world are turning their vigilant eyes to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government's moves to take a permanent seat in the U.N. Security Council with a voluble talk about its contribution to the United Nations have aroused deep concern and skepticism from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most urgent for the Japanese government at present is to settle Japan's past wrongs as early as possible and wipe the slate clean if it truly wishes to be a respected member of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without the settlement of its past wrongs, it would be impossible for Japan to regain the confidence of the international community. This settlement is not for others but for Japan itself. So, the sooner, the better. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should face up to the reality and come out to settle its past crimes as quickly as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they buckled down to this research with persevering efforts and finally succeeded in manufacturing electronic devices based on high technology and precision on their own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The weighing machine was finally tested at the weighing site of the February 8 Jiktong Youth Coal Mine recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each time a freight wagon slowly rolled past the site, the results of its weighing displayed on the computer proved accurate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The introduction of this weighing machine made it possible to cut down the manpower at the weighing site to one operator from at least 10 people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They should, at the same time, exert all efforts to frustrate \"cooperation\" with outside forces and achieve the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the patriotic people should strongly oppose and reject the U.S. hostile policy towards the north and its moves for a war of aggression and conduct a nation-wide struggle for peace against war and the U.S. in order to force the U.S. to withdraw its troops from south Korea to the last man, not \"reducing\" them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will join all the patriotic people in opposing and rejecting any acts against the nation and reunification such as shunning the joint declaration and going against it and launch an indomitable struggle to defend and implement the historic declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year our people will unanimously support and defend the Songun politics of the north, a treasured sword for national defence and a key to fully ensuring happiness, always remembering the days they have spent in peace, demonstrating national dignity under the protection of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan is one of the worst human rights violators in the world. It is ill-famed for the number of cases of suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard reality, the reactionaries of Japan are joining the U.S. in its smear campaign against the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" in an effort to overturn its system. This is, however, nothing but a daydream of the wicked and stupid guys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better properly understand who their rival is and give up their futile attempt to bring down the system in the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

That was an historic event of the birth of the first socialist state in the Western Hemisphere and an epochal turning point in the life of the Cuban people aspiring after an independent life, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the fraternal Cuban people today, under the leadership of Fidel Castro Ruz, are honorably defending the country and the gains of the revolution, frustrating at every step the persistent political pressure and sanctions and blockade of the United States, he said the Korean people sincerely hope that the Cuban people would make a bigger advance in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of our Party, government and people to steadily boost the traditional friendly and cooperative relations with socialist Cuba, he said, and stated: The Korean people will as ever advance shoulder to shoulder with the fraternal Cuban people in the cause of defending socialism against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the reception on invitation were Kim Yong Jin, minister of Education who is chairman of the Korea-Cuba Solidarity Committee, Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, Pak Sun Hui, chairperson of the Central Committee of the Korean Democratic Women's Union, and Mun Jae Chol, acting chairman of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This gravely threatens the peace and security of the Korean Peninsula and has led the inter-Korean relations to a frustration and stalemate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No less undisguised have been its interference and obstructions to drive to breakdown economic cooperation between the Koreans while inciting inter-Korean confrontation. In desperately throwing snags in the way of inter-Korean economic cooperation which is desired and demanded by all the Koreans, the United States seeks a sinister intention to do harm to the common prosperity and interests of the Korean nation and send a reverse stream to the development of inter-Korean relations and the process of reconciliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is prerequisite to peace, security and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. Only when the Korean nation forces the U.S. troops out of south Korea and thwarts the U.S. imperialists' interference in its internal affairs and obstructions can it advance the era of independent reunification and win final victory in the cause of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
