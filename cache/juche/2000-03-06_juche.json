It boasts of a sanatorium, a hospital, shops, a rice cookery and other public service facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has more than 60 workshops for mothers of children, who enjoy additional benefits from the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In February General Secretary Kim Jong Il took measures for solving the attendance and leaving and housing problems and supplying vegetables, meat and other non-staple food for women workers even under the hard economic situation. He also sent 1,140 cultural instruments including accordions and harmonicas for their optimistic life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Scores of women workers became \"Kim Il Sung Order\" bearers, labour heroines and merited weavers under the infinite loving care of the party and the state. \r\n\r\n"

Thaebaek in the rear, escorting several wounded soldiers from the front, at the risk of her life.    It was only after the retreat of the hospital that they arrived there only to find the letters \"to the 2nd rendezvous\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the climax of the opera the heroine sings this song with strong yearning for the President Kim Il Sung, looking up to the northern sky. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unshakable faith and will to rush into his arms come what may are fully reflected in the song. The heroine earnestly asks where is the brightly lit Supreme Command where the dear Marshal is sure to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The noble spirit displayed by the Korean People's Army and people to win a victory in the hard-fought war, picturing Kim Il Sung in mind, has been carried forward by the rising generation today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jong Song Ok emerged as the world's \"marathon queen\" by displaying matchless spirit though her physical capacity reached its limit. And soldiers of the KPA returned to the socialist homeland a few years ago, defying the appeasement of the enemy. They could do so because they fought, picturing General Secretary Kim Jong Il in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The absolute worship of Kim Jong Il has become the source of strength which enabled the Korean people to carry out the \"arduous  march\" and the forced march in recent years. \r\n\r\n"

When she was 9 years old, she was kidnapped by an unidentified Japanese man on the way to a primary school in Niigata Prefecture and has since been detained in his house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today says this case is not something shocking in the Japanese society riddled with all sorts of social evils and crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   30,000 cases of abduction and missing were reported in Japan last year alone. The Japanese police which claims to be intelligent is at a loss how to settle them. Judging from this, Japan is obviously a den of kidnappers    though the Japanese authorities are not in a position to settle ceaseless kidnapping at home, they peddled the \"suspected kidnapping\" in a bid to slander the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the past the Japanese imperialists invaded Korea like brigands and inflicted innumerable misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people. They abducted and walked away about 6 million young and middle-aged Koreans and kidnapped nearly 200,000 Korean women in broad daylight and reduced them to sexual slaves for the \"imperial army\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Far from making a thousand-fold apology and compensation for these crimes, the Japanese authorities are pulling up the DPRK over the \"suspected kidnapping\". This is a height of effrontery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The so-called \"suspected kidnapping\" is a product of their intentional and premeditated hostile policy toward the DPRK and no more than a sinister trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will certainly make Japan pay a high price for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must draw a due lesson from the girl kidnapping case. \r\n\r\n"
