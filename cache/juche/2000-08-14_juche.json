And he created the first party organization--the society for rallying comrades--and the Korean Revolutionary Army, the first armed organization of Korean communists, in July Juche 19 (1930) and made preparations for an anti-Japanese armed struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He advanced a strategic and tactical policy on waging an armed struggle against the Japanese imperialists in the winter of 1931 and founded the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army (AJPGA) on April 25, Juche 21 (1932). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, he put forward the policy to expand and develop the anti-Japanese armed struggle to the homeland in March Juche 22 (1933) and took a measure to reorganize the AJPGA into the Korean people's revolutionary army in march Juche 23 (1934). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He advanced a correct political line and scientific strategic and tactical policies in the whole period of the anti-Japanese struggle, thus dealing a fatal political and military blow to the Japanese aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He founded the association for the restoration of the fatherland in May Juche 25 (1936) and further expanded and developed the anti-Japanese united national front movement, bringing about a new advance in the Korean revolution as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And he put forward the policy to let a large unit  advance into the homeland in March Juche 26 (1937). The Pochonbo battle and the operation to advance into the Musan area commanded by him brought the people the dawn of the country's liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then he briskly conducted military and political activities relying on the northeastern parts of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe  wisely led the struggle to actively meet the great event of national liberation in the first half of the 1940s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He firmly built up the internal force of the Korean revolution  and established the brilliant revolutionary traditions to be always carried forward and developed by the workers' party and people of Korea in the course of leading the arduous anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle to victory for 20 years. \r\n\r\n"
