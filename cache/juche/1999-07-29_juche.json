Korean ruler's double-dealing tactics  lambasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry signed commentaries lashing out at the crafty double-dealing tactics of the ruling quarters of the self-proclaimed \"people's government\" of South Korea to arrest the massive advance of the workers for vital rights and democratic freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present South Korean chief executive at recent negotiations with the \"Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" and the \"Federation of Korean Trade Unions\" accepted the three-point demand made by representatives of labour circles such as the release of the arrested workers and stop to police search for those on the want list, a severe punishment of unjust labour administrators and a probe into the truth behind the case of inducing the Mint Company Trade Union to strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A commentary of Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief executive of South Korea, who had issued fascist repressive orders one after another, saying all demands of workers should be settled through the three-party negotiations of the \"Labour-Management-Government Committee\", accommodated the demand of workers this time, behind which his ulterior intention is hidden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He intends to calm down the anti-\"government\" sentiments of the South Korean people which are daily mounting owing to the case of \"prosecution's\" inducing the mint company trade union to strike following the April-may general strike of workers, and gain time at whatever cost to bridge over the serious ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If he truly wanted to accept the demands of workers even a little, he should have released the arrested workers unconditionally and stopped the police search for those on the want list as \"promised\" by him earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But he has not taken any measure till now. And he went the length of saying \"he would consider lenient punishment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe same can be said of a \"severe punishment of unjust labour administrators\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a day dream to expect a fair solution to the issue from the authorities and businessmen, the same exploiters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An introduction of the \"special prosecution system\" and \"probe into state policy\" are under discussion in the \"National Assembly\" to look into the truth behind the case of \"prosecution's\" inducing the mint company trade union to strike. There is, therefore, no reason for the chief executive to claim that credit for it goes to himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His \"promise\" made to the workers is no more than a sheer deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The lingering desire and expectation for the ruling quarters of the \"people's government\" is like poison, and for the workers to give up their struggle halfway means death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson says the double-dealing tactics of fascist repression and appeasement and deception is a trite ruling method of the present chief executive. If the South Korean workers waver in face of fascist repression or give up their struggle halfway, taken in by honeyed words, they will not win the right to existence and democracy, stresses the paper. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

From that time on July has been marked as the month of victory in which the north punished the provocateurs mercilessly and the month in which the United States sustained a crushing defeat for the first time in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The war victory achieved by Kim Il Sung in July is being brilliantly exalted by Marshal Kim Jong Il in history with his great politics of giving priority to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His politics is defending and glorifying the dignity of the nation and socialism in defiance of the western policy of isolation and suffocation. \r\n\r\n"
