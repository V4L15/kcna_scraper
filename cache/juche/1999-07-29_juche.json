Korea to accept maritime demarcation line at West Sea \r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Panmunjom, July 21 (KCNA) -- DPRK-U.S. military talks at general officer level took place at Panmunjom today at the proposal of the Korean People's Army (KPA) side over the West Sea incident.\r\n   In his speech, lt. general Ri Chan Bok, senior delegate of the KPA side, urged the U.S. Forces side to accept the five-point proposal put forward by the KPA side at the last talks lest a grave conflict should recur at the West Sea. He added that both sides should first agree to define a maritime demarcation line at the West Sea as soon as possible.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   He said the main principle in defining the maritime demarcation line at the West Sea is that this issue should be settled on the basis of the armistice agreement and international law. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Ri Chan Bok notified the U.S. Forces side of the maritime demarcation line at the West Sea defined by the KPA side on the basis of the armistice agreement and international law. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The maritime demarcation line is an extension line of the provincial boundary line (a-b) between Hwanghae-do and Kyonggi-do stipulated in the armistice agreement. The line links the point (37 degrees 18.5 minutes n, 125 degrees 31 minutes e) equidistant from \"a\" point and Tungsan point, the tip of Kangryong peninsula under the DPRK control, and from Kul-Op island under the U.S. military control= the point (37 degrees 1.2 minutes n, 124 degrees 55 minutes e) equidistant from Ong island under the DPRK control and from Sogyokryolbi island and Sohyop island under the U.S. military control= and the point (36 degrees 50.75 minutes n, 124 degrees 32.5 minutes e) equidistant from the DPRK and China. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The senior delegate of the KPA side stressed that if the U.S. Forces side wants to resolve the West Sea incident at an early date and prevent the recurrence of a conflict, it must respect the maritime demarcation line based on the armistice agreement and international law and take strict measures lest its warships should intrude beyond this line. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The senior delegate of the U.S. Forces side, failing to eefute the KPA side's statement, said this issue should be discussed at inter-Korean talks. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Strongly repudiating the assertion of the U.S. Forces side the senior delegate of our side stated: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The north-south agreement lays stress on observing the armistice agreement, but it does not stipulate that the issue of maritime demarcation line should be discussed between the north and the south. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Now that the north-south dialogue has come to a rupture and the north-south joint military committee has a stopped its function, the assertion that the west sea issue should be discussed between the north and the south is to avoid the responsibility to observe the armistice agreement. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   In the long run, the issue of the West Sea demarcation line should be settled between the parties responsible for implementing the armistice agreement and defending peace and security in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   In this regard, the senior delegate of our side recalled that the representative of the U.S. army side to the DPRK-U.S. high-level talks held in Beijing in June and the South Korean vice-minister of national unification at the north-south vice-ministerial level talks in Beijing insisted that the West Sea issue should be discussed at general officers level talks in Panmunjom. The U.S. Forces side failed to answer this. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The senior delegate of our side stressed that the West Sea demarcation line put forward by the Korean People's Army side is the most reasonable and just one from the viewpoint of law and reason. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   He declared: firstly, the maritime demarcation line set by us is based on the armistice agreement, the law both sides must observe. Secondly, it takes full account of the requirements of the international law.  Thirdly, it takes the conditions of the opposite side into full consideration. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n    Our senior delegate charged that the \"northern limit line\" on the lips of the U.S. Forces side is the line which has no legal justification as it is in wanton violation of the armistice agreement and international law and which was marked unilaterally without any agreement with the opposite side. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   In response to the charge, the U.S. Forces side admitted that the \"northern limit line\" was unilaterally marked with no agreement between both sides. And it repeated its brigandish argument that the present \"northern limit line\" should remain until a new demarcation line at sea is confirmed. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Now that the U.S. Forces side admitted that the \"northern limit line\" at issue is unjustifiable and agreed to mark a new demarcation line at sea, it is necessary to have working-level contacts to discuss the issue of the demarcation line at the West Sea of Korea, our senior delegate said. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The proposed contacts may be attended by the KPA side and the U.S. Forces side directly responsible for the problem of the demarcation line at the West Sea of Korea and, if necessary, military officials concerned of South Korea, he added.\r\n   Though the U.S. Forces side agreed to the offer, it insisted on having the contacts within the framework of the north-south joint military committee. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Our senior delegate refuted the argument, saying that inter-Korean talks have long been deadlocked and the committee has not been in operation and so it is impossible for the committee to discuss the issue which brooks no further delay.\r\n   Lt. general Ri Chan Bok had this to say: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The KPA side urges once again the U.S. Forces side to boldly drop the old concept and go back and carefully study a new demarcation line at the west sea, which was proposed by us, and respond to our proposal to hold the contacts. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   Attitude towards the contacts for defining the demarcation line at the West Sea of Korea will show whether the U.S. Forces side truly wants to ease tensions and prevent armed conflict at the West Sea. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. Forces side refuses to have the contacts, ignoring our sincere efforts for relaxation of tensions and prevention of military conflicts on the Korean peninsula, this will provide clearer evidence that the general officers' meeting is meaningless. In this case we will no longer wish to waste time, sitting face to face with the U.S. Forces side. Then the general officers' meeting will come to an end. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;\r\n   The KPA side will follow the attitude of the U.S. Forces side.    \r\n \r\n"

Korean ruler's double-dealing tactics  lambasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- Papers here today carry signed commentaries lashing out at the crafty double-dealing tactics of the ruling quarters of the self-proclaimed \"people's government\" of South Korea to arrest the massive advance of the workers for vital rights and democratic freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present South Korean chief executive at recent negotiations with the \"Korean Confederation of Trade Unions\" and the \"Federation of Korean Trade Unions\" accepted the three-point demand made by representatives of labour circles such as the release of the arrested workers and stop to police search for those on the want list, a severe punishment of unjust labour administrators and a probe into the truth behind the case of inducing the Mint Company Trade Union to strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A commentary of Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The chief executive of South Korea, who had issued fascist repressive orders one after another, saying all demands of workers should be settled through the three-party negotiations of the \"Labour-Management-Government Committee\", accommodated the demand of workers this time, behind which his ulterior intention is hidden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He intends to calm down the anti-\"government\" sentiments of the South Korean people which are daily mounting owing to the case of \"prosecution's\" inducing the mint company trade union to strike following the April-may general strike of workers, and gain time at whatever cost to bridge over the serious ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If he truly wanted to accept the demands of workers even a little, he should have released the arrested workers unconditionally and stopped the police search for those on the want list as \"promised\" by him earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But he has not taken any measure till now. And he went the length of saying \"he would consider lenient punishment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe same can be said of a \"severe punishment of unjust labour administrators\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a day dream to expect a fair solution to the issue from the authorities and businessmen, the same exploiters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An introduction of the \"special prosecution system\" and \"probe into state policy\" are under discussion in the \"National Assembly\" to look into the truth behind the case of \"prosecution's\" inducing the mint company trade union to strike. There is, therefore, no reason for the chief executive to claim that credit for it goes to himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His \"promise\" made to the workers is no more than a sheer deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The lingering desire and expectation for the ruling quarters of the \"people's government\" is like poison, and for the workers to give up their struggle halfway means death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson says the double-dealing tactics of fascist repression and appeasement and deception is a trite ruling method of the present chief executive. If the South Korean workers waver in face of fascist repression or give up their struggle halfway, taken in by honeyed words, they will not win the right to existence and democracy, stresses the paper. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "June to be followed by July\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- Ri Chun Sok, professor of history in South Korea, published an article titled \"June is to be followed by July,\" said Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The title is not a phrase meaning mere flow of time but implies a serious lesson and strong warning that provocateurs are to come in for punishment and ruin, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that the U.S. schemed to realize its domination over the whole Korean peninsula from the very day of its occupation of South Korea, he said that the June 25 war against the north was a great misfortune which was imposed upon the Korean people by the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Although 49 years have passed since then, the U.S. ambition for aggression on the north is growing stronger, the article said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States still remains an aggression force and a target of damnation and hatred of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. considered the war with the north in the 1950s to be quite a sure and easy job, but the DPRK was a rival it misjudged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Because the north had invincible and iron-willed commander Kim Il Sung who stood in the van of the war for defending justice and a strong army and people who were ready to devote their lives to the defense of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. failed in every battle because it misjudged the DPRK. From that time on July has been marked as the month of victory in which the north punished the provocateurs mercilessly and the month in which the United States sustained a crushing defeat for the first time in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The war victory achieved by Kim Il Sung in July is being brilliantly exalted by Marshal Kim Jong Il in history with his great politics of giving priority to the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His politics is defending and glorifying the dignity of the nation and socialism in defiance of the western policy of isolation and suffocation. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's attempt to transport plutonium through Caribbean\r\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The DPRK holds that the just call of the governments and the peoples in the Caribbean for ensuring security and protecting the ecological environment in the region should be respected in any case, stated the spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today answering the question put by KCNA as regards the statement recently issued by heads of government of 14 Caribbean countries at the 20th CARICOM regular summit denouncing Japan for attempting to transport nuclear fuel through the Caribbean Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that Japan is going to ship about 450 kg of plutonium from Britain and France to Japan via the Caribbean and the Panama Canal, he noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a justifiable demand to save the destiny of millions of people in the region who depend on the Caribbean Sea for their living and prevent the catastrophic pollution of ecological environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has kept shipping nuclear material under the cloak of \"fuel for nuclear power plants\". This is intended to push in full gear with nuclear weaponization and the conversion of Japan into a military power in a bid to realize the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are now vociferating about the \"threat\" from the DPRK, insisting that its launch of a satellite for a peaceful purpose is a \"launch of a ballistic missile\". It is, after all, designed to find an excuse to achieve that objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis move of Japan to become a nuclear power by shipping a large quantity of plutonium from other countries and stockpiling it has now come in for strong protest and condemnation by the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
