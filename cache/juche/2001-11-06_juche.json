It savagely bombed more than 1,900 churches, cathedrals and temples and killed in cold blood hundreds of thousands of Korean religionists including Christians during the past Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The central committee of the Korean Christian Federation dismisses such U.S. behavior as outrageous and arrogant as it disregards even the elementary principle of the international law and seriously violates the basic principle governing the life of a Christian which forbids him from telling any lie harmful to the other and, at the same time, sternly condemns it in the name of all the Korean Christians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should apologize for destroying all the churches in Korea and killing many religionists in the past Korean war in the 1950s and immediately and unconditionally withdraw its arrogant \"decision.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the expectation that the international Christian organizations and all the honest-minded Christians of the world who love justice and peace would actively turn out in the struggle to check and frustrate the U.S. plot.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to drop its unilateral demand \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea in a recent \"lecture given on invitation\" clamored for a \"close watch\" on the \"threat from North Korea\" and a \"firm measure\" against someone's \"misjudgment.\" the U.S. ambassador to South Korea addressing a \"seminar\" to which he was invited talked about the \"need\" to cut down the conventional armed forces of the DPRK.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK have entered an extremely grave stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of reducing of the conventional armed forces of the DPRK raised by the U.S. clamoring about the non-existent \"threat\" from it is aimed to justify its attempt at the permanent occupation of South Korea, torpedo the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and shift the responsibility for it onto the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. left no stone unturned to perpetuate its troops' presence in South Korea, keeping South Korea under its military occupation for more than half a century. Its talk about the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK is part of its moves.\r\n Though the U.S. is talking about the DPRK-U.S. dialogue, it, in fact, has shown no interest in it from its beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the contrary, it is seeking to torpedo the DPRK-U.S. dialogue and shift the responsibility for it onto the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no change in the DPRK principled stand on the issues of the U.S. military presence in South Korea and the DPRK-U.S. dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has consistently demanded the immediate withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea. It is a pressing issue in improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. It is the DPRK consistent stand to settle the abnormal DPRK-U.S. relations through DPRK-U.S. dialogue. But the DPRK never begs for dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It approaches and conducts all dialogues from an independent stand. Neither demand nor pressure, which are running counter to the DPRK independent stand and interest, can work on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants the dialogue with the DPRK, it should renounce its unilateral attitude toward the dialogue, properly understanding the DPRK will and stand toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Everything depends on the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will watch the U.S. future behavior.    \r\n\r\n"

As the first step for its realization, it hastily fabricated this law to allow the overseas dispatch of the SDF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's undisguised moves to launch overseas expansion and become a military power are arousing deep apprehension and resentment of many Asian countries and the rest of the world. Strong protests are ringing out not only from Japan but from among the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These reckless moves of Japan can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people are following Japan's militarist moves for expansion with high vigilance and keeping themselves fully ready to counter them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is rushing headlong toward militarist expansion instead of drawing a lesson from its crime-woven past. But it will meet strong resistance of the Korean people and other Asian people and face a more miserable end than what it sustained in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
