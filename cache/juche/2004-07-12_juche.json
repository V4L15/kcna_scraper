Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean Association for the Study of Human Rights gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA on Saturday as regards the protest of the ultra right conservative forces including the Grand National Party against the decision made by the south Korean Committee for Proving the Truth behind the Suspected Incident that three former unconverted long-term prisoners of south Korea made contribution to the movement for democracy and died in prison while fighting against the scheme to force \"ideological conversion\" in the period of the military fascist dictatorship.\r\n Ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea including the GNP and the Association of Reservists charged the decision with a behavior of shaking the liberal democratic system and law and order. They let loose such string of vituperation that they can never remain a passive onlooker in case the decision that a state organ recognized those out of legal frame as persons of merit under the \"security law\" is not withdrawn. Moreover, they openly exerted violence upon those organizations and personages supporting the decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman dismissed this as an unpardonable move to justify and revive such criminal acts as harassing human rights and democracy and inciting distrust, antagonism and confrontation among the Koreans in the period of the military fascist dictatorship as it is a behavior to measure the reality of the new era with the old ruler used in the past era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners whom the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea including the GNP called to account are the most tragic sufferers of human rights violation in the 20th century who sustained all sorts of inhuman maltreatment and suppression and even miserable death behind bars for over 3 or 4 decades for the mere reason that they did not convert their idea and faith, he said, adding it admits no argument that their struggle is intended to protect their idea and faith, rights and democracy against fascist suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This crime is all the more grave as it invoked the SL which defines fellow countrymen as \"enemy\" at a time when all the Koreans are going in for independent reunification by their concerted efforts after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the spokesman said, stressing that those going against the trend of the times, turning their back on public mindset will face a shameful doom.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They perpetrated such thrice-cursed hideous crime in defiance of the ancestral moral ethics, the crime which may drive the inter-Korean relations to the phase of severance and confrontation, just as the \"civilian government\" did ten years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a rude and immoral behavior in view of the precedents because south Korean personages of various circles so far visited the statue of the President and paid respectful homage to him while staying in Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such inhuman crime was committed in the era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the era of \"By our nation itself.\" This clearly indicates that though they are talking about \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" their real intention is to fundamentally negate the system in the north, still regarding it as their enemy, just as they did in the period before the publication of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already well known, the north, feeling painful at the misfortunes that hit south Korea, observed necessary etiquette and fulfilled its obligations as part of the same nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea committed such an action as breaking the good precedents of the exchange of visits of personages between the north and the south, trampling down upon the good manners and customs of the nation and violating the elementary morality, as soon as a new \"prime minister\" and \"minister of Unification\" took office. This compels the north to worry about the possible serious impact this absolutely unreasonable action will have on the future visits between the north and the south and the overall inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A severe judgment will surely be meted out to those who blocked the visit of the delegation to the north in violation of the moral ethics    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Songgo in Pakyon-ri, Kaesong. Originally it had stood on four cornerstones and slabs put on a natural rock. But it was found destroyed when discovered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lotuses were carved in relievo on a round stone on the top of the pagoda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe first-storey stone was 1.2 m in diameter and 25 cm in thickness while the third-story one 40 cm in diameter and 20 cm in thickness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pagoda is believed to be about 3 m high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It draws the attention of the experts as it has a round shape roof though the stone pagodas so far known in Korea had square shape roofs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Koryo celadon kettle, 11.3 cm in height and 15.6 cm in diameter, is simple in its pattern and peculiar in its shape. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n New findings lotus-patterned flower vase and other porcelains are very instrumental in academic studies for their shape, color and patterns peculiar to Koryo celadon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The results of the investigation made by the \"Commission for Investigating the September 11, 2001 Terror Attacks,\" an independent investigation organ in the U.S., proved that the assertion of the Bush administration that Saddam's regime in Iraq cooperated with Al-Qaeda was a sheer lie and fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the Bush administration, showing a sensitive reaction to the report made by the commission, insisted the day after the publication of its results that there were contacts between Iraq and Al-Qaeda. It, however, has failed so far to produce any concrete evidence proving its assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Public opinions dismissed this as a clumsy attempt of the Bush administration to justify its war crimes and evade its responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, Hans Blix, former chairman of the UN MOVIC, also said at a press conference that the Iraqi war was illegal to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the political faith of the Bush warlike forces not to rule out even the use of military equipment, nuclear preemptive attack, in particular, with a view to establishing its domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is persistently pursuing its policy to stifle the DPRK, spreading \"the nuclear and missile threat from north Korea\" in a bid to dominate Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom for the U.S. to attempt to stifle the DPRK as it has not yet settled its difficult situation in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to ponder over the miserable consequences to be entailed by its wrong foreign policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
