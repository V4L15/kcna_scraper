Among those servicemen were platoon leader Kim Tae Jin, who joined in the army to repay the warm benevolence shown by the party and motherland for his father, who wandered about in Japan before being repatriated to the homeland to lead a genuine life, and remained faithful to the revolution until the last moments of his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, Kim Jong Il visited a battery under the unit and saw a training of servicemen and the families of their officers in fire service. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people have turned the whole country into an impregnable fortress by successfully carrying out the WPK's military line for self-defence aimed at making the entire army a cadre army, modernizing the entire army, arming all people and turning the whole country into a fortress, he said, adding: no force on earth can match such army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also went round various places including an education room, bedroom, daily provision store, washroom and barrack compound of the battery under persimmon trees to take warm care of servicemen's living with paternal love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he saw an art performance given by soldiers of the battery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly satisfied to see its servicemen leading a revolutionary and militant life as brave and stalwart artillerymen, he congratulated them on their successful performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the soldiers of the battery a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and posed for a picture with them.    \r\n   \r\n"

This is essential for reflecting the will of many UN member nations in imposing sanctions and minimizing its negative role. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UN is to decisively increase its major role in international relations, all its member nations should respect and honestly implement the UN Charter, reject unilateral practices and ensure equality.    \r\n\r\n"
