It has unique bridges and crossings. There appeared on its either side green belts and woodlands and houses for thousands of families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il acquainted himself in detail with the construction of the motorway, looking round wide highway, flyovers of particular style, green belts and houses on either side of the motorway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the motorway has been impeccably built in terms not only of its width and blueprint but of all its structures, he stressed that the heroic struggle and enduring feats of the young builders will shine long in the history of building a powerful socialist nation and their immortal feats will be always remembered by the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that members of the youth shock brigade and young soldier-builders wrought such miracles as building a great edifice of eternal value with empty hands in the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, the revolutionary spirit of devotedly carrying out any task when the country was under the most difficult conditions. This signal achievement is a demonstration of the great mental power of the Korean youth who like to work and make revolution, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Praising the young Koreans as the militant vanguard and shock brigade of the revolution that registered victories, braving the hardships and difficulties hard to endure, he said: It is the great pride of the Worker's Party of Korea and the Korean people to have such excellent youth and the Korean revolution is sure to win as the ranks of those proud young loyalists are giving steady continuity to the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youth hero motorway should be put into better shape and always kept clean and neat as it is a precious wealth to be handed down to posterity, he said. He advanced highly important tasks that would serve as guidelines in managing and operating the motorway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met and gave warm pep-talks to the youth shock brigade members and soldier-builders who performed heroic feats in the construction of the motorway and posed for a picture with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accompanying him were director of the general political department of the Korean People's Army Jo Myong Rok, chief of the KPA general staff Kim Yong Chun, Minister of the People's Armed Forces Kim Il Chol, member of the DPRK National Defence Commission Yon Hyong Muk, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee Han Song Ryong, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Jung Rin and Kim Yong Sun, secretary of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly Kim Yun Hyok, department directors and first vice department directors and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee, and KPA generals Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong. \r\n\r\n"

It is a modern factory where all processes and temperature, humidity and lighting regulation are computerized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the outside and inside of the factory reminiscent of a modern scientific research center, Kim Jong Il was much pleased to learn that soldier-builders completed it in such a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated their feats and expressed thanks, noting that by the heroic struggle of servicemen one more edifice of eternal value was built to bring prosperity to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to pay primary attention to technical control and the management of equipment as it is a highly automated ultra modern factory, he urged its officials and workers to steadily improve their technical skills and thus manage and operate it on a scientific basis. After looking round the factory he put forward important tasks to bring about a decisive turn in the improvement of the standard of people's living by putting stock-breeding onto a new stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Calling for building ultra modern and highly productive chicken,  duck,  goose and pig factories  in different parts of the country under a long-term plan, he stressed that all factories to be built should be completed so impeccably that they may be handed down to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need to thoroughly establish a feed supply system and thus make the existing stock-breeding bases pay off and build a strict anti-epidemic system in all domains of stock-breeding including poultry industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Jo Myong Rok, director of the general political department of the KPA= Kim Yong Chun, chief of the general staff of the KPA= Kim Il Chol, Minister of the People's Armed Forces= Yon Hyong Muk, member of the DPRK National Defence Commission= and KPA generals Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was also accompanied by Han Song Ryong, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Jung Rin and Kim Yong Sun, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, Kim Yun Hyok, secretary of the presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, senior officials of the WPK Central Committee including department directors and first deputy department directors of the WPK Central Committee and Pak Nam Gi, chairman of the State Planning Commission. \r\n\r\n"
