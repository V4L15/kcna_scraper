            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blames U.S. for Posing Nuclear Threat to DPRK\r\nPyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman gave a statement on Wednesday in connection with the fact that the U.S. is pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula, which entered the phase of detente, back to the state of tensions and confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe statement said that the ever-mounting nuclear threat and blackmail by the U.S. and its moves for making preparations for a war of aggression are a serious encroachment upon the sovereignty and right to existence of the DPRK, and a wanton violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreements and September 19 joint statement in which Washington gave \"assurances\" not to use force against the DPRK including nuclear weapons nor pose any threats to it with those forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis notwithstanding, the U.S. is trying to make the public convince that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is precisely the DPRK's dismantlement of nuclear program, while making sophism that the restart of the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon are a violation of international obligation and commitments, if it is true. This is aimed to cover up its crimes and shift the responsibility on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the invariable aim of the policy of the DPRK government, does not mean the unilateral nuclear dismantlement on the part of the DPRK side. This is the process of making the peninsula a nuclear-free zone on the basis of completely removing the substantial nuclear threats posed to the peninsula from outside on the principle of simultaneous actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAction for action remains a basic principle for finding a solution to the nuclear issue on the peninsula and the DPRK will, therefore, not unilaterally move first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt present there exist only physical moves on the peninsula where there are neither peace nor stability nor dialogue. This is attributable to the U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail and sanctions against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIncreasing nuclear threat from outside will only compel the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrent to cope with this. It will not be bound to anything in doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK stands for peace and stability and demands the U.S. roll back its hostile policy towards the former but will never beg the latter to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will dynamically advance towards a final victory, invariably keeping to the road of independence, Songun and socialism no matter how Washington behaves."

Korean Regime's Watchword \"Confidence-Building Process\"\r\nPyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) -- The north-south relations have been put on the orbit of confrontation and the escalated tension again  and the situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out any moment. The present south Korean ruling forces are wholly to blame for this alarming development as they are getting frantic with the moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK in collaboration with outsiders after adopting what they called \"confidence-building process\" as their \"policy towards the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Wednesday observes this in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"confidence-building process\" on the lips of the south Korean authorities represents a policy for confrontation and war  with the DPRK from A to Z as it is aimed at blocking the mending of the inter-Korean ties and increasing the danger of a nuclear war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKeeping mum about the U.S. nuclear threat, the south Korean puppet ruling forces described the DPRK's nuclear deterrence as a \"threat\" and adopted their scenario for pressurizing \"the north to dismantle its nukes\" as a main mainstay of their \"policy towards the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the main hurdle lying in the way of repairing the inter-Korean relations as it is a clear expression of their hostility towards compatriots and their scenario to invade the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Changes in the north\" which the puppet regime is seeking through the \"confidence-building process\" are designed to lead the north \"to reforms and opening\". Its ultimate goal is to bring down the dignified socialist system in the north and achieve \"the unification of the social systems\" in collusion with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn recent days, the war-like forces are keen on establishing the \"Kill Chain,\" a system for mounting a preemptive attack, and the \"missile defense system\" in the wake of their formal working out of the \"tailored deference strategy\" with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn another development, the warmongers openly staged the DPRK-targeted nuclear strike maneuvers with U.S. nuclear strategic bombers and nuclear-powered carrier involved in them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly proves that the \"confidence-building process\" will bring nothing but the escalated military confrontation and tension between the north and the south and the danger of a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe said watchword represents the confrontation policy of the pro-U.S. elements zealously following the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. This is an aspect revealing the regime's treacherous and anti-reunification nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the moves pursued by the regime for putting its watchword into practice are geared to tightening the \"alliance\" with the U.S. and boosting cooperation in increasing the military pressure on the DPRK for the purpose of escalating the confrontation between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe inter-Korean ties can never be a plaything for realizing the watchword of the warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe present catastrophic inter-Korean relations are evil consequences of their watchword and, at the same time, clear evidence proving its failure."
