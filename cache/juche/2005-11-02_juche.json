This is, however, nothing but poor diplomacy of Japan utterly indifferent to its own deplorable position and the mind-set of the world people.\r\n The majority of the UN member nations have opposed Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council at its session because they could not trust Japan as it is after a sinister purpose without redressing its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the world to severely criticize and jeer at Japan as a blind country and a political dwarf that, defying the demand of the times, is unable to measure the weight of the UN, interested in money only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should Japan challenge the UN over its contribution, instead of repenting of its past crimes, it will have a hell of a time. This is the world's unanimous comment and advice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
