It is quite clear that it is impossible to sit at the negotiating table with such man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, he asserted that the nuclear issue should be discussed at the north-south summit talks despite the fact that the issue is now being settled at the six-party talks. This proves that he seeks a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The issue of summit talks peddled by Lee cannot be construed otherwise than a ploy to evade the responsibility for having bedeviled the inter-Korean relations, get rid of the situation where he stands isolated at home and abroad and mislead the public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak would be well advised to clarify his stand towards the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration before talking about the summit talks.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this course, he made imperishable exploits to be handed down through the history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the last year of his great life he energetically led the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn July 7, Juche 83 (1994), he read the historic document related to national reunification as a preparatory work for the North-South summit to be held for the first time since the division of the nation and wrote the words \"Kim Il Sung, July 7, 1994\" on its first page. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe noble intention of the President for reunification is being carried forward by General Secretary Kim Jong Il with credit today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKim Jong Il, with a grand intention to open up a new era for the independent reunification without fail in the new century, arranged north-south summit meetings on two occasions to publish the June 15 joint declaration and its practical programme the October 4 declaration, thus making the whole nation hold aloft the idea \"by our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNow the Korean people, bearing deep in mind the intention of the President reflected in the autograph, are vigorously advancing forward for the future of the reunified country that the President had longed for. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
