It was another mockery of the Korean nation and remarks deceiving it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries, far from drawing a lesson from their blood-stained history of crimes, are openly pursuing the moves to grab Tok islets, distort history and convert Japan into a military power and policies of discrimination and contempt against the Koreans in Japan and rushing headlong into nuclear weaponization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans should unite as one irrespective of idea, ism and system under the patriotic banner of struggle against Japan, be they in the north and the south and overseas, and thus wage dynamic solidarity actions to force Japan to pay for the crimes committed against the Koreans for a centenary this year, the \"year of joint anti-Japanese struggle\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The two parties in their appeal ardently called on all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to unite close and more dynamically turn out in the struggle for national reunification and the joint anti-Japanese solidarity actions this year, the 10th anniversary of the historic June 15 joint declaration and the centenary of the fabrication of the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" which brought national ruin to the Koreans."
