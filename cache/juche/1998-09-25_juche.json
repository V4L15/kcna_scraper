The U.S. Secretary of Defense, Cohen, made identical remarks.\r\n   Their allegation is that the DPRK has built \"underground nuclear facilities\" and launched an artificial satellite, demonstrating its capacity of attack on any target on the earth, which poses \"threats\" to the U.S. it cannot be construed otherwise than a shameless argument reversing black and white.\r\n   The U.S. argument came after the DPRK said that the underground structure in the Nyongbyon area is a civilian one and it launched artificial satellite for peaceful purposes, not a \"ballistic missile.\" The argument is an unpardonable encroachment upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. has a lot of nuclear facilities, produces large quantities of nuclear substance and possesses a huge amount of nuclear warheads and carrier rockets. It is stepping up the militarisation of space through the launch of espionage and military satellites. What is the U.S. act like in view of the U.S. logic?\r\n   By bringing forward the fiction of \"threats\" the U.S. seeks to justify its campaign to stifle the DPRK and find an excuse to give further push to the militarisation of space.\r\n   For the U.S. to talk about the \"threats\" by the DPRK is the height of impudence.\r\n   Whether the DPRK's launch of artificial satellite is used for military purposes or not entirely depends on the attitude of the U.S. and other hostile forces.\r\n   The U.S. had better stop advertising the fiction of \"threats\" from the DPRK and look squarely at the developments. \r\n   \r\n"

Many friends of the world, as well as the Korean people, have been struck with admiration at it. The South Korean authorities should have been pleased and proud of the world-startling event of the fellow countrymen. No sooner had the news of the artificial satellite launch been reported than they felt uneasy about the launch. As a result of this, they convened a \"meeting of security-related officials,\" cried for \"adoption of South Korea-U.S. joint countermeasure\" and hatched a plot with the Japanese reactionaries. Their acts are the height of treason.\r\n   It is the deep-rooted bad habit of the South Korean authorities to blindly follow foreign forces and to do harm to the fellow countrymen. \r\n   All the facts prove that the self-styled \"government for the people\" takes the road of confrontation with the fellow countrymen as its predecessor did.\r\n   Confrontation with the fellow countrymen leads them to ruin. The South Korean authorities must be aware of this.\r\n   They should stop fawning on and following outsiders and doing harm to the fellow countrymen and reject outsiders, hand in hand with the fellow countrymen out of the stand of national independence. \r\n\r\n"
