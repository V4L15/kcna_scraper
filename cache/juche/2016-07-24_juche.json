And he set forth the tasks for reinforcing modern equipment, putting all its production processes on an automated and stream-lined basis and turning its compound into a woodland and orchard and provided it with valuable equipment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He took hands of the officials one by one and noted that he was very pleased to hear that the output at the factory has remarkably increased as it was furnished with modern equipment.

He gave strength and courage to the unit so that it can steadily play a vanguard role in the drive for developing the country's pisciculture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, O Su Yong and Jo Yong Won."
