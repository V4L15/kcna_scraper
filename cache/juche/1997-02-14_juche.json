If peace and security failed to be ensured on the Korean Peninsula, the U.S. and Japan too would be seriously affected by the consequences.\r\n   The U.S. must stop trying to stifle the DPRK by abusing the name of the United Nations but clearly see the situation and dissolve the \"United Nations Command\", a legacy from the Cold War, which has been left without any real meaning.\r\n   Nearly 22 years have passed since a resolution calling for the dissolution of the \"United Nations Command\" in South Korea was adopted at the UN General Assembly. The Cold War has been terminated and the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement is now under way. It is high time that the U.S. delinked its military presence in South Korea from the name of the united nations, without losing face.\r\n   If the U.S. thinks it can cover up its being a belligerent under the name of the united nations, it is a mistake.\r\n   The prolonged belligerent relationship between the DPRK and the U.S. would be unfavorable to the U.S., either.\r\n   So, the U.S. had better sign a tentative agreement with DPRK and jointly pave the way for a peace agreement. It would be favorable to the U.S.    If it continues abusing the name of the united nations, the U.S. will be kept under fire for its arbitrariness and high-handedness and lose confidence from UN member nations.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must discard the design of reinvasion for the sake of the Japanese people and avoid falling a prey to the U.S.\r\n   The United Nations should take a step to withdraw its name and flag from U.S. Forces in South Korea. Those nations which remain registered in the \"United Nations Command\" should also take a step to quit it and substantially contribute to the conclusion of a tentative agreement between the DPRK and the U.S.\r\n"

Earlier, on February 11, the \"NCNP\"and the \"United Liberal Democrats\", another opposition party in South Korea, held a joint meeting of \"National Assemblymen\", at which they declared that Kim Hyon Chol, the second son of Kim Young Sam, was involved in the Hanbo scandal.\r\n   As were claimed by public circles of South Korea, the case of the illegal loaning for the Hanbo steelworks was a power-backed extra-large financial scandal caused by  Kim Young Sam.\r\n   Kim Young Sam and his second son, who are the behind-the-scene characters of the unlawful loaning of a sizable sum of money, are impostors who unhesitatingly resort to any means and method to earn money.\r\n   All facts show that Kim Young Sam is wholly responsible for the Hanbo scandal.\r\n   Kim Young Sam is making a formalistic investigation into the Hanbo scandal with the mobilisation of the prosecution, saying that it is a \"deplorable case\". However, this is nothing but a stop-gap measure to bury his crimes in obscurity. If he thinks that he can conceal his crimes, it is as foolish as a daydream.\r\n\r\n"
