Kim Jong Il has mapped out all the lines, policies, strategies and tactics in the era of army-based policy on the principle of giving priority to the army, guided by the Juche idea. The army-based line based on the Juche idea serves as guidelines for all fields including the party, power, economic and cultural construction and the revolutionary spirit of soldiers based on the idea and theory of Juche represents the spirit of the times on which people's viewpoint, ways of activities and work style are based. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This line is the essence of the revolutionary idea of Kim Jong Il and the fundamental principle to govern all its systems and contents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era of the army-based policy is the times in which the validity and vitality of the Juche idea and the idea and line of the army-based policy based on it are most strikingly demonstrated. \r\n The army-based revolutionary cause of the WPK is an invincible cause which makes progress and wins victory with the might of the idea and the army. It is an unshakable will of Kim Jong Il to accomplish the Korean revolution that started in the forest of Mt. Paektu under the banner of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls on all the people to vigorously accelerate the revolution and construction, considering the Juche idea to be a permanent strategic objective in the revolution, and thus make the era of the army-based policy shine as the most glorious era of creation and innovation in the history of the WPK and the revolution.    \r\n\r\n"
