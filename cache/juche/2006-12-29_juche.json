            "content": "Exalting History of Great Revolutionary Upswing Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- Today marks the 50th anniversary of the historic speech made by President Kim Il Sung at the Kangson Steel Works in which he called for using locally available production potentials to the maximum to boost the production of steel. He visited the works in the wake of the plenary meeting of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea in December 1956.\r\n Rodong Sinmun in an editorial Thursday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung had the historic plenary meeting convened in December Juche 45 (1956) when the Korean revolution was undergoing a grim test, at which he set forth the revolutionary policy calling on all the Party members and other people to brace themselves up and effect a dramatic upswing in building socialism. Then he went down to the workers in Kangson and aroused their ardent patriotic zeal, thus ushering in the new history of Chollima march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il has seen to it that the history of socialist construction in the DPRK has been constantly carried forward as a history of a great revolutionary upswing, true to Kim Il Sung's blueprint of building a prosperous powerful country, and has recorded every decade of the revolution and construction as a heroic epic. \r\n Kim Jong Il's energetic leadership finds it traces in the course of the advance in the 1970s and the 1980s when the Koreans rushed forward like the wind by adding speed to the gallop of Chollima and in the three revolution red flag movement, a new higher stage of the Chollima work-team movement, which serves as a powerful driving force for building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a significant historic exploit performed by him that he energetically led the work to glorify the tradition of the great revolutionary surge in the days of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of building socialism in the DPRK in which the Koreans have written the heroic epic of the great revolutionary upswing for many years is a history of the tested leadership of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il. All the people should turn out like a giant and set off a raging storm of leaping progress in every field and domain of socialist construction like the people who upheld the spirit of the historic plenary meeting in 1956, urges the editorial.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
