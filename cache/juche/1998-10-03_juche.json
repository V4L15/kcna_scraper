He noted with satisfaction that the county was striving to complete minor power stations that were under construction as soon as possible and supply electricity for heating the dwelling houses.\r\n   He called for doing land management well. He said windbreak trees should be planted in larger numbers, the land be conserved and the roads and rivers be kept neat and tidy at all times.\r\n   He urged the senior officials of the county to enhance their role.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

But they had dared not foster a fear of war among people so extremely as the present rulers do, vociferating about  the fictitious \"chemical war\"  by the north.\r\n   This fully shows that the present ruling quarters of South Korea are fanatics of anti-communist confrontation who are surpassing their preceding fascist dictators and warmaniacs who do their utmost to round off preparations for war against the north.\r\n   Their war hysterics against the north is reaching a perilous state. \r\n   A few days ago, the chief executive of South Korea inspected a war exercise in the central sector of the front together with the military bosses and revealed a wild design to invade the north at celebrations of the \"Day of ROK Army\" held by ground force, air force, special combat units and mechanized units in Seoul on October 1.  These facts show that the present \"government\" of South Korea is rushing headlong along confrontation and war.\r\n   History and people will deal a sledge-hammer blow at the South Korean authorities who are taking a road of confrontation and war against the fellow countrymen in the north, fostering antagonism and enmity instead of  an atmosphere of national reconciliation and unity.    \r\n\r\n"

The vicious Japanese imperialist aggressors did not dare block the service.\r\n   Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are trying to obstruct the service, branding it as a political event. This shows that the \"unification ministry\" led by Kang In Dok has no soul of the Korean nation.\r\n   By blocking the north visit of Buddhists, the South Korean rulers  fully revealed  their splittist stand and real intention to obstruct religious activities of buddhists, not respecting forefathers.\r\n   With those left intact, national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, cannot be achieved nor can cooperation and exchange  between Buddhists be realized. \r\n   The South Korean authorities must look straight at the aspirations of the fellow countrymen and the trend of the times, discard the concept of confrontation with the north and take the stand of alliance and reconciliation with the north.      \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clumsy act reveals their vulnerability.\r\n   Despite opposition at home and abroad, warmongers of the United States and Japan recently decided to promote joint studies for \"theatre missile defence\" in the wake of our satellite launch. This is a blackmail designed to prevent the DPRK from launching another satellite.\r\n   We are neither frightened nor afraid, though.
