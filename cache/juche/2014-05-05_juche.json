This was followed by its ceaseless plunder and invasion by its Shenandoah and other warships in 1867, 1868 and 1871. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finding it hard to attain its aggressive purpose due to resistance of the Korean people, the U.S. sided with Japan during the 1894-1895 Sino-Japanese War and 1904-1905 Russo-Japanese War, openly supporting Japan's aggression of Korea. In 1905 the U.S. concluded the \"Katsura-Taft Treaty\" which recognized Japan's occupation of Korea, using it as a shock brigade for invading Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After occupying south Korea under the mask of \"liberator\" in September of 1945, the U.S. started its bestial atrocities against the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It openly revealed its ambition for aggression of the DPRK and finally launched invasion of the DPRK on June 25, 1950. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. suffered a disgraceful defeat in the Korean war but has fully turned south Korea into its colony and a tundra of human rights, keeping it under its occupation since the post-war period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It massively introduced all types of WMDs including nukes, turning south Korea into the world's biggest nuclear arsenal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has staged ceaseless dangerous nuclear war drills for decades, posing constant danger of nuclear disaster to the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists have committed unheard-of monstrous massacres of Koreans since they launched aggression against Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist aggressors killed Koreans by the cruelest and most brutal methods baffling human imagination during the Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Korean war, they killed at least 1.23 million people in the northern half of Korea and more than 1.24 million in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They committed sexual abuses against Korean women to satisfy their carnal desire and mercilessly killed them even in the vortex of the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They committed hair-raising atrocities against many innocent people, lording it over south Korea after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There occurred ceaseless GI crimes last year alone. To cite just a few examples, GIs gang-raped a woman in her twenties on a subway electric car, GIs made shooting spree against passers-by in the center of Seoul, driving their car over a local policeman before taking to flight and a drunken GI drove his car at breakneck speed, causing a traffic accident, and beat the victim who chased him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists perpetrated barbarous air raids during the Korean war, massacring Koreans and reducing the country to ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The flying corps of their air force made 800 000 sorties and those of their marines and navy over 250 000 sorties against the northern half of Korea in the entire period of the war. They dropped bombs and napalm bombs totaling almost 600 000 tons or 3.7 times those dropped over the Japan proper during the Pacific war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. barbarous air raids perpetrated during the Korean war 50 941 industrial establishments, 28 632 buildings of schools at all levels, 4 534 buildings of healthcare facilities including hospitals and clinics, 579 buildings of scientific research institutes, 8 163 buildings of media and cultural institutions and 2 077 226 dwelling houses were severely destroyed, 563 755 hectares of farmland devastated and 155 500 hectares of paddy and non-paddy fields decreased.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Environment was also seriously polluted due to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' several decades-long presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has desperately obstructed the reunification of Korea, blocked the independent development of the Korean nation and stood in the way of achieving its peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human and material damage done to the Korean nation by the U.S. aggression and crimes against humanity amounts to at least 114 trillion U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has committed too many crimes against the Korean nation to count for more than a hundred years, the memorandum said, adding there is no such country of barbarians in the world as the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation will certainly settle accounts with the U.S., the sworn enemy, it warned."

The regime, however, didn't take proper measures to conduct under-water searching operations at the very crucial moment more survivors could be saved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only six days after the sinking of the ferry, Park chaired a meeting of secretaries of Chongwadae to cope with the accident. And it didn't conduct operations to get access to the sunken ship to rescue survivors even four days later. Moreover, it failed to get a correct number of the passengers aboard the ship and the one of those rescued. It even got signatures from the divers who volunteered to join in the rescue operations for school children, warning them that the regime would not be responsible for death of any of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts go to clearly prove that the disaster of ferry Sewol was an inevitable product of the incompetence and unpopular rule of the present south Korean regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits serious attention is the fact that no noticeable progress has been made in the operations conducted by the authorities since the occurrence of the accident. On the contrary, the ruling quarters are only vying with each other to shirk the blame for the accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is worth recalling that Park cried out for severely punishing public officials at the meeting of secretaries of Chongwadae but excluded herself and her yesmen of Chongwadae from the list of punishment. At that time Park claimed the cause of the disaster seemed to be \"murder-like behavior of the captain of the ferry\". Meanwhile, those concerned of the regime asserted that the sinking of the ferry was caused by the abrupt turn of the ferry with cargoes more than treble the allowed weight aboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Park regime has done as regards the ferry disaster was that it blocked the infuriated bereaved families from going to Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, at a time when the whole of south Korea turned into a mourner's house due to the ferry's sinking, the Park regime invited its U.S. master to tour south Korea in violation of the human ethics and morality observed by Koreans generation after generation in a bid to boost cooperation and nexus with the U.S. in its campaign for slandering, threatening and blackmailing the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the mothers who lost their dear children, their families and tens of millions of other south Koreans were mourning over the untimely death of those youngsters, Park made such a disgusting sycophantic behavior as hosting a banquet for its U.S. master to please him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We cannot but question whether she is a human being and a woman before being \"president\" responsible for the destiny of the south Korean popular masses and whether she has even an iota of soul and spirit of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is, indeed, a maniac of confrontation with compatriots and the worst pro-U.S. lackey surpassing the preceding south Korean rulers and the one of cold-blooded nature rare to be found in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So many innocent south Korean people and school children fell victim to the wrong selection of Park as \"president\" of south Korea because she is the daughter of the \"yusin\" dictator, bereft of elementary feeling as a human being and humanity but engrossed in dictatorial and tyrannical rule only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can vouch that the second and third disasters like the one of ferry Sewol would not occur as long as such woman who is utterly ignorant of philosophy or politics, a depraved old lady who has neither human ethics nor conscience and the worst traitor and sycophant as Park is allowed to stay in office. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park is allowed to go scot-free, not only the south Korean society but all Koreans will not be able to escape manifold disasters and misfortunes."
