It laid bare the injustice of the \"bill\" faked up by the authorities.   The acts of the \"Ministry of Justice\" against human rights are illustrated by the \"law-abiding oath system\" faked by it as regards the release of prisoners of conscience, the total refusal of the introduction of the \"special examination system\" and its refusal to guarantee  jobless people qualifications to join  trade unions despite the agreement  reached at the \"labour-management-government committee\", the declaration noted.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It held that the \"government's bill on human rights\" which was faked up by the \"Ministry of Justice\" should be canceled at once. \r\n\r\n"

According to the operational plan \"8-53\", the United States intended to make ground, naval and air attacks on targets in Korea and the northern area of China by using 50-200  nukes as well as conventional weapons in case  another war breaks out on the Korean peninsula.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA  study report worked out by an institute of Johns Hopkins University of the United States in December 1951 has confirmed that in the early period of the Korean War the United States examined  the plan to drop over Korea an A-bomb the  destructive power of which was more than double those A-bombs dropped over Hiroshima and Nagasaki of Japan. \r\n\r\n"
