            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Works Studied Worldwide \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Works of leader Kim Jong Il were studied and disseminated on a worldwide scale from January to March this year.\r\n His famous works were published in pamphlet by the Group of Dialectical Materialists of Italy, the U.S. Solidarity Committee for Supporting the Struggle of the Anti-imperialist National Democratic Front and the South Korean People, the Mexican Institute for the Study of the Juche Idea, the Joseph Gebauer Publishing House of Austria. And full text or gist of his works were carried by the Egyptian paper \"Al Siyassi\", the Romanian paper \"Romania Muncitoare\" and the Lao paper \"Vate Lao\" and aired by an Italian TV. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Victorial Publishing House of Pakistan and the Publiraser Publishing House of Peru brought out in booklet his works \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction\" and \"The Juche Philosophy Is an Original Revolutionary Philosophy\". Prefaces of the books said that his works are of weighty significance in hewing out the destiny of the people and developing the country independently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The executive chairman of the Mongolian Mt. Paektu Association for Independent Development stressed at a releasing ceremony of his famous work that the association would actively disseminate the Juche idea so as to fulfill its duty for society.\r\n His works were studied and disseminated among broad masses in various forms and ways by the Indian Youth Group for the Study of Works of Comrade Kim Il Sung, the People's Rally for Socialism of Democratic Congo, the Mexican Committee for the Study of Kimilsungism and organizations of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director general of the Kim Il Sung Institute of Agricultural Science in Guinea said that the work of Kim Jong Il serves as a great encyclopedia which indicates the road ahead of the times and revolution, adding that the work clarifies what attitude and stand we should have to build a new society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Russian Youth Association for the Study of the Juche Idea stated that his famous work \"On the Juche Idea\" serves as a precious textbook of revolution for the followers of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief of the Group of Youth for the Study of Kim Jong Il Juche Idea in Vienna, Austria stressed that his work serves as a powerful weapon for accomplishing the popular masses' cause of independence today when confrontation between the independent forces and the dominationist forces is sharpening and the moves of the imperialists have become more undisguised.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Especially, the aggressive nature and danger of the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises have been brought into a bolder relief as they were staged in the wake of the announcement of the \"national security strategy report\" in which the U.S. has defined a preemptive attack on the DPRK as its main military doctrine.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. main military strategy after the end of the Cold War to contain the DPRK with preemptive nuclear attack and then seize the military supremacy over Asia by expanding it, the commentary points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now realigning and relocating its forces in south Korea, Japan and other parts of the Asia-Pacific region as a whole while intensively deploying the nuclear forces in the region. It is needless to say that such deployment of forces and escalated war drills are designed to attack not only the DPRK but also its neighboring countries.\r\n Today, the U.S. bellicose forces have fixed the nuclear war as the key mode of war for their supremacy. To this end, the U.S. is making ceaseless nuclear tests and stepping up the production of new types of nukes. It has already simplified the procedures of using the nukes. It is the calculation of the U.S. that it may hurl a large number of aggressor troops into the Korean front in a short span of time from the surrounding areas in case of \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula and wage a war as it intends.\r\n A war on the peninsula will possibly spread to vast areas of Asia. \r\n The U.S. is the chieftain of bringing the danger of thermo-nuclear war. With nothing the U.S. bellicose forces can cover up their criminal nature as the wrecker of peace on the Korean Peninsula and the ringleader of bringing the danger of a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are past masters at deception and plot-breeding operation and the Japanese ultra-right conservative forces are immoral and corrupt guys without parallel in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They treat the people and shape politics just to meet their own selfish interests. \r\n No matter how hard they may try to style themselves an \"incarnation of humanitarianism,\" talking about the \"abduction issue,\" the public will not interpret it otherwise than disgusting \"farcical politics\" peculiar to political dwarfs and a clumsy face-saving charade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a tragedy in Japan today that the political camp there is now dominated by ill-advised diehards bereft of discretion and principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relations between Japan and its neighbors are at the lowest ebb due to the Japanese politics that has turned most corrupt, conservative and rightist. No wonder, even political elders and media of Japan are becoming increasingly assertive that they can not leave the politics to such imbeciles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is extremely harmful to the future of Japan for the ultra-right forces of Japan to seek a way out of the crisis they find themselves at home and abroad in the militarization of the country and in stoking the atmosphere of war while abusing the \"abduction issue\" to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They pretend to work for people but, in actuality, seek to meet their political interests by sacrificing them. Any Japanese who can face up to the reality should not get involved in such reckless row. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for them to choose between confrontation and the normalization of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to stop running wild.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the contents and forms of their decoration are very rich.\r\n The chonghwa decoration, symbolic of the chonghwa white porcelain, was only the sipjangsaeng patterns in the first half of the Ri Dynasty period. But, in the latter half, it included colorful patterns including four flowering plants (plum tree, orchid, chrysanthemum and bamboo) and kilsang (good fortune) patterns.\r\n Also new kinds of decorations were applied. Typical of them was chonghwa-crimson porcelain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The picture decorations of the chonghwa white porcelains were mostly based on the traditional art of Korean drawing.

This is equal to the amount of water to be pumped by ten pumping machines with a capacity of 2 tons per second for three years non-stop.\r\n This waterway extending hundreds of kilometers from the Taegak Youth Dam runs to Lake Thaesong, filling 20 reservoirs with water and adding beauty to the  landscape of the country. It has watered fields of co-op farms realigned as befitting the land of socialist Korea, while supplying industrial and drinking water to inhabitants.\r\n The construction of this irrigation system resulted in saving more than 300 million kwh of electricity as it was no longer necessary to operate at least 500 pumps, electric motors, transformers at hundreds of pumping stations. It was more beneficial than operating a power station with a generating capacity of tens of thousands of kw.\r\n There appeared along the waterway such big and small power stations as the Taegak Youth Power Station and Phyongwon power stations Nos. 1, 2 and 3 and this also helped the existing minor power stations increase their capacity, creating an additional generating capacity of over 10,000 kw.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Pero detras de esta campana publicitaria pidieron a esas pocas victimas la compensacion por el rescate. Es decir, estos tipejos practican a los habitantes japoneses la politica de regalar uno para arrebatar dos. \r\n  Entonces, por mucho que traten de hacerse \"simbolos del humanitarismo\" cuestionando el \"problema del secuestro\", no podran ocultar su naturaleza de politicos enanos acostumbrados a su repugnante y barata \"politica teatral\".\r\n  Es una tragedia de Japon contemporaneo que el circulo politico fuera controlado por esos individuos obstinados, descabellados, imprudentes y carentes de un criterio fijo.\r\n  La irremediablemente corrompida politica de Japon, que toma el rumbo al conservadurismo y la derechizacion, llevo a la peor fase las relaciones con sus paises vecinos. Por lo tanto, entre los propios \"veteranos\" del circulo politico del pais-isla y la prensa cunden voces dando descredito a esos politiqueros tan ignorantes.\r\n  Las fuerzas ultraderechistas japonesas buscan la salida de su crisis interna y externa en la militarizacion y la creacion de un clima a favor de la guerra y, para este fin, malemplean el \"problema del secuestro\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, tal procedimiento resulta muy perjudicial para el futuro del pais isleno.\r\n  Si un japones sabe justipreciar la realidad, no debe inmiscuirse en las imprudentes acciones de quienes danan al pueblo fingiendo trabajar para este y persiguen solo sus mezquinos intereses politicos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas de Japon deben portarse con prudencia y responder claramente a esta pregunta: ?O la guerra o el establecimiento de relaciones diplomaticas con la RPDC?    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto evidencia que EE.UU. toma por blanco de ataque no solo a la RPDC sino tambien a los paises circunvecinos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy en dia, las fuerzas belicosas estadounidenses consideran la guerra nuclear como modo principal de guerra para tomar la supremacia. Para este fin, realizan de continuo prueba nuclear y aceleran la produccion de nuevas armas nucleares. Ya han simplificado la tramitacion de uso de armas nucleares. EE.UU. cree que en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana podria cumplir la guerra segun lo previsto al trasladar en un corto tiempo sus fuerzas armadas de gran envergadura de la region circunvecina al frente coreano. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si se desencadena una guerra en la Peninsula Coreana, esta se extendera a amplia region de Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. es perturbador de la paz de dicha Peninsula  y promotor del peligro de la guerra nuclear. Las fuerzas belicosas estadounidenses no podran ocultar jamas su faz criminal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
