            "content": "NDC Policy Department Slams Park Geun Hye's Coarse Invectives against DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK released the following statement Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unquenchable desire of the nation and the irresistible trend of the times to achieve the reunification, peace and prosperity of the country as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bold measures taken by the army and people of the DPRK with patience and magnanimity to put the operations in the Kaesong Industrial Zone back on their normal track, realize the reunions of separated families and their relatives and resume the tour of Mt. Kumgang were the manifestation of their patriotic efforts to subordinate everything to meeting desire of the nation and the requirements of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to these efforts that the north-south relations that were inching close to a catastrophe due to traitor Lee Myung Bak were brought under control and the tense situation that reached the extremes began to ease.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, a new phase for dialogue and cooperation was provided amid deep concern and expectation of the public at home and abroad, bringing hope to all the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Park Geun Hye and the present ruling quarters of south Korea cried out for \"confrontation accompanied with dialogue\", not doing away with their dirty intention prompted by mistrust and hostility, thereby chilling the hard-won atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation through bad words and acts and sinister steps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group is trying to make the public convince that the measures taken by the DPRK on its own initiative to improve the north-south ties were taken \"under the control\" of a big country. The group said that the measures were an \"unavoidable option to open back financial source and solve dire economic situation\" and described them as \"emergency measures under the situation in which the north was finding it hard to maintain its political system\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Kaesong Industrial Zone was put back on normal operations and a series of relevant agreements were reached, the group described them as results of the so-called \"theory of principle\" maintained by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK already warned the puppet south Korean authorities several times that they should stop anachronistic remarks against fellow countrymen and behave to give help to peace and reunification of the country if they do not want to see the north-south ties deteriorating as during the past five years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But Park Geun Hye malignantly slandered the dignity and social system in the DPRK, now with her face raised, though she did it under the veil till some time ago. She openly slandered the DPRK soon after she took power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So far, Park and her group often talked rubbish as if they were worried about the life and future of the north. They used to jabber that \"the north should be led to abandon the line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force and properly opt the road of change\", \"the north should be made to understand that the former Soviet Union collapsed not because it did not possess nukes\" and \"strong deterrence should be built against the north to pressure it to dismantle nuclear weapons and missiles\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the group held an event to mark \"Day of ROK Army\" miming the great political festival for celebrating the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War that was held in the DPRK amid admiration of the world. The group is blustering that it will use the \"south Korea-U.S. combined operational system\", \"Kill Chain preemptive strike system\" and the \"south Korean-type missile defense system\", threadbare ones, to make the north admit the uselessness of nuclear weapons and missiles by itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group, steeped in repugnance against the DPRK to the marrow of their bones, made coarse outpourings, daring take issue with the autographic letters sent to people reflecting loving care and trust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group made up lies, not content with slandering the single-mined unity characterized by pure kindred feelings between parents and children. The group is, indeed, made up of ignorant hooligans hell-bent on hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and on eclipsing the bright sunlight.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's disgusting acts leave even young pupils of primary schools of the DPRK skeptical about her ability as president as they say \"it seems there is no appropriate person in south Korea. Is it possible for a person making bad words to become president?\" Servicepersons of the DPRK ridicule that \"does Park, who is unaware of the basics of the military affairs, know the meaning of the DPRK's nukes that have become smaller, lighter and diversified.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are watching with dubious eyes how Park is maintaining her post in Chongwadae as she is rejected as a \"stubborn woman\" shunning the mindset of the people, a narrow-minded \"headstrong lady\" going against the national concord and a \"cold-blooded being\" defying the good faith of compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Policy Department of the DPRK NDC sternly warns Park and her group as follows now that the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and peace is turning into that of confrontation and tension on the Korean Peninsula:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Park should open her mouth to suit her capacity, clearly judging how the things go about in the world if she truly ranks among politicians. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A saying goes that all misfortunes come from mouth and that all illnesses also go through the mouth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should refrain from groundlessly insisting on the false \"principle\" and pressing her unilateral and self-justified opinion as an \"international standard\". She should be mindful that thoughtless vitriolic languages may cause the shower of fire by the army and people of the DPRK. It is said that tongue wagged thoughtlessly will become a knife cutting one's own head. A politician who hails from this land should make words helpful for the country's reunification, peace and prosperity. She should bear in her mind that in case she does not do so, she can not evade the same miserable ends as the \"yusin\" dictator and other puppet presidents met.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Park and her group should face up to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times and behave with discretion.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the nation wants is reconciliation and cooperation and the times call for peace and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she wants to live as a genuine human being who puts the nation above all and attaches importance to it, she should stop treacherous act of antagonizing the fellow countrymen and kissing the aggressors in alignment with outsiders. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her reckless act of betraying the nation and going against the times will push her deep into treachery which is bound to be punished by history. She should not forget that it is an unpardonable act of treachery to introduce carrier flotilla with nuclear weapons on board and the aggressors' nuclear strike means into south Korea to threaten the fellow countrymen and to instigate human scum to scatter leaflets and hold other anti-DPRK psychological warfare almost every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Park and her group should not try to lead the DPRK to \"change\" and force it to dismantle nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will invariably advance forward its own way, under the line on simultaneously pushing forward the building of nuclear force and economic construction to build a prosperous country to be envied by the world, to attain the goals set by them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What needs change is Park's politics which are veering to \"yusin\" and dictatorship after derailing from the road of democracy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear weapons possessed by the army and people of the DPRK are a powerful deterrence to deter the nuclear war disaster to be inflicted by the U.S., and a treasured sword common to the nation to defend the destiny of the country and its people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear weapons serve as the most appropriate means for peace. They will play the role of completely removing the sustainable nuclear threats from the U.S. and linking the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula with that of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There will be no bigger fool and poorer imbecile than the one who schemes to side with nuclear-wielding robber and urge one's own kinsmen to lower a knife first. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park and her group conspire with outsiders under the pretext of leading the DPRK to \"change\" and go reckless to bring down the social system in the DPRK and force it to dismantle nuclear weapons, it will be little short of digging their own graves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who went against the desire of the nation and the trend of the times all met miserable ends.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group should not run reckless, clearly facing up to the trend of the times."

Hasta hace poco, lo hacia entre bastidores y pero ahora vuelve a calumniar publicamente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, Park y sus seguidores vinieron hablando como si estuvieran preocupados de la vida y el futuro de alguien, a saber, \"hay que conducir al Norte para que abandone la linea de desarrollo paralelo (de la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares) y opte correctamente por el camino de cambio\", \"se debe hacer al Norte saber que la ex-URSS fue derrumbada no por la falta de armas nucleares y \"es preciso procurar un fuerte disuasivo al Norte para que este renuncie el arma nuclear y el misil\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl imitar el gran festival politico de la RPDC por el dia de victoria en la guerra, admirado por el mundo entero, ellos celebraron pomposamente el acto por el \"dia de fuerzas armadas\" y prometen con fanfarroneria que con el insignificante \"sistema de operacion conjunta Sur de Corea-Estados Unidos\", el \"de ataque preventivo tipo Kill Chain\", el desgastado \"de defensa antimisil de tipo surcoreano\", etc., harian al Norte de Corea comprender que no le sirven mas sus armas nucleares y misiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, criticaron hasta las firmas signadas de amor y confianza del Mariscal Kim Jong Un al pie de las cartas de fidelidad que le envian muchos habitantes norcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfechos con censurar la unidad monolitica de la RPDC establecida como lazos fraternales, esos elementos corruptos difamaron la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC con datos fraudulentos tratando de ensombrecer los rayos del sol.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la mala conducta de Park, hasta los ninos de la primera se preguntan: \"?No habra otra persona mejor que Park en el Sur de Corea? ?Como ha sido posible que ella se haya elegido presidenta a pesar de su vicio de hablar mal?\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tanto, los militares del Ejercito Popular de Corea se burlan de la gobernadora surcoreana senalando que \"Es verdad que ella no sabe ni jota de los asuntos militares. Si no fuera asi, conoceria que significan nuestras armas nucleares minimizadas, aligeradas y diversificadas y no hablaria como ahora\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, nuestro ejercito y pueblo dudan como Park se mantiene en el sillon presidencial, aunque fue sometida a la avalancha de criticas de la epoca como \"testaruda\" que da espaldas a la opinion publica y se opone a la reconciliacion nacional y como \"persona de sangre fria\" que desprecia la buena fe de los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDada la grave situacion en que el ambiente de dialogo, que se preparaba a duras penas en la Peninsula Coreana, vuelve al estado de enfrentamiento y el clima pacifico regresa a la fase de tensiones, el Departamento de Politica del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea advierte severamente a Park Geun-hye y sus compinches como lo siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, si Park Geun-hye se cree politica, deberia juzgar bien todos los asuntos y hablar razonablemente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la antiguedad, se dice que la desgracia parte de la boca y esta es la via de transmision de enfermedades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebera abstenerse de insistir en el \"principio\" que no lo es realmente y de imponer su opinion unilateral y egoista como si fuera la \"norma internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebe tener presente que con los improperios se buscara la lluvia de fuego del ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo dice el refran, el que habla mal, le cae la desgracia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta recordar que los politicos nacidos en esta tierra deben decir palabras, que contribuyan a la reunificacion, la paz y la prosperidad del pais, y en el caso contrario, repetiran el fin tragico del dictador de renovacion y otros ex presidentes titeres surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, Park Geun-hye y su camarilla tienen que portarse con prudencia viendo correctamente la aspiracion de la nacion y la corriente de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nacion coreana desea la reconciliacion y la cooperacion y la epoca demanda la paz y la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi quiere vivir como humano verdadero que antepone y da importancia a la nacion, no debe cometer los actos vendepatrias y traidores a la nacion como hostilizar a los connacionales y confabularse con los agresores, siendo fascinado de la cooperacion con las fuerzas foraneas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conducta imprudente de hoy como abandonar a la nacion y rechazar la epoca conducira a la senda de peor traicion, de la cual sentenciara la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo debe olvidar que es imperdonable acto traidor el hecho de que amenaza a la connacional RPDC introduciendo a menudo los medios de ataque nuclear de los agresores, incluyendo la flotilla de portaaviones nuclear, y lanza casi diariamente la guerra psicologica anti-RPDC instigando a las escorias humanas a lanzar volantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, Park Geun-hye y su horda no deben atreverse a conducir a alguien al \"cambio\" ni hacerle deponer las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de la RPDC avanzaran invariablemente manteniendo firmemente la linea de desarrollo paralelo para construir un pais prospero, admirado por el mundo, segun su meta propia y por el estilo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que debe ser cambiado no es la RPDC sino la pseudo-politica de Park que toma el camino de renovacion y dictadura desviandose de la democratizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas armadas nucleares de nuestro ejercito y pueblo son poderoso disuasivo para frenar los desastres de la guerra nuclear de EE.UU. y valiosa herramienta comun de la nacion para defender el destino del pais y los compatriotas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien son medios pacificos mas apropiados para eliminar completamente la continua amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y lograr la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana como parte de la misma del mundo entero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo habria en este mundo un tipo mas imbecil que el que intenta bajar el arma de su casa poniendose al lado del bandido que acomete con el garrote nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Park y su banda intentan el desarme nuclear de la RPDC para derrocar el regimen de esta en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras y bajo el rotulo de inducir el \"cambio\", eso sera un acto suicida igual a lanzarse al fuego con gasolina.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHa sido siempre tragico el destino de los que frustraron la aspiracion nacional y desafiaron a la corriente de la epoca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark y sus seguidores deben actuar con prudencia viendo correctamente la tendencia de la situacion."
