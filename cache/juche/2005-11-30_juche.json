            "content": "Japan Urged to Gain International Trust before Making Bid to Sit on UNSC \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ambassador to the UN, addressing the UN General Assembly recently, urged the reform of the UN Security Council and reiterated Japan's sustained efforts for it. This was nothing but an open revelation of Japan's sinister purpose to win a permanent seat on the Security Council through its expansion during the on-going UN session, observes Minju Joson Tuesday in a signed commentary.\r\n From a moral point of view it would be quite reasonable for Japan to seek permanent membership of the UN Security Council only after redressing all its unprecedented past crimes among other things to be trusted by other Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, leaves no means untried to sit on the UN Security Council and repeat its crime-woven history of aggression.\r\n The issue of Japan's bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council can be discussed only after it has restored the trust of the Asian countries by sincerely repenting of its past wrongs. Japan can never calm down the deeply rooted bitterness and vigilance against it among the international community including the Asian countries nor can it gain the international community's trust in it unless it sincerely repents of its crime-woven past and fully apologizes and compensates for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that many countries in Asia and other parts of the world, to say nothing of Japan's allies are turning cold shoulders to Japan's bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to come to its senses, stop the foolish act that would invite denunciation and scorn and sincerely opt for settling its crime-woven past though belatedly.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
