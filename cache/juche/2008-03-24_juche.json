It enables the country to make more effective use of the weather satellite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work for developing and introducing implements for automatic meteorological observation has also been done.

Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists pretend to help other countries under the signboards of the so-called \"aid\" and \"cooperation\". Through this they seek their sinister purpose to stretch their claws of aggression deep to these countries and subordinate them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one does not sharpen vigilance against the imperialists' appeasement tactics and carrot policy strategy, one can be taken in by their schemes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to dispel illusion about imperialism, it is important to have a correct understanding of its aggressive nature. Imperialism never abandons its aggressive nature as it is reactionary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there be any change of the imperialists, it is a method for aggression, not its aggressive nature. Their method for aggression has become craftier, more heinous and deceptive than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bourgeois ideology and culture are used as means of the imperialists for internal division of the socialist countries and anti-imperialist independent countries and moves for ideologically and morally disintegrating them and a guide for military aggression against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning moves will result in destabilizing and degenerating socialism, shaking people's faith in socialism and, furthermore, toppling the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the new century such \"coloring revolution\" as the \"rose revolution\" and \"orange revolution\" took place in various countries one after another and regimes changed there. These facts prove how grave the consequences of the bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning moves are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. imperialists are becoming all the more undisguised in their moves for military threat and blackmail against the DPRK and, at the same time, persisting in their crafty and vicious methods for psychological warfare but their vicious ideological and cultural poisoning moves prove futile in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary parties and peoples should clearly see through the miserable reality of the countries and nations which harbored illusion about imperialism, resolutely oppose the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning moves and intensify the struggle for achieving independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The October 4 declaration calls for independently settling the reunification question, attaching importance to the dignity and interests of the nation and subordinating everything to them in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" enshrined in the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The October 4 declaration clarifies a specific orientation and ways for expanding and developing the north-south relations by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It serves as a banner encouraging the nation in its efforts to carve out its independent destiny because it is strictly based on the principle of national independence and the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Inter-Korean relations have developed, cooperation has made progress and the reunification movement has grown in the June 15 era of reunification because all the Koreans have firmly adhered to the principle of national independence in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The October 4 declaration calls upon the Korean nation responsible for the settlement of the reunification question to further enhance its role at the present stage. All the questions arising in the inter-Korean relations and the movement for national reunification should be settled by the Koreans themselves as they are responsible for them. If foreign forces are allowed to interfere in them, this will create only complexities and difficulties in the way of settling them, making it hard to expect any solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification forces at home and abroad are now making reckless efforts to play down the historic significance of the October 4 declaration and hamstring the efforts to implement it.

Nevertheless, they made indiscriminate air raids and even strafed civilians within eyeshot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming it a \"criminal operation wantonly violating international law\", the committee urged the \"government\" to demand the U.S. take measures for compensation to the victims.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
