This is also a labour gift presented by them to the party and the country on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of the WPK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He acquainted himself in detail with its construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Overlooking it, he noted with great satisfaction that the people's army soldiers and builders completed the difficult and vast second-stage project of the station, one of the leading hydro-power centers in the DPRK, in a little over three years and showed high appreciation for their great exploits.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He noted that the station is a great miracle which can be wrought only by the KPA soldiers who are firmly determined to flatten mountains and empty seas and thus carry through what the party wants.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave highly important tasks which would serve as a guideline in keeping electric production going at a high rate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next leg of his guidance was the Naephyong Power Station built by KPA unit no. 549.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round the station, an edifice dedicated to the 55th anniversary of the WPK, he was greatly satisfied to see the modern power station with a high capacity built by servicemen of the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He highly appreciated their proud feat, saying that they could erect a world startling great edifice in the historic period of victoriously concluding the \"arduous march\" and forced march as they built such a huge power station on their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on the whole society to earnestly learn from the spirit of our servicemen, noting that they built such a modern power station with bare hands at a time when they were hard pressed for everything.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the soldiers of the KPA are playing a vanguard role in the worthwhile drive for building a powerful nation, he said this is noble patriotism and love of the people which can be displayed only by our army intensely faithful to the country and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks to be carried out by the station to manage and operate it and make an effective use of the produced electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then Kim Jong Il guided the work on the sideline farm. \r\n\r\n"

Korean Red Cross urged to honestly admit his wrong \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the central committee of the Red Cross Society of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued a statement today in connection with a letter sent by the president of the South Korean Red Cross in which he said \"he felt regretful for getting on the nerves of the north side and hurting its feelings\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the South Korean Red Cross president in an interview with the October issue of \"Monthly Korea\" described the meeting of separated families and relatives, a noble humanitarian undertaking, as an issue of confrontation between the systems in the north and the south. He went the length of slandering the dignified political system in the north and way of life under man-centred socialism of Korean style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compelled the central committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK to release a statement on November 3 in which it clarified the principled stand that it would not talk with him as long as he remains the president of the South Korean Red Cross, that it would be hard to settle such humanitarian issues as alleviating misfortune and sufferings of the separated families and relatives as long as he deals with the issue and that it cannot but re-examine the exchange of the second visiting groups of separated families and relatives and inter-Korean Red Cross talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this connection, the president of the South Korean Red Cross in a letter sent to our side on November 4 noted that he felt \"regretful for getting on the nerves of the north side and hurting its feelings, justifying himself by asserting that \"some of the content of an article of the 'Monthly Korea' was wrongly expressed against his will and there was something distorted.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should frankly admit his wrongdoing and make an honest and sincere apology for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We hardly think that with a few words such as \"distorted report\" and regret\" the president of the South Korean Red Cross can clear away the adverse effect his remark had on the settlement of the humanitarian issue and redeem his crime of insulting us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he sincerely reflects on his wrongdoing and hopes for the smooth progress in the solution of the humanitarian issue, he should show a more honest attitude to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are of the view that if the content of his interview was wrongly expressed and distorted against his will as he said, he should lodge an official protest with the \"Monthly Korea\" against this and take an action demanding its correction. At the same time, he should urge the \"Monthly Korea\" to admit its release of a distorted report about the interview and make an official apology to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot consider his letter to be honest unless these points are solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will follow his behaviour. \r\n\r\n"
