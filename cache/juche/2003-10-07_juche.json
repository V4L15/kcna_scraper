It confirmed solidarity with the WPK and the DPRK government, congratulated the Korean people promoting their defense plan, not yielding to the imperialists' threat, and denounced the attempts of the Bush administration to stifle and isolate the DPRK and provocations of the U.S. troops and the south Korean bellicose forces against the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n"

It clearly shows that it has no intention at all to abandon its hostile policy towards the DPRK but is persisting in its attempts to bring the DPRK to its knees by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. aggressive intention was clearly evidenced by the fact that U.S.-made military hardware was massively displayed in the large-scale \"military parade\" of the south Korean army staged on the same day in Seoul and the U.S. directly participated in it, flying its attack helicopters for the first time after the signing of the \"mutual defense pact.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History and realities show that the crisis on the Korean peninsula finds its origin in the U.S. policy of military occupation of south Korea and it is getting worse today owing to the bellicose and unilateral hard-line policy of the Bush administration.\r\n The U.S. should act with reason, pondering over the consequences to be involved by its military pressure upon the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anti-war Struggle for Peace Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 6 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday in an article says that the great unity of the nation stands out with greatest urgency today in defending sovereignty and right to existence of all the fellow countrymen in the north and south and achieving peace and peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n The author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Korean nation wants is not reunification by use of armed forces, but peaceful reunification based on national reconciliation and unity. The political and military confrontation and tension between the north and the south that have been sustained for decades have only boosted the interference and disturbance of outside forces in the internal affairs of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peaceful reunification can never be brought to the Korean people by the U.S. imperialists who find a pretext for their aggression and interference in the growing tension and danger of war on the Korean peninsula. What the U.S. seeks is the provocation of a total nuclear war against the north, not \"negotiated settlement\" or \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. The U.S. nuclear bombs would not discriminate between the north and the south. National cooperation is the way of checking and frustrating the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and war and achieving peace of the country and independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Openly staged in south Korea now are dangerous military actions against the fellow countrymen in the north and for \"cooperation\" with outside forces in disregard of the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the main spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. \"Cooperation\" with outside forces which are keen on provoking a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula will result in driving the peace of the country and the nation's security into an irrevocable danger. Such act is not beneficial either to the north or to the south. \"Cooperation\" with outside forces is an unpardonable crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not a time for any side to argue about ideology and social system and turn aside from national cooperation. Ideology and social system are unthinkable apart from the existence of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south, from the patriotic stand, should resolutely reject the outside forces which seek to launch a nuclear war against the north and pool their efforts for the achievement of peace and reunification through national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Compensate to Victims of Ukishimamaru Incident \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 6 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government in 1950 decided not to compensate to Koreans killed in the explosion of Ukishimamaru, according to a recently disclosed document in Japan.\r\n The document described the explosion and sinking of the ship as an unavoidable accident and contended that any attempt to bring an action against the navy of the Japanese Imperial Forces in a bid to force it to compensate can never be accepted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary in this regard. Dismissing the Ukishimamaru incident as a massacre organized and committed under the Japanese government's carefully worked out plan to kill Koreans, the commentary continues: In the document the Japanese government asserted that many Koreans got on board of their own accord and described the ship's sinking as an unavoidable accident. This is a sheer distortion of truth and it only reveals the extremely mean and crafty nature of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government did not make any effort to confirm the correct number of those killed in the incident, their addresses and names. It even went to the lengths of publishing the grossly doctored number of the dead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that Japan has not yet taken any measure to set right the mishandled issue of the victims of the Ukishimamaru incident and has kept it buried into oblivion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only added to Japan's crimes and has touched off bitterer indignation of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will certainly force Japan to pay dearly for its past crimes and compensate for them so as to give vent to the pent-up wrath of the Koreans including the victims of the Ukishimamaru incident and many other Koreans killed by the Japanese imperialists.    \r\n\r\n"
