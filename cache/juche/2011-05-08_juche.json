To this end, they are going to bring huge armed forces of the U.S. Marine Corps to the area of Paekryong Island. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. armed forces in the Asia-Pacific region, the U.S. mainland, Alaska, Japan and south Korea are conducting brisk maneuvers aiming at the DPRK under such war scenarios as \"New OPLAN 5026\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies dare to invade the DPRK, they will be doomed to a miserable fate."
