Distrust and hatred among people have reached the \r\nextremes and nobody knows when this society will collapse.\r\n   Unlike this society, the northern society is full of \r\nhuman love and sound morality. All people in the north \r\nregard their leader as the father of the nation and loyalty \r\nto him as their highest moral obligation and remain \r\nintensely loyal to President Kim Il Sung and Secretary\r\nKim Jong Il.\r\n   The people's loyalty to the leader is based on their \r\nunique view of morality. The north is a mysterious land \r\nwhere love for the country, comrades and neighbors is valued \r\nas the most beautiful morality and people devotedly work and \r\neven defy death for the sake of society, the collective and \r\ntheir comrades.\r\n   What is the source of the morality based on human love?\r\n   President Kim Il Sung was the father of true \r\nmoral politics.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il, while assisting the \r\nPresident, put heart and soul into helping the people in the \r\nnorth, splendidly trained by the President, to have more \r\nbeautiful moral traits.\r\n   On the basis of the man-centred Juche idea, General\r\nKim Jong Il propounded a theory of morality that defends \r\nhuman values most resolutely and develops humanity into most \r\npowerful, beautiful and noble beings. He also has turned the \r\nnorth into a powerful nation in moral and political aspects.\r\n   With his practical examples, he teaches humankind what \r\nhuman morality should be like.\r\n   He regards loyalty to the leader as the highest form of \r\nmorality. He has been loyal and dutiful to the President.\r\n   He considers it his bounden duty to respect and put \r\nforward the forerunners who were faithful to the motherland \r\nand the people.\r\n   His famous work \"Respecting the Forerunners of the \r\nRevolution is a Noble Moral Obligation of Revolutionaries\" \r\nis an outcome of his noble view of morality.\r\n   The north has the leader Kim Jong Il, the \r\nincarnation of morality and loyalty, and its people are \r\nunited not only ideologically but also morally. So, the \r\nnorth will certainly overcome all difficulties and create a \r\nbright history with redoubled vigor. \r\n\r\n"

We can hardly \r\nrepress surging resentment.\r\n   The government authorities of Japan describe Eto's \r\nremarks as a talk based on his \"individual view of history\" \r\nand \"not binding on the government.\" If this is true, they \r\nshould raise a serious issue over this incident and resume \r\nnegotiation with the DPRK for postwar settlement.\r\n   The double-dealing tactics of the Japanese government \r\ncompels us to view the revival of militarism and the \r\nrightist development of society in Japan in combination with \r\nthe present government's policy of avoiding postwar \r\nsettlement.\r\n   A spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry already issued a \r\nstatement on January 10, urging Japan to immediately come to \r\nthe negotiation table with the DPRK with a sincere attitude \r\nfor postwar settlement.\r\n   Our demand is absolutely just and principled.\r\n   In response to this, the Japanese government manipulates \r\nthe mass media of Japan to raise unreasonable preconditions \r\nsuch as \"four-way talks\" and \"inter-Korean dialogue\" and \r\ndescribe time as immature for postwar settlement, which \r\nshould have already been done. It also wirepulls a private \r\nfund to pay \"compensation\" to some former \"comfort women\" in \r\nsecrecy in an attempt to bribe them and avoid state \r\nreparation.\r\n   It is outrageous for the offender to talk about \"time\" \r\nconcerning the repentance of his crimes before the victim.\r\n   It is more than half a century since the end of world war \r\nII and humankind are on the threshold of the 21st century. \r\nHowever, the agitation for the revival of militarism is not \r\nrestricted by law but overlooked and defended by the \r\ngovernment only in Japan unlike other defeated nations. This \r\ndraws due attention from the unbiased public opinion around \r\nthe world.\r\n   The Japanese government must discard its wrong attitude \r\ntoward cognition of history and postwar settlement and meet \r\nour just demand without delay. \r\n\r\n"
