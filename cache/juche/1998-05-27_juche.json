If all the anti-imperialist forces unite to deliver collective counterblows to imperialism, it will be incompetent.\r\n   All the progressive countries and peace-loving people of the world should firmly unite on the joint front against imperialism on the basis of the common desire for independence, regardless of the differences in system, ideology, religious belief and race and the level of economic development.\r\n   Particularly, they should refrain from  compromising with imperialism, keeping a wide berth of and rejecting other countries while thinking  of their own national interests  and actively develop friendship and cooperation among countries on the principles of mutual respect, non-interference in other's internal affairs, equality and reciprocity.\r\n   The non-aligned and other developing countries should loudly advocate independence against imperialism in the United Nations and the international arena and ensure unanimity of action in dealing with all international issues.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

This is an undeniable historic fact. In addition, the U.S. started wars in different parts of the world and violated world peace and democracy.\r\n   They are provokers of aggression and war and a cancer and wrecker of world peace and democracy.\r\n   Exalting them to the skies, the South Korean ruler prattled that \"today's security and democracy come from the sacrifices of U.S. soldiers.\" his remarks are stirring up indignation of the people.\r\n   This eloquently shows that although he styles himself a \"defender of democracy\", he is a de facto wrecker of democracy and a rare warmonger who takes war as the way of existence. It also clearly proves that he is a flunkeyist and traitor who surpasses five traitors of 1905, who cannot  exist even a single day without the support from the American masters and throws sheep's eyes at them, believing them as saviours.\r\n   The nation will certainly make him pay for his flunkeyist and traitorous misdeeds.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

It is Japanese imperialism that took kidnapped about 200,000 Korean women and forced them to serve as \"comfort women for the army.\" \r\n   And it is Japanese imperialism kidnapped and carried away more than one million innocent Koreans.
