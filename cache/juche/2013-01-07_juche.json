            "content": "News Analyst on Japan's Fabrication of \"Hansong Treaty\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Japanese imperialists forced the Korean feudal dynasty to adopt the \"Hansong (Seoul) Treaty\" on January 9, 128 years ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t The treaty was a document for aggression cooked up by the Japanese imperialists who bedeviled Korea-Japan relations in the wake of the failure of the Kapsin Coup in 1884, the first bourgeois reform in Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the Kapsin Coup occurred, the Japanese imperialists pretended to support the bourgeois reform in Korea, but in fact they craftily worked to torpedo it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They calculated that in case the bourgeois reform succeeded in Korea, their plan for aggression might go bust. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That was why, when the enlightenment forces of Korea succeeded in the Kapsin Coup in 1884, the Japanese imperialists broke the promise made with the forces and unilaterally withdrew Japanese soldiers who \"were mobilized to guard\" the royal palace. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When infuriated citizens of Seoul encircled the Japanese legation and lodged a strong protest against their action, the Japanese resident minister set fire to the legation and ran away. He asked the Japanese government to dispatch armed forces to take \"retaliatory measures\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After deliberately creating a complicated situation surrounding the Korea-Japan relations with the Kapsin Coup as an occasion, the Japanese imperialists used this for pursuing their policy for invading Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They entered Inchon Port with 7 warships with troops of two battalions aboard. They forced the Korean feudal government to conclude a humiliating treaty, unreasonably claiming \"reparation\" for \"damage\" they suffered during the Kapsin Coup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The corrupt and incapable ruling quarters of the Korean feudal dynasty yielded to the threats and blackmail of the Japanese imperialists and concluded the above-said treaty on January 9, 1885.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By concluding the treaty the Japanese imperialists wrested a huge amount of \"reparation\" from Korea and provided conditions for subjugating Korea politically, economically and militarily. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the subsequent period, too, they fabricated different kinds of \"treaties\" including \"Ulsa (1905) Five-point Treaty\" in the same manner, turning Korea into their colony. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that their method of invading Korea was the most cunning, shameless and brigandish one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The outrageous moves for aggression perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists against Korea in the past are being invariably carried forward by the Japanese reactionaries at present. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are openly trying to grab by force of arms Tok Islets, inviolable territory of Korea, and put spurs to the arms race for aggression under the pretext of non-existent \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their moves are aimed at securing a pretext for justifying their moves for aggression by driving the relations between Korea and Japan to an extreme phase. But they are seriously mistaken. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people are no longer what used to be in the past when their dignity and sovereignty were wantonly trampled upon by the Japanese imperialists' brigandish aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries should stop at once their reckless moves for reinvasion and make sincere apology and honest reparation for their crime-woven history."
