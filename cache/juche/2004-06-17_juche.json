They serve as an all powerful treasured sword capable of coping with any strategy of the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun idea is the revolutionary strategy with which to increase the driving force in every way with the revolutionary army as the mainstay, the army standing guard over the most vital line in defending socialism and the most revolutionary, militant and powerful contingent of society. The idea represents a revolutionary line on dynamically pushing ahead with the overall socialist construction on the principle of putting priority to military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army represents the banner of independence and prosperity that all the countries and nations should hold aloft in preserving the Juche character and national identity in our era and a powerful weapon to establish fair international relations on the basis of equality and mutual respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea calls for attaching importance to the army and projecting it as it fights for justice and independence against imperialism and loves the country, the nation and the people, while maintaining principle and merciless towards the enemy. It is a great idea, strategy and method to honorably defend the sovereignty of the country and nation and transform nature, society and man in conformity with the demand and desire of the popular masses for independence at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people should cherish the faith that the strict application of the Songun idea provides a sure guarantee for defending the sovereignty of the nation and increasing the national power and prepare themselves as the absolute followers and steadfast defenders of the idea and carry it into practice to the letter so as to consolidate the singlehearted unity of the revolutionary ranks based on the idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today we attach importance to military affairs in order to defend the valuable system and idea, the products of the blood and sweat shed by the people, not to threaten others. As we value our own sovereignty, we respect that of other country and nation. Just is our Party's line of attaching importance to military affairs because it is the line to defend the dignity and sovereignty of the people and the gains of the revolution by reacting to the enemy's hardline policy with the toughest policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today military power precisely means economic power and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should pay primary attention to the development of the defence industry in the 21st century to provide a military and technological guarantee for the security of the socialist homeland and the victory of the revolution and develop both light industry and agriculture with it as a model and basis.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It went to the lengths of openly blocking the process of reconciliation among Koreans and peaceful reunification by putting pressure upon the south Korean authorities to adjust the tempo of improving the inter-Korean relations under the pretext of the nuclear issue, claiming that the process of improving the inter-Korean relations is too fast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of late the U.S. is stepping up the relocation of the U.S. troops in south Korea and the moves to increase their combat power. It intends to spend 11 billion dollars for equipping the U.S. troops in south Korea with ultra-modern arms and remarkably increasing the mobility and striking power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA lot of the latest war equipment has already been shipped into south Korea from Iraq or in the process of transfer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither successful implementation of the declaration nor independent reunification can be expected as long as the U.S. persistently pursues the hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable are the desire and will of the Koreans to foil the U.S. interference and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by the concerted efforts of the nation. The U.S. should face up to the reality, stop obstructing the implementation of the declaration, pull its forces out of south Korea and take its hands off Korea.

It intends to spend 11 billion dollars in four years to come for deploying military hardware and equipment with high mobility and striking power there in a bid to significantly bolster the combat power of the U.S. forces. Its deployment of new type task operation means in the vicinity of south Korea, Hawaii, Guam and Asia-Pacific area is meant to carry out its scenario for mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK by use of powerful task forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this goes to clearly prove that the moves the U.S. is stepping up more desperately than ever before to increase its strategic forces, task striking forces and long-distance operation capability under the signboard of \"troops cutback\" in and around south Korea are aimed at holding an unchallenged military strategic edge and realizing its strategy of Asian invasion, come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only the DPRK but its neighboring countries are targets of the U.S. new military strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These dangerous moves of the U.S. escalating the military tension in the region are bound to go bust.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the U.S. has put forward only its robber-like demand in the whole period of the talks with the DPRK, showing no change in its attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should know that its unreasonable stand can no longer work but will only lead the U.S. to an international isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Considering its specific relations with the U.S., the DPRK judged that the nuclear issue could be settled only by the mode of package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions and proposed \"reward for freezing\" as the action of the first stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. tried to force upon the DPRK its unilateral demand, persisting as ever in CVID, this would be branded as an unjustifiable act to attain its foul political aim, not wanting a solution to the nuclear issue, and would call forth stronger protest and bitterer denunciation from the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This logic of the Bush administration reflects the brazen-faced American way of thinking and is nothing but brigandish sophistry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scenario of the U.S. warmongers for a nuclear and biochemical war is posing a real threat to exterminate the Korean nation.
