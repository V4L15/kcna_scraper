            "content": "Source of war should be removed first of all\r\n Pyongyang, February 14 (KCNA) -- The controversial ban on the use of anti-personnel mines on the Korean Peninsula is drawing world public attention.\r\n   Almost the countries of the world are calling for the ban. Since there is a wide field of mines along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) of the Korean Peninsula, their call confirms with a durable peace and stability on the Peninsula and the humanitarian desire of the world people.\r\n   The mine problem of the peninsula should be certainly and finally settled. To this end, one should consider how the problem appeared and what its cause is and concentrate on removing it.\r\n   The problem was produced by the U.S. military presence in South Korea. After it occupied South Korea militarily and divided Korea, the United States marked off the MDL willfully. It has also armed the South Korean puppets to push ahead with the preparations for a war against the DPRK.\r\n   Since it was defeated in the three-year Korean war in the early 1950s, the United States has resorted to every conceivable means and method to ignite another Korean war. \r\n   It has systematically reinforced not only its troops present in South Korea and the South Korean puppet army but also its military presence in Japan and, at the same time, made the largest field of mines in the world along the MDL.\r\n   In order to cope with the new war preparations of the U.S. and the South Korean puppets, we have no other choice but increase the self-defensive capabilities and take necessary steps. \r\n  If the United States did not occupy South Korea by force of arms, there would not have been the MDL on the Korean Peninsula. And if the United States did not escalate the war preparations, the mine problem would not have been raised.\r\n   All facts prove that the final solution to peace and stability and the mine problem of the peninsula depends on the pullout of the U.S. troops from South Korea.\r\n   That is why we have proposed that the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea should be discussed as a main agenda item at the \"four-way talks\" for a durable peace on the Peninsula.\r\n   If the U.S. troops withdraw from South Korea, the mine problem will be settled easily and a durable peace and stability be ensured on the Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
