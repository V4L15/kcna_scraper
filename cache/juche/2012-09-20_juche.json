This will only strain the regional situation and escalate the arms race.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over the last decades the U.S. has steadily increased the military spending by misleading the public opinion with a trite psychological warfare that it is building a missile shield against the potential enemies' missile strikes. By doing so, it has brought big profits to the munitions monopolies and, at the same time, worked hard to establish the system of its military domination in various parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In fact, it is impossible to intercept something with a missile shield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that Panetta openly declared the new radar is targeted against the DPRK, not China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. military chief disclosed the plan at a time when the U.S. diplomatic chief lost no chance to let loose rhetoric that the U.S. has no hostile intent on the DPRK. This is tantamount to the U.S. total denial of its words and open admission of its hostility towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Given the fact that the U.S., the world's biggest possessor of nukes and missiles, is stepping up its arms build-up against the DPRK, it is quite natural for it to steadily bolster up its nuclear deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attitude requires the DPRK to become a more powerful nuclear weapons state as befitting the \"rival\" of the U.S."

Korean Regime Slammed for Pushing Forward Construction of Naval Base on Jeju Island \r\n Pyongyang, September 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued the following statement Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime's stepped-up construction of a big naval base on Jeju Island has drawn a flurry of censure and protest from broad south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The addition of the capacity for the passage of nuclear carriers at the request of the American master has further enraged the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The broad range of south Koreans are demanding an immediate stop to the naval base construction, saying that \"it is like getting embroiled in the competition of big powers for hegemony\" and \"getting a time-bomb\". Environmental protection organizations submitted to the plenary meeting of the International Union for Conservation of Nature held on the island recently a resolution calling for the stop to the construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by this, the south Korean regime is claiming that the construction is aimed to accommodate big vessels to meet the trend and it is environment-friendly. It has given a continued push to the construction, citing \"security\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction is a very dangerous act of treachery aimed to make the island a bridgehead for realizing the U.S. ambition for world domination and carrying out its strategy of attaching importance to the Asia-Pacific, and turn it into an advance post for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the capacity for the passage of the U.S. carriers is created in the base, it will naturally mount military tension on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and increase the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The push given by the regime to the naval base project despite the protest of south Koreans is prompted by its aim to bolster military nexus pursuant to the U.S. strategy of attaching importance to the Asia-Pacific and keep up the project even after new \"regime\" takes over power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the move is also an aim to garner supporting votes for the military and the pro-U.S. conservative forces in the upcoming \"presidential\" election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are lots of U.S. nuclear bases in south Korea. But traitor Lee Myung Bak and the \"Saenuri Party\" clan are offering even Jeju Island, tourists' attraction, to their master as a nuclear outpost. Such hideous pro-U.S. traitors and despicable war servants will never be found in any other part of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lee and military warmongers are portraying the naval base as a civilian-army combined base but it is just sophism to evade public criticism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely intolerable are their moves to turn the island into a nuclear outpost of the U.S. under its manipulation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never remain an on-looker to their moves to inflict a nuclear holocaust on the nation in alignment with outsiders but take stronger countermeasures for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans should turn out in actions against the naval base project and wipe out the die-hard pro-U.S. traitors from this land at an early date."

They are, however, sadly mistaken if they think they can dodge the responsibility for their past crimes. Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists cooked up the \"Unyo-maru\" incident, talking about the \"Theory of Conquest of Korea\" more than a century back. This was a curtain-raiser to the Japanese imperialists' military occupation of Korea and their harsh repressive colonial rule over it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese aggressors aboard the vessel \"Unyo-maru\" illegally intruded into waters off Kanghwa Island on Sept. 19, 1875 to spy on waterway and others in the area of Wolmi Island. The next day they intruded into the Chojijin battery, major military fortress in the West Sea of Korea and stronghold to defend Seoul. Members of the Korean garrison defending the battery showered a barrage of fire on the Japanese aggressors. As if they had been waiting for the opportunity, they conducted saturation shelling at the Chojijin battery and attacked Hangsan and Yongjong islets which were weak in defence, killing many innocent civilians and committing barbarous destruction and plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Groundlessly asserting that \"the Korean side perpetrated a hostile act against Japan\", the Japanese invaders again intruded into Kanghwa Island in January of 1876, pressurizing Korea to conclude an unequal treaty with Japan. They finally fabricated the illegal and invalid \"Kanghwa Island Treaty\" on February 27, 1876, openly threatening and blackmailing Korea with artillery pieces and warships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They succeeded in intervening in different domains of Korea including politics, economy and culture on the strength of the treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Keeping Korea under their military occupation for more than four decades, the Japanese imperialists enforced an unprecedentedly harsh colonial rule over Korea, imposing unspeakable misfortune, sufferings and disasters upon the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should pay a dear price for all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people during their nearly half a century-long illegal occupation of Korea, urges the article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in a bylined article refers to the \"Unyo-maru\" incident. The Korean people are filled with the determination to force Japan to pay a thousand-fold dearer price for the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean nation no matter how frequently the old generation is replaced by a new one, notes the paper."

This is a blatant challenge to the north which has pursued the most popular policy in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A sexual abuse broke out in Thongyong of South Kyongsang Province less than a month since the latest case of sexual assault. This clearly indicates the real picture of south Korean society where Yankee style corrupt culture prevails and the people are under the conservative forces' misrule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mothers are staging candlelight demonstrations with tears in their  eyes despite heavy rain, demanding a severe punishment of criminals. They are, at the same time, condemning the conservative authorities for their incompetence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to information recently released by the south Korean police agency, 82 000 sexual assaults broke out for five years from 2007 to the previous year, but criminals are still at large in most cases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victims' parents are bitterly angered at the conservative ruling forces who are only trumpeting about the \"human rights in the north\" instead of trying hard to settle their human right issues though they have reduced south Korea to a huge cemetery of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Beside the above-said problems, there are countless human rights issues pending urgent solutions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of workers, industrial disaster, discrimination against women, school registration fees and human right abuses committed by the U.S. forces in south Korea, etc. remain unresolved, far from being put on agenda."

            "content": "MINREX se refiere a nueva base de radar a instalarse en Japon \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 20 de septiembre (ACNC) -- En relacion con que Estados Unidos publico que instalara la nueva base de radar en Japon acusando a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el vocero del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de esta respondio el dia 20 a la pregunta de un reportero de la ACNC.\n\t\t\t\t\tEl secretario de Defensa estadounidense, Panetta tras reunirse el dia 17 en Tokio con su homologo japones, concedio una rueda de prensa conjunta, ocasion en la cual publico que acordo instalar otra base de radar en la zona meridional de Japon para hacer frente a la \"amenaza de ataque de misiles del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon anterioridad, se dio a la publicidad el plan de EE.UU. de establecer el sistema antimisiles de Asia instalando nuevas bases de radar en Japon y la region del Noreste Asiatico y conectandolos con otros emplazados en la tierra y el mar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa instalacion de nueva base de radar en el territorio japones, siendo un eslabon de maniobra del imperio para perfeccionar el sistema regional antimisiles, toma como su blanco a los grandes paises en Eurasia, lo que agravara la situacion regional y promovera la carrera armamentista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante los decenios pasados, el imperio yanqui  ha venido incrementando incesantemente los gastos militares y aumento solamente la codicia de los consorcios militares desviando la opinion publica mediante la predilecta guerra psicologica de estructurar el escudo antimisil contra el ataque de misiles de los latentes enemigos. Ademas vino tratando de establecer por doquier del mundo el sistema de su dominacion militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo pasa de ser una ilusion irrealizable interceptar algo con el sistema antimisiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no se puede pasar por alto es que Panetta  hablo abiertamente que la nueva base es no para apuntar a China sino a la RPDC. Cuando las autoridades diplomaticas norteamericanas suelen hablar de que su pais no tiene la voluntad de hostilizar a la RPDC, la autoridad de la capa militar lo nego totalmente y reconocio abiertamente que EE.UU. tiene hostilidad contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la condicion de que el imperio, mayor poseedor de armas nucleares y misiles en el mundo, da mas acicate al incremento de las fuerzas militares apuntando a la RPDC, es muy natural que esta amplie e intensifique sin cesar el disuasivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actitud del imperio nos demanda convertirnos en el pais poseedor de armas nucleares mas poderosas correspondiente a su \"rival\"."
