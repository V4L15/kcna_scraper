It is the WPK's determination and will to effect a historical turn in all fields of the revolution and construction this year marking the 60th founding anniversary of the DPRK just as the Korean people built a socialist power--independence in politics, self-support in economy and self-reliance in national defence--on this land in leaps and bounds through the grand march of Chollima in the post-war days and to let the DPRK occupy the position of a power in the economic field, too, in a few years to come  in the same spirit as displayed in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kanggye spirit represents the Chollima spirit in the Songun era, a powerful engine propelling the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said spirit reflects confidence in rosy future, great ambition and high goal and represents the high speed of Chollima (winged horse) covering 400 km at a gallop and its staunch spirit of braving whatever adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only those who live and struggle in the Kanggye spirit can claim to be genuine human beings who share idea and faith with Kim Jong Il, staunch fighters who have personified his view on the revolution and life and heroes of the times and genuine patriots rendering devoted services for the prosperity of the country. When the Kanggye spirit runs high throughout the country it will witness a new great Chollima surge and scale the high eminence of a great prosperous powerful nation faster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls on all people to give fuller play to the Kanggye spirit single-mindedly united around Kim Jong Il and thus glorify this year as a year of historical turn which will go down in the history of the country and make efforts to bring earlier the day of final victory in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The historic October 4 Declaration for Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity provided the Korean nation with a landmark for making a new history of independent reunification and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no doubt that an epochal phase will be opened in the way of national reunification if the declaration is implemented to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can break the firm will of the Koreans to achieve independent reunification through national reconciliation and unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Conservative Hardliners Urged to Drop Their Wrong Way of Thinking \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- The U.S. conservative hardliners had better drop their wrong way of thinking and immediately stop their reckless acts of creating a catastrophic situation, facing up to the reality with cool heads. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday urges this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reckless remarks prodding the authorities to step up the hostile policy towards the DPRK are heard from the United States these days. It is preposterous for the above-said hardliners to claim that the DPRK is to blame for the delay made in the implementation of the points agreed upon at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreed points have not been implemented as scheduled not because of the DPRK but because of the failure of other participating nations to adhere to the principle of simultaneous action. The \"action for action\" principle is a key point in implementing the agreement adopted at the six-party talks. Therefore, one may say everything hinges on this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tells that success or failure of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula depends on how sincerely all countries concerned, the U.S. in particular, honor their commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. conservative hardliners broke into cheers upon hearing about the results of the \"elections\" in south Korea as if they had been waiting for them, asserting that the power change in south Korea marks a new occasion of strangling north Korea. This is nothing but a cry-out for boosting cooperation in their bid to pressurize the DPRK by turning the development and the changing situation in their favor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish daydream for them to try to gain something through cooperation in pressurizing the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what dastardly and vicious ploy they may resort to, it can never work on the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The persistent efforts made by them to seek cooperation in pressurizing the DPRK from the stand of escaping from reality would only compel it to more strongly react to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should bear in mind that the nuclear issue on the peninsula can never be settled should they again seek the tri-angular cooperation mechanism for pressure which had failed in the 1980s.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto quiere decir que se debe fortalecer la cooperacion en presionar a la RPDC para dar marcha atras a la situacion y la realidad en cambio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Resulta un delirio nunca realizable el intento de conseguir algo con esa cooperacion anticoreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es que el pueblo coreano no se amilanara nunca ante tales maniobras tan sucias y perversas de ellos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si ellos persiguen de continuo la cooperacion para dar impactos a la RPDC desatendiendo la realidad, esta se vera obligada a tomar una contramedida mas fuerte. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ellos deben saber una vez por todas que si tratan de reestablecer el sistema de cooperacion tripartita anti-RPDC fracasado ya en la decada de 1980, nunca sera solucionado el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
