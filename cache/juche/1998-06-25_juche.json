            "content": "Prevention of outbreak of another Korean War called for\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- The U.S. provoked a war of aggression in Korea 48 years ago.\r\n   Papers here today run editorials in this regard.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun says the heinous U.S. provoked a war of aggression and of mass destruction in Korea in order to dominate the whole of Korea,  Asia and the rest of the world.\r\n   The daily continues:\r\n   The U.S. called out the latest type of combat equipment and its armed forces, troops of 15 satellite nations and the South Korean puppet army, more than two million in all to stifle the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in its cradle.\r\n   The Korean people and people's army devotedly fought rallied close around the great leader Kim Il Sung, a legendary hero of the anti-Japanese war and an ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander and a brilliant military strategist, to defeat the aggressors and win a historic victory.\r\n   While paying lip-service to the \"end of the Cold War\" and \"detente\", the U.S. is still pursuing the \"policy of strength\".\r\n   Recently it placed the 8th army in South Korea and the 3rd army in the mainland under a field army system. The reorganisation of the 8th army and the 3rd army is the revelation of its criminal design for the \"Win-Win Strategy.\"\r\n   The U.S. is trying to bring the DPRK to its knees in reliance upon military threat and provocations, but in vain= the U.S. efforts are nothing but a dangerous adventure which will result only in catastrophic disasters.\r\n   \"Peace\" and \"implementation of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement\" on the lips of the U.S. hawks are a sheer lie.The U.S. seeks to stifle the DPRK by force of arms in conspiracy with the South Korean puppets.\r\n   The Korean people and people's army value peace and do not want a war. But, if the enemy provoke a war, they will turn out in a just war to defend the destinies of the country and the revolution. Once they are determined to fight, they will fight and emerge ever-victorious. That is the traditional qualities of the Korean people and army.\r\n   If the enemy dare unleash a war of aggression against the northern half of Korea, ignoring our warnings, the Korean people and revolutionary armed forces will first defeat the U.S. aggression forces and then all those who join in the aggression.\r\n   Minju Joson says:\r\n   The division of the Korean nation which began in the middle of the 20th century should certainly be brought to an end within the century. \r\n   The Koreans in the north, south and abroad must bring about a new phase of national unity, reconciliation and reunification through the medium of the successful festival of great national unity.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Japan urged to stop outcries over  \"suspected kidnapping\"\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the central committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK made public a statement on June 24 lashing out at the continued anti-DPRK racket in Japan over \"suspected kidnapping.\"\r\n   Referring to the fact that a strange row is being kicked up in Japan these days to find faults with results of search for missing Japanese published by the Red Cross Society of the DPRK, the spokesman said:\r\n   The Japanese side agreed with our view that words of \"suspected abduction\" are an expression of a hostile policy toward the DPRK and Japan will get nothing from the policy and promised more than once that it would use words of \"ordinary missing persons.\"\r\n   Nevertheless, an anti-DPRK racket over \"suspected kidnapping\" is going on in Japan.    This is a foolish bebaviour to give impressions that Japan, which  inflicted immeasurable sufferings and damage upon the Korean people, is a sufferer.\r\n   We take a serious view of the fact that for Japan to hurl mud at the DPRK over the fictitious issue of \"suspected kidnapping\", turning a deaf ear to the stark historical fact, is motivated by its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   We warn once again that Japan must stop at once using hostile words \"suspected kidnapping\" in newspapers or others, clearly knowing that there is nothing for Japan to get from such a racket.\r\n   We consider that the Red Cross Society of Japan must clarify its stand concerning hometown visits of Japanese-Korean women and take a necessary step to prevent the recurrence of groundless provocative remarks contrary to humanitarianism in Japan. \r\n   We will follow its future attitude.    \r\n\r\n"

Michael Hayden.\r\n   At the meeting the KPA side said the armistice agreement is not implemented and the armistice mechanism is paralysed, and for a durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula it is necessary to conclude a peace accord between the DPRK and the U.S. and to get the U.S. Forces withdrawn from South Korea. It went on to say that to the end a new mechanism should be set up to prevent and handle armed conflicts and an unexpected situation.\r\n   The both sides agreed to have further talks to have sincere and objective examinations on the armistice agreement to meet the requirements of the developing realities and adopt relevant measures.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

In fact, his remarks are a variant of a \"single window in dialogue\" advertized by the former dictators.\r\n   The remarks were  prompted by the puppets' ulterior purpose to monopolize dialogue and block contact and cooperation of nongovernmental organisations.\r\n   They are trying to block contact, exchange and cooperation between nongovernmental organisations and persons as well as talks between government authorities entirely because such an ultra-rightist and anti-communist, anti-reunification  element as Kang In Dok is taking the seat of minister of \"national unification\" in South Korea.\r\n   As long as Kang, who is trying to do harm to the fellow countrymen, with a dagger in his belt, remains in the position, exchange and cooperation can never be realized satisfactorily not only between the government authorities but between nongovernmental organisations and persons.\r\n   He is like a thorn between the north and south.
