The bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group, sworn enemy, hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and kicked up \"north wind\", stunning the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, the puppet group held a trial of those allegedly related to the so-called spy ring case whose investigation it had been calling for since last year, and inflicted heavy penalties on them linking them to the DPRK for no reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It also harshly suppressed the publisher and representative of the progressive magazine Minjok 21 and others related to it, alleging that they were co-opted by the DPRK and conducted \"espionage activities\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, it also let the riff-raffs tarnish the international image of the DPRK and kicked up smear campaign by the use of hack media to justify its confrontation policy. It also intensified the \"security education\" of young generation and the puppet army and instilled the hostile feelings towards the fellow countrymen into them, citing possible provocation from someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not satisfied with waging madcap war exercises against the north with the U.S., the puppet group perpetrated heinous provocation of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and is working with bloodshot eyes to fabricate the \"north wind\". This clearly proves once again their nature as die-hard confrontation maniacs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's desperate effort is aimed to lift it from the catastrophic crisis, diverting elsewhere the public opinion and tilt the election situation in its favor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically, the south Korean puppets left no means untried to block the advance of the progressive forces and turn public opinion critical of the \"government\" in its favor with the fabrication of the \"north wind\" cases whenever they faced the ruling crises ahead of the elections.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group, too, is without exception. It attempted to raise the \"north wind\" by fabricating one after another such provocations as the \"Cheonan\" case and the Yonphyong island shelling incident and the anti-DPRK smear campaigns with the use of riff-raffs before the elections including local autonomous election and by-election.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they triggered greater wrath of the people and its isolation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Far from learning a lesson from it, the Lee group is trying to get rid of the worst dilemma in another \"north wind\" just like a drowning man catching at a straw.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is mistaken if it calculates it can distract the public with such a stereotyped publicity stunt and evade ruin by slandering the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fabrication of the \"north wind\" will give rise to stronger anti-Lee Myung Bak and anti-Saenuri Party storm, hastening the ruin of the group of traitors."

Korean Internet on Ever-Changing Mode of Activities of Kim Jong Un\r\n Pyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- Jaju Minbo, south Korean Internet newspaper, carried an article about the inspection of Panmunjom by Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said that the author accepted the news of Kim Jong Un's inspection of the truce village of Panmunjom through internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the south Korean media learnt of his inspection after Central TV of the DPRK put out the story about it, the article said, and went on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question is what the south side had been doing when Kim Jong Un toured Panmunjom together with lots of officials, and why the south had been ignorant of it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un had a photo taken on the balcony of Phanmun House in broad daylight with a pair of binoculars close to his eyes. He had the photo taken with general officers and guards of Panmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un stayed in Panmunjom for a long while but the south side was unaware of this and even failed to take a photo of him. Moreover, the south side is now amid high tension as the military exercises are under way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mode of Kim Jong Un can be amounted to \"busting hard-line stand\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The author could be certain of the personality of Kim Jong Un about whom he heard only through rumor as regards the \"Cheonan\" case in 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how much plausible evidence the south side may produce, they remain most vulnerable in the north view as it had not been involved in the sinking case. This means that verification of the evidence by experts can easily turn down the rival's assertions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un's mode of counteraction is characterized by neutralizing the rival's assertions and activities by the use of less energy while hitting the weakest point of the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un displays wonderful tricks in reliance on the power of the country, army and people. Analysis of them proves that they are very diverse and ever-changing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un's activities are like the most difficult higher mathematics problem. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean experts described his recent visit to Panmunjom as demonstration of his pluck.
