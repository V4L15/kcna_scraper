They have gone so impudent as to assert that \"co-op farms should be disorganized and agricultural reform be effected to help improve the livelihood of the citizens in the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On April 19 they appeared in the puppet Scientific Institute for National Defense where they heaped praises on a few poor-looking missiles, saying they have precision and power enough to immediately strike any part of the DPRK, inviolable land. They had temerity of dare talking about \"striking the supreme headquarters through office window\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puppet Defense Minister Kim Kwan Jin and other military warmongers danced to the tune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation proves that the group of traitors has long lost its reasoning power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, paid conservative media which had long been reduced to a waiting maid of the group of traitors, worked with blood-shot eyes to build up public opinion in favor of the rats' group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Involved in the campaign were Dong-A Ilbo situated in the downtown Seoul as well as KBS, MBC, YTN and other media institutions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group should have apologized for its high treasons tens of thousands of times and chosen death by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This group is, however, challenging the north, grinding its teeth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the situation getting graver as the days go by, the KPA Supreme Command special operation action group issues the following notice upon authorization:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The special actions of our revolutionary armed forces will start soon to meet the reckless challenge of the group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those actions are an eruption of the public anger and resentment and a sacred war of all service personnel and people to protect the dignity of our supreme leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their targets are the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors, the arch criminals, and the group of rat-like elements including conservative media destroying the mainstay of the fair public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the above-said special actions kick off, they will reduce all the rat-like groups and the bases for provocations to ashes in three or four minutes, in much shorter time, by unprecedented peculiar means and methods of our own style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our revolutionary armed forces do not make an empty talk."

            "content": "FM Spokesman Slams US Undisguised Double Standards\r\n Pyongyang, April 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK Monday issued the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t The hypocrisy and shamelessness of the double standards applied by the U.S. recently under the pretext of ensuring world peace and security have been brought to light to become the target of the international community's criticism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. malignantly slandered the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes which was conducted in a transparent manner from A to Z as \"a long-range missile launch\" and spearheaded a campaign for \"protesting\" against it for no reason. The U.S., however, backed other country's open launch of a long-range missile, sparking off international furor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. came under fire by world people for this behavior, it let loose such sophism as that country posed no problem as it properly abided by international law but the DPRK posed a problem as it failed to do so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the observation of international law is concerned, it is the U.S. that took the lead in meeting its own interests in disregard of the UNSC resolution, its own making, and much-touted NPT when something runs counter to its interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters here, in essence, is the U.S. application of its double standards whereby it asserts any country which does not obey it should be barred from developing anything for peaceful purposes, to say nothing of bolstering defence capability while any country friendly to it is allowed to have access either to nuclear weapons or long-range missiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even Western media deplored American logic that what matters is not what one does but who does anything and termed its attitude of distinguishing legality from illegality according to the difference between systems as a clear expression of double standards. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the trite method of the U.S. that it resorts to high-handed and arbitrary practices in defiance of international law and the UN when it considers any situation unfavorable to it and when it wants to pull up others, it cooks up unreasonable resolutions in a coercive manner by abusing the authority of the UNSC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example of this is UNSC Resolutions 1718 and 1874 fabricated by the U.S. These are the height of the application of the double standards as they were illegally cooked up in wanton violation of the universally accepted international law stipulating that \"space shall be freely developed and used by all states without any distinction\" and the principle of equal sovereignty provided for in the UN Charter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. application of the double standards is, in the final analysis, a product of its hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the inveterate habit of the U.S. to view everything done by the DPRK from a conception of confrontation. It has systematically abused the UN for internationalizing its hostile policy which calls for unconditionally holding in check both the DPRK's use of nuclear energy and space development for peaceful purposes under the pretext that they may lead to bolstering up its military capability, a threat to the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC is abused for implementing the hostile policy towards the DPRK under the influence of the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and the UN Secretary General reelected, backed by the American master, plays the role of a shock brigade in attacking the DPRK, revealing the true colors as a servant of the U.S. This is the present regretful reality. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that only when a country is strong enough, it can defend justice and dynamically promote global independence and that the road of independence, the road of Songun chosen by the DPRK is entirely just."
