That measure is a drive to adopt a bill on the referendum to decide on procedures of the revision of the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan is speeding up preparations to have the bill passed through the House of Representatives before May 3, the constitution day. It intends to get it railroaded through the House of Representatives single-handed, should the opposition parties come out against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the adoption of a war-oriented constitution is a fait accompli in Japan and it is pushed ahead on a full scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are several reasons for the Japanese reactionaries to throw away the \"Pacifist Constitution.\" But their main purpose is to round off the preparations for the realization of their militaristic ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can justify the moves of the Japanese reactionaries rushing headlong toward the completion of the preparations for a militarist overseas aggression as evidenced by their drive to discard the \"Pacifist Constitution\" and make a war-oriented constitution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
