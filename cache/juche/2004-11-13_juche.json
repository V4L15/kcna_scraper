Korea's Desperate Anti-North Moves Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article accuses the south Korean authorities of invariably seeking to stifle the north behind the scene of the inter-Korean dialogue and cooperation.\r\n The article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been recently disclosed that the Ministry of Unification of south Korea worked out in top secrecy such emergency plans as Chungmu 3300 and Chungmu 9000 and has pushed forward them allegedly to cope with the \"suddenly changed situation\" in the north. This has sparked off a big furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not but be a perfidy to the June 15 joint declaration and a disturbing development as it is shaking the inter-Korean relations to their very foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the joint declaration which the north and the south committed themselves to implement is to bear rich fruits neither side should seek its selfish interest quite contrary to its spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have persistently pursued their anti-north secret plan dating back to the era of inter-Korean confrontation even after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. This clearly proves that they have been waiting for the day their wild ambition will come true, more interested in the \"collapse\" of the north than in the implementation of the joint declaration for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism in the DPRK remains undeterred by any challenge of the imperialists as it is advancing under the great banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation sets store by the era of independent national reunification and is successfully meeting with the might of national unity every challenge of the anti-reunification forces to this era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans at home and abroad will get reconciled and achieve unity to realize the desire for independent reunification without fail in the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should face up to the reality and cancel the provocative anti-north emergency plans and make an apology to the entire nation for having hatched such sinister plots.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 12 (KCNA) -- The true colors of the Institute of Public Security under the Police Office have been brought to light in south Korea to give rise to a spate of rage in the public circles.\r\n It had been the Home and Foreign Policy Institute under the anti-communist section of the then Public Security Headquarters by the time of the \"Fifth Republic\" dictatorship. In 1988, on the strength of the Act of the Founding of a Police College it turned into an institute attached to the college, changing only its name. Merging with the Institute of Security Problems of the Seoul Police Office in 1995, the institute was endowed with extended repressive functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Institute of Public Security has allotted more than 70 per cent of its business to the surveillance and assessment of mass organizations and individual figures and their documents out of its nine categories of duties including the study of leftist ideology, grasp of the status of left-wing forces and their problems and appraisal of cases of public security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the activities of the institute from the composition of personnel to the performance of its duties have been kept in strict secrecy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But its whole picture was stripped bare by an anonymous letter to an assemblyman in October stating that \"Jon Pyong Ryong, security police turned director of the institute, threatened and pressurized research officials to judge all kinds of appraised documents as leftist and pro-communist as far as possible\" and through the inspection of administration by the 17th-term \"National Assembly\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institute categorically defines as \"enemy-benefiting\" any publication, document and any other things with words about the abolition of \"the National Security Law\", reunification by federal formula and the withdrawal of the U.S. forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been exposed this time that the institute has conducted indiscriminate investigation even into normal activities of progressive social organizations, individuals, lawful political parties and media and engaged itself in the fabrication of a wide range of fictitious cases.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The source of the might of a revolutionary army lies in political and ideological advantages and what is most important here is the unity of the armed forces based on revolutionary comradeship. The Korean revolution was pioneered and has been victoriously led forward by the might of the armed forces closely united in revolutionary comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The combination of the armed forces with revolutionary comradeship is growing tighter and is displaying its invincible might in the revolution and construction thanks to the Songun politics of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army firmly rallied around Kim Jong Il, supreme commander of the KPA, in revolutionary comradeship is struggling devotedly for defense and prosperity of the country and its commanders and fighters united in one body are carrying through the orders of the supreme commander with all devotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is one body of common destiny sharing will and life and death with the headquarters of revolution. It is ruled not by simple relations of order and obedience but by the ties of love and sense of duty and it is overflowing with the resolution to lay down its life for the headquarters of revolution. This is entirely a shining fruition of the Songun politics of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can match the might of the People's Army united in one body around the headquarters of revolution with death-defying resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnder the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il, the might of the People's Army will increase further still day by day, grow a hundred-fold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korean-style socialism in which oneness of the army and the people in ideology and fighting morale has been definitely achieved will make a steadfast advance without vacillation in any raging storm.    \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n"
