Ellos fomentaron la psicosis de agresion al Norte de Corea visitando  reciprocamente las unidades de las fuerzas aereas de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 21 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esto es la maniobra para confirmar el perfeccionamiento de la \"disposicion de operacion combinada\" del Sur de Corea y EE.UU. destinada al ataque preventivo desde el aire en el \"tiempo de emergencia\" de la Peninsula Coreana y fortalecer la cooperacion en la guerra agresiva contra el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Igualmente, es la provocacion militar imperdonable y el grave acto hostil al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La \"alianza\" de que hablan los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos es, en su esencia, la de guerra y la de agresion contra el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si los imperialistas yanquis son las peligrosas fuerzas belicistas que persiguen la tension en la Peninsula Coreana y la provocacion de la guerra contra el Norte bajo el enganoso rotulo de la \"paz\" y \"estabilidad\", la banda de Lee Myung Bak es la horda de los vendepatrias imperdonables que sirven sin titubeo de los acolitos de la guerra nuclear de las fuerzas extranjeras obedeciendoles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para evitar la catastrofe es preciso eliminar su fuente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El invencible disuasivo atutodefensivo de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea frenara y frustrara tajantemente cualquier provocacion militar de las fuerzas belicistas internas y externas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. y la banda del traidor Lee deben saber bien que su provocacion militar contra la RPDC es el acto suicida igual que meterse en la boca del lobo, y abandonar el temerario alboroto militar."
