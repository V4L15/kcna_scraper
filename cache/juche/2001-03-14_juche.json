Korean civilians during Korean war disclosed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- It was disclosed that the U.S. imperialist aggression troops massacred civilians at a cobalt mine in Kyongsan, North Kyongsang Province, South Korea, during the past Korean War, according to Seoul-based MBC.\r\n A recent excavation of the site of the mine after the blasting of a concrete structure blocking a pit led to the discovery of remains of the dead littered about in the pit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lots of remains were scattered over a heap of mucks at a place inside the pit 120 metres from its mouth. Gunshot wounds are still clear on the skulls discovered in the pit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"As such remains of the dead are littered about here and there in the pit which has never been excavated, their number is presumed to be fairly big, and at least 2,000 dead bodies are believed to be buried in the pit,\" the MBC said, adding: The recently disclosed case will be brought to the international war crimes tribunal to open in New York on June 23 as evidence proving the crimes committed by the U.S. troops during the June 25 war.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea to buy its fighters blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Three civil organizations including the women's association for peace and the peace network issued a statement on March 12 denouncing the U.S. for putting pressure upon South Korea to buy its war hardware, according to Yonhap News of South Korea.\r\n Noting that the U.S. is keen on dastardly acts to sell F-15 fighters to South Korea, the statement strongly demanded the U.S. administration immediately stop pressurizing South Korea into purchasing its fighters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said that it is unreasonable for the U.S. to beef up its military muscle at a time when a good atmosphere of reconciliation and cooperation is prevailing in the north and south after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. It demanded the South Korean authorities react with dignity to the U.S. pressure and refrain from going against peace and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

The former requires high skill in incising the front part of the neck linked with the main carotid arteries, nerves and gullet. But this method is defective because it is liable to a secondary complication caused by the trouble of grafted bone's nerves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Director Ko Je Ryun of the traumatic orthopaedics department decided to apply a new method of operation on the basis of his experience gained in clinical practice on the dislocation and multi-fracture of neck bone. This is a funnel-shaped vertebra front fixing operation by grafting a funnel-shaped bone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n this method of operation proved successful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three days after operation, paralysis began to be removed from fingers, and a week later paralyzed fingers began to move. now the patient is in a position to sit and walk by herself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her body functions are on the gradual improvement. \"There will be no aftereffects of operation,\" said director Ko.    \r\n\r\n"
