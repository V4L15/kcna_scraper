They seek to conceal their thrice-cursed crimes, justify sycophancy and treachery, confrontation with the compatriots in the north and anti-social rule in an effort to calm down the angry public and evade punishment by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, matchless bete noire and the worst criminal, has to write a confession paper before resorting to chicanery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing is more foolish calculation than thinking she can prolong her remaining days by embellishing her crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Crimes bring punishment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The broad segments of the south Koreans should deal a sledge-hammer blow of justice at Park Geun Hye bereft of even elementary face and discerning ability as a human being."

            "content": "ACNC critica intento de publicar carta blanca sobre \"meritos\" de Park Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, 22 de febrero (ACNC) -- Ahora, los titeres surcoreanos intentan publicar hasta finales de junio que viene la carta blanca sobre los \"meritos\" del \"gobierno\" de Park Geun-hye realizados durante 4 anos de su mandato, lo cual provoca risas burlonas de todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\tLa edicion protagonizada por Chongwadae recogera los \"exitos\" alcanzados en ese periodo segun las tareas politicas presentadas por Park Geun-hye como \"rehabilitacion economica\", \"economia creativa\", \"prosperidad cultural\", \"felicidad del pueblo\" y \"paz y unificacion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de \"meritos\", en el cuatrienio de su mandato, la traidora Park cometio multiples crimenes que merecen la pena de prision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que hizo ella fue haber llevado a la ruptura la economia, la vida de la poblacion y las relaciones intercoreanas y convertido el suelo surcoreano en colonia completa de EE.UU. recurriendo al servilismo a grandes potencias y al enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado, se ha desatado la lucha de todo el pueblo con velas en sus manos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significo la explosion de rencor y colera arraigados contra la banda titere surcoreana, acostumbrada a la dictadura fascista, las politicas antipopulares, el servilismo a grandes potencias y el enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, los habitantes surcoreanos levantados en la lucha con velas demandan fuertemente destituir y encarcelar lo mas pronto posible a la diabla de Chongwadae. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto al cinico intento de publicar la susodicha carta blanca, suenan fuertes voces de condena en distintos sectores de la sociedad surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los miembros del \"Partido Parun\", agrupacion separada del partido de Park Geun-hye, exigen a esta y sus compinches que escriban primero las reflexiones de sus errores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Park quiere publicar la polemica carta blanca con el siniestro intento de calmar a la poblacion indignada y eludir la sentencia de la historia justificando sus crimenes inauditos, actos vendepatrias y fratricidas y politicas antipopulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa escoria humana y criminal de peor calana debera escribir primero la nota de confesion de sus delitos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes surcoreanos de diferentes sectores castigaran duro a esa mujerzuela que dejo de ser humana hace mucho tiempo."
