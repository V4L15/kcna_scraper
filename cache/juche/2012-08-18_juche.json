            "content": "KCNA Commentary Terms U.S. \"Talk about Threat from North Korea\" Theory for Dominating Asia-Pacific\r\n Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- The U.S. is getting evermore vociferous about \"threat from north Korea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t The supra-partisan diplomacy and security experts group of the U.S. said in its \"3rd Armitage Report\" on Aug. 15 that the U.S. and Japan are facing the threat from north Korea armed with nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, Samuel, commander-in-chief of the U.S. forces in the Pacific, cried out for getting ready to protect security from north Korea's provocations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Walter M. Golden, deputy commander of the U.S. 8th Army, said that the mission to deter the threat from Pyongyang is becoming more important than ever under the present situation where the center of the U.S. forces is being shifted to the Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The International Institute for Strategic Studies of the U.S. in a report worked out at the request of the U.S. Defense Department said that north Korea is the primary threat to the U.S. in Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the trumpeting of the U.S. Administration and strategic think-tanks about the \"threat from north Korea\" is a sinister scenario to justify the implementation of the U.S. strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are big powers with military and economic potentials in Asia-Pacific. It is the scenario of the U.S. to expand its strategic interests in the region. This is bound to lead to infringing upon the strategic interests of big powers and, consequently, spark off acute confrontation among big powers in the region. The U.S. feels a more urgent need to maintain its military edge in the region than ever before. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"talk about threat from north Korea\" is no more than sophism to justify its arms buildup and military actions to contain the big powers in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. calculation that it is most appropriate to brand the DPRK with strong anti-imperialist stand among those countries in the Asia-Pacific region and has long been in the hostile relationship with it as the force threatening its security and thus misleads public opinion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' relocation aimed at laying a military siege to other big powers is making brisk progress behind the row over \"threat from north Korea\".  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has already decided to station its marines in the northern part of Australia and is now holding military negotiations with some countries in Asia-Pacific for stationing its forces there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. assistant secretary of Defense said that the U.S. formation of a siege to Asia has already become an established fact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S. undisguised hegemonic moves the military tension is escalating and the danger of a new war increasing in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ulji Freedom Guardian joint war exercises to be staged with south Korean puppet army from Aug. 20 are war drills for aggression threatening peace and stability in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that this saber-rattling would involve not only huge armed forces of the U.S. and south Korea but also military personnel of those countries which dispatched their troops to the front during the last Korean War and offensive means recently deployed in the area along the Military Demarcation Line. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how vociferously the U.S. may talk about \"threat from north Korea,\" it can never cover up the deceptive and criminal nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop at once its long bankrupt trumpeting about \"threat from north Korea\" and cease its unjust military actions threatening the DPRK and other countries in the region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile actions persistently intensified by the U.S against the DPRK regarding it as forefront for implementing its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific would only embolden the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrent for self-defence."

Korea's Crackdown on Pro-Reunification Champions \r\n Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- Of late, the south Korean prosecution brought allegations against Ro Su Hui, vice-chairman of the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon), on charges of making \"secret entry\" to the DPRK and showing sympathy to \"agitation for social system in the north\" by invoking the notorious \"Security Law.\" The prosecution had so far investigated him after arresting him a month ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro visited Pyongyang to take part in events to pay respects to leader Kim Jong Il on the 100th day since his demise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the meantime, the secretary general of the organization was also detained and prosecuted for the unjust reason that he planned and spearheaded Ro's \"secret entry\" to the DPRK and \"return home.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the North Headquarters of Pomminryon in a statement on August 17 called it an intolerable mockery and insult to the mind-set of the south Korean people respecting the father of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro's Pyongyang visit was an extremely just conduct, reflection of his bitter sorrow over the untimely demise of the nation's father.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pomminryon is the nation-wide umbrella organization for the reunification movement consisting of different organizations and figures of various social standings in the north and the south and overseas standing for independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a body in which the three parties -- the north, the south and overseas -- discuss the issues related to the national reunification movement, make decisions on them and take joint actions with the equal qualifications, rights and duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To describe the reunification-oriented activities of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon as \"secret entry\" and \"sympathy\", therefore, betrays the south Korean puppet regime's ignorance of the elementary common knowledge about the three-party solidarity movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro's meeting with the chairman of the North Headquarters of Pomminryon during his stay in Pyongyang was part of the normal activities of Pomminryon as the umbrella body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the regime incriminated this act. This clearly shows the traitorous nature of the regime which is opposed to reunification and meeting between compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent anti-DPRK conspiratorial action taken by the regime was prompted by its black-hearted intention to stamp out the progressive movement bodies such as the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and provide a way-out to the conservative forces which are now driven into a tight corner for their whole gamut of corruptions and irregularities, moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen and traitorous actions sycophantic towards the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also motivated by the base attempt to create an atmosphere helpful for the conservatives' stay in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime is hatching all kinds of plots after putting into custody the core members of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon including Ro and its secretary general.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such actions of the regime were aimed to label the South Headquarters of Pomminryon as a \"pro-north and enemy-benefiting\" one and disorganize it with Ro's case as a momentum. So, it is absolutely intolerable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the regime persistently resorts to the moves to totally deny the north-south joint declarations and suppress the pro-reunification movement of the south Koreans despite the protest and condemnation of all the Koreans, it will face a severe punishment by the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We, the North Headquarters of Pomminryon, strongly call on the organizations and people of different social strata in south Korea seeking national reconciliation, unity and independent reunification to step up actions to force the regime and the prosecution to halt their crackdown upon the members of the South Headquarters at once and release all the pro-reunification champions including Ro and the secretary general who were arrested for no reason."
