Security Council,  says Korean Ambassador to Russia\r\n   Moscow, February 19 (KCNA) -- Korean Ambassador to Russia Son Song Phil called a press conference on February 14 as regards the more undisguised moves of Japan to obtain a permanent seat in the united nations security council.\r\n   Japan cannot become a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council unless it liquidates the past, he said, and went on:\r\n   Japan has not yet liquidated its past crimes against the Korean people though a half century has passed since world war two but avoided its state responsibility for such a deadly sin as the crime against \"Comfort Women for the Army\". To allow Japan to take a permanent seat, would mean not only to tolerate its past crimes but also to encourage it to repeat such crimes. Accordingly, Japan's liquidation of the past is a cardinal problem related to world peace and security, not merely a question of relationship between Korea and Japan. \r\n   In case the permanent membership is expanded, it should be preferentially alloted to non-aligned and other developing countries so that the independent right of all member nations may be ensured on an equal footing. \r\n\r\n"

It further says:\r\n   The incident is, in the final analysis, the largest-ever power-backed fund scandal involving Kim Young Sam.\r\n   Nevertheless, prosecution excluded Kim and his close associates in the list of those to be investigated and hastily wound up the investigation.\r\n   It is apparent that the investigation was planned and carried out as wished by the traitor, who intends to shove off the responsibility for the Hanbo steelworks' insolvency to some petty persons, gloss over the incident and alleviate the political, economic and social confusion caused by it.\r\n   After becoming \"President\" in 1992 with the help of a trillion won he got by aiding and abetting Roh Tae Woo in the slush fund scandal, he appeared as the seventh richest man in south korea in a year and topped the list of the millionaires in three years.\r\n   The Hanbo incident should be thoroughly probed and, to this end, Kim Young Sam, the kingpin of irregularities, should be prosecuted first of all. \r\n\r\n"
