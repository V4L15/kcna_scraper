Rapid progress is being made in the work to reconstruct the dwelling houses and public buildings destroyed by heavy rain and downpour and put roads and bridges into their original shape.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working people in South Hamgyong Province reinforced all the destroyed irrigation waterways in at least 110 places in a short span of time while those in North Phyongan Province are reporting successes everyday in the project to improve the flood-hit rivers and streams.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  South Hwanghae Province drained off water from the waterlogged thousands of hectares of paddy and dry fields, reducing the damage done to crops. It is now busy clearing ditches near fields and improving river embankments.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The work to recover from flood damage is also making brisk headway in railway transport, post and tele-communication and other fields in flood-stricken Jagang Province. Rail roads have been put into order and tele-communication lines in the destroyed or inundated major construction sites restored immediately."
