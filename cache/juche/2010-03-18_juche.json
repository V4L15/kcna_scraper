So, about 30,000 people die due to gun-related crimes and cases every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unemployment, poverty and the homeless are very serious problems in the U.S. where working people's economic, social and cultural rights cannot be guaranteed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnemployment rate in the U.S. in 2009 was the highest in 26 years. And 39.8 million Americans were living in poverty by the end of 2008, an increase of 2.6 million over that in 2007. About 32,000 people commit suicides due to abject poverty in the U.S. each year, nearly double the cases of murder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dwelling houses should be cradles providing stable life and happiness to people. However, in the U.S. they have become objects of speculation and many people are left homeless in the same day. This is the American society where the people live in agony and despair due to the uncontrollable catastrophic financial and economic crises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While vociferating about \"freedom of speech\" and \"freedom of the press,\" the U.S. administration mercilessly abridges the freedom under various pretexts including that of \"anti-terrorism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. continued faking up information for the \"war on terrorism\" including the Iraqi war. This goes to patently prove how hypocritical and nonsensical the U.S. touted \"freedom of the press\" is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the U.S. invasion of Iraq in 2003, about one million civilians lost their lives in that country owing to the U.S. forces' military operations and violence, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Abu Ghraib\" prison bears witness to the shuddering human rights abuses being perpetrated by the U.S. forces in the \"war on terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Americans' man-killing and human rights abuses are ceaselessly going on in Afghanistan and secret prisons in different parts of the world even today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the country with the worst human rights record and the world's arch human rights abuser.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. interference in the internal affairs of other countries over human rights issues reminds one of a pupil trying to admonish his teacher.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can the society where exploitation of man by man is institutionalized establish a correct conception on human rights? Is it possible to guarantee the genuine rights and ideal of the popular masses to lead a free and happy life in such unpopular country?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the DPRK everything is made to serve the popular masses and the state enforces free health care and free compulsory education and provides them with de luxe houses free of charge. Is it conceivable in the U.S.?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As everything that cannot be dreamed of and everything impossible in the U.S. are becoming realities in the socialist society of the DPRK, its people devote themselves to the work for the country's prosperity and the victory of socialism with high pride and great attachment to it, and find worth and happiness in doing so. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what rhetoric the U.S. may let loose, the army and people of the DPRK will confidently consolidate the Korean style socialist system centered on the popular masses that has grown stronger thanks to the Songun politics."

            "content": "ATCC rechaza informe de DDHH de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 18 de marzo (ATCC) -- Es ridiculizado en escala internacional el \"informe anual de la situacion mundial de DDHH para 2009\" publicado recientemente por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ese informe, que tergiversa gravemente la situacion de DDHH de muchos paises incluso la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, deviene un absurdo documento carente de fundamento cientifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si bien EE.UU. dice que publica ese informe para la \"defensa de los DDHH\", ningun pais del mundo lo reconoce ni mucho menos le hace caso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ese imperio actua como \"juez de DDHH\" no autorizado por nadie violando ilegalmente la norma del derecho internacional de respetar la soberania, lo cual constituye flagrante violacion del poder estatal y los DDHH de otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. es precisamente el peor violador de DDHH que debe ser cuestionado y condenado mas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En este mundo no hay otro pais como EE.UU. en que no se garantizan la existencia y la seguridad del ser humano y se violan despiadadamente hasta los derechos elementales de la vida social.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Segun los datos publicados en septiembre de 2009 por el Departamento de Justicia norteamericano, en EE.UU. se reportaron en 2008 4 millones 900 mil crimenes de violencia en que resultaron victimas numerosas personas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En ese pais, donde se hizo algo cotidiano la matanza reciproca entre los individuos armados, se registran cada ano casi 30 mil muertes inocentes por esta causa o en casos accidentales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tambien, resultan muy graves en EE.UU. los problemas del desempleo, la pobreza y la vivienda y no pueden ser garantizados los derechos economicos y socio-culturales de las masas trabajadoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el 2009 la tasa de desempleo marco el record de los ultimos 26 anos y el numero de los pobres llego a finales de 2008 a 39 millones 800 mil con un aumento de 2 millones 600 mil en comparacion con 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ademas, se suicidan cada ano 32 mil personas aproximadamente lamentando su extremada pobreza y este numero es casi el doble de la cifra de los asesinados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl convertirse en el objeto de especulacion las viviendas que deben servir de cuna de vida estable y feliz de las personas, decenas de miles se quedaron sin hogar al mismo tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, la devastadora crisis economica financiera, producto de esa especulacion, llevo a ellos a los sufrimientos mayores y a la desesperacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es precisamente la infernal sociedad norteamericana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La administracion norteamericana habla de la \"libertad de la palabra\" y \"la de prensa\", por una parte, y, por la otra, las reprime despiadadamente bajo varios pretextos como el \"antiterrorismo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las desinformaciones que se inventan de continuo en la guerra iraqui y otras \"guerras antiterroristas\" demuestran cuan enganosa y absurda es la \"libertad de prensa\" de que habla EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Desde 2003 cuando EE.UU. invadio a Irak hasta la fecha, en este pais persico murieron mas de un millon de civiles en las operaciones militares y los casos de violencia cometidos por las tropas norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El nombre de la carcel iraqui \"Abu Ghraib\" es el simbolo de los escalofriantes y asquerosos actos de violacion de DDHH perpetrados por las tropas norteamericanas en la \"guerra antiterrorista\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El homicidio y la violacion a DDHH de EE.UU. no cesan hasta hoy en Afganistan y las prisiones secretas instaladas en todas partes del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. es el pais mas atrasado en el campo de DDHH y causante de los flagelos de DDHH de talla mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por lo tanto, la intervencion de este pais en el problema de DDHH de otros paises resulta tan ridicula y absurda como la conducta de un alumno que quiere instruir a su maestro.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es posible que esa sociedad, que permite institucionalmente la explotacion del hombre, conciba la correcta concepcion sobre los derechos humanos?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY como van a realizarse en ese pais tan antipopular los verdaderos derechos e ideales de las masas populares de vivir libre y felizmente?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En EE.UU. no se puede imaginar la realidad de la RPDC donde todo sirve para las masas populares y el Estado les asegura el tratamiento medico gratuito y la educacion obligatoria gratuita y les ofrece gratis hasta las viviendas de maximo nivel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La sociedad coreana es la socialista en que se concretan en hechos los ideales inimaginables e irrealizables en EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por esta razon, el pueblo coreano se siente orgulloso de su sociedad, la ama tanto y busca el valor y felicidad de su vida en trabajar con mucho entusiasmo por la prosperidad de la patria y el triunfo del socialismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Por mucho que EE.UU. hable mal, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea seguiran fortaleciendo sin vacilacion el regimen socialista al estilo coreano centrado en las masas populares, que se vio consolidado con el poderio del Songun (priorizacion militar)."
