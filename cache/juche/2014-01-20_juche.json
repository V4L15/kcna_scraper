And emissaries were dispatched to the 2nd International Peace Conference held in Hague in June 1907 to proclaim its invalidity and condemn Japan's aggression on Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, Kojong gave a secret order of waging the anti-Japanese patriotic volunteers' struggle and used his authority to control the pro-Japanese elements. He also worked as possible as he could to deter the Japanese imperialists' moves for colonial dominion, standing against the \"Jongmi Seven-Point Treaty\", the keynote of which was to wrest the right of home administration from Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Alarmed at such movement, the Japanese imperialists forcibly dethroned Kojong and at last brutally poisoned him to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard, a Japanese book wrote: The truth of the case came to light at last. Imperial Japan let its stooge Han Sang Hak put poison into food for Kojong. In less than one hour after taking the meal, the emperor groaned with pain, saying what kind of food made him sick, and died soon. His eyes were blood-shot, with stigmas founded on his whole body.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to a diary of Yuzaburo Kuratomi, director of the auditing bureau at Japan's royal office at that time, the then Japanese prime minister instructed the \"governor-general\" in Korea to poison Kojong for the reason that he refused to acknowledge the \"Ulsa Five-Point Treaty\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The assassination of Kojong was a never-to-be-condoned state terrorism against the sovereignty of Korea and the dignity of its nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been 95 years after the case, but Japan is still refusing to make apology and reparation for its past crimes while persistently denying the past history of aggression. On the contrary, it is embellishing the past to launch reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dangerous moves of the Japanese reactionaries to repeat their past crimes are now arousing criticism of many countries in Asia and the rest of the world, including the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should come out for the settlement of the past at an early date, clearly seeing the Korean army and people's will to force Japan to pay dearly for the blood shed by the Koreans."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Warns Japan of Its Moves for Militarization\r\n Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- Abe, who comes under fire by the international community for his visit to Yasukuni Shrine, said at his New Year news conference that now is the time for Japan to start a battle to restore \"strong Japan.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Abe uttered reveals his scenario to restore the imperialist state which invaded many Asian countries at the beginning of the 20th century, crying out for becoming the \"leader\" of Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a blatant challenge and mockery of not only the Korean people but also other peace-loving people of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moves are being pressed forward in Japan in real earnest to convert itself into a militarist and war state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has rushed headlong into the moves for militarization. This is evidenced by the facts that it worked out the \"defence programme guidelines,\" \"Midterm Defence Capability Adjustment Plan\" and a \"strategy for state security\", the first of its kind in its history late last year. At the outset of this year, it set up the \"National Security Council\" and the \"National Security Agency\" which plays the role of secretariat under it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive regimes of Japan worked hard without exception to remove legal and institutional hurdles lying in the way of converting itself into a military giant and launching overseas aggression. But no regime has gone so mad with militarist hysteria like the Abe regime.   It is the preoccupation of the Japanese reactionaries to make all Japanese diehard militarists by denying the history of aggression and thus bring back those days when the Japanese imperialists could occupy vast regions of Asia in the last century, under the signboard of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\". This is, however, nothing but a daydream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is going along the road of ruin."
