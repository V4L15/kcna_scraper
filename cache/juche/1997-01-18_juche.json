            "content": "S. Korea's continued military buildup\r\n   Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- The South Korean puppets \r\nhave escalated military buildup from the beginning of the \r\nyear.\r\n   According to a news report, they purchased tanks and \r\narmoured vehicles recently.\r\n   The puppet defence ministry decided to hold a \"discussion \r\non defence policy\" in seoul every year, crying for \r\n\"diversification of military diplomacy\".\r\n   Large quantities of combat equipment purchased by the \r\npuppets, who are seeking close military cooperation with \r\nwestern countries, have become a serious political and \r\nmilitary problem which poses a great danger.\r\n   Though the Cold war was terminated, the Korean peninsula \r\nhas still remained an acute region where huge armed forces \r\nof the north and the south are confronted with each other \r\nalong the military demarcation line.\r\n   Under this situation, an accidental conflict may lead to \r\na war, wrecking peace and security.\r\n   From the beginning of the year, the south Korean puppets \r\nhave frequently staged military drills against the north in \r\nthe mdl areas, while escalating arms buildup for \"increased \r\ncombat power\".\r\n   They have planned to purchase multiple rocket launching \r\nsystem, surface-to-air missiles and tactical missiles this \r\nyear with an investment of d4,640 million, or 15 percent \r\nhigher than last year's.\r\n   The facts show that it is the south Korean puppets who \r\nhave increased tension and brought the situation to the \r\nbrink of war in the Korean peninsula and that their call for \r\n\"peace\" and \"cooperation\" is nothing but a hypocritical \r\npropoganda.\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that some nations which have \r\ncalled for \"multi-way talks\" for a solution to the Korean \r\nissue and peace and stability of the Korean peninsula have \r\nstrengthened military cooperation with the puppets, \r\nunilaterally supplying them, hell-bent on war moves, with \r\nmilitary equipment.\r\n   We have continued making sincere efforts to relax the \r\nsituation of the Korean peninsula and ensure peace and \r\nstability in this region.\r\n   But some countries, giving lip-service to peace and \r\nstability of the Korean peninsula, have provided military \r\nequipment to the South Korean puppets. This is a very \r\nperfidious act.\r\n   Supplying combat and technical equipment to the puppets, \r\nwho are seeking confrontation and conflicts with the fellow \r\ncountrymen in the north, is as good as encouraging them to \r\na war.\r\n   Fostering a crime is a more grave. \r\n   The countries must not break their word and the South \r\nKorean puppets must stop reckless arms buildup. \r\n\r\n"
