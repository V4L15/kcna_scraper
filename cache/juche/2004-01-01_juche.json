            "content": "New Revolutionary Offensive on Three Fronts Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- Leading newspapers of the DPRK Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi carried a joint editorial titled \"Let's glorify this year as a year of proud victory through revolutionary offensive on all fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation!\" on the occasion of the New Year Juche 93 (2004).\r\n The joint editorial has been issued on every New Year's Day since Juche 84 (1995) as a substitute for the New Year's address of President Kim Il Sung after his demise. It reviews proud successes of the year and sets forth militant tasks to be fulfilled by all Party members, servicepersons and people in the new year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the successes achieved last year, the joint editorial says that Juche 92 (2003) was a year of heroic struggle in which the dignity and might of the DPRK were demonstrated to the world and a year of proud victory in which the sovereignty of the nation and socialism were defended despite the tense situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the single-hearted unity with the headquarters of the revolution as a centre and our own style state political system were consolidated more steel-strong and the self-supporting national economic potential grew stronger while the socialist cultural life was brought into fuller bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year our army and people fully demonstrated heroic stamina by waging a life and death struggle for independence and justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that a decade has passed since the army and people of the DPRK started a death-defying struggle to accomplish the cause of the President, the joint editorial says that in this period the absolute authority of the headquarters of the Korean revolution led by Kim Jong Il, steadfastness of its leadership system and its invincible political caliber have been displayed before the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for paving a wide avenue for a fresh victory in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation to make this year a significant year to bring about a turn in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of the Party, the joint editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Let us reach a high stage of the country's prosperity, true to the great Comrade Kim Il Sung's idea and cause!\" This is the slogan we should put up in our advance this year.\r\n The general task for the Party, the army and youth this year is to conduct a revolutionary offensive to attain a higher goal in building a great prosperous powerful nation on the three fronts of politics and ideology, anti-imperialism and military affairs and economy and science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to exert utmost efforts for strengthening the front of anti-imperialism and military affairs, the editorial calls for giving top priority to increasing the military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enemies will suffer inescapable blows if they impose a war of any form upon the DPRK anytime, it warns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls for a vigorous struggle this year under the slogan \"Let us make rapid progress in the economy and science and technology and thus increase the national power in every way!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Turning to the issue of national reunification, the editorial notes: \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\" This is the slogan all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should put up in the movement for reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our invariable principled stand to seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will always react with the toughest stand to the U.S. hard-line policy of completely denying and threatening the dignified idea and system of our style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will in the future, too, develop our relations with various countries of the world in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and make positive efforts to build a new peaceful and independent world.    \r\n     \r\n"

            "content": "Joint New Year Editorial Published \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- The January 1st issue of the leading newspapers of the DPRK Rodong Sinmun, Josoninmingun and Chongnyonjonwi issued a joint editorial titled \"Let's glorify this year as a year of proud victory through revolutionary offensive on all fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation under the Party's leadership.\"\r\n Juche 92 (2003) was a year of heroic struggle in which the dignity and might of the DPRK were demonstrated to the world and a year of proud victory in which the sovereignty of the nation and socialism were defended despite the tense situation, the editorial says. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that all the officers and men of the Korean People's Army and the people celebrated the 55th anniversary of the DPRK as a grand festival of victors by displaying unusual patriotic devotion in hearty response to the militant call of the Workers' Party of Korea and thus glorified the exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung in building the socialist power of Juche and fully demonstrated the invincible national power of Songun Korea, the editorial continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the single-hearted unity with the headquarters of the revolution as a center and our own style state political system were consolidated steel-strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people's absolute trust in their leader was fully manifested and the might of the ranks devotedly defending the leader grew remarkably stronger with the 1st Session of the 11th Supreme People's Assembly as a momentum. The state political system with the National Defence Commission as a mainstay was strengthened to meet the requirements of the Songun era and its authority rose exceptionally high. This was an event of great significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the country's self-supporting economic potential grew stronger and socialist cultural life was brought into fuller bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people waged a stubborn struggle in the revolutionary soldier spirit, thus opening up a prospect of a fresh surge in building an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people fully demonstrated heroic stamina by waging a life and death struggle for independence and justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people did not tolerate the U.S. brigandish pressure and high-handed practices even in the least but decisively frustrated them in a do-or-die spirit. Steadfast was the stand and the will of the army and the people of the DPRK. They went their own way with high dignity according to their independent decision and principle no matter how the situation might change and what others might say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They clearly proved the truth of the anti-imperialist struggle that one is sure to emerge victorious if one tightly holds arms in hand and wages a death-defying struggle. This is a great pride of the army and the people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the victories won by the WPK and the people of the DPRK last year are victories of the idea, line, faith and pluck of leader Kim Jong Il, tested and experienced statesman and great strategist, the editorial notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Juche 93 (2004) is a historic year which will witness unforgettable events in the glorious history of our motherland and revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that a decade has passed since the army and people of the DPRK started a death-defying struggle to defend the destinies of the motherland, the nation and socialism with arms to accomplish Kim Il Sung's cause under the uplifted slogan of faith \"The great leader Comrade Kim Il Sung will always be with us\", the editorial stresses that the past decade was years in which a worldwide example was set in accomplishing the cause of perpetuating the memory of the leader and an eternal foundation was laid on which the DPRK can prosper and the Korean revolution can always triumph despite the grimmest trial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was quite just for the DPRK to have unswervingly followed the road of Juche opened up by the President under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il despite unspeakable difficulties and ordeals and this is the only way of guaranteeing the eternal prosperity of the country. This is a valuable review of the past decade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period the absolute authority, steadfastness of the leadership system and the ever-victorious political caliber of the headquarters of our revolution headed by Kim Jong Il have been displayed before the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the tasks to be fulfilled this year, the editorial says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should give the fullest play to the inexhaustible strength that has been built up despite grim ordeals under the banner of modeling the whole Party, army and society on the Juche idea and pave a wide avenue for a fresh victory in building a great prosperous powerful nation and thus glorify this year as a year of weighty significance in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us reach a high stage of the country's prosperity, true to the great Comrade Kim Il Sung's idea and cause!\" This is the slogan we should put up in our advance this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The general task for the WPK, the army and the youth this year is to conduct a revolutionary offensive to attain a higher goal in building a great prosperous powerful nation on the three fronts of politics and ideology, anti-imperialism and military affairs and economy and science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for the whole party and the entire army and all the people to turn out with extraordinary determination and revolutionary enthusiasm and beat the drum to win victory in the Songun revolution on all fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary offensive should be conducted on the front of politics and ideology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an all-out offensive to increase the militancy of the Party organizations, effect a radical turn in the Party ideological work and mount a strong counterattack on the imperialists in the ideological and cultural fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to intensify the education in the Juche idea, strengthen the driving force of the revolution in every way and consolidate the politico-ideological position of socialism as solid as a rock this year marking the 30th anniversary of the proclamation of the programme for modeling the whole Party and the society on the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party members and all other working people should firmly defend the gains of socialism with transparent class awareness and in the spirit of anti-imperialist struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party ideological work should be conducted in such a way as to influence the minds of the people, thinking and will of the masses and their feelings just as it is done by the People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatest efforts should be directed to strengthening the front of anti-imperialism and military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an invariable stand of the army and the people of the DPRK to attach paramount importance to increasing the military capacity so as to defend the motherland and socialism and independently carve out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The People's Army is the most reliable mainstay on the front of anti-imperialism and military affairs and a strong force defending the Juche-oriented revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the officers and men of the Korean People's Army should intensify the combat and political training in the spirit of staunch anti-imperialist struggle and with a strong determination to wipe out the enemy. The enemies will suffer inescapable blows if they impose a war of any form upon us anytime. The KPA should be built up to be the strongest revolutionary army that has achieved unity between officers and men, the army-people unity and the combination of military and political affairs on the highest level and the most dignified and stalwart elite force in its appearance as a regular army and strongest in military and technological might, the force that no formidable enemy can ever provoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the all-party, all-state and all-people work to consolidate the front of the anti-imperialism and military affairs. It is important to develop the national defence industry as the primary strategic task in carrying out the revolution and construction. And it is necessary to thoroughly establish the traits of giving importance to the military affairs throughout the society, conduct all work on the principle of giving priority to the military affairs, strengthen the militia and turn the whole country into an invulnerable fortress. It is imperative to fully realize the unity of the army and the people, the roots of our society and a firm guarantee for all victories, in thinking and fighting spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to make a leaping advance on the front of economy and science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We must wage a vigorous drive this year under the slogan \"Let's make rapid progress in the economy and science and technology and thus increase the national power in every way!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The economy and science and technology in the Songun era should be so modern and viable as to materially and technologically guarantee the overall national power with the military muscle as the core and enable the people to live as well as others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to hold fast to and thoroughly implement the line of economic construction in the Songun era. In order to inject dynamism into the overall economy of the country it is necessary to channel main efforts into the development of the power, coal mining and metal industries and the railway transport. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The field of light industry should make an effective use of the existing production foundation and energetically push ahead with the technical modernization to boost the production of consumer goods and decisively improve their quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to significantly increase the agricultural production it is necessary to take it as a main link to bring about a radical turn in the seed improvement so as to effect a signal change in the potato farming and develop the two-crops-a-year farming on a large scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is the need to spruce up well Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution, radically change the appearances of provinces, cities and county seats and achieve new progress in the land administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We must put all fields of science and technology in the country on the world's advanced level as early as possible with a persevering will and patriotic enthusiasm, true to the Party's line of attaching importance to science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to increase the role of the Cabinet, the economic headquarters, and improve the economic management. \r\nTo this end it is necessary to establish a proper work system guiding and administering the economy and science and technology in a uniform manner and closely combine science and technology with production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sure guarantee for achieving a victory on the three fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation this year to conduct all work with the leadership exploits of our Party as guidelines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should achieve a shining victory and success in the on-going all-out offensive by glorifying all the leadership exploits of the Party this year, which marks the 40th anniversary of Kim Jong Il's start of work at the Central Committee of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Party organizations and officials should work in the same style of work and struggle as displayed in the 1970s when the revolutionary enthusiasm surged high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our youth are the most dynamic combat ranks for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation and a glorious generation with a historic mission to carve out the future of the Songun cause, loyal to the headquarters of the revolution. \r\n They should firmly uphold the idea of the youth movement set out by the Party and the leader and their leadership exploits, perform the role of a death-defying corps defending the leader and a mighty shock brigade implementing the Party's line and thus demonstrate to the full the wisdom and spirit of the young Songun vanguard on the three fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The all-out offensive should be conducted by a Songun political mode on the fronts of politics and ideology, anti-imperialism and military affairs and economy and science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year witnessed great progress made in the movement for national reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should hold high the banner of our nation-first spirit to more vigorously push forward the movement for national reunification along the road indicated by the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the slogan all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should put up in this year's movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should fully demonstrate our nation-first spirit and promote the cause of national reunification on the principle of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity as they are the nation who has glorified its brilliant history with the same blood in the same territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should fully realize national cooperation with the stand and will to place the nation above all and depend on its strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for disturbing the national cooperation and wrecking peace and stability on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream to think that it is possible to avert the danger of a war and achieve economic stability only when depending on the U.S., prompted by an illusion about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south should take practical actions to cope with the nation's confrontation with the U.S. in order to defend the peace of the country and achieve its reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is a grand programme for national reunification reflecting the desire of all the Koreans. All Koreans, be they in the north and the south and overseas, should devote themselves to the struggle to uphold and implement the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great Songun politics is a truly patriotic one. All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should unanimously support and defend the Songun politics aimed to protect the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year witnessed such tragic developments in the international arena as the world peace was wantonly violated by the imperialists' strong-arm policy and their moves for aggression. This reality proved that it is impossible to protect the sovereignty of the nation and world peace unless the U.S. \"logic of strength\" is countered with force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation on the Korean peninsula has reached a grave phase due to the Bush administration's extremely hostile policy toward the DPRK. Consistent is our principled stand to seek a negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. But we will always react with the toughest policy to the U.S. hardline policy of totally denying and threatening the dignified idea and system of our style. This is a legitimate option for self-defence as it is aimed to defend the nation's sovereignty and right to existence and ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will in the future, too, develop our relations with various countries of the world in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and make positive efforts to build a new peaceful and independent world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming Juche 94 (2005) a glorious year which marks the 60th anniversary of the WPK and the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, the joint editorial calls on all the servicepersons, people and youth to significantly greet the anniversaries with proud achievements in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

Earlier, on Dec. 8, 9 and 10 an RC-135 strategic reconnaissance plane based overseas made shuttle flights above the areas of Taebu island, Yangphyong and Yangyang for espionage on the depth of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On Dec. 26 an EP-3 electronic reconnaissance plane searched the coast and seabed of the DPRK while making shuttle flights above the East Sea and West Sea of Korea. On Dec. 16, 17 and 18 an E-3 commanding plane commanded flying corps engaged in a war exercise while flying above the areas of Kongju, Yongdong and Richon and, at the same time, committed an espionage on objects of the north side along the Military Demarcation Line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists also let fly RC-7B, RC-12, RF-4C and other tactical reconnaissance planes for an aerial espionage on the frontline and coastal areas of the north side by shuttle flights between Tokjok island and Phochon areas and between Phochon and Sokcho areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such aerial espionage fully shows that the U.S. imperialists are watching for a chance to make a surprise attack on the DPRK in a bid to stifle it by \"strength\".    \r\n\r\n"
