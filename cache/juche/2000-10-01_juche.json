It should be achieved by the efforts of the Korean nation itself in its interests according to its will and demand for independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation should thoroughly reject intervention of outside forces and discharge their responsibility and exercise their right as the master in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to achieve the reunification of the country by the efforts of the Korean nation itself, all its members should arm themselves with the spirit of national independence and thoroughly oppose and reject flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should have a high degree of awareness that they are responsible for national reunification, and cherish the fixed faith and will to reunify the country by their own efforts despite any ordeals and difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to achieve the cause of national reunification independently, it is imperative to firmly build the driving force of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The whole Korean nation should firmly unite regardless of differences in ideology, religious belief and system and discharge their responsibility and role as the master in the struggle for national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
