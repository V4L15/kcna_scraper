            "content": "DPRK to Certainly Force Japan to Pay for Crackdown upon Chongryon: KCNA Commentary \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries' suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) has reached an intolerable limit.\r\n Visits of officials of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan to their homeland by Ship \"Mangyongbong-92\" are banned by law, watch and persecution of them have been intensified and the assaults on Korean schools and their students have become pronounced. Japan is swept by a whirlwind of crackdown upon Chongryon and Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The suppression of Chongryon and xenophobia against Koreans in Japan are an intolerable challenge and provocation against the DPRK as they are an extremely grave development, a product of the Japanese authorities' hostile policy towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to the world, the Koreans in Japan are those who were forcibly taken there by the Japanese imperialists to do slave labor and their descendants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to guarantee the Koreans in Japan their national rights and convenience in their living both in the light of its moral commitment to own responsibility for the crimes committed by it against the Korean people in the past and apologize for them and the requirements of international law which calls for respecting the legal status of foreign citizens and those of humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are despising and persecuting the Koreans in Japan in violation of their rights to maintain political and legal and kindred ties with their homeland through their visits to their homeland, etc. as proud overseas citizens of the socialist country, though they are provided for by international law. Their behavior is unjustifiable as it means that they have abandoned all their commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"international convention on putting an end to all forms of racial discrimination\" adopted at the UN in 1965 stipulates that any discrimination, rejection and restriction of anyone on account of race and nationality and so on belong to racial discrimination and any organization inciting these practices and those affiliated to it are liable to punishment for being international criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should hold the Japanese reactionaries hell-bent on the crackdown upon Chongryon and Koreans in Japan wholly accountable for the international crimes and mete out a stern judgment to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should stop their moves to achieve the sinister aim sought by their pressure upon the DPRK, taking officials of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan as hostages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their despicable behavior would do the DPRK-Japan relations nothing good but only betray their rude nature and weakness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no machination can they break the faith and patriotic will of the officials of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any provocation and suppression of them are little short of an infringement upon the sovereign rights of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese reactionaries persist in their anti-Chongryon campaign defying the DPRK's repeated warnings, this will only touch off bitterer anti-Japanese sentiment among the Korean people and add to the debts Japan has refused to pay to them for a long period of time.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What is essential in the struggle of the popular masses for independence is to protect the sovereignty of their country and the dignity of their nation. Sovereignty is what keeps each country and nation alive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An independent people should not allow anyone to infringe upon the sovereignty of their country and the dignity of their nation under any circumstances but stand up firm against such practice. This necessity is proven by the fact that the people's struggle for independence and peace has unprecedentedly mounted in the international arena this year and the imperialists, accordingly, stand further isolated and rejected by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the vigorous struggle of the world's progressive forces for independence against imperialism that the movement for global independence has victoriously advanced, meeting the vicious challenges of the reactionaries of history this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive countries of the world have waged a dynamic struggle against the imperialists' military intervention and aggression against other sovereign states, regarding them as an infringement upon their own sovereignty, and check and frustrate the imperialists' high-handed and arbitrary practices and unilateral policy. Various countries have increased their defence capability to cope with the imperialists' threat, blackmail and pressure. As a result, the world's progressive forces have grown stronger, accelerating the process of global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people of the world will intensify their struggle under the uplifted banner of independence and peace and surely emerge victorious in the cause of global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is dynamically inspiring all the members of the Korean nation to the accomplishment of the cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for independent reunification is a movement for achieving the country's reunification independently by pooling the efforts of the Korean nation, rejecting outside forces. It demands that the whole nation give priority to the nation's dignity and interests and struggle with the view and morale of attaching importance to the nation and in the Korean nation first spirit. It is the main substance of this movement to frustrate the domination and interference of outside forces and put an end to the treacheries of the traitorous forces teaming up with them, giving fullest scope to national self-respect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for peace against war is a movement to achieve a stable peace and peaceful reunification, clearing away dark clouds of war carried over the Korean Peninsula by outside forces. This movement is a patriotic struggle of justice for the Korean nation aspiring after peace and reunification to closely unite and firmly defend peace and security and drive the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops out of south Korea. It can score a proper success only when the banner of \"By our nation itself\" is held high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for great national unity is a movement for all the Koreans to get united for national reunification, irrespective of differences in idea and ideology, system and party and political affiliation, and further tighten solidarity and alliance among organizations of reunification movement. It can have a powerful impetus only when it is guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" This movement must uphold \"By our nation itself\" as its basic idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is, indeed, the main idea and vitality of the patriotic movement for independent reunification, for peace against war and for great national unity and it is the banner of victory glorifying the present June 15 era of reunification.
