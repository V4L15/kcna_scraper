            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Japan's stand towards U.S. MD \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- The Japanese foreign minister recently said that Japan understands the necessity of the U.S. missile defense program and there is no change in the stand of the Japanese government towards it.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary, which says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unpardonable that Japan expressed \"understanding\" toward the U.S. MD program which is being pushed forward under the unreasonable pretext of \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is chiming in with the U.S. MD program out of the deep-rooted hostility towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unchangeable intention of the Japanese reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK in collaboration with the United States. Japan's joining the United States in taking issue with the DPRK is an expression of the open U.S.-toeing policy and an extension of the hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should know that it will favour Japan to live with its own view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese authorities do not give up their habitual U.S.-toeing stance, it will wreak havoc with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ambition to isolate and stifle the DPRK is an infeasible illusion. Japan cannot approach the fast changing political situation with its own view unless it gets rid of the U.S.-toeing stance.    \r\n\r\n"

Its assertion is a sophism designed to cover up its criminal purpose. \r\n The U.S. is the only one country that has the largest number of nuclear arms and missiles in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The missiles the U.S. is trying to intercept are not ours but the missiles from other big countries that may attain superiority over its strategic arms. It is trying to set up state-of-the-art missile defense so as to disable strategic offensive weapons of those countries. It is the U.S. ulterior intention to contain all elements lying in the way of its efforts to carry out a strategy for world supremacy and use nuclear arms and missiles unchallenged as it pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. tries to attain a sinister political, military strategic purpose against the DPRK through the medium of missiles, the DPRK is compelled to counter its moves with sharpened vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has no reason and right to slander the self-defensive countermeasure of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

After designating the DPRK as the \"enemy no. 1\" the U.S. is running wild to achieve its aim of aggression at any cost while pulling up the DPRK over the \"issue of conventional weapons.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is revealing its true color as the obstructer of independent reunification of Korea and a cancer-like entity in the way of reunification by further intensifying war maneuvers against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is allocating 14 billion dollars every year for the upkeep of its troops in South Korea for war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose elements' criminal hostile policy toward the DPRK and war maneuvers are no more than a foolish attempt to stem the trend of history.    \r\n\r\n"
