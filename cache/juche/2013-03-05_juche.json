            "content": "Spokesman for Supreme Command of KPA Clarifies Important Measures to Be Taken by It\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t On Dec. 12 last year the DPRK legitimately and successfully launched a satellite for peaceful purposes, ensuring international transparency, going beyond practice, and choosing a comparatively mild situation for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seizing the DPRK's satellite launch as an occasion for stifling it from the outset, the U.S. and its allies deliberately negated the DPRK's sovereignty over its satellite launch. They finally prodded the UN Security Council into adopting a \"resolution on sanctions\" before opting for high-handed hostile acts against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These hostile acts are still going on. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this situation the DPRK was compelled to take practical counteractions to defend the security and sovereignty of the country. On Feb. 12 it admirably and successfully conducted the third underground nuclear test for self-defence at the highest level as part of those counteractions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. imperialists and their allied forces including south Korea are making more persistent and desperate efforts to slap new tougher \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, far from drawing a due lesson. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with this, they kicked off again the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises to stifle the DPRK by force of arms by mobilizing huge armed forces of aggression. They will reportedly last for two months from March 1.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unlike last year the current joint military exercises will be participated in by super-large nuclear-powered carrier task force carrying at least 100 nuclear warheads, B-52H strategic bombers and other means of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces for making ground, sea and air nuclear strikes and its allied forces including south Korea, U.K. and Australia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From this point of view, the exercises cannot be construed otherwise than the most dangerous nuclear war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK and the most undisguised military provocation to be made by a group of all hues of hostile forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This serious situation clearly indicates that the actions of the U.S., south Korea and other hostile forces to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK are now leading to a military offensive for aggression, going beyond the level of outrageous economic \"sanctions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing situation, the Supreme Command of the KPA which is responsible for the national defence and security of the country and the destiny of the nation sent a meaningful warning message to the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces through the KPA Panmunjom mission on February 23. It warned them that if they ignite a war of aggression in the end, from that moment their fate will be hung by a thread with every hour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the joint military exercises have persisted and the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces have become all the more undisguised in their base moves to kick up their \"sanctions.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking back on history, the Korean people have neither shot even a single arrow nor thrown a single stone at the land of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, however, working with bloodshot eyes to swallow up the DPRK, not content with having incurred the pent-up grudge of the Korean people which can never be settled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the south Korean puppet forces steeped in worship and sycophancy toward the U.S. are dancing to its tune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Of late Kim Kwan Jin, puppet minister of Defense, and Jong Sung Jo, chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, inspected frontline army corps, fleet command and guided missile units where they blustered that a sort of military provocation is expected from the north and cried out for making \"deadly strikes\" and \"preemptive strikes\" at the \"bases for provocations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as these guys are concerned, they are a group of traitors who pushed the inter-Korean relations to a collapse together with traitor Lee Myung Bak who knows nothing about politics and military affairs. They are military gangsters who go reckless, unaware of what their master U.S. has in mind, what is the intention of the neighbouring countries and what all fellow countrymen and nation desire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities, too, are crying out for the dismantlement of nukes and halt to provocation as dictated by their master, without knowing what is precious wealth for the nation. They move like a robot and repeat anything like a parrot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sovereignty and dignity of the nation are violated and the supreme interests of the country are seriously threatened by the U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people, and maniacs of confrontation with fellow countrymen grouping worst traitors. The army and people of the DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this fact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the KPA Supreme Command is authorized to declare the following important measures:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, it will take the second and third strong practical counteractions in succession to cope with the high-handed war acts of the U.S. and all other hostile forces as it had already declared. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK never make an empty talk. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the mettle of Songun Korea to do what it is determined to do. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It won victories in the two wars and has advanced along the road of victory despite manifold difficulties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army groups on the front, ground forces, the navy, air and anti-air units, strategic rocket units of the KPA, the Worker-Peasant Red Guards and the Young Red Guards have launched an all-out action according to the operational plan finally signed by the dear respected Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. imperialists seek to attack the DPRK even with nuclear weapons, it will counter them with diversified precision nuclear strike means of Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those means are bound to be launched once their buttons are pressed, and the enemies' strongholds be turned into a sea in flames.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This land is neither the Balkans nor Iraq and Libya.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK have everything including lighter and smaller nukes unlike what they had in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, the KPA Supreme Command will make the Korean Armistice Agreement totally nullified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war maneuvers being staged by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces are a vivid expression of their systematic violation of the AA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the Supreme Command of the KPA will completely declare invalid the AA, which has existed for form's sake from March 11, the day when the war maneuvers will enter into a full-dress stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will make a strike of justice at any target anytime as it pleases without limit, not bound to the AA, and achieve the great cause of the country's reunification, the cherished desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the KPA Supreme Command will totally stop the activities of the Panmunjom mission of the KPA which was tentatively established and operated by it as a negotiating body for establishing a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard it will simultaneously make a decision to cut off the Panmunjom DPRK-U.S. military telephone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our choice has become clear now that the moves of all hostile forces to encroach upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK are reaching a dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the unshakable stand of the army and people of the DPRK and the mode of counteraction of Mt. Paektu style to counter enemies coming in attack with a dagger with a sword, a rifle with an artillery piece and nukes with precision nuclear strike means of Korean style more powerful than them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and their allies should not forget even a moment that they are standing at the crossroads of their life and death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A final victory is in store for the army and people of the DPRK who are all out to protect its sovereignty."

            "content": "Japan's Move to Evade Responsibility for Its Past Crimes of Sexual Slavery Assailed\r\n Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- At the end of last year Japanese Prime Minister Abe expressed his will to reexamine \"Kono's statement\" which admitted Japan's past crimes such as forced sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army and made an apology for form's sake. Recently he claimed that there is no evidence proving that the soldiers of the Imperial Japanese Army stormed dwellings and forcibly took away women as \"comfort women\". \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nonsensical is the Japanese chief executive's insistence that there is no evidence of sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries are doggedly evading admission, apology and reparation for the heinous inhumane crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past.

This will make Japan, a defeated nation, isolated, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This guy ignorant of what makes Japan further isolated is holding the post of the advisor to Abe for diplomacy policy, an indication of the level of diplomacy of the Japanese authorities. Though belatedly, they should be clearly aware that the issue related to sexual slavery by the Japanese imperialist aggressor troops would be expanded and Japan would experience a bitter agony of shame before the international community in case it continues evading the state responsibility and reparation for the past crimes. World people query Japanese politicians resorting to a sleight of hand, far from admitting and apologizing for the past crimes, how long they would act basely. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A touchstone judging whether Japan achieves development and prosperity as a pacifist state or perishes, being forsaken as a militarist aggressor state is its honest reflection on the past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities had better lend an ear to just voices of the international community and make a bold decision to break with the disgraceful past."

Popular de Corea hizo publica el dia 5 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 12 de diciembre del ano pasado, la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea lanzo de manera justa y exitosa el satelite artificial con fines pacificos asegurando la transparencia internacional por encima de la costumbre y optando el momento relativamente tranquilo de la situacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, Estados Unidos y sus satelites, que desde el principio planearon convertir el lanzamiento de tal satelite en una oportunidad para aplastar a la RPDC, negaron  obstinadamente el derecho de soberania de la RPDC al lanzamiento de satelite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl final, adoptaron la \"resolucion de sancion\" movilizando el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU y tomaron el camino de hostilizar sin ton ni son la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal acto hostil continua hasta este momento ano tras ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal circunstancia, la RPDC realizo con exito en el nivel mas elevado el 12 de febrero la tercera prueba nuclear subterranea como un eslabon de las contramedidas sustanciales para defender la seguridad y soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, los imperialistas yanquis, los titeres surcoreanos y otros seguidores, en vez de sacar la debida leccion, se desesperan con mas tenacidad para aprobar una nueva \"sancion\" mas fuerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfechos de tal complot, emprendieron el camino de volver a desarrollar durante los 60 dias a partir del dia primero del mes en curso los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" para aplastar de manera militar a la RPDC movilizando las enormes fuerzas armadas de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA diferencia del ano pasado, los presentes simulacros planean movilizar mucho el colectivo de ataque de portaaviones supergrande de propulsion nuclear de las tropas agresoras yanquis cargado de mas de 100 ojivas nucleares, el bombardero estrategico B-52H y otros medios de ataques nucleares terrestres, navales y aereos y hasta las fuerzas armadas de los titeres surcoreanos, Gran Bretana, Australia y otros paises satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tal sentido, los calificamos del mas peligroso alboroto de guerra nuclear cuyo blanco es la RPDC y de la mas abierta provocacion militar de todas las fuerzas hostiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal situacion muestra fehacientemente que la violacion de la soberania de la RPDC por EE.UU., los titeres surcoreanos y otras fuerzas hostiles paso la esfera de \"sancion economica\" y se dirige a la abierta y agresiva ofensiva militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon respecto a tal situacion creada, la Comandancia Suprema del EPC, encargada de la defensa nacional y seguridad del pais y asumida del destino de la nacion, emitio el 23 de febrero pasado a los agresores norteamericanos el aviso de advertencia via telefonica a traves de la representacion de Phanmunjom de que si encienden por fin la mecha de la guerra de agresion, desde ese momento correra el tiempo mas fatigoso en que sera descontado minuto por minuto y segundo por segundo su destino miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, prosiguen los aventureros entrenamientos militares conjuntos y se torna cada dia mas abierta la vil conspiracion del imperio y los titeres surcoreanos para armar la campana de \"sancion\" anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistoricamente, el pueblo coreano no ha tirado nunca ni una flecha ni piedra al territorio norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el imperio, insatisfecho de haber dejado el indeleble rencor de sangre a la RPDC, actua desesperadamente para ocupar a esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que los titeres surcoreanos, contagiados de adoracion al imperio y el servilismo a  grandes potencias, se suman a tales maquinaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo en estos dias, Kim Kwan Jin, ministro titere de Defensa Nacional, y Jong Sung Jo, jefe de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor, recorrieron los cuerpos en el frente avanzado, la comandancia de flota y las unidades de proyectiles teledirigidos, ocasiones en las cuales hablan tanto del \"ataque horroroso\" y \"ataque preventivo\" a los \"puntos originales de provocacion\" divulgando que se preve la llamada \"provocacion militar\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos tipejos son la horda de los traidores, que interrumpio por completo las relaciones intercoreanas junto con el traidor Lee Myung Bak carente de la politica y los asuntos militares, y son los gangsteres militares que andan atareados sin saber que piensa su amo gringo, cual es la intencion oculta de los paises vecinos y que desean todos los connacionales y la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA porfia, las autoridades titeres surcoreanas, sin saber cual es el patrimonio valioso de la nacion, se portan como un robot e imitan como papagayos a la orden de su amo yanqui hablando tanto de la renuncia nuclear y el cese de la provocacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC no pueden estar con brazos cruzados ante la realidad en que se violan la soberania y la dignidad de la nacion y se ve amenazado el maximo interes del pais, precisamente debido a  EE.UU., enemigo jurado del pueblo coreano, y los maniacos de la confrontacion fratricida, horda de traidores sin precedente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl portavoz de la Comandancia Suprema del EPC, por encargo, aclara al interior y exterior del pais, las siguientes medidas importantes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, la Comandancia Suprema del EPC tomara consecutivamente la segunda y tercera contramedidas fuertes y practicas frente al brutal acto belico de EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles como ya habia declarado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC no conocen las palabras hueras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCumplir lo decidido, esto es el temperamento de la Corea del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo confirma la pasada historia en que vencio a los enemigos en dos guerras revolucionarias  y ha recorrido por el camino victorioso superando toda clase de pruebas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl colectivo de las tropas del frente y otras unidades de las fuerzas terrestres, navales, aereas y antiaereas, los destacamentos de cohetes estrategicos, el Ejercito Rojo Obrero-Campesino y la Guardia Juvenil Roja ya han entrado en el estado de enfrentamiento total segun el plan operacional firmado finalmente por el Comandante Supremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa que el imperialismo yanqui nos invade con armas nucleares, tambien nosotros le enfrentaremos con los diversificados medios de golpe nuclear a precision a nuestro estilo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi  apretamos el boton se descargaran fuegos, que convertiran todos en el mar de fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste territorio no es la peninsula de Los Balcanes ni Irak ni Libia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA diferencia del tiempo pasado, el ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC tienen lo todo incluyendo las armas nucleares pequenas y ligeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, invalidara completamente el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente simulacro, que desarrollan los imperialistas yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos, es tambien la demostracion concentrada del sistematico acto destructivo al mencionado acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, la Comandancia Suprema del EPC invalidara por completo el vigor de ese acuerdo, que venia manteniendose formalmente, desde el proximo dia 11 de marzo en que pasara a la etapa decisiva el presente entrenamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi lograremos la gran causa de la reunificacion de la patria, anhelo de la nacion, tras dar el ataque de justicia segun nuestra decision en cualquier momento y a cualquier blanco sin ser restringidos de ese acuerdo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero,  anulara totalmente las actividades de la Representacion del EPC en Phanmunjom  establecida y manejada temporalmente por nuestro ejercito como mecanismo de negociacion para establecer el sistema de paz en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, tomara paralelamente la medida de cortar las comunicaciones telefonicas entre las capas militares RPDC-EE.UU. en Phanmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que se desarrollan al estado riguroso los imprudentes actos de todas fuerzas hostiles para atentar la soberania y la dignidad de la RPDC, se ha hecho clara nuestra opcion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa invariable posicion y el modo de reaccion a estilo del monte Paektu del ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC son enfrentar con espada al cuchillo, destruir con canones a fusiles y responder con el mas poderoso ataque nuclear a precision a nuestro estilo a la amenaza nuclear de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos yanquis y sus satelites no deben olvidarse nunca de que ellos mismos se hallan en la encrucijada del destino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria final esta al lado del ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC que se han levantado en la  defensa de la soberania."
