To this end they are touting about the plan for building \"new Japan\" and rendering the Japanese society more reactionary and militaristic. It is the ultimate goal of the Japanese militarists to boost Japan-U.S. alliance and make the Japanese society more reactionary and militaristic under the pretexts of \"new era of Japan\" and the building of \"new Japan\" to turn the 21st century into a century of aggression and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the lesson and review of human history that aggression and war bring ruin to a war criminal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will face self-destruction and meet a tragic end if it opts for a war of reinvasion to dominate the world, oblivious of this lesson of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "New Point of View on Revolution Clarified by Juche Idea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- President Kim Il Sung fathered the Juche idea in his early years of revolutionary activities and, proceeding from it, expounded the new viewpoint on revolution.\r\n The preceding theory studied the social movement (revolution) with the production mode of material wealth as the center in accordance with the principle of the materialistic conception of history, thus viewing it as a change of social systems by socio-economic relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President evolved the issue of revolution like all the socio-historical phenomena with the popular masses as the center and gave a new definition that the revolution, in essence, is a struggle for the independence of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolution is a social movement that is made to meet the demand of the popular masses for independence and developed by their creative power. Herein lies the fundamental principle of the revolution that the popular masses are the master of revolution and its driving force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President, from this point of view, defined the fundamentals of the revolution and developed theories on the revolution in a deep-going way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expounded that the revolution is not only to overthrow the old social system and to establish a new one but also to change the outmoded things with new ones in the ideological, technical and cultural domains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for replacing old ideology, technology and culture with new ones means a struggle between the new and the old, between the progressive and conservative forces and between collectivism and individualism. It, therefore, is regarded as a full revolutionary process and period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President thus was the first in the history to establish a new, original and scientific theory on the revolution evolved with the independence of the popular masses in the center. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system of the DPRK where the revolution and construction have been carried on centering around the popular masses is a true society for the people under which they are the master of all things and everything in society serves them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The drill glaringly revealed the U.S. criminal hostile scheme of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war gambles of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean war hawks against the DPRK can never be tolerated as they wreck peace on the Korean Peninsula and arrest the north-south reconciliation and the cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will boost the invincible self-defensive deterrent force a thousand-fold, holding ever higher the banner of Songun to cope with the evermore undisguised, reckless military provocations of the aggressive forces at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the height of sarcasm that the Bush administration claims it is \"not hostile\" to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tension on the Korean Peninsula was not created overnight. It has been fostered and elevated through centuries by the U.S. deep-rooted hostile policy towards the DPRK and its sustained moves to launch a war against the latter. The tension has been driven to the worst phase by the bellicose Bush administration wielding a military strong arm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts vividly show that it is none other than the U.S. which is bringing the danger of a nuclear war while increasing tension and destroying peace on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
