Strong demand should be made for an immediate demolition of the concrete wall built in the area south of the Military Demarcation Line in Korea, the appeal said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to build up the world opinion that the U.S. should renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK by action and opt for co-existence with it and to lift up louder voices worldwide supporting the conversion of the Armistice Agreement into a peace accord, it stressed. \r\n A letter to leader Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attending it were honorary chairmen of the CILRECO, officials of political parties and organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people in different countries and personages of different circles.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was sponsored by the East American Regional Council for Measures against Reckless Claim to Tok Islet, which comprises overseas Koreans' organizations including the Federation of Korean Residents in the United States.\r\n The protesters said they turned out in the protest, unable to repress indignation at Japan's far-fetched claim to Tok Islet which evidently belongs to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One hundred years have passed since the fabrication of the \"Ulsa Five-point Treaty\" by Japan, they noted, and said: However, it has not yet made an honest apology for its past history but is rushing headlong toward the revival of militarism and its conversion into a military giant for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They ridiculed Japan for seeking permanent membership of the UN Security Council, though it has not purged itself of the ill-fame as a war criminal state which inflicted calamities of war upon humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said a movement for curbing Japan's campaign to grab a seat of UNSC permanent membership should be launched by all the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The People for Achieving Peace and Reunification and the Reunification Solidarity in south Korea reportedly called a press conference in front of the building of the U.S. forces command in south Korea on March 9 in protest against the planned reorganization of the U.S. forces aimed at a preemptive attack on the north.\r\n A press release was made public at the press conference, which said: It has been decided to reorganize the second U.S. forces division in south Korea into a \"future-oriented division\" equipped with \"long-range operation capabilities\" and \"precision strike capabilities\" until this summer. This means that the U.S. combat forces will turn into an \"Asia-Pacific task force\" that can be rapidly deployed in different parts of Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through such reorganization the U.S. seeks to use the Korean Peninsula as an advance base for its war of aggression in the Asia-Pacific region and round off its \"capacity to mount a super-precision preemptive attack\" on the north, the press release noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would jeopardize the peace on the peninsula. The fact that the planned reorganization has been moved up since the north's declaration of its access to nuclear weapons goes to prove that the U.S. has, in fact, entered the phase of making preparations for a preemptive attack on the north after going beyond the phase of putting  military pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It strongly urged the U.S. to promptly stop such acts as seriously threatening peace in the peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Moves of U.S. and Japan to Tighten Their Military Alliance under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and Japanese reactionaries have systematically supplemented and rounded off the joint military operation plan and the order of action under the pretext of \"ensuring security\" and \"coping with threat\" since the demise of the Cold War. They are now working hard to expand their operation worldwide while tightening their military alliance.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Monday says in a signed commentary: \r\n A recent meeting of the U.S.-Japan Security Consultative Council attended by their high-ranking officials in charge of diplomatic and military affairs adopted a joint statement which set it as a \"joint strategic target\" to intensify military activities centering on the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many countries in Asia and the rest of the world view the tightened U.S.-Japan military alliance as a dangerous move to harass peace and bring about a war in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan and the U.S. have boosted their military alliance and cooperation, talking about the reexamination of \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines.\" This is aimed to establish an offensive system targeting the whole Asia including Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-Japan joint strategic target is, in essence, to strengthen the aggressive and military nexus against the DPRK and China and, at the same time, to build a system for preemptive attack. The U.S. listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" and an \"outpost of tyranny\" and adopted it as its policy to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. The U.S. is set to use Japan as a shock brigade for implementing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. strategic goal to occupy the Korean Peninsula and then put China under its military control and, moreover, establish military supremacy in the Asia-Pacific region. The boosted military alliance and cooperation are a dangerous move to upset the military equilibrium in Asia and spark a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This move seriously jeopardizes peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an exercise of a legitimate right to self-defense for the army and people of the DPRK to make full preparations to counter such move, while closely watching it. The Japanese militarists' moves to reinvade Northeast Asia in collusion with the U.S. while straining the situation there would only precipitate their second defeat.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean revolution is a proud revolutionary cause which has been ever victorious with idea as its only and most powerful weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attaching importance to idea has been the main maxim throughout the 60-year long history of the Workers' Party of Korea. It is well known a fact that the WPK, while pursuing Songun politics, has given priority not only to arms as physical means but to idea and spirit of the soldiers holding them in their hands and has advanced the revolution and construction on their pattern. To attach importance to arms in Songun politics has been to attach importance to idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and faith of the army and people of the DPRK who have recorded the sacred history of the Songun revolution as an ever-victorious chronicle are a noble spiritual power representing unity with the headquarters of the revolution in one mind and one will .The might of the ranks tens of millions strong united in one mind and one will is inexhaustible one defying comparison with mathematical sum total. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea and faith of the army and the people of the DPRK are, in their content, those of the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strength of the army and the people who live and fight in the same idea, desire and emotion with their leader can not be vanquished even by nuclear weapons nor can they be frightened or subjugated by psychological warfare. \r\nThe immense strength of revolutionary spirit displayed by the army and the people of the DPRK lies in its combination with a death-defying stand. This stand is an expression of unshakable trust in their leader and victory of the socialist cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A great ideological power is led by a great master of ideology. Leader Kim Jong Il is the veteran of present-day socialist politics who put forward the Juche-based theory of ideology that idea decides everything and is recording an ever-victorious history by carrying it thoroughly into Korean revolutionary practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Urged to Take Hands Off Iraq \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Some time ago south Korean-American Choe Min Su met a miserable death during Iraqi resistance forces' attack after being dispatched to Iraq. Several south Korean civilians have so far met similar deaths there. This is touching off bitter resentment among all Koreans as it is the tragedy caused by the U.S. wrong policy of war of aggression.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe's death is obviously a miserable one caused by the U.S. war of aggression fought against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the U.S. not ignited the Iraqi war, such south Korean young man as Choe would not have met such miserable death as cannon fodder of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cannot but be shame on the nation and a tragedy triggering off anger among the Koreans that the south Korean young man was forced to die after being taken to Iraq in the U.S. military uniform instead of Americans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities are contemplating dispatching the second batch of troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that more young south Koreans will not meet the same miserable deaths as those of Kim Son Il and Choe Min Su, should the south Korean authorities continue backing the U.S. in its policy of aggression against Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fawning upon the U.S. and blindly following its policy would only invite disgrace and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean troops dispatched to Iraq should be withdrawn from there without delay not only for the dignity of the nation but for the security of the south Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
