They are hell-bent on unprecedented-in-scope suppression of pro-reunification, patriotic forces, including the students under the influence of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon), the statement says, and continues:\r\n   History and the nation will certainly make the South Korean authorities pay dearly for their crimes such as the brutal suppression of patriotic champions of reunification and deal a heavy blow at the enemies of reunification, the traitors to the nation.\r\n   The more the South Korean authorities are engaged in suppression of pro-reunification, patriotic forces, the more crimes they will commit against the nation. They should be aware of this. They should abolish the anti-reunification \"National Security Law\" and dismantle the fascist plot-breeding \"Agency for National Security Planning.\" they also should unconditionally and immediately release the unreasonably arrested officials of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and \"Hanchongryon\"-lining students. \r\n \r\n"
