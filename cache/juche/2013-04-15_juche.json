            "content": "Papers Praise Kim Il Sung' Idea and Exploits\r\nPyongyang, April 15 (KCNA) -- Newspapers of the DPRK Monday dedicate editorials to the birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung. \n\t\t\t\t\tHis revolutionary history is shining as noble one for building the great Paektusan nation, Rodong Sinmun says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe is the great pioneer and peerless patriot who gave the origin to the great Paektusan nation and laid its eternal foundation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe embarked upon the road of revolution in his early years with a great aim to save the destiny of the country and nation. He defeated the brigandish Japanese imperialists, weathering snowstorm in Mt. Paektu, and thus achieved the historic cause of liberation of the country. Since then the Korean revolution has been inseparable from Mt. Paektu. That period marked the beginning of the history of the great Paektusan nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe led building a new society, the hard-fought Fatherland Liberation War, post-war rehabilitation and construction and socialist construction. This represented a history of the arduous struggle and great changes to implement the noble idea which was matured in Mt. Paektu. During this history the DPRK was built into a powerful socialist country independent in politics, self-sufficient in economy and self-reliant in defence and a heyday was ushered in the era of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe revolutionary idea, the Juche idea created by him serves as an encyclopedia for the revolution and construction in the present times and an all-powerful treasured sword for building a thriving nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Workers' Party of Korea founded by him shines as the Juche-oriented revolutionary party most prestigious and strongest in its militant power, the Korean People's Army has turned into an invincible revolutionary Paektusan army capable of defeating any formidable enemy and the DPRK is demonstrating its might as a socialist state centered on the popular masses where they are the master of everything. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor over 80 years since the Korean revolution started and 65 years since the birth of the DPRK, Mt. Paektu has been a symbol of every victory and its tradition has been the lifeline of the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe history of the President in which he advanced only along the road of independence and Songun, no matter how the situation might change and whatever one might say, is given steady continuity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe steadfast principle of independence whereby the DPRK does everything by its own-style to meet the interests of the Korean revolution, the tremendous military muscle capable of making precision strikes at the strongholds of aggressors wherever they are in the world, the unbreakable single-minded unity of the whole country.  These are a proud picture of the DPRK demonstrating its dignity as the great Paektusan nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson calls upon all the people to unite close around the dear respected Marshal Kim Jong Un and work hard for bright future of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Korea and accomplishment of the Juche revolutionary cause full of confidence in sure victory."

Es que ellos estan planteando cinicamente las platicas ahora, como si no fueran nada sus crimenes, sin decir ni una palabra de excusa ni de su responsabilidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos tambien, en el Sur de Corea se desarrollan los ejercicios de guerra \"Foal Eagle\" y Estados Unidos y los belicistas titeres del Sur de Corea intensifican sus acciones en busca de guerra anti-RPDC cuestionando nuestras contramedidas militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, la misma propuesta de dialogo es la superficial que no tiene ningun contenido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien propone el dialogo, el autor de la creacion de la situacion catastrofica de ahora no asume la actitud sincera o seria, por el contrario, tiene la postura extremadamente arrogando diciendo que escucharia lo que piensa y desea el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, la mandataria y el ministro de Unificacion mezclaron la propuesta con palabras ofensivas como \"provocacion\", \"renuncia nuclear\", \"cambio\" y \"repeticion del circulo vicioso\", lo que demuestra que ellos no abandonaron la conciencia hostil y la intencion conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Seran posibles acaso las platicas en tales condiciones? ?Habran imaginado ellos cual resultado darian tales platicas?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParece que la actual gobernante surcoreana trata de repetir la politica de transicion de \"confrontacion sin dialogo\" al \"enfrentamiento con dialogo\", de que hablaba tanto el \"poder de Yusin\" a principios de la decada de 1970. Si piensa asi, seria mejor dejarse de ese drama de dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dialogo Norte-Sur no es un juego ni mucho menos el enfrentamiento verbal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas recurren a todas las artimanas enganando la opinion publica, no podran liberarse de las responsabilidades del actual estado de tensiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa confrontacion y el dialogo son incompatibles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas tienen de veras la voluntad de dialogar, deben dejar primero su posicion conflictiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa apertura o no de dialogo depende totalmente de la actitud posterior de autoridades surcoreanas."
