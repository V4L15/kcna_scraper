He also gave on-the-spot guidance to it on several occasions and attended the New Year gatherings of children in Pyongyang held there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the cinema has been spruced up in a more refined manner and its interior completely renovated while preserving the original style of its exterior in keeping with the modern aesthetic taste of the Korean people, the architectural demand and the principle of historicism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has two 500-seated halls perfect in content and style as a specialized cinema. Their ceilings and surface of walls are designed to assume a unique architectural appearance in formative and artistic aspects while ensuring acoustic and visual requirements at a high level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its inaugural ceremony took place on the spot on April 13. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Nam, president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, addressing the ceremony, noted that General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave instructions on dozens of occasions over the construction of the cinema, led the work to organize a group of competent designers and building forces and solved all problems arising in the reconstruction. The speaker also said that the reconstruction of the cinema could be finished in a short span of time by soldier builders who are playing the standard-bearer in devotedly defending the leader and implementing his instructions in do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day, an inaugural ceremony of newly-rebuilt Okryu Restaurant was held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All parts of the restaurant, including its first and second buildings and dining rooms of Moran Restaurant attached to it, have been rebuilt and repaired in an overall way.

He also clearly indicated the tasks and ways for reconstructing all the buildings of Okryu Restaurant after the reconstruction of its main building, the speaker added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officials and builders of the Pyongyang Guidance Bureau for Construction turned out as one in the reconstruction and repair project of Okryu Restaurant and worked hard to complete the project after setting a high goal to create a model in putting structures on a formative and artistic basis, he stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This sheer sophism would get them nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical for this group of traitors to show a sign of efforts to calm down the bitter feelings of the DPRK by peddling the issue of \"cooperation\" and bargain with it over the issue of inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will have neither dealings nor bargaining with the group of traitors who do not respect the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" denying the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, a programme for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the Lee Myung Bak group continues playing sleight of hand, weighing the stand clarified by the DPRK, it will be held wholly accountable for the ensuing catastrophic consequences as it is hell-bent on sycophancy towards the U.S. and inter-Korean confrontation, denying the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that as long as the Lee Myung Bak regime persistently sticks to its pro-U.S. conservative \"policy toward the north\" despite our warnings, the situation will remain serious and the inter-Korean relations are bound to collapse.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their indomitable fighting spirit of always working miracles of history without any hesitation and vacillation in face of any difficulties is based on the fixed faith in the party's policies and the spirit of devotedly implementing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their noble revolutionary traits also lie in that they do all work as Kim Jong Il does, taking his Songun leadership feats as guidelines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Songun leadership feats make them confident of the immensely bright prospect of the country and revolution. They deem it the greatest pride and honor to live and struggle as Kim Jong Il does. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The society of the DPRK is, indeed, an ideologically pure community pervaded with the idea and will of the leader and an example of single-minded unity in the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

2012, en que se acogera el centenario del natalicio del Presidente, la puerta que de acceso a la gran potencia prospera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abriremos la nueva era de la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad frustrando tajantemente las maniobras de las fuerzas conservadoras surcoreanas en el poder que persiguen el servilismo a EE.UU. y la confrontacion con el Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nos esforzaremos tambien por rechazar la dominacion, intervencion y belicismo de los imperialistas y por preservar la paz y la seguridad de Asia y el resto del mundo.
