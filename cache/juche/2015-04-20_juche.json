He noted that the longer he traveled along the road covered by Kim Jong Il, the more keenly he realized that there was no such leader in the world as him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he came to the power station to call on the members of the youth shock brigade to complete as early as possible the construction of the Paektusan Songun Youth Power Station, the legacy left by Kim Jong Il and structure associated with his loving care and the eternal treasure of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the power station in front of the map showing its panoramic view, he went round different places of the construction site to learn in detail about the progress made in the project and the living of the members of the shock brigade. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the members of the youth shock brigade have pushed forward the project in a three dimensional manner as evidenced by the successes made in pressing ahead with the construction of the waterway tunnel of Power Station No. 2 at a final phase after completing the construction of its sand and stone dam, while hastening the concrete dam project of Power Station No. 1, the main project, despite unfavorable conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Though they are undertaking such huge power station project for the first time, they are performing miracles and feats in the construction as they are members of the youth shock brigade who have the intense loyalty to uphold the cause of the party and the leader in practice and enthusiasm to make a positive contribution to settling the shortage of electricity in the country\", he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the power station is of great importance in improving the people's standard of living and resolving the economic issue in Ryanggang Province which has Samjiyon County where the birthplace of Kim Jong Il and revolutionary battle sites are located, calling for unconditionally completing Power Stations Nos. 1 and 2 till the 70th anniversary of the Workers' Party of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Patriotism being displayed by the members of the youth shock brigade in the construction site of the power station clearly proves that our country is a power of youth without an equal in the world\", he said, highly praising their feats as a historical term.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that there are great many monumental structures going by the name of youth in various parts of the country, he ardently called for carrying forward the shining tradition established by the Korean youth in their efforts to achieve the prosperity of the socialist motherland and building the station, the eternal treasure of the country to be handed down to posterity, on the land of Paektu by working hard in the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu and thus implementing the behests of Kim Jong Il without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the faster the youth go, the more rapid advance the country makes, adding that the party reposes deep trust in the youth, and that it is the determination and will of the Party Central Committee to let the youth put up a nameplate at the gate of a thriving nation ahead of others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And he told officials to inform once again the members of the youth shock brigade of  the fact that the party entirely entrusted to them the construction of the power station to which the party attaches importance with a firm resolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for winding up the construction project till the 70th anniversary of the WPK to demonstrate before the whole world that the 70 year-long history of the party is the history of attaching importance to the youth and the history of building a power of youth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Proposing the presentation of a great chorus of young people there with the joy at finishing the project, he promised to surely watch it and have a photo taken in front of the station that day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Choe Ryong Hae, Ri Jae Il and Jon Yong Nam."
