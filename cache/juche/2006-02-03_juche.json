As said by Japanese news analysts, Japan is not in a position to get sure support from the U.S. for its membership of the UN Security Council. The U.S. does not want growth of the permanent member states in number, which may weaken its special right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unless Japan liquidates its past and gains international trust, it will not be able to gain the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "American-style \"Globalization\" Bound to Go Bust = Commentary on International Situation = \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- As was known already, the World Social Forum denouncing the U.S. \"neo-liberalist\" policy was held in Caracas from Jan. 24 to 29.\r\n The forum discussed the construction of \"socialism in the 21st century\" and the ways of countering the U.S. strategy of \"globalization\" for aggression and plunder. A resolution calling on the international community to conduct a widespread movement against American-style \"globalization\" was adopted there.\r\n During the forum tens of thousands of delegates of political parties and public organizations from different countries made an international march in Caracas under the slogan of \"Against War, Imperialism and Neo-Liberalism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the struggle of progressives against American-style \"globalization\" has become an organized one with their clear direction and way of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that foreign media estimated the forum as the most significant event in the movement against \"globalization\".\r\n The U.S., preoccupied by the idea of being the \"only super power\" after the end of the Cold War, tried to revive \"cosmopolitism\", the old ideological trend thrown away into the dumpage of history, and pressurized other countries and nations of the world to integrate politics, economy, culture and all other fabrics of social life in an American way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"globalization\" based on the U.S. jungle law-like view of value has caused catastrophic disasters such as financial crises and conflicts in developing countries of Asia, Africa and Latin-America. West European businesses introduced the method of American-style management and drank the bitter cup of \"neo-liberalistic 'globalization'\", with deficit to the tune of billions of U.S. dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. moves for \"globalization\" have become all the more frantic under the signboards of \"democracy\" and \"anti-terrorism\", the struggle against the moves has become a strong trend of the times in the international political arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cuba, Iran, Belarus and other countries where the U.S. seeks \"regime changes\" by labeling them \"outposts of tyranny\" are firmly defending the sovereignty and dignity of their countries from the U.S. \"democratization\" offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, in Mideast, the main front of \"war on terrorism\", the U.S. attempt to bring about \"domino\" of \"democratization\" has proved to be futile.\r\n Its example is the U.S. failure in its attempt to interfere in the Palestinian parliamentary election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, the AP on Jan. 26 jeered Bush who has made \"democracy\" a defining marker for American foreign policy, saying that he got a jolting message to be careful from Palestinian voters. Bush's clarion rhetoric about spreading liberty can yield results that appear counter to the U.S. interests, the press said, noting that's a challenge the U.S. may have to confront someday in other places as well, including Iraq, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Central Asia, the Balkans and -closer to home- South America. This can be viewed as a harbinger to the fate of bankruptcy the U.S. \"globalization\" and \"democracy\" will meet in the political field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"globalization\" in the economic and cultural fields is also rejected in all parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Venezuela, Argentina, Brazil, Bolivia and other Latin-American countries the left-wing forces have come to power in succession along the wave of resistance against the \"neo-liberalistic\" economic management system and IMF and are enforcing popular policies to build new societies of their own style such as revolution for the poor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South TV, founded by these countries to counter the U.S. and the West's smear campaign and ideological and cultural poisoning, is increasing its influence on the media field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ASEAN member nations have gained a lesson from the catastrophic financial crisis in the latter half of the 1990s and are going toward economic integration for the foundation of the economic community by 2020, etc. Referring to this last April, the Singaporean prime minister announced that changes are taking place in the economic structure of those Asian countries which once tried to achieve prosperity with American, European and Japanese investment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is progress of history while \"globalization\" is reaction on history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"globalization\" moves are as foolish an act as trying to reverse the trend of history. Such action will be driven out of history by the strong protest of the daily growing independent forces of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The slogan to be held up in the movement for national reunification this year is \"Let us vigorously forward the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the banner of 'by our nation itself'!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Advanced at the meeting were proposals for more dynamically pushing ahead with the cause of national reunification on a new stage.
