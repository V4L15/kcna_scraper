Solbong in Kosan County, Kangwon Province, in the late 14th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The temple consisted of tens of buildings. The temple consummates legacies of excellent architecture and culture created by the Korean people in 500-odd years from the end of the 14th century to the early 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is of historic and academic significance in studying different styles of architecture and unique construction methods of wood buildings developed by the sagacious Korean nation in hundreds of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But most of the buildings in the temple were completely destroyed by the indiscriminate bombing of the U.S. imperialists during the past Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the Workers' Party of Korea's correct policy of preserving the cultural heritages of the nation, some buildings of the temple including the Puli Gate and Hoji Gate were restored to their original state later. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Researchers of Pyongyang University of Construction and Building Materials concentrated their efforts on designing the Sokwang Temple so that it may take full appearance as a temple. They, at the same time, went out to the spot to survey and discover sites of buildings representing the corresponding periods, thus confirming the outlines of the temple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Basing themselves on historical records, photo materials and the data collected in the field survey, they confirmed the construction years of individual buildings which constitute the center of the temple and already worked out the designs of the Taeung Hall, Sugun Pavilion, Simgom Pavilion, Ungjin Hall and others to the restoration of which should be given definite precedence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the patriotic zeal of scientists, the Sokwang Temple will recover its old appearance in the near future.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was a reckless action of the warmongers keen on military confrontation with the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the above-said trips were focused on laying and tightening a military siege to the DPRK through cooperation with the foreign forces. The traitor asked for the delay of \"transfer of the right to control wartime operations\" while promising to increase the upkeep for the U.S. military presence in south Korea. He also deliberated on such matters as building up the combined defense capability and jointly countering terrorism with the U.S. and tightening the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance. His actions revealed his dangerous scheme to stifle the DPRK by force with ease by zealously following the outsiders and further tightening the military tie-ups with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, Lee agreed with his U.S. and Japanese masters to further strengthen the cooperation for war against the DPRK during the trips. Such behavior made the triangular military alliance sharpen its spear of aggression aimed at the DPRK, bringing the actual danger of outbreak of war to the Korean Peninsula. Herein lies the dangerous and treacherous nature of the traitor's recent junkets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee, hell-bent on sycophantic treachery and confrontation with the DPRK, did not hesitate to do such treacherous act as putting the destiny of the Korean nation on the outsiders' chopping-board called war, fawning on them. This is an anti-nation crime that can never be pardoned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This dangerous move hints that Japan is turning into a war state for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' intention is to launch overseas aggression by building up the SDF into armed forces of offensive style on the plea of non-existent \"threat\" from someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such military moves are triggering off and accelerating a new arms race in Northeast Asia, rendering the regional situation strained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese reactionaries should not commit rash acts, clearly mindful that their moves for conversion of Japan into a military power and overseas expansion will bring only ruin upon themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
