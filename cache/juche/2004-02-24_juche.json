            "content": "U.S. Must Approach Six-way Talks with Sincerity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Public figures of different countries, regions and international organizations and media hope to see a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United States and the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula with the successful holding of the six-way talks.\r\n Growing louder are voices urging the Bush administration to approach the six-way talks beginning from Feb. 25 with sincerity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is delaying talks with Pyongyang, said a U.S. Democratic Senator on Jan. 28. He added that it is time a sincere attitude was taken toward negotiation and if the president fails to instruct his officials to honestly approach negotiation and leave no room for this, the U.S. will be unable to get the goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Senator Kerry who is seeking presidential candidacy of the Democratic Party sharply criticized President Bush, saying it was an ill-considered act to deny direct dialogue with north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  McNamara, former U.S. defense secretary, in his interview with Yomiuri Shimbun on January 31 criticized the U.S. atom bombing in the Second World War and said if that had not happened, the era of a nuclear race would have been evaded and no nuclear issue would have cropped up between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Kay, former chief U.S. arms inspector in Iraq, on Feb. 1 told FOX TV that people would respond with doubt to Bush administration's statement that the DPRK poses a great threat to the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, on Feb. 1 contended that for a solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the United States humanitarian aid and security should be provided to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korean KBS reported on Feb. 3: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North Korea sticks to its stand that at least the first-stage step must be agreed upon when the talks open. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Entering this year, it showed the nuclear facilities in Nyongbyon to a U.S. delegation, making clear its willingness to freeze them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And it urged the United States to delete it from the list of \"terrorism supporting states\", lift political, economic and military sanctions and blockade on it and give it aid in energies such heavy oil and electric power as counter measures when it freezes nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, however, demands it abandon the nuclear materials for all purposes including not only plutonium but highly enriched uranium, failing to put forward its detailed plan. And it persists in its stand that there will be no reward unless Pyongyang \"scraps its nuclear program first.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the United States should correctly read the intention of north Korea hoping to end the hostile relations with it and should seek a policy switchover.\r\n The radio on Feb. 17 said the U.S. tough stand made it hard to expect a dramatic progress from the second six-way talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Solidarity for Implementation of the South-North Joint Declaration in south Korea issued a statement entitled \"The United States Must Drop Its Deceptive Double-dealing Tactics\" on Feb. 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Bush on Feb. 11 again made hardline remarks urging the north to scrap its nuclear program first, branding it as \"a rogue state\", the statement noted: This made it plain that there was no change in the U.S. hostile policy toward the north and that the U.S. was not interested in the success of the six-way talks with them at hand and its real intention was to isolate and stifle the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States wants a successful progress of the talks, it should not hang on a deceptive ruse but drop its hostile policy towards the north first of all and set to creating an atmosphere for dialogue, the statement urged. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's Troop Dispatch to Iraq Must Be Stopped \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- South Korea's additional troop dispatch to Iraq is a war crime joining the U.S. in the war of aggression against and occupation of Iraq without any justification and an anti-national crime damaging the dignity, interests and honor of the Korean nation, says Rodong Sinmun in a commentary today.\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is already publicly recognized that the U.S.-launched Iraqi war was a brigandish and aggressive crime going against international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, the \"National Assembly\" of south Korea legalized the troop dispatch to Iraq. This is an insult to the south Korean people and the whole nation who value the dignity, honor and interests of the nation as life and soul and a challenge to humankind wishing justice and peace and an indelible crime against the Iraqi people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are loud-mouthed about the \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue, while taking a direct part in the outside forces' war of aggression against Iraq. This is the height of sarcasm and a mockery of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-U.S. means death to the Korean nation and anti-U.S. a way out for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe aggression, interference and strong-arm and arbitrary practices of the U.S. which has brought only misfortunes and disasters to the Korean nation can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary calls on the south Korean people to kindle fiercer flames of struggle to thwart and frustrate the pro-U.S. flunkeyist forces' treacherous troop dispatch to Iraq for driving young south Korean people to a death field in submission to the United States indulged in aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a unique revolutionary mode of leader Kim Jong Il and serves as an invincible weapon for the Korean revolution.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pushing forward the economic construction by the Songun political mode means putting forward the People's Army as a core and main force and carrying out economic construction by the concerted efforts of the army and people in the revolutionary soldier spirit and fighting trait, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The line of economic construction in the era of Songun calls for simultaneously developing light industry and agriculture while attaching priority to the development of national defence industry. This is a unique line of economic construction which makes it possible to significantly increase the state power with the military muscle as its core. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the unshakable will of Kim Jong Il to carry out by the Songun political mode the line for economic construction of the Workers' Party of Korea which is based on the successes made in the efforts to implement the basic line of socialist economic construction set forth by President Kim Il Sung long ago and which has been carried forward and developed as required by the era of Songun. The WPK's Songun political mode and line of economic construction fully reflect the strongest anti-imperialist spirit for independence. Now the army and the people of the DPRK are firmly convinced that the Songun political mode serves as a powerful treasured sword to win victory in the revolution in the 21st century and a most effective mode to be fully applied by all fields of socialist construction including politics, military affairs, economy, culture and foreign affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The idea of carrying out the line of economic construction in this era by the Songun political mode is based on a correct viewpoint and stand on the main force of the revolution in the Songun era and precious experience gained in the course of the Songun revolution which has won one victory after another thanks to the might of the unity between the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean revolution ushered in the 21st century, a century of creation and innovation, despite the stern test of history with the army playing the role of a pacesetter. This practical experience clearly proves that the Songun political mode is the most just and effective mode to implement to the letter the line of economic construction in our era. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This will result in seriously harassing peace and security in Asia as it is a wanton violation of international law. This also may scuttle the process of dialogue between the DPRK and Japan as it diametrically runs counter to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan will have to bear full responsibility for all the unpredictable serious consequences to be entailed by its persistent pursuance of hostile policy toward the DPRK as evidenced by the passage of the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange,\" the statement warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Central Committee of the Communist Workers' Party of Russia in a statement on February 12 said that the passage of the \"amendment to the law on foreign exchange\" through the House of Representatives of Japan indicates that Japan's moves for aggression of Korea have entered an undisguised phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of driving the DPRK-Japan relations to a catastrophic phase as it is a product of Japan's self-contradictory policy of precipitating its self-destruction to serve the U.S., it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The People's United Democracy-Unity Left Wing of Italy in a statement on February 13 strongly demanded the Japanese authorities immediately withdraw their reckless hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"
