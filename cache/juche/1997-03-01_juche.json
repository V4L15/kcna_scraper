AN EDITORIAL OF RODONG SINMUN SAYS:\r\n   THE DESIRE OF THE MARCH FIRST POPULAR UPRISERS HAS NOT \r\nYET BEEN REALISED IN SOUTH KOREA, ONE HALF OF THE COUNTRY, \r\nAND THE SOUTH KOREAN PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING FROM THE COLONIAL \r\nRULE BY OUTSIDE FORCES, THEIR NATIONAL DIGNITY AND \r\nSOVEREIGNTY BEING RUTHLESSLY VIOLATED.\r\n   ALL THE FELLOW COUNTRYMEN IN THE NORTH, THE SOUTH AND \r\nOVERSEAS SHOULD EXPOSE AND RESOLUTELY FRUSTRATE THE SOUTH \r\nKOREAN RULERS' POLICY OF DEPENDENCE UPON OUTSIDE FORCES, \r\nFLUNKEYIST AND TREACHEROUS PRACTICES AND THEIR POLICY OF \r\nCONFRONTATION AND WAR AT EVERY STEP UNDER THE BANNER OF \r\nNATIONAL INDEPENDENCE AND PEACE AND TURN OUT VALIANTLY IN \r\nTHE STRUGGLE TO MAKE A TURNING-POINT IN THE MOVEMENT FOR THE \r\nINDEPENDENT AND PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION OF THE COUNTRY.\r\n   THE UNITED STATES MUST AFFIRMATIVELY RESPOND TO OUR \r\nREALISTIC PROPOSAL FOR NEGOTIATION TO REPLACE THE INSTABLE \r\nARMISTICE SYSTEM WITH A DURABLE PEACE SYSTEM IN KEEPING WITH \r\nTHE IDEA OF THE DPRK-U.S. AGREED FRAMEWORK.\r\n   JAPAN MUST ABANDON THE ANACHRONISTIC POLICY OF EXCLUSIVE \r\nFAVOR FOR SOUTH KOREA AND DO THINGS HELPFUL TOWARD PEACE ON \r\nTHE KOREAN PENINSULA AND ITS PEACEFUL REUNIFICATION. \r\n   AN EDITORIAL OF MINJU JOSON SAYS THAT ALL THE FELLOW \r\nCOUNTRYMEN SHOULD BECOME UNDERTAKERS OF THE NATIONAL \r\nREUNIFICATION AND MAKE TANGIBLE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE \r\nPROMOTION OF GREAT NATIONAL UNITY AND THE REUNIFICATION OF \r\nTHE COUNTRY, UPHOLDING THE TEN-POINT PROGRAMME OF THE GREAT \r\nUNITY OF THE WHOLE NATION. \r\n\r\n"
