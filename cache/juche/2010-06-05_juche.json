Accordingly, the security was firmly guaranteed and the warship was also involved in those military maneuvers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical for warships of south Korea and the U.S. involved in the military maneuvers to claim they were unaware of \"Cheonan's\" sinking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  There is also the possibility that \"Cheonan\" might be sunken by a U.S. forces submarine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to remind that a U.S. nuclear-powered submarine involved in the joint military maneuvers was on a secret combat duty in the waters near Paekryong Islet in the day the case occurred."

Ahora ellos intentan hacer de la RPDC el \"agresor\" instalando los altavoces para inducirla a abrir primero el fuego.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun la fuente de exploracion de la flota del Pacifico de Rusia, es cierto que el \"Cheonan\" fue hundido por el torpedo, pero este no era \"del Norte de Corea\" sino el torpedo especial lanzado por un submarino atomico ultramoderno de EE.UU. a traves de un pequeno aparato submarino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tension de la Peninsula Coreana no conviene al Norte ni al Sur sino resulta provechosa solo a EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de desarme nuclear, EE.UU. intenta establecer el sistema de control de armas nucleares del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que esta empantanado ahora en Irak y Afganistan, EE.UU. trata de buscar la \"otra mano\" cambiando su tactica. Especificamente dicho, trata de conservar \"su imagen\" traspasando al Sur de Corea el cargo de aplastar a la RPDC, y piensa poner en aprieto a China para separarla de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su articulo publicado el mismo dia \"?El buque 'Cheonan' fue hundido por el torpedo del Norte o del ejercito norteamericano?\", el periodico indonesio \"Compass\" senalo que la causa de siniestro es una incognita y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el momento de hundimiento, estaban en plena marcha en la polemica zona maritima el ejercicio militar conjunto Sur de Corea-EE.UU. Por lo tanto, estaba garantizada la seguridad y el buque de guerra \"Cheonan\" participaba tambien en ese ejercicio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta absurdo que los buques del Sur de Corea y EE.UU. no se hayan enterado del hundimiento del \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe presenta ahora la posibilidad de hundimiento del \"Cheonan\" por un submarino del ejercito norteamericano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs necesario recordar que en el dia del accidente, un submarino nuclear de EE.UU., participante en el citado ejercicio militar conjunto, estaba cumpliendo su mision secreta en las aguas cercanas a la isla Paekryong."
