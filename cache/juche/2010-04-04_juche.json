Korea War Moves against DPRK Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, April 4 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, the commander of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea contended, talking about possible \"contingency\" in the DPRK, that measures and preparedness for military intervention are needed to cope with it. The warlike forces of the south Korean military, too, are getting unprecedentedly hell-bent on the military provocative moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the facts, Minju Joson Sunday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The remark about \"contingency\" itself is a deliberate provocation to the DPRK, and it represents the U.S. stand to invade the DPRK by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now going beyond the danger line in the moves to provoke a war for aggression on the DPRK. It has already worked out such anti-DPRK war scenarios as \"OPLAN 5029\", the keynote of which is to intentionally create war situation through \"massive offensive of pressure\" in case of \"contingency\" in the DPRK and spark off military conflict. At present it is frantically trying to put the scenarios into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is intolerable is that the south Korean conservative group is persistently joining in the U.S. moves to provoke a war for aggression on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Dialogue\" and \"improvement of relations\" touted by the United States and the south Korean conservative group are noting but a deception to cover up their design to invade the DPRK, and they are recklessly seeking only to ignite a war for aggression on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK do not want war but love peace. However, should the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet warmongers unleash a war for aggression on the DPRK, they will deal a mercilessly annihilating strike at them and the provokers will be bound to face a lot of forlorn wandering spirits."
