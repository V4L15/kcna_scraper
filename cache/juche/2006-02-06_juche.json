They should never concede the principles to the U.S. imperialists but resolutely fight against them without slightest delusion and expectation. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Retreat or submission in the confrontation with the enemy will lead to death.\r\n One should not betray one's weakness before such ferocious enemies as the U.S. imperialists but resolutely fight against them. The more concessive one is, the more arrogant the U.S. is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the way of defending the destiny of a country and a nation to return strength for strength and respond to the arrogant use of armed forces with merciless punishment.\r\n Fear of the U.S. imperialists benumbs the anti-U.S. spirit and weakens the anti-U.S. struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fear of the U.S. imperialists will give rise to flattery and submission to them. If one is afraid of the U.S., one cannot have one's say nor can do what one should do. On the contrary, one is forced to curry favor with it, losing one's independence and the Juche character and reading its face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is not a fearful entity at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If one is to stand up to the U.S. imperialists, one should build up military strength. Arms should be returned for arms. Strong arms strengthen pluck. \r\n Victory is in store for those countries and nations which fight sternly against the enemy. This has been proved by the history of the Korean people's struggle.\r\n The important lesson the Korean people have drawn in the confrontation with the U.S. imperialists is that they can emerge victorious when they wage a toughest struggle against the enemy without any slightest concession of principle or retreat.\r\n It is the rock-firm determination and immutable will of the Korean army and people to achieve a final victory in the fierce fight against the U.S. hard-line moves to stifle them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The attraction and vitality of the idea of \"By our nation itself\" are growing stronger day by day. All the Koreans should continue promoting reconciliation and unity, invariably holding high the banner of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aspiration and enthusiasm of the Korean nation for reconciliation and unity are remarkably high. It is necessary to conduct multifarious functions for reunification which will enhance the zeal for national reconciliation and unity this year, too, and make them grounds for great national unity. It is imperative to continue developing the work for inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation so as to make it conducive to independent reunification and common prosperity of the nation on the principle of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also imperative to conduct a nation-wide struggle to shatter the moves of the separatist forces at home and abroad standing in the way of national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon all the Koreans to categorically oppose and reject the unreasonable moves of the U.S. to put a spoke in the wheel of north-south relations and national unity and firmly defend the lineage of national independence.

Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The \"UN forces\" what the U.S. called were neither based on any UN resolution nor organized by the UN, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The existence of the command was illegal and a wanton violation of the UN Charter in view of the background against which it was formed, its military system and financial source. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is all the more brazen-faced for the U.S. to talk about the role of the U.S. forces in south Korea as the \"UN peace-keeping forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has threatened peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and increased the danger of a war. This was the only thing it has done through the command. The U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are the root cause of the escalating tension and war on the peninsula and a cancer-like entity in the way of achieving peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. imperialists' invariable strategy for aggression to realize their ambition to dominate Asia with the Korean Peninsula as a military stronghold.\r\n No matter how much the U.S. imperialists may publicize their forces' role as the \"UN peace-keeping forces\" they can never cover up their true colors as warmongers.\r\n The U.S. can never escape the censure and condemnation by the international community for its arrogant acts of defying the UN, mocking at it and abusing its name.\r\n The command should be dismantled at an early date and the U.S. forces in south Korea under the UN helmets should be pulled out of it without delay. If the U.S. is truly willing to prevent a war and ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula and improve relations with the DPRK it should make a bold decision to dismantle the command and pull back its forces from south Korea without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their moves to obliterate the peculiar soul, long-standing tradition and all the legacies and treasures of the Korean nation were also most cruel in history.\r\n Their actions for stamping out the Korean language and its national character were the most brutal and cruel, mental torture imposed upon the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how many generations and centuries may change, the Koreans will never forget the blood-stained crimes of the Japanese imperialists seeking to exterminate the Korean nation after occupying Korea by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans will never pardon the crimes of Japan which offered its whole territory as a logistic, repair and supply base and a sortie base for the U.S. imperialist aggression troops, zealously engaging itself in the implementation of the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression aimed at occupying the whole of Korea and has joined the U.S. imperialists in their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese aggressors are, indeed, the sworn enemies who have long imposed all misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean people. \r\n The article calls upon all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to turn out as one in the anti-U.S., anti-Japanese struggle to settle the crime-woven history of the Japanese imperialists who set up the colonial \"government-general\" with the backing of the U.S. and mercilessly trampled down the sovereignty of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
