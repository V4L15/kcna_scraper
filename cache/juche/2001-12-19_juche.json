Yet, it is impudent enough to interfere in others' arms buildup intended to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This glaringly reveals the arrogant and shameless nature of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality today when the U.S. has become more undisguised in its moves to establish military domination over the world clearly proves the justness of the DPRK idea of giving priority to the army and its policy of increasing military capability for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will invariably hold fast to the idea of giving importance to the army, significantly increase this capability and accomplish the socialist cause no matter how the situation may change and no matter what others may say. \r\n\r\n"

This was in contravention of the desire of all the fellow countrymen for national reunification, the statement said, and continued:\r\n According to a news report, the Taegu high court in a trial on an appeal made by Son Jun Hyok, former chairman of the 6th-term South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon), sentenced him to three years in prison and three years of suspension of qualification on the charge that he spearheaded various rallies and demonstrations of Hanchongryon and printed \"literature benefiting the enemy.\" \r\n In the last few months alone scores of deputies to Hanchongryon and youth and students were thrown behind bars, representatives of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) including chairman Jon Sang Bong of the council of the youth organizations, who participated in the 2001 grand festival for national reunification held in Pyongyang in August, were arrested on the charge of violation of the \"security law\" and the chairman of the 10th-term Kwangju and South Jolla Provincial Federation of General Student Councils was walked away to police without any warrant of arrest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north headquarters of Pomchonghakryon brands the South Korean public security authorities' fascist suppression of leading members of Hanchongryon as a perfidy to the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and an anti-reunification criminal act to destroy the patriotic pro-reunification organizations including Hanchongryon, and sternly denounces them on behalf of all the youth and students in the northern half of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement urged the South Korean public security authorities to properly understand the daily mounting desire of the compatriots for national reunification, immediately abolish the \"SL,\" a leftover of the old era, and unconditionally release chairman of the 6th-term Hanchongryon and all other unreasonably arrested patriotic youth and students without delay.    \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the concrete wall serves as a barrier of division as well as a military fortress and an attack position to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The concrete wall has no reason to exist today, the era of national independent reunification, and it should be demolished at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The existence of the concrete wall is abnormal in all aspects provided that through the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration the north and the south solemnly declared independent settlement of the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pulling down the concrete wall or not confirms whether the South Korean authorities have intention to implement the joint declaration or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The concrete wall should no longer remain but be demolished at an early date in view of the spirit of the north-south joint declaration and the ardent desire of the nation for independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
