Talking about someone's \"provocation\", they let loose belligerent remarks calling for \"promptly and resolutely punishing the north without hesitation\" and also said that \"the north should be made to keenly feel the price of provocation\". They even cried out for \"making havoc of provocation base and support and commanding forces\" and launching \"preemptive attack\".\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet warmongers even let the puppet Defense Ministry spokesman spread false story about \"tunnel\", \"construction of missile base\" and \"development of new-type missile\".

Korea-Japan Naval Maneuvers\r\nPyongyang, October 21 (KCNA) -- The Russian internet news service Rosinfor Net posted a commentary \"What is U.S. going to deter in Korea?\" on Oct. 14. \n\t\t\t\t\tRecalling that the U.S., south Korea and Japan staged joint naval drills targeted at the DPRK, the commentary said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExperts comment that the maneuvers staged with even a nuclear-powered carrier involved are aimed to acquire the capability to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is interesting is that the drills were timed to coincide with the adoption of the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" by the U.S. and south Korea to target the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is said that the task force is formed with the latest weapons including nukes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat are the U.S. and its allied forces going to deter with such strong task force?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a word, they mean opposing the peaceful reunification of Korea which was proposed and has repeatedly been confirmed by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the U.S. and south Korea were discussing a preemptive nuclear strike on the DPRK, voices calling for achieving the reunification of the north and the south by federal formula were heard from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContrary to the assertion of south Korea the DPRK's proposal calls for reunifying the country by federal formula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's proposal is undoubtedly just. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo was put forward by President Kim Il Sung in October 1980. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt will be hard for south Korea to find an appropriate counterproposal against the Korean people's desire of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrecisely for this reason the south Korean authorities are discussing with outside forces a nuclear strike deterring reunification, instead of consulting a proposal for reunification with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey do not care whether such acts meet the interests of the south Korean people or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities have long served the U.S. for its interests only and they have been closely linked with big businesses of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. will never allow such thing as losing south Korea as it is the springboard for containing China and Russia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., therefore, is working hard to dampen the Korean people's desire for reunification together with its lackeys."
