            "content": "Imperialists' Logic of \"Military Threat\" Blasted\r\n Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article terms the logic of \"military threat\" touted by the imperialists a modern version of their logic of aggression and domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said logic is becoming a \"passport\" of the imperialists for high-handed and arbitrary practices and a \"permit card\" for war, and lurking behind it is their criminal attempt to disarm the independent countries, the article says, and notes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the claims made by the imperialists that those countries which are sympathizing with their policy for aggression have \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" but those countries going against it \"lack human rights and democracy\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said logic is reactionary sophism aimed at establishing the order for world domination by strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists are opposing the establishment of a fair international order which respects the rights of all countries and nations of the world and opens the path of free development for them while regarding those countries struggling for it as objects to be eliminated. They are making every possible effort to undisguisedly reject and internationally isolate these countries after labeling them as \"dangerous forces\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such act can be checked and sovereignty and peace of countries be ensured only when the world progressives wage a dynamic struggle against the imperialists' crafty moves for aggression with heightened vigilance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how loudly the imperialists may talk about \"military threat\", the people of the countries struggling for independence and progress should increase the defence capability and be ready to beat back any aggression forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a foolish act just like pricking one's own eye with one's own finger to compromise with imperialism without principle or try to fish in troubled waters joining it. Illusion about imperialism leads to death and ruin."
