Dirigente Kim Jong Il, nacido como hijo de la guerrilla en el monte Paektu, el sagrado de la revolucion, condujo durante largo tiempo la revolucion y la construccion a la senda de victorias con su genial prevision, destacada ideologia y teoria, extraordinaria capacidad de guia y nobles virtudes y realizo imperecederas hazanas revolucionarias ante la patria, la nacion, la epoca y la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCreo la nueva historia del cumplimiento de la causa de eternidad del lider con la mas noble moralidad revolucionaria e hizo brillar para siempre en el corazon del pueblo coreano y la humanidad la gran vida y las hazanas revolucionarias del Presidente Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa vida revolucionaria de Kim Jong Il fue la trayectoria epica del General Insigne del Songun y patriota sin par quien defendio la soberania de la RPDC frustrando rotundamente con el poderio de las fuerzas armadas las sanciones, presiones y maniobras belicistas de la coalicion imperialista y situo en el plano cimero la dignidad del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podremos olvidar nunca los trabajos abnegados del Dirigente quien para hacer feliz al pueblo, continuo su incansable marcha forzada de direccion en el terreno vestido en su chaqueta de campana durante toda la vida viviendo cada dia haciendolo valer por diez y cien dias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente era destacado politico, gran hombre sin par y gran sabio de la revolucion quien impulso la revolucion coreana a la unica senda de victorias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBien consciente de su noble mision de responsabilizarse del destino de la patria y la nacion y del futuro de la revolucion, el dio la garantia de continuacion de la causa revolucionaria del Juche, la del Songun, iniciada en el monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSu hazana mas valiosa realizada por el destino de la patria y la prosperidad de todas las generaciones venideras es haber solucionado perfectamente el problema de sucesion de guia que resulta el fundamental en la continuacion de la causa revolucionaria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, al frente de la revolucion coreana esta el camarada Kim Jong Un, sucesor de la causa revolucionaria del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un es el Maximo Dirigente del partido, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea quien heredo integramente la ideologia, el modo de direccion, las personalidades, las virtudes, la audacia y el coraje del Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuperaremos las dificultades de hoy convirtiendo la tristeza en las fuerzas y coraje multiplicados bajo la direccion de Kim Jong Un y avanzaremos a pasos mas firmes por el sendero del Songun indicado por el Dirigente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEnalteceremos al camarada Kim Jong Un como otro General y Maximo Dirigente, como hemos jurado con lagrimas ante el feretro de Kim Jong Il, y cumpliremos hasta el final la causa revolucionaria del Songun y la de construccion del Estado prospero socialista.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl nombre sagrado y la imagen del Sol del Dirigente Kim Jong Il brillaran para siempre y quedaran eternamente en el corazon del ejercito y el pueblo

viviendo, al recordar con gran emocion su inmortal vida y hazanas revolucionarias y los abnegados e incansables trabajos realizados por el por la patria y el pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tomaron
