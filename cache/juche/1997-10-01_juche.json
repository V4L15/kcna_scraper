Their double-dealing tactics only lead to the worsening relations between the DPRK and the U.S., between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   We cannot remain a passive onlooker to the fact that with the new \"guidelines\" worked out the U.S. and Japan are working in real earnest to realise their design of aggression on our country and other Asian countries. We will respond to the situation with sharpened revolutionary vigilance. The Asian countries should never allow the new \"guidelines\". \r\n\r\n"

Korean figure on Juche character and national identity\r\n Pyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- Choe Yong Cho, a historian residing in Tongdaemun district, Seoul, published an article entitled \"north and south viewed with Juche character and national identity\", according to the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.\r\n   The author said:\r\n   The Juche character of the north can be fully seen in all domains of social life.\r\n   It has firmly maintained the Juche character in its relations with other countries, startling the world.\r\n   The strong-arm policy, which the United States used to force upon other nations at random, cannot work on the north.\r\n   The north finally concluded the framework agreement with the United States, a nuclear power, and received a letter of guarantee from U.S. President Bill Clinton.\r\n   When the hostile forces made a hue and cry over \"preparations for launching missiles in the north\", the north put a gag in their mouths by declaring that the launching belonged to its sovereignty, there was no reason to slander or interfere in it and it would carry out missile tests any time if conditions presented themelves and it considered it necessary and that it did not want others to poke their noses into this matter.\r\n   Indeed, the north is a dignified country which will never make any concession over the issue related to its sovereignty.\r\n   It is only the north that is not in the least affected by worldwide economic fluctuation or difficulties.\r\n   One can maintain political independence and increase defence capabilities only when it establishes economic independence. \r\n   This is proved by the realities of the north.\r\n   However, the operation command over the southern army is in the hands of the U.S. Forces and the south Korean soldiers are nothing but mercenary soldiers and cannon fodder of the U.S. Forces.\r\n   The realities in the south which has no Juche character and independence and in the north which has a strong Juche character and enjoys a high authority and dignity of the nation, form a sharp contrast.\r\n   The Juche character of the north and the national development based on this are results of the independent politics of President Kim Il Sung and Secretary Kim Jong Il who is identical to the President.\r\n   It is thanks to the outstanding and tested independent politics of the General that the people in the north are dignified people in the world who highly display their authority, saying what they want and doing what they intend.\r\n   The General is, indeed, the incarnation of independent politics.\r\n   From olden times, our Tangun's nation valued the national identity very much and developed it generation after generation. However, after the country was divided into the north and the south, the two parts have produced a striking contrast in preserving the national character.\r\n   Seeing the realities in the north and the south, I felt that the north is a sacred land in which the Juche character and the national identity are thoroughly preserved and highly displayed, while the south is a \"land of others\" in which there are no Juche character and national identity.\r\n   I keenly felt that it is the first and foremost task of our people to restore the Juche character and the national identity which have faded away in the south.\r\n   To this end, we must follow the politics of Secretary Kim Jong Il, the author of the article stressed. \r\n\r\n"
