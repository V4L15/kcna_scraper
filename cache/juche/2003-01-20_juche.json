            "content": "DPRK to react to unreasonable \"countermeasure\" with toughest stance \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 19 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell said that the nuclear issue of the DPRK should be brought to the UNSC and \"concrete countermeasures including economic sanctions would be seriously considered.\"\r\n This fully represented the hostile intention of the Bush administration to shift the responsibility for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, which was authored and has been hyped by it, and the resultant serious developments on to the DPRK and use the un platform as was the case with the IAEA for internationalizing its campaign to pressurize, isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is entirely to blame for the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. This issue was unreasonably put on the U.N. agenda to be discussed there in the past as the U.S. instigated the IAEA to create artificial difficulties and complexity in the way of settling the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the crisis over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula in 1993 was settled through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S., not by the UN. This historical fact proves that the issue can be settled only through equal and fair dialogue and negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S., not by any third party's unjust intervention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United Nations wants to show its principled stand and attitude to settle the issue with a fair concern for it, it should call into question the U.S. unreasonable DPRK policy that compelled it to take a self-defensive step to withdraw from the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. abandoned its commitments to fully normalize the political and economic relations with the DPRK, provide light water reactors to the latter and supply heavy oil to it, thus unilaterally and totally ditching the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and causing an acute shortage of electricity to the DPRK. It also singled out the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack after listing it as part of an \"axis of evil\", creating extremely grave danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such act of threatening the DPRK's vital right is a crime against humanity quite contrary to the spirit of the UN Charter for peace of humankind as it is intolerable political violence in the modern society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. drives the developments to the extremes, turning aside the DPRK's fair and aboveboard proposal for settling the issue in a peaceful way through the conclusion of a non-aggression treaty with the U.S. and clamoring for any \"countermeasures,\" the DPRK will be left with no option but to counter it with the toughest stance.    \r\n     \r\n"

This is the height of shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous of the U.S. to abuse the name of the un for attaining its dirty goal for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Sanctions\" or military pressure can never work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States continues to drive the situation to the extremes while branding the DPRK as a \"criminal\", we will be left with no option but to react to it with the toughest stance. The U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

He highly praised her invariable loyalty and patriotic devotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he visited pilot Hong Thae Sik's family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hong and his wife had the great honor of receiving profound loving care from Kim Jong Il when he dropped in at their room on August 28, 2001 during their pleasant vacation at the Kalma rest home of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speaking highly of Hong's long and devoted service at the air force unit, he told Hong to bring up their children as good pilots and soldiers to make his family a family of servicepersons who defend the country with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il saw an art performance given by airmen of the sub- unit and had a photograph taken with the sub-unit's servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by generals of the KPA Ri Myong Su, Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and secretaries Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam and first vice-department directors Ri Yong Chol, Jang Song Thaek and Choe Chun Hwang of the WPK Central Committee    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is intolerable as it is intended to call back the departed soul of militarists and justify the aggression and all the crimes Japan committed against Asian countries in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was reported to have told media persons prior to his visit that he was going to visit the shrine in peace, lost in the thought that Japan would not start a war again. It is, indeed, a foolish attempt to mislead the fair public opinion critical of visits to the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can the visit to the shrine, a symbol of militarism, bring peace and security to the Korean people and other people of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koizumi's visit is an open challenge to the Korean people and all other people of Asia who hope that Japan will not repeat its history of aggression, its blood-stained history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His misbehavior is quite contrary to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, in which Japan admitted, in a spirit of humility, the facts of history that it caused tremendous damage and sufferings to the Korean people through its colonial rule in the past and expressed deep remorse and heartfelt apology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state relations between the DPRK and Japan can never be normalized as long as Japan persistently works to revive militarism while covering up its past history in which it imposed great misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people and committed unprecedented crimes against Korea in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese politicians should stop the anachronistic moves to justify the unprecedented crimes committed against the Korean people and opt for clearly liquidating Japan's past as early as possible in line with the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
