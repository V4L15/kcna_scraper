Korea Can Never Be Justified: Rodong Sinmun\r\n Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation can never tolerate the U.S. desperately  pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK while justifying its aggressor forces' presence in south Korea, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t It says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' presence in south Korea is the root cause of disturbing peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in Northeast Asia, and a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the Korean nation as it is quite contrary to its will and wishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From a historical point of view, the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea was a product of its hostile policy of aggression towards the DPRK, not according to the will and wishes of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. troops occupied the region south of the 38th Parallel under the pretext of \"disarming Japanese troops\" after the Japanese imperialists' defeat. But it was aimed to lay a military springboard from which to put the Korean peninsula and Northeast Asia under control. This was quite contrary to the interests of the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. troops' presence brought untold misfortune and sufferings to the south Korean people. Not a single day passes without seeing tears and blood of people in south Korea where U.S. aggressor troops behave like brutes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is making foolish efforts to establish military domination over the Asia-Pacific region, though it is suffering serious economic difficulties. However, gone are the days never to return when the U.S. could perpetrate military intervention and invasion of other countries as it pleased, styling itself \"the world's only superpower\". The U.S. decline and ruin are a hard reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces should pull out of south Korea without fail for the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in the region and for the U.S. itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persistently tries to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea, this will only result in the miserable doom of its aggressor forces."
