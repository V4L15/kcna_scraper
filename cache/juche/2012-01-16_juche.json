Korean Authorities\r\n Pyongyang, January 16 (KCNA) -- It is an urgent demand for defending the country's peace and the nation's security to foil the war moves of the south Korean hostile forces to invade the DPRK in collusion with outside forces. Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a by-lined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a vital issue related to the nation's destiny and urgent task required by reality to check and frustrate the war moves of the warmongers at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out in the Korean Peninsula, it will be Koreans in the north and south who will suffer from it. But in this case outside forces will fish in troubled waters. In case another war breaks out in the peninsula due to the reckless military provocations of warmongers at home and abroad, it is bound to escalate into a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Koreans should never allow themselves to fall victim to a nuclear war as they underwent horrible disasters from the war ignited by the U.S. imperialists and their stooges in the middle of last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula has long been in the state of neither war nor peace. But the war danger has never been so alarming on the peninsula as now. The pro-U.S. conservative Lee Myung Bak's \"government\" emerged in south Korea to give top priority to strengthening the alliance for aggression with the U.S. and, consequently, the war moves were intensified, driving the situation on the peninsula into the worst phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, the saber-rattling committed by the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors during the nation's mourning over the great loss to nation deprived the group of the last chance to bring peace and improve the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces to disturb peace have reduced the Armistice Agreement to a dead paper. The Lee group also scrapped the North-South Joint Declaration, nullifying the agreements for defusing the tension and completely blocking the channel of dialogue. It is quite evident what consequences will be entailed by the above-said moves of the warmongers at home and abroad."

However, the DPRK has made sincere efforts for reunification, prompted by the patriotic desire to bring about national reunification, the aspiration of all the Koreans, as early as possible, as evidenced by its broadminded proposal for dialogue and negotiations, not asking about his past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the Lee group turned down the proposal for dialogue made by compatriots, defying the aspiration and wishes of the fellow countrymen. Worse still, this group of traitors no better than animals rubbed salt into the wounds of the compatriots grieving the passing of the great father of the nation born of Heaven. These confrontation maniacs can never be pardoned.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials and other compatriots under the Fukuoka prefectural headquarters will join in the nationwide struggle to throw Lee Myung Bak into a graveyard of history, he stressed."
