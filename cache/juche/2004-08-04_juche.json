He saw consumer goods of wide variety which national light industrial factories and districts and counties of the city had produced by tapping and using inner reserves and potentials and highly praised them. And he set forth important tasks to be fulfilled to make substantial contributions to the improvement of the people's living through an all-people movement for the production of consumer goods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Vice-Premier of the Cabinet Kwak Pom Gi in his report said the start of the movement opened a broad avenue for raising the production of consumer goods both in quantity and quality in a short time with the participation of all the people by putting to effective use all the reserves and potentials in all regions and fields of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He recalled that Kim Jong Il energetically guided the movement so that it could be waged vigorously on a massive and nation-wide scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the movement has displayed great vitality in the light industrial revolution and the improvement of the people's living in the past two decades for its originality and validity, he referred to concrete tasks arising in lifting the production of consumer goods to a new, higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the meeting were Premier of the Cabinet Pak Pong Ju, Secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea Han Song Ryong, Chairman of the State Planning Commission Kim Kwang Rin, Minister of Light Industry Ri Ju O and others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- The U.S. moves to \"cut down\" its forces in south Korea is nothing but a wicked ruse to perpetuate its military presence in south Korea and colonial domination over it and make the south Korean authorities meekly accept its brigandish demands including additional troop dispatch to Iraq, observes Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had unilaterally decided on the timetable for the \"reduction\" of its forces in south Korea at a time when the anti-American sentiment was mounting among the south Koreans and raised all of a sudden the issue of readjusting the timetable on which it has so far insisted. Lurking behind these moves is a sinister aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had informed the south Korean authorities that it would \"cut down\" its forces in south Korea by over 10,000 till the end of 2005 without any agreement with them. But the U.S. made an about-turn in its attitude about a month later and announced the \"delay\" of the \"reduction.\" This creates a strong impression that the U.S. intends to use the \"reduction\" as a bargaining chip or as a leverage to intimidate one in a bid to achieve a certain aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has now become clear that the U.S. administration announced the \"reduction\" of its aggressor troops in south Korea not because it is urgent but it was prompted by its intention to create \"security unrest\" in south Korean society floating a shocking story about \"reduction.\" Through this it sought to browbeat the south Korean authorities and calm down the anti-American public opinion in order to save its dominating position in south Korea from shaking to its very foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities have begged the U.S. to put off the \"cutdown\" of its forces in south Korea, taken in by its trick. This is a crime against the nation, reunification and peace as it betrays the dignity and interests of the nation and brings dark clouds of a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people should see through the criminal aim hidden behind the U.S. plan to \"reduce\" its forces and turn out as one to force the U.S. to withdraw all its aggressor troops from south Korea.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"

It is the ranks united steel-like in revolutionary comradeship and sense of obligation, which are merciless to the aggressors attempting to encroach upon the sovereignty and dignity of the nation, but are ready to lay down their lives for the people  Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article, which reads in part:\r\n The KPA is a matchless revolutionary army which has won all the fights with imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Born in the flames of anti-imperialist struggle, the KPA is armed ranks which have fought death-defying battles on the forefronts where confrontation between revolution and counter-revolution and socialism and imperialism is most acute. And it is proud revolutionary armed forces which have successfully fulfilled the heavy duty they assumed before the times on the forefront of the anti-imperialist military front, taking upon themselves responsibility for the destiny of the country, the nation and socialism. The might and pride of the KPA lie in that it worked miracles of winning victories in all battles, not knowing a single defeat on the anti-imperialist military front most acute ever known. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary armed forces, after their foundation, defeated huge armies of the Japanese imperialists, the most ferocious and brutal robbers, and the U.S. imperialists who boasted of their being \"the strongest\" in the world and their satellite forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the powerful KPA has stood guard on the anti-imperialist military front in do-or-die spirit, the dignity of the nation and peace have been able to be defended for a long period of over half a century since the ceasefire in this land and the socialist revolutionary position be consolidated like an impregnable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the KPA has increased beyond measure under the banner of Songun. Under the Songun leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea, it has grown to be a revolutionary army possessed of offensive and defensive means powerful to drive back any formidable enemy at one blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is reliably defending Korean-style socialism at the outpost of the anti-imperialist military front today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has grown to be an invincible revolutionary army wining one victory after another on this front as it has been led by the great brilliant commanders of Mt.

            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean Authorities Hit for Their Allurement and Abduction of North Koreans Abroad\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 3 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Tuesday as regards the recent allurement and abduction of many northerners abroad to south Korea:\r\n Recently the south Korean authorities, at the U.S. instigation and under its command, faked up the so-called \"massive defection of northerners and their transfer.\" They took away hundreds of northerners, mainly women and children, to south Korea in groups after alluring them to Vietnam via the vicinity of the DPRK on a phased basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, most of the northerners whom they described as \"defectors from the north\" are those who fell victim to the allurement tactics of the enemy's spy organs after going to Northeast China for a visit to their relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means accidental that this case was faked up in less a week after the \"bill on human rights in north Korea\" envisaging fabulous \"financial aid\" to the \"defectors from the north\" was passed through the U.S. House of Representatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. media are making much fuss, as if they had been waiting for the opportunity to occur, that the wholesale defection of north Koreans proves bankruptcy of the north Korean regime's education, information activities and control over its citizens. They cry for joy that it would be a best scenario if this leads to the collapse of north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the recent case was, to all intents and purposes, a product of the U.S. hostile DPRK policy whose ultimate aim is to topple its political system and it was prompted by the deliberate intention of dishonest elements in south Korea desirous of discord and confrontation between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that Vietnam conspired with them in this case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has information enough to prove that Vietnam was involved in the plot of the U.S. and the south Korean authorities to allure and abduct citizens of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through its involvement in the case Vietnam self-exposed that it can stoop to any perfidious action, discarding elementary sense of obligation and morality between the states, in order to meet its own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly make non-governmental organizations in some countries pay for their flesh traffic worldwide as they have been engrossed in threatening, alluring and trading off DPRK citizens under the signboard of humanitarianism at the instigation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seems to calculate that it can use the issue of \"defectors\" for bringing down the DPRK as it did erstwhile East European countries. This is, however, as foolish an act as trying to put an end to the sun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No issue between the DPRK and the U.S., to say nothing of the nuclear issue, can be settled unless the U.S. fundamentally drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
