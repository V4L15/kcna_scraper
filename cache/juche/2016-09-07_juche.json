This is utterly illogical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more viciously the UN Security Council finds fault with the DPRK's legitimate measures for self-defence by siding with the U.S., arch criminal harassing peace and security on the Korean peninsula, the more glaringly it will reveal its true colors as an unfair good-for-nothing entity before the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will continue to expand the signal successes of bolstering up the nuclear force in a phased way in this historic year when it started with the solemn blast of the first H-bomb test of Juche Korea."

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- September 8 this year marks 71 years since the U.S. military occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a statement Wednesday said that the 70-odd history of the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea has been the one in which war, confrontation and escalation of tension have persisted on the Korean peninsula, adding that the U.S. forces in south Korea are a cancer-like entity harassing peace and security on the Korean peninsula and in the region and bringing the dark clouds of a thermonuclear war. The statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the end of the Second World War the U.S. occupied south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the Imperial Japanese Army. Since then it, pursuant to its aggressive scenario for domination of Asia and world, divided the territory of Korea and the Korean nation and has inflicted the war disaster on the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the past six-odd decades since the signing of the Armistice Agreement, the U.S. introduced into south Korea and its vicinity huge aggression forces including nuclear weapons and staged the DPRK-targeted war exercises under various codenames, steadily escalating the tension on the Korean peninsula and in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the peninsula has constantly been put beyond control amid the evil cycle of escalation of tension. This is attributable to the arms buildup of the U.S. and the joint military exercises for aggression staged every year with the U.S. forces in south Korea as main force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea have turned into \"strategic task force\" capable of intervening in any dispute in the region under the signboard of \"strategic flexibility\" and this has made its aggressive nature clearer. Recently, THAAD which includes even countries around Korea within the radius of operation was decided to be deployed in the U.S. forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves that unless the U.S. forces are withdrawn from south Korea as early as possible, it would be impossible to expect lasting peace and security on the peninsula and in Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We opted for nuclear weaponization to safeguard the sovereignty, right to existence and peace and security of the country to stand up against the U.S. extreme hostile policy toward the DPRK and its threat of a nuclear war, and are bolstering up the nuclear deterrence for self-defence in every way, regarding it as its strategic line to simultaneously push forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to clearly face up to the strategic position of the DPRK which ranked itself among the nuclear powers and the trend of the times and roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, replace the Armistice Agreement with a peace treaty and withdraw its aggression troops and war means from south Korea at once."

It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists divided one territory and one blood vessel of one nation into two and lorded it over south Korea as a de factor ruler for decades but there is neither single document nor a single paragraph of agreement that can support even its mere form. This is the truth about the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSteadily training and replacing their hand-raised running dogs, the U.S. imperialists turned south Korea into their permanent colony and egged pro-U.S. stooges on to the acts for hostility, confrontation and aggression against the DPRK and mover for stifling it, deliberately standing in the way of achieving national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea are the root cause of all disaster and pain suffered by the Korean nation in its modern history and they are a pronoun of aggression and war and symbol of injustice and evil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is a matter of urgent concern of the international community and countries around Korea aspiring after stability and development of the region and it is a top priority political task.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world progressive forces loving justice and aspiring after peace should pay due attention to the Korean nation's struggle against the U.S. and war that has lasted century after century and render active support and encouragement to the just sacred war for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should clearly understand that its justification or pretext for its aggression forces' presence in south Korea will no longer work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialist aggressors should make a proper option at the present crucial crossroads if they do not want to be a wandering spirit without even label in the second Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe appeal noted that no one can block the advance of the Korean nation to drive the U.S. imperialists out of south Korea and usher in a new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity, and the final victory belongs to the Korean nation."

And he had wisely led the work to establish a people's revolutionary government at guerrilla bases around the River Tuman in conformity with specific conditions of the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Commune and the Soviet were the only forms of working-class government at that time. But they were inconsistent with conditions of Korea, a colonial semi-feudal society where the capitalist development was repressed due to the occupation by the Japanese imperialist aggressors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From this point of view, Kim Il Sung delivered a speech \"The People's Revolutionary Government Is Genuine People's Power\" at the assembly for setting up the people's revolutionary government in Gayahe, Wangqing, in March Juche 22 (1933). \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his speech he stressed that the people's revolutionary government is a power based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class and on the united front of broad masses of people standing against the Japanese imperialist aggressors and it is a genuine people's power run by the people as its masters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later, district people's revolutionary government appeared in most guerrilla bases around the River Tuman with peasant committee in some areas. The people's revolutionary government distributed the land free to inhabitants and enforced such popular policies as eight-hour working system, free education and free medical services, bringing about great social reforms in the bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the people's revolutionary government served as a prototype of the people's power founded in Korea after its liberation from Japan's colonial rule on August 15, 1945."
