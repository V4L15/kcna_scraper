They have thrown off the signboard of \"defence\" to get themselves ready for mounting practical \"attack.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The theory of \"attacking enemy bases\" touted by them is just the theory of a war for staging a comeback to Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The completion of \"emergency legislation\" for prompt and efficient \"counteraction\" in case of \"emergency in areas surrounding Japan\" with the main stress laid on \"event of contingency in the Korean Peninsula,\" the formation and deployment of SDF combat units and frequent military exercises of the SDF in the sea east of Korea are all part of the preparations for reinvasion of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarists' scheme to realize their ambition for reinvasion by way of reckless preemptive attack started long ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan already conducted \"mock preemptive attack\" in the 1990s under the pretext of \"countering missile attack\" from the DPRK. The then Japan Defence Agency increased attack capability after confirming ASDF's ability of collecting information and carrying out an electronic warfare through it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' undisguised \"theory about attack on enemy bases\" proves the danger of their attempt at reinvasion in practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japan Defence Ministry recently worked out \"basic policy for development and use of outer space\" and included in it an article stipulating that Japan shall kick off researches into the development of early warning satellite capable of immediately detecting \"enemy state's\" ballistic missile launch. This is an extension of such reinvasion scheme.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Missile launch\" and \"threat to regional security\" much touted by Japan are nothing but a trick to cover up its aggression design.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already clarified more than once, there is nothing questionable in the DPRK's space activities for peaceful purposes as they are part of the worldwide efforts to explore space. It is, therefore, illogical for Japan to talk about \"attack.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's missile program does never pose any threat to those countries which are not hostile toward the DPRK because it is a self-defensive measure to protect the security of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan continues acting rashly to dare infringe upon the dignity of the DPRK and its people in disregard of the said stand, it will meet only merciless punishment."

It is impossible to develop science and technology when the might of ideology is disregarded. Ideology is above science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scientists and technicians of the DPRK accurately put satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 into orbit by carrier rocket Unha-2 and the workers of Kangson built a modern UHP electric arc furnace by their own efforts and with their own technology even under the most arduous and difficult conditions. This would have been unthinkable without the might of ideology and morality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-oriented theory of ideology serves as an invincible treasured sword which helps the people display their greater might in the present times when a fierce anti-imperialist class struggle is underway.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has achieved decisive victory by driving the U.S. imperialists to a tight corner in all the fields of politics, military affair, economy and diplomacy in recent years. This was possible not because it had a strong material potential. The political and ideological might of the DPRK was the source of strength which helped it foil the strategy for stifling the DPRK invented by those imperialists styling themselves strategists and the unprecedented blockade committed by them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il is one which embodies the theory of ideology and the Songun era is one that advances by the invincible ideological and moral power.

The Songun politics is based on the unity of the army and people in thinking and will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The environment of the Korean revolution still remains difficult and complicated but the DPRK has such invincible weapon as the theory of ideology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people have fully equipped with the revolutionary soldier spirit, the most revolutionary and militant idea and spirit in our era, going through thick and thin during the \"Arduous March.\" The strong mentality they have built generation after generation helped bring about a fresh great Songun revolutionary surge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stirring reality today eloquently proves that there is nothing impossible for the Korean people and they can win everything when the might of ideology is given full play.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A rosy future of a great prosperous and powerful nation looms ahead of them, the article says, stressing that ultimate victory is in store for the party, army and people of the DPRK struggling guided by the theory of ideology."
