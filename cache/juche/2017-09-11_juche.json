It is that Leader Kim Jong Un won a victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He has turned his country into a nuclear power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that Kim Jong Un has taken the initiative in essence, the U.S. has come to the conclusion that it can never sleep a sound sleep.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief of the defense research office of the Center for the National Interests of the U.S., in a commentary contributed to the political news journal National Interest on September 3, noted that the recent successful nuclear test clearly proved that the supreme leader of north Korea is a sturdy leader who does anything without fail once he is determined to do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Notable in those opinions is the claim strongly urging the U.S. administration to make a U-turn in its policy toward the DPRK by facing up to the situation from the acknowledgment that the mechanical structure between the DPRK and the U.S. and the world political structure have undergone a complete change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Western media like AP, ABC, Washington Post, Reuters, Independent and AFP, commenting on the statement of the Nuclear Weapons Institute of the DPRK on Sept. 3, asserted that the H-bomb test directly hit Trump who has hesitated in tackling the Korean issue. The event showed that the structure of the confrontation between the U.S. and the DPRK has completely changed and the U.S. and its allies have no way to check the DPRK's rapid development of nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the nuclear bomb test of north Korea proved that Washington's north Korea policy has come to a real flop, Germany's radio Deutsche Welle said on Sept. 4:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The H-bomb test conducted by the DPRK was the bitterest moment for the U.S. A bomb like that is powerful enough to reduce New York to ashes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. strategy to halt the DPRK's nuclear and missile programs through sanctions has come to a failure. If the U.S. escalates sanctions and waits for its effect, the DPRK will get more time to complete its missile program. The U.S. is now the loser on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trump only reveals his true colors as paper tiger whenever he twitters against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A commentary contributed to the newspaper of Hong Kong of China South China Morning Post by its correspondent in New York termed the denuclearization of the DPRK and a preemptive attack on it unrealistic. It urged the U.S. to think of a new and realistic policy now that its goal for denuclearizing the DPRK has proved futile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. politicians are needed to have the stance of heeding the public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That will help them clear their confusion and secure a way out."
