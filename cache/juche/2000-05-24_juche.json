They have firmly defended Chongryon, the precious patriotic heritage bequeathed to the republic by the President, despite the most vicious anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon moves of the enemies at home and abroad since the appearance of Chongryon and steadily advanced the patriotic movement for the homeland and the nation. \r\n\r\n"

Its military activity overseas is prohibited by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, it restored its rights of belligerency and entry into a war through the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" and modernized military hardware for a war of overseas aggression with the backing of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the black-hearted intention of the Japanese reactionaries to maintain close relations of military cooperation with the U.S. and join the U.S. forces stationed in Japan in a war of aggression overseas so as to bring their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries should mind that to participate in a war of overseas aggression with the backing of the U.S. is just a foolish act of precipitating their self-destruction like they jump into fire with faggot on their back. \r\n\r\n"
