This was because the Korean people were undergoing unprecedented ordeals and difficulties due to the natural disasters for consecutive years and the harsh sanctions and blockade of the allied imperialist forces from the middle of the 1990s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The modern history of the DPRK records that time as the period of the Arduous March, the forced march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Korean people pulled through difficulties, rallied close around the WPK which held high the banner of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK has consistently maintained the line of economic construction in the era of Songun which provides a sure guarantee for the building of an economic power despite the moves of the imperialists. It has also pushed forward the development of the overall national economy, regarding the metal, power and coal industries and railways transport as the pilot domains of the national economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK considered the policy of attaching importance to idea, the policy of attaching importance to army and that of attaching importance to science and technology as the three main pillars for building a thriving nation and made the drive for pushing back the frontiers of latest science and technology rage across the country."
