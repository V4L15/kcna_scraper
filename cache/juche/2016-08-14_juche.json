Korea\r\n Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA Sunday as regards Germany's projected delivery of attack missiles to south Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\t There are reports that Germany will deliver Taurus air-to-surface missiles capable of accurately hitting the strategic bases of the DPRK within this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it is true, Germany's projected delivery disregarding even its domestic law banning arms export to dispute-torn areas will disturb peace and escalate tensions on the Korean peninsula, the biggest hot spot in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past Germany sold Patriot interceptor missiles and diesel engine submarines to south Korea. Its unhesitating delivery of even attack missiles to south Korea will only result in inciting the south Korean authorities getting desperate in confrontation with the compatriots in the north to a new war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Germany has talked more than any others that it hopes for \"stability\" and \"peace\" on the Korean peninsula as it made apologies repeatedly for inflicting untold disasters upon humankind by igniting two world wars and experienced the pain resulting from national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, it is now making no scruple of doing an action inciting a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is, indeed, preposterous for it to term the DPRK's self-defensive steps for defending its sovereignty, vital rights of the nation and regional peace \"violations of resolutions\" of the UN Security Council, while selling even attack missiles to south Korea in defiance of its domestic law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Germany will have to have courage to answer the question as to whether the UNSC's resolution terming weapon test \"threat to world peace and security\" is fair or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it wants to shoulder \"heavier responsibility\" in the international arena, it will have to discreetly behave with a right viewpoint on the situation on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The projected sale of missiles should be retracted at once as it will wreck peace on the Korean peninsula and other parts of the region."
