            "content": "Japan's Ambition for Militarist Reinvasion under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Former Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan Nobutaka Machimura from the Liberal Democratic Party spoke about the need to \"eradicate the aftermath of defeat in the war from the educational field\" when addressing a recent meeting of the ad hoc committee of the House of Representatives dealing with the major educational law.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an open challenge to the world public opinion demanding Japan repent of its past bloody history interwoven with aggression and plunder and turn over a new leaf and a mockery of human conscience as it is a rash outcry totally rejecting Japan's repentance of its past criminal history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces of Japan are flatly refusing even to repent of Japan's past wrongs, not content with having evaded the responsibility for them. This is a more blatant challenge to the public at home and abroad as it reveals their intention to repeat the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" to call back the departed soul of militarism have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are going mad, seized by the ambition to revive militarism and realize reinvasion. This is arousing big apprehension and vigilance of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the political and social circles in the U.S. are becoming increasingly displeased with the Japanese reactionaries' reckless moves to revive militarism and launch reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Voices of caution about the moves to revive militarism are heard from Japan, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to cool their heads heated with fever of militarism, bearing deep in mind that their revival of militarism and their moves to realize the ambition of reinvasion will only render Japan further isolated in the international arena and precipitate its ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- Leader Kim Jong Il's start of the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu in June Juche 45 (1956) marked a historic event as it ushered a new era of carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of Juche and provided a new landmark in confidently inheriting the traditions of the Korean revolution.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in an editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The march to Mt. Paektu, a holy mountain of the revolution, is a trip for winning sure victories in the struggles as the army and people of the DPRK glorify the Songun era by steadfastly carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of Juche generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the crucial period when the Korean people stood at the crossroads of protecting the banner of Juche which had been held aloft from the start of the revolution or not, Kim Jong Il led the group making a study tour of the revolutionary battle sites to visit the area of Mt. Paektu on its first leg. This was a solemn declaration which fully proved that there are no other traditions for the Korean people than the revolutionary traditions of Juche, the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu established by President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatest exploits performed by Kim Jong Il when steering the Korean revolution on the basis of the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu lie in that he gave comprehensive answers to all the theoretical and practical problems arising in carrying forward the revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All questions that arose in carrying forward the revolutionary traditions in our era have been lucidly explained by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His another undying exploit lies in that he trained the army, the people and the younger generation into indomitable revolutionaries fully equipped with the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also performed an immortal feat in steadfastly carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu by providing centres for the education in the revolutionary traditions and setting a shining example in the construction of the holy land of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now faced with a sacred task to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the uplifted banner of Songun along the course of the march to Mt. Paektu, which was opened by Kim Il Sung and has been steadily followed by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to dynamically continue the march to Mt. Paektu holding aloft the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people should hasten this march, regarding the Songun traditions as an invincible weapon in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should never forget Mt. Paektu where the Songun traditions, the eternal lifeline of the Korean revolution, began. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To fully display the spirit of devotedly defending the leader is a firm guarantee for steadily carrying on the march to Mt. Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To devotedly defend the leader is the core of the revolutionary traditions of Mt. Paektu. Giving steady continuity to the march to Mt. Paektu precisely means adding shine to the traditions of defending the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The happier the Korean people feel while making revolution under the leadership of Kim Jong Il who protects and takes care of their destiny and future, the higher they should hold the banner of devotedly defending him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK, who enshrine the soul of Mt. Paektu, will trust and follow Kim Jong Il only and eternally glorify the tradition of devotedly defending the leader bequeathed to them by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This irrefutably revealed the U.S. imperialists' true nature as man-killers who indiscriminately massacred innumerable south Koreans during the war.\r\n The U.S. has so far persistently evaded its responsibility for the shocking massacres of civilians by its soldiers during the war including the murder case in Rogun-ri, saying that they were \"accidents\" and that it could not confirm whether there was an order to fire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mass killings of Koreans by GIs during the war were not accidents but deliberate and premeditated atrocity as clearly evidenced by the recently disclosed fact, observes Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. refuses to admit the fact, although it was proven to have been deliberate and premeditated one, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are working overtime to provoke another Korean war to reduce Korea into the battle field of a nuclear war and exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have desperately maneuvered to wipe out the Korean nation's movement for independent reunification which is running on the crest of a surging tide with the advent of the June 15 era of reunification, pushed the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. into a deadlock, spurred the \"relocation\" of their aggression troops in south Korea and arms buildup and staged mad-cap exercises for a nuclear war of aggression against the north in south Korea. These are premeditated provocative acts to ignite a train of a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that in case a war is provoked on the Korean Peninsula again by the U.S. imperialists, it will turn out to be a war of genocide as the U.S. is keen to realize its domination over the whole of Korea even by reducing the peninsula to ruins and exterminating the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can never tolerate the U.S. imperialists' feverish moves to start a nuclear war on this land today after killing millions of Koreans in cold blood in the last Korean war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In other words, it precisely belongs to the right to national self-determination as it concerns the destiny of Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, national reunification should be achieved by the Korean nation itself according to its independent intention and demand. No foreign force has the right to interfere in the issue of reunification which belongs to the right of national self-determination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is based on a scientific exposition of the driving force of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle is consistent with the Koreans' pride of excellent national character. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Success or failure of the cause of national reunification based on the principle of independence depends on the great unity of the nation based on patriotism and the spirit of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no more worthwhile work for the Koreans than to devote themselves to national independence and reunification. All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to achieve the independent reunification in the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the banner of national independence, bearing in mind the patriotic appeal set forth in the joint New Year editorial.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "National Memorial Service for Kim Hyong Jik Held\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 5 (KCNA) -- A national memorial service for Kim Hyong Jik, an indomitable revolutionary fighter and an outstanding leader of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea, was held at the People's Palace of Culture Monday on the occasion of his 80th death anniversary.\r\n Attending the service were Kim Yong Nam, Kim Yong Chun, Jon Pyong Ho, Ri Yong Mu, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Jung Rin and vice-premiers of the Cabinet Kwak Pom Gi and Jon Sung Hun, Chairperson of the Central Committee of the Chondoist Chongu Party Ryu Mi Yong, and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, in a memorial address said that the whole life of Kim Hyong Jik was a noble life of a genuine patriot who fought for the sovereignty of the country and the emancipation of proletarian masses and a glorious life of an outstanding revolutionary who performed immortal feats in the history of the anti-Japanese national liberation movement in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when the movement for liberation in Korea was undergoing serious pain as it failed to find a right way, he set out the great idea of \"Aim High,\" indicating the road to be followed by the movement, Choe Thae Bok said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"Aim High\" represents a revolutionary view on life as it calls for finding the worth of living and happiness in the struggle for the country and the nation and the indomitable revolutionary spirit of liberating the country without fail by carrying on the struggle generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set the idea as the goal of his life and struggle and consistently applied it in the whole course of his revolutionary activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He trained key elements for organizing a new revolutionary organization and laid a mass foundation by awakening people of different social standings including workers and peasants and uniting them. On the basis of the careful preparations made for years he finally formed the Korean National Association (KNA) at a historic meeting in Hakdang-gol, Pyongyang on March 23, 1917. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The formation of the KNA made it possible for the Koreans to have a powerful revolutionary organization rallying all anti-Japanese forces as one and guiding the nationwide liberation movement in a uniform manner. As a result, the national liberation movement in Korea came to take a fresh road of confidently advancing in reliance upon the nation's independent forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It was thanks to the genuine education and upbringing provided by Kim Hyong Jik that President Kim Il Sung grew up to be an outstanding revolutionary from his early years and took the helm of revolution as an illustrious leader required by the times and longed for by the nation. This brought such greatest fortune to the Koreans as acclaiming him as an outstanding leader for the first time in the nation's history spanning thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation is a worthwhile and noble cause to creditably realize what Kim Hyong Jik desired while he was alive and Kim Il Sung's behest and bring about the eternal prosperity of Kim Il Sung's nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to conduct a more dynamic all-out offensive to effect a great surge in building a great prosperous powerful nation so as to give full play to the advantages of Korean-style socialism and bring about full efflorescence of Songun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how arduous and difficult our struggle may be, we should overcome manifold difficulties with a high sense of revolutionary obligation and persevering will without the slightest vacillation and consolidate the politico-ideological, economic and military positions of Korean-style socialism as firm as an iron wall, by carrying forward the steadfast idea of independence against imperialism, the spirit of being prepared for three contingencies and the indefatigable revolutionary spirit possessed by Kim Hyong Jik.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
