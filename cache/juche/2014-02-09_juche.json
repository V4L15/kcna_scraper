            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Blasts Nexus between U.S. and Japan for Nuclear War\r\nPyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Abe, when asked by a Diet man at a recent meeting of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives about whether there was a secret agreement between the U.S. and Japan on the introduction of nuclear weapons in the 1960s, answered that it was wrong for the successive regimes of the Liberal Democratic Party to persistently fail to let the people know about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is little short of the Japanese chief executive's full revelation that the U.S. moves to launch a nuclear war in Northeast Asia in conspiracy with Japan started as early as in the 1960s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. aggressive scenario to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula after turning south Korea and Japan into nuclear outposts, the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies the reason why the U.S. imperialists signed a secret agreement with their junior ally in the 1960s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Huge nuclear offensive means of the U.S. forces deployed in Japan are aimed to carry out the strategy for a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. has staged ceaseless war exercises under various codenames in south Korea and Japan in recent years with nuclear force involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries have oft-repeated \"three non-nuclear principles\" as regards the danger of a nuclear war prevailing on the Korean peninsula but offered their territory to their American master as a nuclear base, hatching plots with the U.S. behind scene. This sinister scenario should not be overlooked. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nuclear arming is the invariable ambition of Japan and it is a strategic goal for turning Japan into a military giant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries consider nuclear arming as a prospect for realizing their ambition for overseas expansion. It is their view that the stepped-up nuclear arming would help them launch overseas aggression and the operation for conquering the world as they please.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. is truly concerned about nuclear threat, it had better get serious about the poisonous mushroom growing under its \"nuclear umbrella.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it is truly interested in peace and nuclear disarmament, it should on longer pursue wild ambition for preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK and immediately halt nuclear war exercises scheduled to be held in south Korea."
