Korean Warmongers \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The joint military exercises \"RSOI\" and \"Foal Eagle\" are very dangerous war games against the DPRK, which are aimed at swiftly hurling massive reinforcements and military hardware of the U.S. onto the Korean front in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula and invading the DPRK by a large-scale joint operation of the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops and the south Korean army, notes Rodong Sinmun in a news analysis Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the massive war rehearsal against the north integrating \"RSOI\" and \"Foal Eagle\" projected by the U.S. and south Korean warlike forces this year again, the analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These joint military exercises planned by them at a time when the situation of the Korean Peninsula is softening in various aspects are a never-to-be-condoned challenge and a grave military provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan cannot be construed otherwise than an indication that they are pursuing confrontation and war, not reconciliation and improved relations, and gives rise to doubt about the credibility of their recent agreement with the DPRK and their will to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is perfidy to the dialogue partner that the south Korean authorities declared the projected war games with the U.S. against the north even before the ink was dry on the agreement at the recent north-south ministerial talks in which they promised the north to make joint efforts for peace on the Korean Peninsula and improvement of inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless war exercises of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers against the DPRK will entail only negative consequences, stonewalling the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula, pushing the inter-Korean relations back to a crisis again and fanning the climate of confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and war games are never compatible with each other.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

She said that the customs of making kimchi for winter in November and bean paste in March are inherent to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bean paste, which should be put on the sumptuous feast, is the essential foodstuff in the dietary life of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bean paste has thousands of years of tradition in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ancestors found out that the fermented soybean is tasty and nutritious. They, therefore, started making bean paste and soy with steamed soybean to use them as essential foodstuff and seasoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They even make stands for the bean paste jars in March habitually. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are proud of bean paste. The folk method of making bean paste, along with the industrial method, is encouraged in the DPRK where the folk traditions are valued.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
