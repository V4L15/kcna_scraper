            "content": "Vestiges of Ancestors in Mt. Paektu Area \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- Mt. Paektu, the ancestral mountain of Korea, is proud of the time-honored history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation chose the area of Mt. Paektu as a site of living from time immemorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly proved by lots of relics unearthed in historical remains left behind by the Korean ancestors in the area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discovered in Sinmyong-ri, Phungso County, Ryanggang Province, is a site of a house like the semicircular houses of the ancient times, many of which have been unearthed in the River Taedong basin and twelve dolmens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A gourd-shaped pot, one of the typical relics belonging to the period of Tangun's Korea, was found in this housing site, which attracts experts' attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the relics unearthed in the area of Mt. Paektu in the 1960s is a star-shaped axe, a weapon for military command, which is estimated to belong to the end of the 2000s B.C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unearthed in Sinjung-ri, Unhung County, Ryanggang Province, the axe has in its center a hole about 2.5 centimeters in diameter and eight horns protrude along its fringe and there are eight small horns between horns. It looks similar in shape to the star-shaped axe found at the housing site in Wonam-dong, Rakrang District, Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also found in the area of Mt. Paektu are relics of things which Korean ancestors created, inherited and developed in the course of overcoming the peculiar climatic conditions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A typical example are the spinning-wheels, which are spinning tools  discovered in different areas including Kim Hyong Jik County, Joyang-ri, Kapsan County, and Sinmyong-ri, Phungso County, Ryanggang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ancient spinning-wheels made by baking clay or by whetting animal bones have been found among the relics of different periods from the Neolithic era to the Bronze and Iron ages. This indicates that the Korean ancestors attached great importance to spinning under the climatic condition of the Mt. Paektu area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, quite a lot of relics giving glimpses of the custom of the ancestors have been found in the Pomuigusok remains in Musan County and Odong remains in Hoeryong City, North Hamgyong Province, Konggwi-dong remains in Kanggye City, Jagang Province and in valleys and riversides along the great Paektu range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government is today showing deep interests in the preservation and management, unearthing and arrangement of the precious historical remains and relics left by the ancestors in the Mt. Paektu area.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This reality patently proves that the Koreans cannot preserve the precious achievements made by them in the efforts to achieve national reunification by their concerted efforts nor can they achieve independent reunification, peace and prosperity unless the group's anti-reunification acts and moves for  confrontation are frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  In order to advance the June 15 era of reunification steadily and dynamically despite difficulties, all Koreans at home and abroad should not allow any slightest act of the Lee group going against the implementation of the above-said declarations but wage a vigorous struggle to uphold and implement the historic declarations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should hold fast to the June 15 joint declaration whose vitality has been proved in practice as a programme for reunification common to the nation and give steady momentum to the nationwide atmosphere of implementing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adherence to the June 15 joint declaration and its implementation would guarantee the victory of the cause of independent reunification and a bright prospect of preserving the peace of the country and achieving the prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans at home and abroad are called upon to intensify the struggle for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, not slackening the present elated atmosphere even a bit, and thus foil the moves of the foreign forces and the group of traitors to scrap the declaration and pave a wide avenue for independent reunification and peace and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
