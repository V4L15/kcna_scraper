            "content": "U.S. Chiefly to Blame for Torpedoing Process of Denuclearization of Korean Peninsula \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- The U.S is chiefly to blame for torpedoing the process of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, say Pyongyang-based papers Wednesday in signed commentaries.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves to turn south Korea into a nuclear arsenal started with its announcement 20 years ago that it would deploy Lance missile capable of carrying neutron bombs in south Korea and the deployment of Honest John nuclear missile there in 1958. It has since systematically escalated its moves to convert south Korea into its nuclear base for the last several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become more undisguised and reckless in its moves to launch a nuclear war against the DPRK since the emergence of the present Bush administration. In January 2002 the U.S. adopted a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK as its policy in its report on the review of nuclear weapons. And in September of the same year Bush blustered in \"the report on national security strategy\" that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons when preemptive military strikes are made. The U.S. defense secretary uttered on November 17, 2003 during his visit to south Korea that the U.S. would mobilize even nuclear force when necessary, thus clearly revealing an attempt at a nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was quite just for the DPRK to have built war deterrent as a means for just self-defence to protect the sovereignty and the right to existence of the country, given that the U.S. unilaterally scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework in which it committed itself neither to use nuclear weapons against the DPRK nor threaten it with them, steadily escalated the nuclear threat to it and attempted to provoke a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, the U.S. is taking issue with the DPRK's measure for self-defence, while shelving its nuclear crimes perpetrated for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unpardonable is the U.S. which cites the DPRK's war deterrent for self-defence a pretext for stepping up the nuclear arms race and provoking a nuclear war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the reality today when the danger of a nuclear war is daily increasing due to the U.S. requires the Korean nation to wage a more dynamic struggle for peace against the U.S. and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "UN Resolution Demanding Lift of Anti-Cuba Sanctions Hailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- A resolution demanding the U.S. lift economic, commercial and financial blockade against Cuba was adopted by an overwhelming majority approval of 183 member nations at the recent 61st session of the UN General Assembly.\r\n This is an expression of the international solidarity with Cuba. The U.S. anti-Cuba sanctions deserve such severe punishment by the world for its injustice and brigandish nature, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A pro-U.S. Batista dictatorial regime collapsed and a revolution triumphed in Cuba in January 1959. The U.S. has gone so mean as to pursue the vicious anti-Cuba policy of economic blockade since 1962. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Extraterritorial, unilateral and unjust measures are intolerable in the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. protracted anti-Cuba sanctions and blockade are a sort of economic and political war to isolate and stifle it and bring down the socialist system in it and a wanton violation of international law and the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of sanctions and blockade against Cuba, has therefore, been censured and denounced by the international community. The UN adoption of several resolutions censuring the U.S. mean sanctions against Cuba is a clear proof of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cuban people are pushing forward the revolution and construction, foiling every move of the U.S. to tighten the sanctions against their country and isolate and stifle it while maintaining the socialist principle with the international support. The recent adoption of the UN resolution is a clear manifestation of the justice of the Cuban revolution and the international support and encouragement to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people warmly hail the adoption of the recent UN resolution and extend firm solidarity to the Cuban people in their struggle to defend the gains of the revolution and socialism which they have achieved at the cost of their lives despite the U.S. imperialists' vicious moves to isolate and stifle Cuba.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is nobody's secret that the U.S. deployed massively stockpiled nuclear weapons in south Korea when the DPRK was doing everything to reunify the divided country in a peaceful manner.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conservative forces in south Korea including the GNP are slandering the DPRK's measure for self-defence, turning aside from this stark fact. This was prompted by their criminal attempt to scrap the joint declaration and bring the inter-Korean relations back into those of confrontation and belligerency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such reckless behavior of these forces is aimed, needless to say, at suppressing the forces for progressive reforms in the south Korean society and winning the next year's \"presidential election\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the sanctions of the U.S. and other international reactionaries against the DPRK to stifle it have reached an extreme phase, the anti-reunification forces including the GNP are running wild as if they had been waiting for this to happen, laying bare their true colors as top class pro-U.S. stooges and confrontation fanatics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is getting desperate to break the pluck and will of the DPRK taking the toughest stand to cope with its ever-increasing pressure and sanctions against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors to the nation is making last-ditch efforts to torpedo even the dialogue and cooperation now under way between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should faithfully implement the June 15 joint declaration and smash the sycophantic and treacherous acts of the GNP and all other anti-reunification and traitorous forces opposed to the declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He asserted that the north is going to use the Kaesong Industrial Zone as a \"frontline base\" in case of emergency and \"fund provided by the south side might have been diverted to the purpose of developing nukes in the north\".\r\n He even let loose the sheer nonsense that the Korean Social Democratic Party (KSDP) is an \"organization for operations\" and a certain overseas Korean is an \"operative.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement issued Wednesday in this regard: What Jong uttered is nothing but a charade based on sheer lies. It is a serious provocation as it malignantly slandered the dignified political system in the DPRK and an anti-reunification treacherous act aimed to totally scuttle the north-south cooperation based on the June 15 joint declaration and incite mistrust and confrontation between the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The development of the Kaesong Industrial Zone is an icon of the north-south cooperation and it started at the request of the south side. However, the GNP is going so reckless as to cry out that the north is turning it into a front-line base and the like, as if it were not enough with slandering the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the zone. This was prompted by its sinister intention to totally stem the trend of the June 15 era and bring the north-south relations back to the era of confrontation in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the GNP, a party of U.S. war servants, to dare paint the KSDP as an \"organization for operations\" in a bid to falsify facts and mislead public opinion. This only discloses its true colors as a party for hatching plots against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the GNP, a foreign party, which even sacrifices the dignity and sovereignty of the nation to serve its American master, looking up to the U.S. as its \"homeland,\" and does not bother to bluster that it will not rule out even a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is an enemy of peace and reunification and a group of criminals hell-bent on inciting confrontation between the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never pardon anyone who slanders its dignified political system and conducts a smear campaign against it on the basis of sheer lies.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Bellicose Forces' Reckless Arms Buildup under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- The south Korean bellicose forces should ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their reckless arms buildup and stop at once their moves to develop ultra-modern war equipment, which will only lead to their self-destruction, warns a spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee in a statement released on Nov. 15.\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces announced on Nov. 9 that they rounded off the development of a mobile radar system as part of the \"work to develop active protection mechanism\" now under way at the cost of 12 billion won from 2003 to 2008, and would begin its test operation from 2007, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are loud-mouthed that they have indigenously developed a fuel cell for submarine in the wake of their announcement that tanks developed by south Korea would be deployed at combat units from 2011. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean bellicose forces have become more vociferous about their development of war hardware than ever before, while blustering that the above-said war hardware is targeted against the north. This is an undisguised provocation and challenge to the north and an unpardonable treacherous act of driving the situation to the military confrontation and war between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The development of new type armed equipment and their introduction frantically stepped up by the south Korean war-like forces are unjustifiable as they are nothing but treacherous acts of serving the U.S. in its nuclear war of aggression.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
