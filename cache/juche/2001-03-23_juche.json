But lurking behind this row is the U.S. sinister intention to justify its military occupation of South Korea and its hostile policy towards the DPRK and bar the reunification of Korea and, furthermore, realise its ambition to seize the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is fear of the U.S. warmongers that if Korea is reunified, the U.S. will find no more justification to stay in South Korea and then it will not be able to realise its ambition to dominate Korea and the rest of Asia.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why they are working so hard to derail the Korean nation's train for independent reunification  from its track and increase the tensions on the Korean peninsula under the above-said absurd pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality calls upon all the Koreans to turn out in a patriotic struggle to frustrate the reckless offensive of the U.S. bellicose forces against the DPRK and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

Their high-handed and arbitrary practices can never work on the DPRK strong in its independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The workers' party and people of Korea will never tolerate  any pressure and interference on the part of them intended to encroach upon its sovereignty but force them to pay a very high price.    \r\n\r\n"
