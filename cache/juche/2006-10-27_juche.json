Korean Authorities Hit for Joining U.S. in Sanctions against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are these days contemplating putting a brake on cooperation in various fields which have been going on between Koreans after suspending inter-Korean humanitarian work, succumbing to the pressure of the United States. They are revealing their scheme to involve themselves even in the U.S.-sponsored military operation intended to blockade the DPRK.\r\n This comes under fire in a statement of a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Wednesday, which reads in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The involvement of the south Korean authorities in the U.S. moves to impose sanctions against the DPRK and stifle it is an anti-national criminal act to backpedal from the June 15 joint declaration and drive the inter-Korean relations to a catastrophe, indifferent to the dignity and interests of the nation, and a grave provocative act of leading the situation on the Korean Peninsula to a war crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation between the north and the south is not for any party but a work to seek the common interests and prosperity of the nation and promote national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the south Korean authorities to join in the acts for stifling fellow countrymen under outsiders' coercion and anti-reunification forces' pressure, failing to look straight into the nature of the present situation caused by the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, can never be justified with any subterfuge and it is an indelible crime against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities, bereft of reason, dare join in the U.S. moves to put sanctions upon the DPRK and stifle it, we will take appropriate steps, regarding it as a total negation of the June 15 joint declaration and a declaration of confrontation with fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
