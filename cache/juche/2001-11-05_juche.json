This is a product of a premeditated plot to tarnish the internal and external prestige of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed why the U.S. needed to inaugurate such a \"human rights\" organization whose headquarters is in Washington and which is executing its political instructions, not content with its annual \"smear report on human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the U.S. is seeking to intensify its hostile policy toward the DPRK while clamouring for dialogue with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., known to the world as a theatre of rowdyism for human rights abuse, should investigate its human rights situation and open it to the world public before inaugurating such a human rights committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a political caricature that the U.S. is taking issue with the human rights situation in other countries while suffering a loss of human lives from surprise attacks by its hand-raised terrorists all over the world, trembling with uneasiness and horror in the crucible of lawlessness and committing crimes of killing in cold blood a large number of civilians in Afghanistan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is no more than a foolish attempt for the U.S. to disparage our social system under which all the rights of humankind are ensured most truly and independence of the popular masses has been completely embodied on the highest level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should refrain from folly, mindful that its \"human rights\" pressure does not go down with our people.\r\n\r\n"

However, nobody believes it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. who should stand trial for abusing religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The freedom of religion and belief is fully guaranteed by law and many religionists are free to conduct their activities in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what others may say, we will consolidate and develop the people-centered socialism of Korean style.    \r\n\r\n"

It is characteristic of fast medical efficacy and low production cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When its powder is sprayed on a wound, bleeding will stop and bacteria and toxin in the inflamed region will be neutralized to promote recovery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also good for suppurative skin trouble of children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Alusil haemostatic pulverisi is also efficacious for the treatment of stomach bleeding. Taking two or three grams of it twice a day is enough to stop bleeding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It protects mucosa of the stomach from a trouble to be caused by irritative substance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before developing it researchers scientifically confirmed that microelements such calcium contained in natural sret exert strong influence on platelet coagulant and sret is strong in its adsorbing function for its porous molecular structure.    \r\n\r\n"
