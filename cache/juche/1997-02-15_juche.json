Such an act is an anti-national crime which can be committed only by fascists with no shred of national conscience and no sense of morality.\r\n   The South Korean rulers have kept the sick man under surveillance and persecution and prevented other people from nursing him, calling them \"seditious elements\".\r\n   Their maltreatment is not a matter related to the old man only but a challenge and provocation against the north, which has made all sincere efforts for the improvement of inter-KOREAN relations and for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country.\r\n   South Korea should ponder over what his possible misfortune may affect inter-Korean relations, give him first-aid treatment and repatriate him before too late, as demanded by the north.\r\n   We will closely watch South Korea's attitude.\r\n\r\n"

Paektu, a holy mountain of revolution, on February 16, 1942 and grew to be a great revolutionary, his lullaby being gun reports of the anti-Japanese war.\r\n   In the first half of the 1960s, he prepared himself to lead the Korean revolution at Kim Il Sung University. He deepened his studies of political economy, philosophy, history, literature and various sciences and gave unique answers to many theoretical and practical problems in politics, the economy, culture, military affairs, international relations and other spheres of the revolution and construction with his ideo-theoretical activities.\r\n   He began to work at the Party Central Committee in June 1964. This marked a milestone of radical progress in the building and activity of the Workers' Party of Korea and opened a bright vista for the Juche revolution.\r\n   The party and the people unanimously elected him their leader in February 1974.\r\n   He called for creating the \"speed of the '80s\" in the spirit of great Chollima upswing and wisely guided the campaign to create this speed so that many industrial establishments were reconstructed and expanded on a new technical basis and the west sea barrage, Kwangbok Street and many other grand monumental edifices were erected.\r\n   Having made immortal contributions to the Juche cause of army building, he was elected Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army at the 19th plenary session of the Sixth Central Committee of the Party in December 1991 and Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission at the fifth session of the Ninth Supreme People's Sssembly in April 1993.\r\n   When a touch-and-go situation was created in march 1993, he placed the whole country, all the people and the entire army in a semi-war state so as to demonstrate the Korean people's heroic stamina and overpower the enemies.\r\n   His resolute self-determined measure against the unreasonable \"special inspection\" of the international atomic energy agency displayed his courage and wisdom as a great general.\r\n   On July 8, 1994, President Kim Il Sung unexpectedly passed away to the great sorrow of the Korean People and progressives around the world.\r\n  Secretary Kim Jong Il put up the slogans \"the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung will always be with us\" and \"let us arm ourselves more firmly with the revolutionary ideas of the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung\" and effectively mobilized the party, the army and the people to carry out the last instructions of the President.\r\n   The book is a revolutionary biography of a great man of the century who performed immortal exploits for the country, people, times and humankind for half a century and exalted the second half of the 20th century as an era of creation, prosperity, independence and struggle.\r\n\r\n"

Paektu plain was the home of three generals. The Mt. Paektu family lived in the open air. \r\n   The snowstorm blustered from the home was the air the three generals breathed, taking the nation's destiny upon themselves, as well as the breath of revolution that came from the hearts of the three generals, which was the fighting spirit.\r\n Secretary Kim Jong Il made a big start in the revolution. \r\nHe has courage of Mt. Paektu, spirit of guerrillas, heart of a general and character of a hero.\r\n   During  the 55 years Secretary Kim Jong Il always found himself on the blizzard-blustering road of revolution in materializing the cause of President Kim Il Sung and the desire of the respected mother Kim Jong Suk, and victoriously led the Korean revolution without deviation together with President Kim Il Sung.\r\n  Secretary Kim Jong Il's birthday, February 16, is the day of fortune when the second sun appeared in the sky of the fatherland and above the nation and this planet. \r\n   Thanks to our three generals who underwent all sorts of trials, Kim Il Sung's nation is immortal and the history of Korea is full of glory.\r\n Secretary Kim Jong Il started the revolution for the people and followed the road even in rain and wind for a long time, but never sought his own interest.\r\n Secretary Kim Jong Il was born for the sake of the people valued by President Kim Il Sung and has been devoting his all to them.  He pushes through untrodden paths of knee-deep snow and walks along slippy hills for improving people's living. \r\n   Although there have been many military generals in the world, the world knows no such benevolent general as Secretary Kim Jong Il, who regards the people as the heaven.
