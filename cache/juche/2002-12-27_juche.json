He stressed that it would not improve the situation but get on the nerves of the DPRK and go by contraries.\r\n The problem cannot be settled by accusation, he said, adding that it is necessary to understand the root cause of the issue related to the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile program\" and the motive for the action of Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to Itar-Tass, Seleznyov, speaker of the State Duma of the Russian Federation, in an internet interview at the State Duma on Dec. 23 attributed the DPRK's resumption of the construction of a nuclear power plant to the U.S. wrongdoings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S. promised to build light-water reactors in the DPRK, he said that the U.S. backtracked its promise and accused the DPRK to put it on the list of an \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's reaction is too natural, he said, stressing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK violated nothing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is a sovereign state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should ensure electric power. So it will continue the construction of a nuclear power plant.    \r\n\r\n"

He asserted that \"North Korea should not be allowed to meet its interests according to international rules\" and \"It is necessary to cope with North Korea's serious threat of proliferation.\" \r\n Dismissing this as a ridiculous logic, Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary says that the U.S. ruling circle's reckless accusation against the DPRK can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a universally recognized fact that the U.S. is raking up huge profits through massive export of missiles and their technology. The U.S. is the kingpin of arms export and proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. rulers are mean and brazen-faced enough to groundlessly accuse the DPRK of its violation of international rules while exporting missiles and weapons of various other types more than any other countries and posing threats to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its true aim is to justify its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK by attaching the label of \"violator of international rules\" to the DPRK and deprive it of its way of earning foreign currency in a bid to strangle it economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a pipe dream. The DPRK will react to the U.S. imperialists' hard-line with the toughest stand.    \r\n\r\n"
