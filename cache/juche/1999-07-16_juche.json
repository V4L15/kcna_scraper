The action would target the DPRK base of missiles with a range of 1,000 kilometers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This shocking war scenario clearly shows that the Japanese reactionaries' hostile moves and war preparations for reinvasion of the DPRK have reached an extremely shameless and reckless stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are again undisguisedly expressing their \"view \" that military attacks on other country's  bases fall under the \"category of self-defense,\" the \"view\" that was already rejected in the diet in the past. Especially they have set military objects of the DPRK as a direct target after it launched a satellite.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The secret study was concluded early last year by the \"ASDF's\" western air defense force headquarters and was informally reported to the air defense command, it was reported. This is undoubtedly part of the war plan worked out under the instruction of the Japanese authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It explains why the Japanese reactionaries raised a hue and cry over the DPRK's launch of the first satellite in late August last year and conducted frantic anti-DPRK smear campaign and why they are still making desperate efforts to build up public opinion over what they called \"test missile launch\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese militarists have sharpened their sword to reinvade Korea for 50 odd years after the war, instead of repenting of and apologizing for the never-to-be-condoned anti-ethical crimes they committed against the Korean people in the past. They have gone the length of openly working  out a preemptive attack and \"ASDF's\" surprise air raid on other country, and justifying it, ignoring their \"constitution.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Astonished and enraged at such reckless war moves of the Japanese reactionaries, the Korean people and self-defensive revolutionary armed forces are keeping themselves fully ready to retaliate against the enemy's provocations a thousand times. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Next day they forced the remaining people to stand on railway tracks and called out a bomber over a radio apparatus to drop bombs over them and fire bullets at them for some 20 minutes, thus ruthlessly killing them.   They pushed the survivors into two tunnels below railway tracks and fired machine guns into them from hillocks by their approaches.
