As a consequence, the human rights of the people are ruthlessly violated.\r\n   More than 300 patriots and democrats have been thrown behind bars as \"prisoners of conscience\" in nine months since the present ruler took office. This eloquently proves that the present authorities are arch-violators of human rights.\r\n   The recent remarks of the South Korean chief executive bring into bolder relief his shamelessness as a violator of human rights.\r\n   The South Korean chief executive should abolish the \"NSL\" and dismantle the \"ANSP\" before crying for the \"defence of human rights.\" \r\n\r\n"

The responsibility rests entirely with the United States.\r\n   Four years have passed since the agreement was adopted and effectuated. But the United States has not faithfully implemented it although it talked much about the agreement.\r\n   The construction of two light-water reactors which should be completed till 2003 has only started.\r\n   The supply of heavy oil has not been made on a regular basis, with the result that there has been a great confusion in electric power production in the DPRK. None of the economic sanctions have been removed and military threat is getting more serious as the days go by.\r\n   Originally, the Korean People's Army expected nothing from the agreement and had no interest in dialogue and negotiation through diplomatic channels.\r\n   Now, the United States, throwing away the mask of \"appeasement\" and \"engagement\" which it had once worn for some time, is openly revealing its design to invade the DPRK, threatening to break the agreed framework and spreading a plan for the second Korean war.\r\n  The present developments prove that the KPA's judgement and stand were completely correct.\r\n   The KPA's anger has reached its limit, and it will never miss an opportunity this time.\r\n   The United State will be held wholly responsible for consequences coming therefrom. \r\n \r\n"
