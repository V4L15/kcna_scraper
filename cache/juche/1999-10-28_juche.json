To this end they should take such practical measures to realize genuine relations of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and south by abolishing the \"security law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will make every effort to ensure durable peace and security on the Korean peninsula and achieve national reunification by means of confederation. \r\n\r\n"

Even when the pit was filled with water gushing down from the ceiling, he continued tunneling by operating rock-drills installed on a raft. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the project was temporarily suspended owing to the shortage of materials and bad weather conditions, he moved to a new project to do things helpful toward accelerating the construction of power stations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To rescue comrades, he threw himself into a pit filled with gas from the blasting at the risk of his life and took care of disabled soldiers like his real brothers and arranged wedding feasts for his comrades who had no parents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAll these show what a man ho is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He became the head of one unit after working as a tunneling worker and has since led the unit in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, strong militant spirit, bold and big way of work  and with exemplary  practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His strong grit and principle, warm love and chivalrous spirit, unworldly-minded and simple character make his unit dynamic and optimistic and helped toward  successfully building minor power stations in many places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il visited Taehongdan county in October last year and looked round the power stations.

But this accord has  hardly been implemented owing to moves of some forces who dislike peace, stability and unity in the African continent, the spokesman said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Of course, the non-implementation of this accord is partly ascribable to the fact that interests of parties concerned are fundamentally different from each other. But, this is  chiefly attributable to outsiders' continued interference in disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Particularly, the United States is further complicating the issue of implementing the peace accord. Although it is loud-mouthed about \"prompt implementation of the accord,\" it is seeking an ill-intentioned purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to tide over such difficulties, a foreign ministerial meeting of African nations was held in Lusaka of Zambia on October 15. At the meeting, practical measures were discussed to make haste with implementing the peace accord in Democratic Congo under the sponsorship of the organisation of African unity and enhance the function of the cease-fire  observation team. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As shown by the Lusaka foreign ministerial meeting, the present difficulties can be surmounted when all parties concerned make sincere efforts for a practical solution to disputes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We think that, as the African nations are wholly responsible for continental issues, the master key to their solution is for all of them to unite and reject the neo-colonial intervention  of the west. \r\n\r\n"
