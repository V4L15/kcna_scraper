Thus, our country has turned into an impregnable fortress for self-defence that no invaders dare provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He worked heart and soul with patriotic will to build up invincible military muscle and achieve the great unity of the servicepersons and people and heighten the dignity of the country and people to the utmost in the national history under the banner of Songun. His exploits will shine for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His Songun revolutionary idea and exploits are being successfully carried forward by Marshal Kim Jong Un, the peerlessly great man of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un is making tireless efforts to consolidate the army into the powerful revolutionary Paektusan army armed with the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu and various kinds of strike means of Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un issued an order of the KPA supreme commander at the emergency enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission of the WPK convened at night of August 20. This was the show of the invincible spirit and will of the WPK's Songun politics that wields sword against the enemy's dagger and fires artillery shell against the rifle fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces that built up their muscle under the care of the Songun brilliant commanders of Paektu can fight any forms of war that the enemies want including a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Counter provocation with immediate counterattack, war of aggression with the great just war for national reunification\"--this is the principled stand of the DPRK which has no empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies want reckless war and confrontation, the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe them out to the last one and accomplish without fail the historic cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called upon all the service personnel and people to rally close around the Party Central Committee headed by Kim Jong Un and work hard to build a thriving socialist country, reunify the country independently and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the banner of Songun."

In Sinchon County alone, they mercilessly killed by barbarous methods baffling human imagination more than 35 000 people or one fourth of the county's population.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the beginning of January to March in 1952 nine regiments of the U.S. air force made a total of 804 sorties to spread germ-carrying insects and things and bombs over 169 areas in the northern half of Korea, an unprecedented germ warfare to exterminate the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t GIs have killed many innocent peoples of various countries under the pretext of \"war on terrorism.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 1 205 000 Iraqis lost their lives and a million were missing for five years since 2003 due to GIs' reckless military operations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Over 3 000 Afghans fell victims to the GIs' \"war on terrorism\" in 2011 alone. Due to the U.S. drone attack under the pretext of \"destroying bases of terrorists\", many civilians lost their lives in various countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This not withstanding, the U.S. is styling itself a protector of \"human rights\" and a champion of \"humanitarianism\" while taking issue with others' \"human rights performance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. Secretary of State Kerry reportedly urged the staff members of his Department recently to prevent information leakage after a series of top secrets were opened to public by media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Among the cases is the one that a high-ranking official of the Department of State in an \"annual report\" on flesh traffic diluted its contents in an effort to play down the records of a country's flesh traffic, which was opened to public by internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, all the \"human rights reports\" the U.S. issues annually by inventing various pretexts to take issue with human rights performance of other countries are no more than sheer fabrications to interfere in the internal affairs of the countries and thus attain its ulterior purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has become clearer this time that the \"report of the Inquiry Commission\" issued last year to take issue with the human rights performance in the DPRK was the one peppered with lies and fabrications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, Kerry is troubled with the leakage of top secrets including the above-said fabrication of information about flesh traffic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. can never cover up its true colors as the worst human rights abuser in the world."

            "content": "Acto central por el Dia de Songun\r\nPyongyang, 24 de agosto (ACNC) -- Tuvo lugar el dia 24 en la Casa Cultural 25 de Abril el acto central por el 55o aniversario del inicio de la direccion del Dirigente Kim Jong Il sobre la revolucion mediante el Songun (25 de agosto).\n\t\t\t\t\tAsistieron alli Kim Yong Nam, Pak Pong Ju, Kim Ki Nam, Pak Yong Sik y otros cuadros directivos del partido, el Estado y el ejercito, el presidente de partido amigo, los miembros del organo de mando del Comite Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea en esta capital, los funcionarios de los organismos de las fuerzas armadas, ministerios y organismos centrales, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular de Corea y del Ejercito de Seguridad Interior del Pueblo de Corea, funcionarios de los organos, fabricas y empresas en la capital y los ameritados laborales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl informe de la ocasion estuvo a cargo del general de ejercito de las fuerzas terrestres Pak Yong Sik, ministro de las Fuerzas Armadas Populares, quien subrayo como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 25 de agosto del 49 (1960) de la Era Juche, el Dirigente Kim Jong Il dejo la huella de la direccion sobre la revolucion en la Division Guardia de Tanques 105 \"Seul\" Ryu Kyong Su, lo que devino un evento historico que anuncio la continuacion de la causa revolucionaria de Songun y la nueva partida de la direccion mediante el Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi, la revolucion del Songun continuo y el EPC se ha fortalecido ininterrumpidamente como ejercito del lider y del partido y se abrio la nueva epoca de la revolucion de Juche  que sale siempre victoriosa bajo la bandera del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante mas de 50 anos, el Dirigente antepuso siempre los asuntos militares y condujo a la victoria la batalla por la defensa del socialismo tomando el EPC como pilar y grueso de la revolucion del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA mediados de la decada de 1990 cuando llegaban a climax las maniobras de los enemigos para aislar y aplastar a la RPDC, el Dirigente inspecciono el puesto Tabaksol (pinito), declarando asi su invariable voluntad de tomar firmemente el fusil de la revolucion hasta cuando se eliminen todos los imperialistas de este mundo y seguir siempre por el camino del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente ilumino la filosofia de fusil, segun la cual la revolucion se inicia, se avanza y se lleva a feliz termino por las fuerzas armadas, y el principio del Songun de que el ejercito es precisamente el partido, el Estado y el pueblo y formulo y sistematizo la teoria politica del Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo la dinamica direccion del Dirigente, el EPC se ha hecho ejercito selecto en la ideologia y la conviccion y poderoso ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu sin rival y la industria belica de la RPDC se ha fortalecido en la potente industria capaz de producir a su antojo cualquiera arma ultramoderna.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe han realizado en la nueva etapa alta la modernizacion de todo el ejercito y el armamento de todo el pueblo y establecido el sistema de defensa de todo el pueblo y todo el estado, y asi la RPDC se ha intensificado como baluarte inexpugnable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBrillaran para siempre las inmortales hazanas del Dirigente quien enarbolando la bandera del Songun dedico toda su vida con la ardiente voluntad patriotica para preparar el invencible poderio militar y la fuerza de la gran unidad del ejercito y el pueblo y asentar la dignidad de la patria y el pueblo en la cima de la historia nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa idea revolucionaria del Songun y las proezas del Dirigente se llevan adelante tambien hoy en dia gracias al Mariscal Kim Jong Un, gran hombre sin igual del monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal dedica todos sus esfuerzos por consolidar el EPC como poderosas fuerzas armadas revolucionarias del  monte Paektu armadas con el espiritu revolucionario del Paektu, el del viento cortante del Paektu y equipadas con diversificados medios de ataque a estilo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la reunion ampliada de emergencia de la Comision Militar Central del PTC convocada el pasado dia 20, se emitio la orden del Comandante Supremo del EPC, lo cual deviene la demostracion del impetu y la voluntad invictos de la politica del Songun del PTC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias, crecidas bajo el regazo de los geniales comandantes del Songun del Paektu, son capaces de responder a cualquier modo de guerra que impongan los enemigos inclusive la guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"!A la provocacion con el inmediato contragolpe, a la guerra de agresion con la gran guerra justa para la reunificacion de la patria!\", esto es nuestra posicion de principios que no sabe las palabras vanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos optan por fin el camino de la imprudente provocacion de guerra agresiva y la frenetica confrontacion, nuestras fuerzas revolucionarias arrasaran sin piedad a todos los enemigos sin dejar ni uno que pueda firmar el acta de capitulacion y lograran sin falta la historica causa de reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl finalizar, el informante exhorto a todos a luchar vigorosamente por la construccion de un estado prospero socialista, la reunificacion independiente de la patria y el cumplimiento de la causa revolucionaria del Juche uniendose mas compactamente en torno al Comite Central del PTC encabezado por el Mariscal y levantando mas alto la bandera del Songun."

Lanzo alli mucho mas bombas que las lanzadas en todo el teatro de combate del Pacifico en el periodo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial destruyendo muchas ciudades, quitando la vida a miles y miles de inocentes y causando hambre a los habitantes de la RPDC\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no pasa de ser una parte de las matanzas y las atrocidades de lesa humanidad cometidas por EE.UU. en su propio pais y otras partes del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ha revelado, solo en menos de dos meses que ocuparon el territorio norcoreano en el periodo de la pasada guerra coreana, los imperialistas yanquis cometieron horrorosas matanzas por doquier de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. Solo en el distrito de Sinchon los yanquis asesinaron de modo inimaginablemente barbaro a mas de 35 mil moradores que correspondian a un cuarto de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde principios de enero hasta marzo de 1952, los 9 regimientos de aviacion norteamericanos lanzaron en 804 ocasiones en total los insectos, articulos y bombas bacteriologicos sobre 169 zonas de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, bajo el cartel de la \"guerra antiterrorista\", el imperio quito la vida de incontables civiles de varios paises del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 5 anos desde 2003 en Iraq quedaron asesinados mas de un millon 205 mil personas y desaparecidos un millon por los uniformados norteamericanos. Solo en el ano 2011, en Afganistan mas de 3 mil habitantes se hicieron victimas de la \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ataque de drones de EE.UU. en varios paises del mundo cometido bajo el pretexto de \"eliminacion de bases de terroristas\" dejo como saldo muchas perdidas humanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el imperio cuestiona la situacion de \"derechos humanos\" de alguien autodenominandose como defensor de \"DDHH\" y encarnador de \"humanitarismo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, se dio a la publicidad por via Internet el hecho de que un alto funcionario del Departamento de Estado norteamericano falsifico el contenido del \"informe anual\" sobre el trafico de seres humanos para reducir el record de un pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el secretario de Estado norteamericano Kerry reprocho a sus empleados por la fuga de las informaciones de la mayor reserva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, EE.UU. inventa cada ano el \"informe de DDHH\" acusando la situacion de derechos humanos de otros paises a fin de intervenir en sus asuntos internos y obtener los designios malintencionados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, se ha evidenciado que el \"informe del comite de investigacion\" anti-RPDC, publicado en el ano pasado, tambien es un documento fraudulento. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel entonces, Kerry cuestiono tanto el \"problema de DDHH\" de la RPDC en la palestra internacional, lo cual fue el climax de la hipocresia para enganar el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Kerry no sabia el caracter fraudulento de aquellos documentos, esto significa que el actuaba como marioneta de los intrigantes y como brigada de choque de la campana de \"DDHH\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs inocultable la naturaleza de EE.UU. como peor violador de DDHH del mundo."
