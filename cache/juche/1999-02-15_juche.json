This great reality is a result of the full embodiment of the respected Kim Jong Il's politics.\r\n   The politics of Marshal Kim Jong Il, which is replete with the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung and intense loyalty to the cause of revolution, serves as a motive force of the Korean revolution to carry forward the lineage of Juche in any trials and making it possible to advance along the most straight path and as a guarantee for the eternal victory of the revolution of Juche.\r\n   It is unimaginable apart from the independent politics of Kim Jong Il that Korea's socialism is steadily advancing along the road chosen by the Korean people themselves not shaken by any storms and continues to demonstrate its might as a powerful socialist nation of independence, self-reliance and self-defence.\r\n   In order to defend the Korean-style socialism and carry the revolutionary cause of Juche to accomplishment all the party and the entire people should uphold Kim Jong Il's politics, ideas and leadership with loyalty and filial piety, the reporter said, adding:\r\n   All the people and the servicemen should consider the Slogan \"Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution headed by the comrade Kim Jong Il with our lives \" to be an eternal creed of struggle and life, under which they should prepare themselves to be heroes through human bomb attack and soldiers ready for suicidal explosion.  They should thus defend with their lives Marshal Kim Jong Il, who is the destiny of the fatherland and the revolution, and strengthen as firm as a rock the singlehearted unity of the leader, the party, the army and the people.\r\n   In reliance upon the springboard for building a powerful nation which has been provided by Kim Jong Il, we should run at a canter, open up an epoch-making phase in building a powerful nation, thus following up the \"arduous march\" with a cheerful advance.    \r\n\r\n"

In former times, the lunar calendar was used in northeast Asia.\r\n   Generally the lunar month is later than the solar one. \r\n   Since ancient times the lunar New Year's Day has been celebrated in Korea and this tradition is still in practice. \r\n   This means two new year days in a year.\r\n   On the lunar New Year's Day, the towns, villages and all homes are in festive attire and every one wears their best. \r\n   In the streets people are seen exchanging New Year greetings. In shops and restaurants, special goods and dishes are served. Folk games--yut, Korean chess, seesaw, kiteflying, spinning, shuttlecock and sleighing--are in wider practice on the day. Kite-flying over the blue sky add charm to the festival atmosphere.\r\n   It is a modern tradition that the working people, soldiers and young people visit the statues of President Kim Il Sung to lay bouquets and floral baskets before them.\r\n   The lunar festival this year coincides with leader Kim Jong Il's birthday (February  16).\r\n   This meaningful coincidence will give a distinctive feature to this year's lunar festival.    \r\n\r\n"
