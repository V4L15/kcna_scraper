It is the only way for the south Korean people to regain their dignity to eradicate the source of man-killing.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the news that GIs drove their truck over a south Korean woman to death in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province on June 10 been known than the U.S. busied itself expressing what it called \"regret\" and \"condolences\" over her death, something unprecedented. The reason why the U.S. is working so hard to gloss over this case is quite clear. It is because the murder took place on the threshold of the third anniversary of death of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son and the fifth anniversary of the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. This tragedy occurred against the background of the mounting anti-U.S. actions and the movement for independent reunification in south Korea. The U.S. was afraid that this might certainly trigger off\r\nstronger anti-U.S. resistance in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the investigation into the case ends up punishing a few criminals and urging the U.S. to make an empty \"apology,\" the south Korean people will never escape from the fate as miserable victims of American soldiers' atrocities, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
