This policy was based on a correct analysis of the class relations in the countryside of Korea at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The poor peasants accounted for about 40 percent while the rich peasants less than 0.6 percent of the peasants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere were not a few middle peasants, but most of them benefited from the agrarian reform after the liberation of Korea. That was why the poor peasants and almost all the middle peasants supported the agricultural cooperativization from its outset. Some of the middle peasants vacillated or hesitated while rich peasants turned away from it or opposed it, but this force was pretty small. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The size of the cooperatives was small--15 to 20 households--at the beginning. It was gradually increased--40 to 100 households--as conditions improved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  As a result, 80.9 percent of the farm households joined cooperatives as of the end of Juche 45 (1956). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The agricultural cooperativization was successfully completed in Korea in a matter of only 4-5 years under the wise leadership of the WPK. \r\n\r\n"

Its original size is unknown, but the remaining part measures 15 cm in length and 3.4 cm in width. It is the second such dagger ever discovered from a dolmen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another dagger from Raknang district is still bigger, 27.6 cm long and 3.5 cm wide with no groove or joint and a flat vertebral column. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Still another dagger from Samsong-ri in Junghwa county is 25.5 cm long and 2.7 cm wide, with both edges holding grooves from the middle to the hilt and with symmetrical joints on the vertebral column that reaches the hilt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A spearhead 18.9 cm by 3.5 cm was collected in the fields of the sixth work-team at Ryongchon-ri, Hwangju county, North Hwanghae Province. It is shorter and narrower than average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another spearhead was found together with a three-foot bronze kettle from a wooden coffin  tomb at Sungri-dong no. 1, Raknang district, Pyongyang. It is a bit longer, the lengthy edge similar to a narrow bronze dagger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The artifacts are not only effective weapons but also delicate metalwork with artistic executions of the softly curved bodies, sharp edges and smooth grooves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In past years, Pyongyang and North Hwanghae Province revealed many remains and relics such as dolmens, stone-coffin tombs, house sites, Pipha (flute)-shape daggers and spearheads belonging to the early period of Kojoson and narrow bronze daggers and spearheads from the late period of Kojoson. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. branded the DPRK as a \"terrorist state\" and Japan chimed in with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. much publicized \"terrorism\" by the DPRK is nothing but a ruse intended to isolate Pyongyang internationally and wrest a sort of \"concession\" at DPRK-U.S. negotiations. Therefore, there is no need to pay heed to the U.S. loudmouthed \"terrorism.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What matters is base diplomacy of Japan blindly following the U.S. crafty stratagem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By nature the ADB should not attach any political strings to the application of any country to join it and any member of the economic and social commission for Asia and the Pacific is entitled to be a member country of the ADB. It is quite illogical for the U.S. and Japan to attach absurd political condition to the bid of the DPRK, a member of the commission, to join the ADB. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This diplomatic posture taken by Japan towards the DPRK in pursuance of the U.S. clearly indicates that its talk about the improved relations with the DPRK is nothing but hypocrisy and there is no change in its hostile policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is becoming ever more pronounced in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK at a time when the DPRK-Japan talks are under way. This prompts the DPRK to doubt once again any success of its talks with Japan. The DPRK has been disillusioned with the inconsistent stand of the Japanese authorities reading others' faces while dealing with the issue of DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This servile diplomatic posture of Japan may imperil the fate of the talks. \r\n\r\n"

What is more incomprehensible is why Japan is renewing a verbal spat against the DPRK while calling for improved relations with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK-Japan talks should not turn into a forum for a quarrel. If Japan approaches the talks from this improper stand, it will put the talks into a bottomless quagmire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hard-won talks should not be let to repeat a collapse in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is high time the Japanese authorities thought twice. \r\n\r\n"
