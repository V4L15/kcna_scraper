Kim Il Sung's cause will be carried to completion\r\n  Pyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong Nam, politburo member of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee and Vice-Premier of the Administration Council, made a memorial address at the national meeting held to commemorate the third death anniversary of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Kim Yong Nam said among other things:\r\n   The unexpected death of President Kim Il Sung was the greatest misfortune of the Korean nation in the 5,000-year history and the greatest sorrow of the Korean people and the progressive people around the world.\r\n    His whole life was a brilliant one of the outstanding leader who took the helm of the times and history and led the popular masses' cause of independence to victory.\r\n   The history of humankind knows many well-known leaders, but no such great leader as President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   He was the peerless great man the Korean people acclaimed and held in high esteem for the first time in the history of thousands of years. He was the most experienced and famous veteran leader of the international revolutionary movement recognised by the world.\r\n   He went through storm and stress all his life, restored the lost country to the Koreans and provided them with the greatest honor and happiness.\r\n   Thanks to the energies and efforts he made all his life the Korean people have become a powerful and dignified people who firmly defend the Juche character and the national character of the revolution and construction in opposition to imperialism and dominationism, and our country has been able to demonstrate its potentials as a powerful socialist state, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence.\r\n   Today imperialists and reactionaries are intensifying their campaign against socialism and the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in the world arena, but the Korean Revolution is making a long drive without the slightest setback. This is because President Kim Il Sung invariably stood true to the faith of Juche and the line of national independence throughout his life and because he bequeathed to us the valuable gains of the revolution including the Party, state and army built by him with matchless grit and wisdom, pulling through all difficulties.\r\n   He was a brilliant thinker, an outstanding statesman, a great saint of the revolution, a great man and a tender-hearted father of the people.\r\n   He always regarded it as the greatest joy to mix with the people and won victory after victory in the revolution and construction in reliance upon their strength.\r\n   At the advanced age of more than eighty he made a long journey with unbreakable will and passion under the burning sun of summer and through fields to give on-the-spot guidance to the work of all domains.\r\n   With superhuman power he gave a final touching to all work, looking forward to the future of a reunified country, and died in his office room.\r\n   Long ago he most brilliantly solved the question of inheritance of the leadership in Korea with a high sense of responsibility for socialism and the future of the people. \r\nThis is his greatest feat which will be handed down for all ages.\r\n   He said:\r\n   \"We solemnly express our pledge to our fatherland the great leader President Kim Il Sung at this important occasion when the mourning is over.\"\r\n   Today the Korean revolution goes on along the straight road of Juche under the guidance of Secretary Kim Jong Il, the most faithful heir to the cause of President  Kim Il Sung.\r\n   We were confronted with the most difficult situation after his death, but were able to firmly defend the red flag of the revolution which was associated with his whole life because Secretary Kim Jong Il wisely led the whole Party, the entire army and all the people.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il consecrated the Kumsusan Memorial Palace as the sacred temple of Juche and preserved President Kim Il Sung in state so that President  Kim Il Sung might always be with the people.\r\n   All the Party members and people under the refined guidance of the Party Central Committee headed by Secretary Kim Jong Il have armed themselves more firmly with the revolutionary ideas of President Kim Il Sung and made every sincere effort to defend and glorify the undying revolutionary feats of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   With a view to coping with the grave situation of the country Secretary Kim Jong Il placed the military affairs ahead of all other state affairs, strengthened and developed our revolutionary armed forces into an invincible army of the Party and an army of the leader, thus building up the military position of the Korean Revolution.\r\n   The progressive people all over the world highly praise Secretary Kim Jong Il  for having set an example of the noble communist outlook on morality and political ethics in upholding the leader. They describe him as the great master of socialist politics in our times and the supreme incarnation of revolutionary ethics and morality and express deepest reverence for and trust in him.\r\n   We will, in the futre, too, meet all challenges of history with unshakable faith in the victory of the revolution and optimism and creditably carry to completion the cause of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   As Secretary Kim Jong Il said, it is the basic guarantee for the victory of the revolution and noble obligation of the revolutionaries to defend and carry forward generation after generation the revolutionary ideas and feats of the leader who paved the way for the revolution.\r\n   We will hold in high esteem President Kim Il Sung as the eternal leader of our Party and revolution, firmly defend and add lustre to his imperishable revolutionary ideas and feats down through generations.\r\n   All the Party members, officers and men of the People's Army and the people will always believe in and follow only Secretary Kim Jong Il in any circumstances and fight for the victory of the revolution, rallied close around him.\r\n   Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution headed by Secretary Kim Jong Il with our lives !. This is the eternal slogan of our struggle and life and our revolutionary faith and conscience.\r\n   We will triumphantly finish the \"Arduous March\" this year in socialist economic construction and bring about greater prosperity of the country and the motherland of Juche liberated and glorified by President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Invincible is the revolutionary cause of the Korean people who are vigorously advancing along the road indicated by Secretary Kim Il Sung, in  firm unity around the Party Central Committee with Secretary Kim Jong Il at the core.\r\n\r\n"

Korean students under fire \r\nPyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- The north headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) in a statement on July 7 denounced the Kim Young Sam group's arrest of Chairman Kang Wi Won and other leading members of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) as another heinous crime to destroy and obliterate the organisation, the vanguard of the pro-reunification patriotic movement of south Korea.\r\n   Kim Young Sam, a rare fascist dictator who is indifferent to the nation and reunification, has stretched tentacles of suppression to \"Hanchongryon\" since its outset for the mere reason that it called for independence, democracy and reunification, and he is trying to totally destroy and stifle it this year, the statement said, and continued:\r\n   This is motivated by the vicious intention to find a way out of the traps of the Hanbo scandal and the \"Presidential Election\" fund in the suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic movement, stifle \"Hanchongryon\" by branding it as a \"pro-north organisation benefiting the enemy\" and thus divert elsewhere the angry people's attention and maintain their rule.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group must step down at once, as demanded by the students and people from all walks of life and release the unreasonably arrested patriotic students and personages including the Chairman of \"Hanchongryon\" unconditionally and immediately. \r\n\r\n"
