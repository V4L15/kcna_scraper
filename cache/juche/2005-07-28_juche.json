He referred to the fact that Kim Il Sung gave a shameful defeat to the U.S. imperialist aggressors who boasted  of being \"the strongest\" in the world with his matchless pluck and will, outstanding strategy and tactics and extraordinary commanding art and brought about the beginning of decline for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal feats Kim Il Sung performed for the victory in the war have been brilliantly carried forward by Kim Jong Il. He has trained the KPA to be the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu and the matchless combat ranks with his outstanding Songun revolutionary leadership for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the KPA servicepersons should firmly believe in and follow the supreme commander only, become human bombs to defend the headquarters of revolution at the cost of their lives, thoroughly establish the revolutionary military traits of acting as one under his command in the KPA and become the first adherents and champion and implementer of the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA will resolutely smash the moves of the enemies to weaken the ideological might of the arms of the revolution and mete out merciless punishment to the aggressors, provokers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Officers at the meeting expressed their firm resolution representing the unanimous will of the servicepersons of the three services of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An evening gala of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces was held at Jonsung Square Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants danced to the tune of songs \"Long Live Generalissimo Kim Il Sung,\" \"Song of National Defence,\" \"My Song in Trench,\" \"Song of Remembrance\" and \"Our July 27,\" recalling the day of victory in the war when the servicepersons and the people beat back the aggression of the U.S. imperialists and honorably defended the freedom and independence of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the pride of being soldiers of the Supreme Commander they danced to the lilting tune of songs \"The Distinguished Service Medal of Soldier,\" \"Let's Keep Pace with Army Song\" and \"Let's Meet on Front,\" flying the flags of the KPA supreme commander, the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the functions were Kim Yong Chun, chief of the KPA General Staff, Kim Il Chol, minister of the People's Armed Forces, senior officials of the Ministry of the People's Armed Forces and servicepersons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, an art performance was given by the Korean People's Army Song and Dance Ensemble at the April 25 House of Culture and a wartime song stage \"Eternal Song of Victory\" by the art squad of the Central Committee  of the Korean Democratic Women's Union and art circle members of the Pyongyang City Women's Union at the Women's Hall.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Now the U.S. has viciously pursued the policy to stifle the north and resorted to the reckless moves to provoke a war against the north in a bid to recover its miserable defeat in the past June 25 war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AINDF would wage a more dynamic struggle together with all the people who value the national sovereignty and dignity, peace and reunification in order to put an end to the 60 year-long disgraceful history of the occupation of the U.S. troops.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
