It also stressed that the Koreans should defeat the invaders with arms in their hands in order to achieve the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a significant meeting which provided a foundation of the Songun politics, the ever-victorious sword. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since then the Korean revolution has triumphantly paved the untrodden path of the history under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people, who had the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army founded on April 25, Juche 21 (1932), waged a bloody warfare against the Japanese imperialists and thus accomplished the historic cause of the national liberation on August 15, 1945. And in the Korean War (1950-1953) they defeated the U.S. imperialists, who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world, and defended the freedom and independence of the nation with credit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1990s was the most trial period for the Korean people owing to the intensified moves of the imperialists to isolate and stifle the DPRK and successive natural disasters. But they safeguarded the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and opened a broad vista for building a great prosperous powerful socialist country in reliance on the strong armed forces built up under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will successfully carry forward the traditions of the Songun revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
