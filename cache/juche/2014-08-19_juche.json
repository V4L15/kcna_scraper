Is its overseas presence still important?\" said that U.S. forces' presence in south Korea proves not effective and on the contrary they may fall victim to other side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such voices are heard from the U.S. Centre for Strategic and International Studies, and other institutes and bodies and figures of political circles and military and Republicans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A researcher at the U.S. naval academy commented that U.S. forces present in south Korea are bound to make north Korea aim at the U.S. and the magazine Forbes also called for the pullback of U.S. forces from south Korea, asserting that they are not sufficient to cope with the nuclear attack from north Korea and are becoming unnecessary nuclear hostages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are comments made on the basis of accurate scientific analysis of the DPRK's deterrence for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's deterrence for self-defense is fully ready to react to the U.S. nuclear blackmail with merciless nuclear attack and to a war of aggression with an all-out just war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ready to strike military bases in the U.S. mainland, the citadel of aggression, and Hawaii, Guam and other operational theatres in the Pacific, U.S. military bases in south Korea and protect the dignity and sovereignty of the country and the nation, should the U.S. recklessly starts a war with huge strategic forces involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already declared, not concealing anything, that if it strikes the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet regime, they will be hit hard, reducing big and small strongholds of aggression to ashes and its deterrence for self-defense is fully ready to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean People's Army conducted drills for firing rockets at the mock bases of U.S. troops in south Korea, fully displaying the combat capabilities of the firepower units and the performance of tactical rockets and once again powerfully demonstrating its military muscle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is crystal clear that the U.S. forces in south Korea will be the primary targets of the KPA and face its punishment in case a war breaks out on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks that it can protect its troops and the south Korean puppet army with its \"nuclear umbrella\" in south Korea, its colony, at a time when it is busy taking steps to defend its mainland from the high-performance nuclear and missile strikes of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is driven into a tight corner because it is stuck in the shambles of wars of aggression started by it in different parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is staggering as it is heavily indebted due to its excessive arms buildup and the serious economic and financial crises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A change has taken place in the balance of forces due to the rapidly changing situation in Northeast Asia and the political and economic interests among countries and regions.

He openly stirred up the brutal disciplinary punishment and violence prevalent in the puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When a beating case occurred in the puppet marine corps in 2011, he misled the public opinion by creating impression that such brutality was committed due to the wrong conception that \"you should be beaten because I was beaten\". This was his desperate bid to hide his crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was because of evil deeds of Kim that junior soldiers of the puppet army are subject to beating and violence by their superiors and are forced to lick even spit and toilet bowls.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Last year alone, more than 45,000 service members became disabled due to disciplinary punishment in the puppet army and at least 2,000 of them deserted the barracks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 70 percent of the dead service members of the army chose suicide, unable to endure violence. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why people of various circles in south Korea are condemning Kim and strongly demanding severe punishment of him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet chief executive is zealously shielding him for fear that ouster of Kim may drive her to another ruling crisis. But this is nothing but a foolish act.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her act of zealously harboring Kim would be little short of admitting herself that the present regime is nothing but a regime abusing human rights and one of killers and this would spark off a more serious ruling crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The root cause of misfortune should be rooted out before it is too late. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should face up to the reality and bring Kim Kwan Jin to a court at once."
