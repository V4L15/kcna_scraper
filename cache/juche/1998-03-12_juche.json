            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on U.S. military buildup in S. Korea\r\nPyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry released a statement today concerning the situation of the Korean Peninsula being aggravated by the United States' reckless military buildup in South Korea.\r\n   The statement says in part:\r\n   As was already reported, Commander of the U.S. Forces in South Korea, told the National Security Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives on March 4 that the latest-type commanding aircraft J. Stars was confirmed, as a result of its first use in military exercises, to be useful in emergency on the Korean Peninsula and that it would be deployed in the U.S.-South Korean combined forces soon.\r\n   Earlier, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Forces Joseph Prueher, in a press interview on February 20, admitted that the United States brought 25 F 15 E Jet fighters and two AC 130 helicopter gunships to South Korea from the U.S. mainland. He alleged that the aircraft deployment in South Korea was necessary to \"maintain effective deterrent.\"\r\n   The massive reinforcement of latest-type military hardware in south korea is timed to coincide with the Iraqi crisis. This cannot be construed otherwise than an extremely dangerous scheme to test their new \"win-win\" strategy for the first time on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   At multi-channelled negotiations with the DPRK, the U.S. has pretended to be interested in peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   As facts show, however, the U.S. is stepping up war preparations against the dialogue partner behind the scenes.\r\n   This compels us to reconsider the prospects of the upcoming \"four-way talks\" and other negotiations with the U.S.\r\n   The reckless arms buildup of the U.S. is seriously getting on our nerves. It is an open violation of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement on putting an end to the longstanding hostile relations between the two countries and improving their ties.\r\n   The hostile acts of the U.S. against the DPRK require that we keep high vigilance and full preparedness for both dialogue and war.\r\n   Now that the united states is sticking to reckless arms buildup and war preparations against the DPRK, we cannot but take countermeasures. If the enemies dare attack the DPRK, the Korean people and revolutionary armed forces will deal a merciless blow at the provokers and decisively foil their scheme to execute the \"win-win\" strategy.    \r\n  \r\n"
