If a country's name can be improperly called according to usual practice because of the absence of diplomatic relations, Japan should have been called \"woe.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more undisguised the Japanese reactionaries become in their moves to debase the DPRK, the bitterer national wrath of Koreans they will touch off. In view of these moves they vowed to intensify the probe into Japan's deliberate misuse of the name of the DPRK for a long period and carry on the vigorous struggle against the Japanese reactionaries' debasement of the name of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

It will strongly retaliate against them should they ignite a new war.    \r\n\r\n"

They secured a colossal amount of fund to assist the front by collecting waste materials and picking medicinal and edible herbs. They formed juvenile guerrilla units, juvenile guard units and juvenile self-defence corps in the occupied areas including Kowon, Anju, Sonchon and Kosong to repulse the invaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the period of the post-war rehabilitation and construction and the grand socialist construction, they contributed to the economic construction through brisk do-good-thing movements while fully preparing themselves mentally, morally and physically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many lorries, tractors, tramcars, passenger ships, locomotives and passenger coaches which are called  \"sonyon\" (children).

The U.S. seeks a very sinister political aim through this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the U.S., while paying lip-service to the \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, is, in fact, seeking to bring the DPRK to its knees by putting pressure on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Participants in the summit accepted an article attacking the DPRK as dictated by the U.S., taking the DPRK for a member state of the NPT. This is either a vivid expression of their ignorance of international law or their misuse of the law for a political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wantonly violates international laws unfavorable for it but resorts to such arbitrary practices as justifying its preposterous charges by unreasonably invoking international law, when necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can not but be an expression of mean flattery to favour the U.S. arbitrary practices in pursuit of their immediate interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Participants in the summit can never flee from the responsibility for seriously debasing the independent status granted by international law through their indiscreet act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
