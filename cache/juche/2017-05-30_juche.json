The chief Cabinet secretary, the foreign minister and other ministers of Japan vied with each other in vociferating about an additional \"independent sanctions\" against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan incites pressure and sanctions against the DPRK here and there. It is aimed at providing a legal justification to push ahead with its militarization by faking up a fascist law at any cost under the pretext of the \"threat\" from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now voices are loudly ringing among the people and political circle of Japan against the moves of right-wing forces to revise its \"Pacifist Constitution\" as war constitution to turn Japan into a war state and put the whole country under watch and fascistize it under the signboard of \"measures against terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an extremely foolish act that the Japanese authorities are running amuck to realize the wild ambition for revival of militarism and reinvasion while branding the DPRK's measures for self-defence as \"provocation\" and \"threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK does never pardon but keeps tabs on new crimes committed by Japan while taking an issue with even the DPRK's exercise of sovereignty, far from repenting of all hideous crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already declared, the DPRK will make more highly precision and diversified nukes and nuclear striking means till the U.S. and its vassal forces come to their senses and make a proper choice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only the U.S. military objects for aggression in Japan have been within the optical sight of the Strategic Force of the Korean People's Army, but if Japan is hostile toward the DPRK following the U.S., not properly seeing the reality, the target of the DPRK will be changed."

Not content with this, it scrapped the rest of the documents although they should remain untouched as \"references for the next regime\" according to a \"law.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the conservative coteries left for the present regime was reportedly a ten-page report on management rules of Chongwadae only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was just prompted by their sinister design to sweep under the carpet the history of their hideous crimes and escape the relentless punishment by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For the four years in power, the Park group committed unpardonable crimes only by suppressing the progressive forces, pursuing misrule, escalating confrontation with the compatriots in the north and kowtowing to outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had Park taken \"presidential\" office than she got hell-bent on eliminating the progressive forces by reviving former dictator and traitor Park Chung-Hee's fascist rule and thus brought the second \"yusin\" dark age to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her misrule peppered with corruption, dissipation and wild greed deteriorated people's livelihood and saddled south Korea with the burden of the biggest \"state debt\" amounting to 1.17 trillion U.S. dollars, made 4.5 million jobless, 10 million semi-unemployed, over 8.5 million homeless families and more than 5.7 million suffering extreme poverty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Along with such pitiful records, south Korea has turned into the worst tundra of human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group of traitors also brought the north-south relations to total collapse by pursuing sycophancy to outsiders against reunification, leaving the interests of the south Korean people to tender mercy of outside forces.

Herein lies the strong evidence proving the crimes of the Park group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History can neither be written off nor be scrapped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime turned south Korea into a sea of tears and moans by causing such disasters as ferry Sewol sinking and MERS chaos and pursuing unpopular rule. There is no statue of limitations to such crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All south Koreans, enraged by the evil deeds of the Park-led conservatives, have turned out in the campaign for throwing overboard traitor Park and her lackeys.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The candles once held by them will soon produce fierce flames for sternly punishing the Park group of traitors."
