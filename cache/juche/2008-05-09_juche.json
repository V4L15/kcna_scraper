This is just the tip of iceberg of his sycophantic and treacherous deeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is a die-hard pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese traitor devoid of the spirit and the dignity of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After his inauguration as \"president\" the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" has grown weak and the past era of sycophancy toward the U.S. and cooperation with outsiders has been brought back in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before taking office he had called for the tightened south Korea-U.S. \"alliance,\" worrying over the \"impaired alliance.\" He is now strengthening the tie-ups with outsiders, away from serving the nation's interests and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak regime agreed to increase the costs for the U.S. military presence in south Korea, dispatch troops to Afghanistan again and import American beef.

What a far-fetched assertion it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end, it has defended Japan's past crimes and even stood in the way of editing \"biographical dictionary of pro-Japanese elements,\" talking about the \"new era of cooperation\" and \"orientation toward the future.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee is little different from the traitors in the last century who sold off the country to the outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such group of traitors will bring nothing but shame to the nation that has been undergoing the tragic division for more than half a century due to the outsiders.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly proves that their doctrine of \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK is being put into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument as for who purses the inter-Korean confrontation and strains the situation in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the south Korean authorities keep pushing forward the policy of confrontation with the DPRK and escalate arms buildup and other military moves peace can not be ensured on the Korean Peninsula nor the Korean nation get rid of danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee regime is, indeed, a treacherous and a war-seeking one as it is keen on its moves to bring a disaster of war to the Korean nation while pouring huge fund for arms buildup and preparation for war at a time when the people's living has gone from bad to worse due to an economic catastrophe and massive unemployment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war-thirsty forces should face up to the situation and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Under this public health system any citizen can get medical examination, experimental check-up, treatment and operation, hospitalization and the medicine without payment. Even costs for round trip to sanitarium are borne by the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state supplies food to workers and office workers and their families and uniforms, shoes and various school things to all the children and pupils and students free of charge or at very low prices. Also houses are built in towns and rural villages to provide the working people at the state expenses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our Party's popular policies had been maintained invariably even in the grim period of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The popular policies now in force in our country will be pursued in a more profound way in various fields along with progress in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This vividly shows the validity and vitality of the declaration which gives priority to national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration has ushered in a new history of reconciliation and unity in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course the structure of confrontation was formed with the Korean nation in one side and the U.S. in the other and the north and the south deeply grasped that to pool efforts of the Korean nation is the best way of achieving independent reunification. As a result, the banner of \"By our nation itself\" was raised higher across the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the October 4 Declaration for Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity was adopted in Pyongyang. The adoption meant the provision of a historic program for more firmly defending and implementing the north-south joint declaration, a landmark event in encouraging the Koreans' will for independent reunification. When the Koreans hold fast to the historic June 15 joint declaration and October 4 declaration it would be possible to successfully solve all the issues arising in the way of achieving reunification and achieve the historic cause of national reunification, its cherished desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Grand National Party\" conservative forces which recently came to power in south Korea are a group of sycophants and traitors as they put the interests of the foreign forces above those of the nation and seek dependence on the outsiders, not national independence.  New difficulties have thus been laid in the way ahead of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean conservative ruling forces' desperate moves to check the trend of independent reunification of the nation will only precipitate their destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Vendepatria de cuno moderno  -comentario de ATCC-\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 8 de mayo (ATCC) -- Durante su reciente visita a Estados Unidos y Japon, Lee Myung Bak mostro su fachada de vendepatria servil a grandes potencias al manchar y sacrificar la dignidad y los intereses nacionales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo que hizo el en esa gira fue nombrar al Sur de Corea como \"Corea del Sur S.A. de EE.UU.\" e \"invitar\" al rey japones a Seul llamandole  \"emperador\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En menos de dos meses desde su llegada a la \"presidencia\", convirtio al Sur de Corea en una sociedad anonima del capital monopolista de EE.UU. y disculpo los crimenes cometidos por los imperialistas japoneses en el siglo pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto no pasa de ser un pedazo de iceberg entre todas sus acciones vendepatrias y serviles a grandes potencias. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Este tipejo proyanqui y projapones no tiene ni un apice de espiritu nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La toma de \"posesion\" de Lee Myung Bak produjo el desvanecimiento en el Sur de Corea del ideal de \"entre nosotros, los connacionales\" y el retorno de la anterior epoca de servilismo a EE.UU. y cooperacion con las fuerzas extranjeras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya desde antes de su investidura, Lee abogaba por fortalecer las relaciones de \"alianza\" entre el Sur de Corea y EE.UU. hablando del supuesto \"deterioro\" de estos vinculos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora intensifica el contubernio con las fuerzas foraneas sin tomar en consideracion los intereses y dignidad de la nacion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Arrodillado ante las fuerzas extranjeras, para las supuestas \"relaciones estrategicas de alianza del siglo 21\", el \"poder\" de Lee acepto el aumento de los gastos para el mantenimiento de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea, el reenvio de efectivos surcoreanos a Afganistan y la importacion de la carne de res de EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, la banda de Lee sigue hablando hasta ahora de la \"amistad\" con Japon, enemigo jurado de la nacion coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Segun los compinches de Lee, conviene al \"pragmatismo\" dejar encubiertos la historia de agresion a Corea y los crimenes del siglo pasado de los imperialistas japoneses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En ese contexto, ellos estropean hasta la redaccion del \"diccionario biografico de elementos projaponeses\" hablando de la \"nueva epoca de cooperacion\" y \"orientarse al futuro\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por cierto, el titere Lee es identico a los vendepatrias del siglo pasado que entregaron en bandeja el pais a las fuerzas extranjeras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los traidores de la calana de Lee traeran solo la verguenza a los coreanos que viven divididos durante mas de medio siglo por las fuerzas extranjeras.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
