He pioneered the revolutionary cause of Juche by rallying comrades. The noble tradition of comradeship of the Korean revolution has been successfully carried forward by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Revolutionary comradeship is the basis of the Korean people's unbreakable unity in mind, the motive force of creation and innovation and the lifeline of the uninterrupted revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble comradely love and trust between the President and the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters in the period when the Korean revolution was pioneered is an example of   comradeship to be invariably carried forward generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is Kim Jong Il's unshakable faith to carry the Korean revolution to completion by comradeship, the revolution that was pioneered by comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary comradeship gives a strong impetus to the Songun revolution today. The People's Army has grown to be an invincible army which has formed one entity of comradeship with the headquarters of the revolution under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The driving force of the revolution in the Songun era is an integral whole of the leader, the party, the army and the people.

After leaving south Korea heavily in debt to it by putting off \"the cutback\" of its forces and patronizing and pleading for south Korea's secret nuclear experiments, the U.S. pressurized the south Korean authorities in every way to extend the period of the stay of the troops in Iraq, threatening  that, otherwise, south Korea-U.S. relations would be hurt. Only the road of treachery is open to those who play into the hands of the outside forces, seeking flunkeyism and dependence on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should not extend the period of the stay of the troops in Iraq but withdraw those disgraceful troops right away.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
