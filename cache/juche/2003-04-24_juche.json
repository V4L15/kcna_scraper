            "content": "KCNA urges U.S. to approach DPRK-U.S. talks from sincere stand \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) - The DPRK-U.S. talks for the solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula began in Beijing on April 23.\r\n The countries around DPRK and the international community, to say nothing of the DPRK, are following the talks with great concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should show its political will to make a bold switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and prove it in practice. This is the master key to making the talks fruitful to satisfy the expectation and concern on the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and, therefore, an end to the hostile relations is the most important conditions for the settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. joint statement and the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework were published and certain progress could be made in the bilateral relations in the past because the Clinton administration officially clarified its political will to terminate the hostile relations between the two countries and put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bilateral relations reached rock-bottom as the Bush administration singled out the DPRK as a part of \"an axis of evil\" and the target of its preemptive attack after its emergence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In actuality, the situation on the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a war may break out any moment due to the U.S. moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war launched by the U.S. despite the international community's unanimous opposition teaches all the sovereign states the lesson that there should be only a strong physical deterrent force to protect the sovereignty of the country and the nation. The inspection and disarmament forced by the U.S. upon an independent state in violation of its sovereignty and its right to existence without any proper reason and ground are only aimed to justify and legalize aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the existence of any \"weapons of mass destruction\" and capability to develop them and other military capabilities should be considered as preconditions for a war and terrorism and the proliferation of weapons harassing the global peace and posing threat to other countries as far as state relations are concerned, it goes without saying that such military capability of the U.S. should be verifiably inspected before any other country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. talks should, therefore, discuss and settle the issue of the U.S. renunciation of its hostile intention and policy toward the DPRK before talking about the \"verification\" and the dismantlement of physical deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past DPRK-U.S. dialogue failed to settle fundamental issues as detente gave way to escalated tensions in the bilateral relations due to the U.S. hostile policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear and consistent is the principled stand of the DPRK to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should approach the talks from a sincere stand and strive to settle the essential issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the talks and confirm the U.S. real intention at them and choose the way to go.\r\n\r\n"

They are hyping the \"threat\" from the DPRK in every way in a bid to encourage the U.S. in its moves to escalate the situation on the Korean Peninsula and start a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK who have a bitter grudge against Japan will mercilessly wipe out the Japanese militarist forces if they dare launch a military attack against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's intensified hostile policy toward the DPRK will only result in harassing its security and bringing disasters to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to stop inviting misfortune and make a proper option for peace.    \r\n\r\n"

All the articles of the declaration are consistent with the idea of the charters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad will certainly bring about a decisive turn in accomplishing the cause of national reunification this year by upholding the call representing the nation's patriotic stand and will and waging a vigorous struggle to implement it, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
