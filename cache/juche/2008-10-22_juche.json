Minju Joson Tuesday in a signed commentary carried in this regard observes:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"abduction\" issue much advertised by Japan as \"cure-all\" has been discussed between the DPRK and Japan so far and it has already become clear thanks to the sincere efforts of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries are driving the DPRK-Japan relations to an extremely tense phase and working hard to torpedo the six-party talks, shelving the issue of settling Japan's past crimes and hyping the \"abduction\" issue, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe row kicked up by the Japanese reactionaries over the \"abduction\" issue is a reckless act of carrying the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan into extremes and little short of committing a double or treble crime in addition to those crimes perpetrated by Japan in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe servicepersons and people of the DPRK feel irrepressible resentment at the mean actions of the Japanese authorities to attain a sinister political aim under the pretext of the \"abduction\" issue and harden their will to settle accounts with the Japanese reactionaries at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is our view that Japan has already lost the qualification to participate in the six-party talks as it has obstructed the talks so far. In particular, Japan is making desperate efforts to dodge the fulfillment of the commitment on which an agreement was reached among the six parties. This compels us to think if Japan is allowed to participate in the talks, it will create complexities in the way of settling the issue and the talks turn into mayhem and raise a question as to whether there is any need to have the six-party talks attended by Japan. It is the view of the DPRK that now is the time to have an exhaustive discussion on the qualification of Japan to participate in the talks as it has persistently stood in their way even after being branded as a disturber of the six-party talks. It is quite natural to deprive the Japanese reactionaries of the qualification to participate in the said talks as they are unilaterally sticking to the stand not to honor Japan's commitment at a time when actions are being taken to implement the commitments the six parties promised to fulfill before the world."

This is attributable to the Lee Myung Bak group which is conniving and patronizing their moves. Herein lies the gravity of the issue.\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson today says this in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs disclosed, it was none other than the Lee group that cooked up ultra-right conservative organizations such as the \"Association of  the Movement for Free North Korea\" taking the lead in scattering those leaflets. Traitor Lee Myung Bak, defaming the June 15 era which paved a wide avenue for independent reunification, peace and prosperity as a \"lost decade,\" laid it down as a policy to make up for it, prompted by sycophancy towards the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen. Consequently, ultra-right conservatives who are hell bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen after holding key posts in the regime knocked into shape many ultra-right conservative organizations under the mask of \"civilian.\" These reptile organizations are busy everyday scattering anti-DPRK leaflets not only into the Kaesong Industrial Zone and the area of Mt. Kumgang resort but also into vast areas of South and North Hwanghae provinces and Kangwon Province along the Military Demarcation Line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs seen above, the psychological warfare launched by the ultra-right conservative organizations against the army and people of the DPRK at the prodding of the Lee group is now gaining in scope and strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is as foolish an act as running one's head to a wall to try to bring down the socialist system in the DPRK through the above-said psychological campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat matters is that such scattering of anti-DPRK leaflets may entail very grave consequences. As the Lee group is conniving at and patronizing the ultra-right conservative organizations' mean psychological campaign getting on the nerves of the army and people of the DPRK, any accidental case in any area along the MDL may trigger off an armed conflict. It is beyond any doubt that this conflict will develop into a new war, a nuclear war because the U.S. massively stockpiled nuclear weapons in south Korea and all Koreans in the north and the south will suffer from it. It is crystal clear that in that case the Lee group will not be safe, either. In the final analysis, the Lee group is digging its own grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee has so far committed too hideous crimes against the nation to escape a stern judgment of history. He had better bear this in mind and immediately stop the suicidal move to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen, warns the commentary."

This crime comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday.\n\t\t\t\t\tTraitor Lee Myung Bak is scaling the inter-Korean relations on the basis of the nuclear issue and, accordingly, persistently pursuing anti-DPRK confrontational policy, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a clear revelation of the traitorous clique's anachronistic conception of confrontation as they blindly follow the outside forces' hostile policy towards the DPRK and regard fellow countrymen as the object to be stifled, not away with the way of thinking dating back to the era of Cold War. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs known to everybody, the patriotic movement for reunification of different social standings in south Korea which made dynamic progress under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" reflected the desire and wishes of the nation and the need of the June 15 era of reunification which has advanced thanks to them. It has nothing in common with any \"plot of pro-north leftist forces.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is more intolerable is the fact that the Lee group revealed its reckless intention to bring down even the system in the north,  talking about \"contingency\" obsessed with the daydream of achieving \"unification through absorption of the north.\" It is an unpardonable blatant challenge and open declaration of a war against the north that the group of traitors has gone so reckless as to disclose its ambition for invading the north, daringly defaming the supreme dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north does not slight any issue of the north-south relations. But, the Lee group should know that the north can never treat the group with leniency as it goes mad with confrontation with the north, even harboring a wild ambition. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north will never remain a passive onlooker to its anti-DPRK confrontational racket but will decisively and mercilessly counter without the slightest tolerance any action to hurt the inviolable system in the north, the dignity and life and soul of the people in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group will only face severe punishment by history and the nation if it persistently pursues confrontation with the north, seized by the wrong concept of confrontation with fellow countrymen in disregard of the need of the June 15 era of reunification and the aspiration of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee would be well advised to drop his foolish idea of confrontation and behave himself."

Paektu established by President Kim Il Sung as the eternal treasured sword, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mental power which the WPK regards as the most powerful driving force for building a great prosperous powerful nation is rooted in the revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu and the validity of the guidelines and principle maintained by it in its march in the new century has been proved in the course of the long-drawn revolution which originated from the \"Down-with-Imperialism Union\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK found the key to the victory in the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation in the new century in inheriting the revolutionary tradition in all fields and made sure that utmost efforts were made to this end. This was a wise measure taken, foreseeing the prospect of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful inheritance of the revolutionary tradition of Mt. Paektu helped invariably adhere to the idea and principle which have been maintained by the Korean revolution throughout its history in the 21st century, too, consolidate the revolutionary ranks in the DPRK as required by the new century and usher in a period of fresh surge in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The third and fourth generations of the revolution acting a main force of the revolutionary ranks have always lived and struggled like the revolutionary forerunners, regarding the reminiscences of anti-Japanese guerrillas as a model and a textbook in life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The country is now witnessing such stirring realities as those in the postwar period in which the whole party and army and all people made a leap forward to build a socialist power, in hearty response to the call of the Party. The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu and the Kanggye spirit, a continuation of the Chollima spirit, are prevailing in the society and it is alive with the same militant fighting spirit as that pervaded in the anti-Japanese ranks. The formula of the Korean revolution remains unchanged as it weathers out stern trials with the revolutionary tradition as a weapon and brings about a turning phase in socialist construction, regarding this tradition as guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic experience gained by the Korean revolution goes to prove that the Songun principle should be strictly applied to the revolution and the construction in order to successfully carry forward the revolutionary tradition of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The army and people in the DPRK will firmly defend and carry forward and develop the revolutionary tradition of Juche and the revolutionary tradition of Mt. Paektu and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche started from the \"Down-with-Imperialism Union\", remaining true to the leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il no matter what storm and stress they may face in their way."
