A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture to mark the anniversary.   Attending the meeting together with People's Army servicemen and working people in the city were senior party, state and army officials, including Kim Yong Nam.   Secretary Kim Ki Nam of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) made a report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe reporter said since the election to the top post of national defense of  the great leader Kim Jong Il endowed with qualifications and traits as befits an outstanding statesman and commander from long ago, a bright future of victory and prosperity has been in store for the Korean revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKim Jong Il is a genius of politics and military affairs who formulated from a new angle a Juche-based outlook on national defense and put it into practice with credit to turn Korea into a militarily strong country of socialism, he said, and continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kim Jong Il put forward a distinguished political philosophy of attaching priority to national defense.   The philosophy is the most scientific and revolutionary guiding idea of state politics that gives a sure guarantee for victory of the Korean revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He defined it as a way of leading the revolution to give precedence to the army and directed primary efforts to strengthening the revolutionary armed forces to attain the height of prosperity in army building.   He made sure that the combat power of all civilian armed forces has been increased and the whole country has turned into an impregnable fortress. He also has devotedly worked for the building of national defense industry powerful enough to make  any weaponry of the latest type.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the people work toward defense and brilliance  of the socialist stronghold of Juche, rallied close around him with one mind and purpose. This is precisely the high spirit and dignified appearance of Kim Il Sung's Korea that proves its worth as a militarily strong country of socialism. In the recent 4 years alone Kim Jong Il gave on-site inspection to some 330 People's Army units, covering the distance as long as over 46,280 km and made a long and tiring journey for a new leaping stride in the national defense industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reporter called upon officers and men of the People's Army and working people to uphold with  loyalty Kim Jong Il's ideology and guidance, rallied close around him, for attaining the goal of building a powerful nation and opening a decisive phase of national reunification.   Now that there still remains imperialism on the globe and the U.S. and their stooges try to stifle Korean socialism at all costs, we should invariably pursue the policy of attaching priority to national defense, he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For strengthening national defense and accomplishing the cause of Juche, he noted, it is essential to channel utmost efforts into strengthening the People's Army. No matter which way the wind may blow, the People's Army should make full combat preparations, he said.   He also called upon all the working people to arm themselves with the WPK's idea of giving priority to the military and viewpoint on war, learn military knowledge with sincerity and follow up the successes gained in turning the whole country into an impregnable fortress. \r\n  \r\n"

            "content": "Dangerous move for military showdown\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean \"Minister of National Defence\", Chon Yong Thaek, at a radio interview some days ago, said the north's missiles as well as \"its suspected nuclear facility\" constitute a \"factor of major threat\" to the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia and the south  is coping with it through close \"cooperation\" with the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe also said the \"ROK\" army has mapped out a scenario to counter any provocation by the north and is now \"in the process of establishing a military posture for a variety of counter-actions.\" He did not bother to disclose \"its plan to increase capabilities for overall counter-actions\" through large-scale joint exercises on the ground and in east, west and south seas and in the air above them within the first half of this year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His remarks indicate how frantically the South Korean authorities are stepping up provocative war moves  to fan up north-south confrontation under the spurious cloak of the \"engagement policy toward the north.\"   His loudmouthed \"missile threat\" and \"nuclear suspicion\" are nothing but fictions faked up by the reactionary warlords of the United States and Japan in a bid to tarnish the prestige of the DPRK, a staunch champion of independence, and isolate and stifle it. Therefore, \"cooperation\" urged by the South Korean authorities self-exposes that they are miserable servants of the outside aggressor forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north presented a landmark proposal for improving inter-Korean relations, including inter-government dialogue, and proposed to them to positively implement the priorities in the first half of the year. But, as a challenge to this offer, he unveiled the \"plan to stage war drills\" against the north throughout South Korea during that period. It once again reveals the South Korean authority's anti-national, anti-reunification stand for north-south confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nChon Yong Thaek at the interview called on \"the ROK army to maintain an unshakable view on the principal enemy regardless of change in inter-Korean relations.\" These outbursts inciting consciousness of confrontation with the north are indicative of the deceptive nature of the present South Korean authority's anti-national, anti-reunification policy toward the north.    The South Korean authorities are well advised to behave with discretion, mindful that the dangerous military moves for north-south confrontation will only precipitate their self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Intention to continue to develop, produce, test and deploy missiles\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- U.S. officials are these days becoming more vociferous about \"missile threats\" from the DPRK.   According to news reports, an official of the U.S. state department recently said the issues of missiles and nuclear weapons are the two sides of a coin and, accordingly, these issues are top threats from North Korea. In another development, a spokesman for the U.S. state department cried North Korea should not test-launch any missile beyond the category of the missile technical control system although it has not entered this regime and that its launch of satellite poses \"threats\" to security.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This preposterous sophism is a flagrant violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK and an unpardonable challenge to it.   The U.S. outcries for \"missile threats\" are nothing but a deceptive subterfuge to contain the DPRK militarily and, furthermore, attain its design for domination over Asia.   Now, the U.S. is pushing ahead with establishing the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system (TMD) in the Asia-Pacific region at the final stage.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This system  represent a motive force of establishing a new Asian version of NATO and, accordingly, it is an aggressive and offensive war system to make a preemptive strike at the DPRK, bring it under its control and contain and command big powers in the Asia-Pacific region.   The U.S. is raising a hue and cry over \"missile threats\" from the DPRK in an attempt to find excuses for establishing the aggressive \"TMD\" system, a great threat to the peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region, and prove its validity. However, theirs is nothing but an anachronistic dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We reclarify that the launch of missiles and satellites belongs to the sovereignty of the DPRK from A to Z and, accordingly, there is no reason why the U.S. should poke its nose into this matter.   Having deployed a large number of ballistic missiles and inter-continental ballistic missiles in many parts of the world, the United States, the warring party of the DPRK, has posed threats to the DPRK and other countries. Under these circumstances, the DPRK will never suspend the development, production, test and deployment of missiles but go ahead with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. side wants, the DPRK may discuss only the issue of suspending missile export, provided that it makes compensation  in cash for losses the DPRK will suffer from the suspension.   However, the U.S. insists that it cannot \"make any compensation in cash.\"    Missile export will not be suspended if the U.S. refuses to pay cash to compensate for the DPRK's losses.   The United States should clearly understand the just and principled stand of the DPRK and stop vociferating about \"missile threats\" from the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"
