However, they should always give priority to making combat preparations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He pointed out that the serious defects were manifested in the sub-unit's combat preparations because the party committee of the unit failed to successfully do the party political work, the work with the commanding officers and soldiers to help them perform their revolutionary duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced important tasks to be fulfilled by the KPA to step up combat preparations and bolstering up the fighting capabilities, emphasizing that the KPA's combat preparations do not allow a unit to make them tomorrow if it failed to do today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Yun Tong Hyon, vice-minister of the People's Armed Forces."
