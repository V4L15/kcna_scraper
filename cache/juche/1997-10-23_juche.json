It is because the U.S. imperialist war maniacs intend to make a breakthrough in the Korean Peninsula with strength so that they can realise their aggressive Asia strategy.\r\n   If they recklessly pounce upon the DPRK, leaning on their numerical and technical superiority, it will deal a sledgehammer blow at them.\r\n   It will not do any good for the U.S. to aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula. \r\n\r\n"

The ideas and lines of national reunification which were put forward and have been maintained by General Secretary Kim Jong Il are consistent with the idea of national independence to realize the complete independence and sovereignty of the country and the nation and the true patriotic spirit for the prosperity and development of a reunified country and those of the whole nation.\r\n   He formulated as the three charters of national reunification the three principles of national reunification, the Ten-Point Programme for the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo which were advanced by the President and regards it as his steadfast will and iron rule to realize the cause of reunification on the basis of the three charters no matter how the situation and circumstances may change.\r\n   The cause of national reunification will be certainly realized in the near future when we regard as the immortal encyclopedia and highly important guideline of national reunification \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" and \"On Preserving the Juche Character and National Character of the Revolution and Construction\" which were recently published by General Secretary Kim Jong Il and carry them through.\r\n   He is the great master of leadership with extraordinary and outstanding, tested leadership ability and the most distinguished clairvoyant foresight who is braving difficulties and ordeals and turning misfortune into blessings, adversity into favorable conditions with his iron will, matchless grit and super stratagem.\r\n   Under his leadership the inter-Korean dialogue and negotiations, once deadlocked have been provided, joint statements and agreements were adopted between the north and south to open a new phase of the movement for national reunification. Multi-channeled dialogue and contacts, collaboration and exchange have been realized between the north and south where antagonism and confrontation prevailed, the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification (Pomchonghakryon) were formed and pan-national rally and reunification festival events of Pomchonghakryon are being held every year and the movement for national reunification has been expanded and strengthened into the nationwide movement both in name and reality. This is unthinkable apart from the wise leadership of General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   His leadership is the ever-victorious great leadership leading national independence, the reunification of the country straight to victory with his brilliant ideas and theories, outstanding and tested leadership ability and noble personality and virtues. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
