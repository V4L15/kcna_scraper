            "content": "Rice's Reckless Remarks Ridiculed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Rice, while\r\njustifying the Iraqi war started by the U.S. recently, blustered that though the information about north Korea's nuclear program  is insufficient, the whole world should strongly react to it. These reckless remarks come under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Wednesday.\r\n Her remarks reveal the U.S. efforts to create an international atmosphere for putting pressure upon the DPRK over the nuclear issue and its design for mounting a preemptive attack on it, the commentary observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the fact that Rice is the chief architect of the U.S. foreign policy, her outcries provided the army and the people of the DPRK with an opportunity to clearly reconfirm the Bush administration's purpose of its policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Insufficient information about north Korea's nuclear program\" and \"the whole world's strong counter-action\" touted by Rice are intended to shift the U.S. blame for having compelled the DPRK to have access to nuclear weapons onto the international community and mobilize multi-national forces for mounting preemptive attacks on it. \r\n To this end, the U.S. imperialist warlike forces worked out \"OPLAN 5029-05,\" a new concrete version of the existing war scenario against the DPRK, and drew up a \"plan to bomb nuclear facilities\" in the DPRK and a \"plan for blockading its coastal areas and airspace.\" This means they are leaving no means untried to stifle the DPRK by preemptive strikes. Their talk about \"the whole world's strong counter-action\" is little short of a declaration of a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK remain undeterred by any outbursts of the U.S. as they are strong in the spirit of independence and pluck. They will pay no heed to \"the whole world's strong counter-action\" and so on. Their message to the Uncle Sam is that it may do as it pleases. But the U.S. should bear in mind that the option of a preemptive attack is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mode of counter-action of the army and people in the DPRK to counter the attack by a stick with a rifle and the rifle firing with artillery firing. The U.S. would be well advised to ponder over the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its preemptive strike at the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To expect it is no more than a foolish dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The wild outburst of the U.S. 7th fleet commander is a military threat to force the DPRK to come to the six-party talks and scrap the nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no change in the principled stand of the DPRK toward a solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and the iron will and pluck of the army and the people of the DPRK to answer the U.S. military threat and tough policy with a super tough action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should behave with discretion, well aware that its policy to stifle the DPRK by military force is nothing but an act of self-destruction like jumping into fire with firewood.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Carrot and stick are their hackneyed means of aggression.  Rodong Sinmun says this in an article Wednesday.\r\n Noting that the U.S., which held its head too high, pursuing unilateralism and arbitrariness in the international arena, is resorting to ever craftier double-dealing tactics, finding itself \"a general without an army\" forsaken by its allies, the author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has clung to the double-dealing policy of carrot and stick down through history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. outwardly cries out for \"respect\" and \"friendship\" between countries, but viciously seeks behind the scene aggression, military intervention and subversive acts against others. And, while advocating \"cooperation\" and \"aid,\" it actually exploits them as the means of subjugating other countries politically and economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the other hand, the U.S. has employed the stick tactics to win some Southeast Asian countries over to its side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. tenaciously resorted to the double-dealing tactics toward the former Soviet Union, the first socialist state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its stick did not work when the former Soviet Union stood firm against it. But, when renegades of socialism came to power there and made one concession after another, the U.S. resorted to the carrot tactics to drive it to collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi situation shows more clearly what a miserable lot one meets if one backs down and yields to imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. is pressuring Iran over the \"nuclear issue\" and even scheming a military attack aimed at a change of power after labeling it as part of the \"axis of evil\" and an \"outpost of tyranny.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One must stand firm against the U.S. stick tactics and be on the alert against the carrot tactics, not tempted by it  Some countries in Africa which had once taken a stiff stand toward the U.S. are now succumbing to it, wanting its aid, discouraged by its invasion and occupation of Iraq.  They, however, lament belatedly that they were duped by the U.S. promise of \"aid.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world progressive countries and people should frustrate the U.S. imperialists' crafty and vicious double-dealing tactics of carrot and stick, seeing through their hypocritical and aggressive nature.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Escalated Moves for War against DPRK Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Ultra-modern war hardware is being more massively deployed on the Korean Peninsula than before the six-party talks\r\naimed at denuclearization and stability were under way and, consequently, the situation on the peninsula is inching closer to the brink of war due to the U.S. reckless war moves, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. chilled the atmosphere of the six-party talks by slandering the DPRK as an \"outpost of tyranny\" early this year. It has recently staged war exercises against the DPRK, creating the situation on the peninsula on the eve of war. It has been recently disclosed that the U.S. deployed scores of latest ground-to-ground missile of new type at the Second Division of the U.S. forces in south Korea, stirring up a furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. recent introduction into south Korea of ultra-modern war hardware once again clearly indicates that it does not want a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. but only seeks to stifle it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that the U.S. shipped these missiles into south Korea before any other places after testing their destructive power in the war of aggression against Iraq. It is not the first time that the U.S. introduced such war hardware whose performance was tested in real wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. moves for massive arms build-up give the lie to its loudmouthed \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and clearly indicate that it is getting all the more undisguised in its aggressive design to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. shipped the new type missiles into south Korea last year when the six-party talks were deadlocked due to the U.S. high-handed and self-opinionated attitude and the second-term of the Bush administration was decided. \r\n At that time the U.S. authorities made a \"gesture\" to create the impression that its hard-line toward the DPRK was likely to change but, in actuality, introduced latest war hardware into south Korea, challenging the international community desirous of a positive settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. This proves that the second-term Bush administration's Korea policy had been oriented toward the hard-line policy aimed at stifling the DPRK already at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. really seeks is to stifle the DPRK through confrontation and war, not to coexist with it in peace or settle the nuclear issue diplomatically. Proof of this is the ever-more pronounced ambition of the Bush bellicose group to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation urgently requires the DPRK to bolster the deterrent force for self-defence for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas to strengthen the three forms of cooperation to foil the U.S. ambition to stifle the DPRK with nukes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
