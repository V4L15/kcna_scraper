            "content": "DPRK Will Regard Any Provocation as Declaration of War: KCNA\r\nPyongyang, March 21 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation has ardently wished to see the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula at an early date as it has been exposed to a more direct nuclear threat for such a long period than any other nation in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, this ardent desire and wish are facing a new grave challenge due to the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors' policy of confrontation with the DPRK and moves to provoke a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet authorities are getting evermore undisguised in their moves to turn \"the nuclear security summit\" to be held in Seoul into a confab on a nuclear racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComing to the surface is their attempt to put the \"nuclear issue in the north\" on the agenda of the summit in the wake of such reckless remarks that \"the summit is of particularly weighty significance for south Korea being exposed to a nuclear threat\" and \"it is the first process for building a world free from nukes.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Myung Bak on March 19 let loose sheer sophism that \"the summit may play a big role in expanding the international community's support for the denuclearization of the north,\" disclosing his ulterior motive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Song Hwan, puppet minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Rim Song Nam, puppet chief delegate to the six-party talks, and others who are responsible for discussing the issue of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are floating wild rumors that \"there may be speeches on the north's nuclear issue,\" \"written statements may be presented\" and \"there may be a message urging the north to scrap nuclear substance\" at the summit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAlso heard from the conservative media are outbursts echoing the puppet authorities' claims that \"the nuclear issue of the north is likely to be addressed in depth\" and \"the parties concerned to the six-party talks will address the nuclear issue of the north in an intensive manner.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, even an idea of working out a draft \"Seoul communique\" on the premise of \"nuclear threat from the north\" is high on the agenda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis clearly testifies to the fact that the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is set to use the forthcoming international forum as a lever for confrontation with the DPRK by availing itself of its position as a host.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Seoul \"nuclear security summit\" is a continuation and extension of the group's frantic anti-DPRK nuclear racket. The DPRK has already clarified its principle stand over this issue and made it clear that international norms are strictly observed in storing and managing nuclear substance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should be stated emphatically is that the issue of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is that of denuclearizing the whole peninsula. Accordingly, \"the north's nuclear issue\" has never existed, in fact, and there is no justification to bring it up for discussion at the summit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group's persistent efforts to place \"the north's nuclear issue\" on the agenda of the Seoul \"summit\" are nothing but a revelation of its sinister attempt to justify its moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK and a curtain-raiser to the worldwide politically-motivated farce to divert elsewhere public criticism of it and escape a miserable defeat in the forthcoming \"election.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a ridiculous attempt and an absolutely unpardonable criminal act for Lee Myung Bak, traitor for all ages, to bring someone's \"nuclear issue\" up for discussion. The Lee group is foolish enough to use the \"summit\" as a card for justifying its military threat and moves for a nuclear war against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCrying out for \"coping with the north's possible terrorism by biological weapons and its attack to disturb GPS\", the group had already staged such war drills as \"combined protection drills of civilians, officials, military and police forces\" and \"combined drill to combat terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Kwan Jin, puppet minister of Defense, even issued an order \"to shower a ten-fold retaliatory fire\" in case the north provokes. He cried out for \"retaliating against the north till its full surrender in the spirit of taking revenge upon it for the sunken 'Cheonan' warship and the Yonphyong Island shelling case.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJong Sung Jo, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, also issued an order to \"take prompt strong retaliatory strikes.\" He said the north should be forced to \"deeply regret for its action\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group is keen to use the \"summit\" as a curtain-raiser to its nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK cannot but take a serious note of this fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo one can vouch that Lee would not use the \"summit\" for achieving his sinister aim as he left no means untried to bedevil the inter-Korean relations in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is proved by the group which behaved so meanly in the wake of the DPRK's announcement that it would launch satellite Kwangmyongsong-3.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group is making last-ditch efforts to deny even the DPRK's right to use space for peaceful purposes and infringe upon its sovereignty. This behavior suffices to guess how reckless it will go with this \"summit\" as an occasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe situation on the peninsula has reached an uncontrollably serious phase due to the group's thrice-cursed act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo one can predict how the situation will deteriorate in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn case \"the north's nuclear issue\" is placed on the agenda at the Seoul \"summit\" and such provocation as \"issuing a statement\" against the DPRK is perpetrated, this will be recorded in history as an intolerable insult to the wishes of the peerlessly great men of Mt. Paektu who left the denuclearization of the peninsula as their behests and as another thrice-cursed hideous crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a mockery of the public at home and abroad and shame on the world community to open the \"summit\" to discuss nuclear security in south Korea, the world's biggest nuclear arsenal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo take part in Lee's indiscreet burlesque is as reckless an act as driving the situation on the peninsula to the worst phase and adding fuel to the flames. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAny provocation will amount to a declaration of a war against the DPRK and result in throwing a stumbling block in the way of discussing the denuclearization of the peninsula."
