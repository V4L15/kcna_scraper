This is also a product of the U.S. long-term presence and domination over south Korea and its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should resolutely drop their shameful sycophancy and treachery and get rid of the U.S. control, clearly aware that their persistent act of keeping to the path of confrontation and war in collusion with outsiders with their backs on the nation will bring destruction only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal said that the final victory of the just sacred war of the Korean nation against the U.S. and the cause of Korea's reunification are certain to be achieved as long as there are the great leadership firmly defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation, the invincible Songun banner and the great programmes for national reunification indicating the way ahead of the fellow countrymen."
