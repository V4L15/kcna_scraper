He said that the exhibition is a pride of the world that all people call the treasure-house of the planet and wealth of humankind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  During my visit to Korea, I was moved to see the Korean people turning out in building a powerful nation, he said, and went on:     The imperialists and reactionaries have maneuvered in every way to stifle socialist Korea and the Korean people have suffered from natural disasters for years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Seeing the Korean people upholding the leadership of the respected Kim Jong Il with loyalty, rallied around him in one mind despite the present hard conditions, the world's people say Korea will soon be a powerful country.\r\n   I am confident that Korea will certainly win victory in building a powerful nation under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

The aggressors, boasting of their \"precision guided weapons\" and \"precision guided bombing technology,\" cannot justify this crime on any pretext.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.-led NATO, interfering in the territorial integrity and internal affairs of a sovereign state, is committing aggression in defiance of the UN Charter and the recognized principle of international law, and violating the wartime humanitarian regulations on protection of civilians and means and method of war. This must be punished as a crime against peace and ethics and a war crime. \r\n   If NATO continues committing this criminal aggression, challenging the justice and consciousness of humankind, it will meet a bitterer defeat. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says that 19 years have passed since all Kwangju citizens turned out in the heroic uprising against the aggressors and treacherous groups, recording  a brilliant chapter in the history of the struggle for anti-U.S. independence, anti-dictatorship democracy and national reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the independence and democratization  of South Korean society,  which Kwangju Uprising aspired after so ardently, have not yet been realised, a signed article of the paper says, and goes on:   It is entirely because of the aggressors and traitors that grave obstacles have been laid in the way of national reunification, the long-cherished desire of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.  have occupied one half of the country, forced colonial slavery upon  the South Korean people  and furthermore, placed them under the trusteeship, and are going to plunge the Korean nation into a nuclear holocaust.\r\n  The South Korean rulers sold out the sovereignty of the nation to foreign forces, and are running amok in  the move to unleash a fratricidal war, trampling down the democratic right and vital rights of the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The reality makes it incumbent upon the South Korean people to stage a nation-wide resistance against the aggressors and traitors as the Kwangju uprisers did for a new politics, new system and new life.\r\n   The ongoing anti-U.S. and anti-\"government\" struggle of the South Korean people from all walks of life is an eruption of aspiration and desire to retake dignity and sovereignty and to live a worthy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are in high spirit to continue the struggle to the end, expanding and strengthening their ranks.\r\n   The banner of independence, democracy and reunification that Kwangju uprisers held high remains a banner of struggle to the South Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

The opening of the hot line is a stark proof that�@the U.S.-Japan-South Korea  triangular military alliance for aggression on the DPRK is actually operating for \"emergencies on the Korean peninsula\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. are now getting more frantic in the moves for arms buildup against the DPRK on the pretext of \"making up military vacuum on the peninsula\" caused by the Yugoslav crisis. Taking side with them, the Japanese reactionaries are sharpening a sword for reinvasion of the peninsula and the South Korean authorities are supporting their masters U.S. and Japan's moves to unleash a war of aggression against the DPRK. Therefore, the situation of the Korean peninsula is being led to the brink of war as days go by.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK  warns the U.S. aggressors, Japanese reactionaries and South Korean authorities that it would take a due self-defensive step to cope with the situation. \r\n\r\n"
