This shows once again that the colonial rule of the imperialists can not be continued forever nor justified with anything, the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recovery of the Panama Canal is the result of the struggle of the Panamanian people for sovereignty of their country and the victory of the cause of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has justified its troops' occupation of South Korea under the pretext of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the adoption of the agreement on non-aggression between the north and south of Korea, the logic of \"deterrent to southward invasion\" has come to convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK-U.S. agreed framework on joint efforts for the denuclearization, peace and security on the Korean peninsula was also adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no justification for the U.S. occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accordingly, the United States can not justify it with any excuse. It is employing every conceivable mean trick to justify the occupation but it only reveals its shamelessness as aggressor to the world. \r\n\r\n"

However, Japan's movement is in sharp contrast to them.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the past, the Japanese imperialists unhesitatingly committed atrocities beyond human imagination, which outdistanced the fascist Hitler. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has the impudence to deny its tremendous crimes it committed against other countries and nations. Its conscience and politics are based on the militaristic conception and, therefore, they are intended to repeat the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For such behavior, Japan has become a target of vigilance and isolation in Asia and the rest of the world and has been distrusted and rejected by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If politicians of Japan have conscience and morality they should feel shame at being condemned, ridiculed and humiliated for their refusal to liquidate Japan's past. If they are true statesmen and level-headed men they should show their determination and will as politicians under the present situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is better for Japan to clear away its crimes and have clean mind rather than to suffer trouble, being shunned in the world community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan may be trusted by the world community if it earnestly repents of its crimes and tries to liquidate them. \r\n\r\n"

His exploits in leading the army are a precious asset which guarantees the development and prosperity of the country and the nation, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His exploits in leading the army are the decisive guarantee which makes the DPRK a militarily invincible nation, a lifeline which enables it to demonstrate its dignity as an ideologically powerful socialist nation and a motive force that brings about a new turn in socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has firmly established the commanding system of the Supreme Commander and the system of revolutionary army leadership in the whole army. It also has an invincible revolutionary army prepared in military technique and the solid foundation of self-reliant defence industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Marshal has seen to it that the people's army has fully inherited the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit which was possessed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. He has also instilled steadfast class-consciousness and hatred for the enemy into the soldiers of the people's army and made sure that traits of unity between the officers and men and revolutionary comradeship are prevalent in the whole army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are firmly preparing themselves to be the genuine revolutionaries of Juche, learning from the ideological and mental world of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the DPRK, the people's army has performed great achievements in socialist construction not only as the defender of the country but also as the creator of the people's happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now the Korean people are thoroughly implementing the lines and policies of the party, making great innovations and successes in socialist construction as the people's army does. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
