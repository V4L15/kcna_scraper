And its history records the brilliant culture and tradition created by its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Palhae literature opened a high plane in the development of Korean literature in the middle ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The literary works of Palhae are characteristic of high patriotic spirit and exquisite description in thematic and ideological contents and opulent lyricism and narration in artistry.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them is the poem \"Cloth-pounding Sound at Night\". It truthfully depicts the mental state of the hero who is homesick and missing badly his parents, wife and children far away from home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poem of 12 verses was written by Yang Thae Sa, a Palhae envoy, in Japan in the mid-eighth century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Other literary works including the poem \"One feels homesick, looking up to the moon\" by Wang Hyo Ryom reflect vividly the noble patriotic minds of the forefathers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Famous foreign men of literature and talents in those days were unstinting in their praise of literary works of Palhae. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The then well-known writers of Japan appraised Pae Jong, a Palhae poet, as \"a talent of seven steps\" meaning a brilliant poet who wrote an excellent poem while taking seven steps.
