They will deal resolute and merciless blows at the enemies if they opt for a reckless military adventure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop its perfidious act of poisoning the atmosphere of dialogue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is most shameless and impudent brigandage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an open secret that the transfer and relocation of the military base stepped up by the U.S. in south Korea are aimed at provoking a war of aggression against the DPRK to put the whole of Korea under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While occupying south Korea for more than six decades, the U.S. has inflicted all sorts of disasters upon it.

But this is a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The foreign policy idea of socialism is independence and peace. Only when the world people advance toward socialism can all the countries and nations live an independent life and develop together in a peaceful world, freed from all manner of domination and subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When all the people of the world follow the road of socialism, international solidarity based on the principles of independence and comradely cooperation can be strengthened and the cause of global independence be accomplished earlier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An imperialist country fond of aggression and war as if they are amusements, possessed of the largest amount of mass destruction weapons in the world, has never been able to pull down a socialist country by means of war. It is because socialism itself represents the strength of unity mightier than nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the first half of the 20th century socialism has performed great feats in thwarting the aggression of the imperialist forces and ensuring peace and security of the world. It was the united socialist forces that played a decisive role in putting an end to World War II provoked by the fascist forces and ensuring world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists dared not unleash a new world war while getting hell-bent on the nuclear arms race and moves for a war of aggression in the period of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If socialism is abandoned, unity is broken and the powerful military capacity is reduced to a candlelight flickering in the wind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the DPRK is demonstrating its might as the socialist fortress playing an important role in ensuring peace and security not only on the Korean Peninsula but also in the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is immediately peace.
