The remarks made by Ishihara this time are intended to justify and repeat the massacre in Kanto, instead of reflecting on it. This shows he is an imbecile who does not have even an iota of sense of political development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Tokyo metropolitan governor's repeated anti-DPRK remarks are as good as an act of throwing a wet blanket over progress in the DPRK-Japan talks because they were made at a time when the improvement of the bilateral relations presents itself as a task of the times and the next round of the full-dress talks is to be held in Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The real intention of Ishihara, who is a leading figure of the Japanese reactionary group and a prototype of ultra-nationalists and chauvinists, is to put a brake on the DPRK-Japan full-dress talks and incite anti-DPRK antagonism among the Japanese people so as to crack down upon Korean nationals in Japan and again drive the Korean people into a position of a ruined nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will surely settle accounts with Ishihara over his anachronistic and criminal behaviour going against trend of the times. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "WPK's unshakable will to defend revolutionary traditions reiterated \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- It is the unshakable will and determination of the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) to accomplish the Juche revolutionary cause by preserving the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Juche revolutionary cause can be accomplished only when the revolutionary traditions established by the President Kim Il Sung in the forest of Mt. Paektu are taken as a lifeline. This is the unwavering faith of General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il, considering the anti-Japanese revolutionary traditions as a cornerstone of eternal value for the WPK and the revolution, has led the revolution and construction on the basis of them and firmly protected their purity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A lot of his works including \"Let Us Thoroughly Equip Ourselves With Brilliant Revolutionary Traditions of Our Party\" and \"Let Us Successfully Carry Forward the Juche-Oriented Revolutionary Traditions\" reflect his steadfast stand and point of view that the anti-Japanese revolutionary traditions should be adhered to as the only lifeline of the Korean revolution and immeasurably precious treasures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He has always instructed that the education in the revolutionary traditions should be steadily intensified in the Korean People's Army (KPA) and among the people so that they might live and work in the same revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu as the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters displayed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary spirit of Mt. Paektu is the spirit of being intensely loyal to the leader by dedicating everything to him, the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude and an indomitable spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The KPA and the Korean people have dynamically advanced along the road of revolution, braving ordeals unprecedented in history. This has been possible entirely thanks to Kim Jong Il who has steered the revolution and construction by firmly preserving the anti-Japanese revolutionary traditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is a long and thorny way for the revolution to cover. But we will surely build a people's paradise, a powerful socialist nation in Korea desired by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners by holding fast to the Juche-oriented revolutionary traditions. \r\n\r\n"

They asserted that German side put sort of \"pressure\" on the DPRK in a foolish bid to attain their sinister political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Friendly relations are established and developed between states not by any \"request\" or \"pressure\" from someone under any circumstances. But they are opened between them in any case according to each other's independent decision and judgement on the principle of sovereignty, mutual respect and equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK government will as ever establish and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries which respect its sovereignty and are friendly to it in the basic idea of independence, peace and friendship. \r\n\r\n"

And its members were chosen from the social organizations concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was stressed at the meeting that the formation of the north headquarters was prompted by the patriotic desire to make the U.S. imperialists pay for all the mass killings committed in Korea and help all Koreans live in the coming new millennium as a dignified nation. And the meeting stressed the need for the headquarters to keep in close touch with investigation committees in South Korea and overseas to fully probe criminal atrocities committed by the U.S. Aggression troops and disclose them, go ahead with activities to inaugurate a pan-national ad hoc investigation committee and wage a dynamic anti-U.S. joint struggle. \r\n\r\n"
