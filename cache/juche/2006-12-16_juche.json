            "content": "Meeting Marks Anniversary of Saenal Children's Union \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 15 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place at the Central Youth Hall on Dec. 14 to mark the 80th anniversary of the founding of the Saenal Children's Union by President Kim Il Sung.\r\n It was attended by Kim Yong Nam, Kim Il Chol, Choe Thae Bok and others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The union formed on Dec. 15, Juche 15 (1926) was the first revolutionary children's organization of new type guided by the Juche idea. It was a vanguard organization of the Korean children who struggled to crush the Japanese imperialists, achieve the liberation and independence of the country and build a new society which would bring the working people a happy life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the C.C., the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, in a report said that the President's formation of the union made it possible for the children's movement in Korea to advance along the road of fresh development with a revolutionary fighting programme under the leadership of the President and provided the deep and strong historic roots of the Juche-based children's movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President set forth an original policy on rallying broad sections of children under the democratic flag and energetically led the preparations to do so though he was busy with the work to build new democratic Korea after the country's liberation. On this basis he proclaimed the formation of the Korean Children's Union (KCU) on Jun. 6, Juche 35 (1946). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean children's movement has been carried forward and made progress on a new higher stage under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il enriched and developed the Juche-based idea and theory of the children's movement expounded by the President, clearly indicating the way to be followed by the KCU in every period and at each stage of the revolutionary development and leading it to creditably fulfill its honorable mission and duty as reserves of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has provided great Songun revolutionary leadership, crossing steep mountain ridges to inspect the forefront, saying that the Songun policy is being enforced by the WPK for the sake of the children. It is thanks to this policy that the members of the union are given ample opportunity of learning, singing happy songs in camps under the blue sky of the country and bring their hopes and talents in full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche-based children's movement has gained in scope and strength under the wise leadership and boundless care of Kim Jong Il generation after generation and all members of the nation's rising generation are firmly preparing themselves as dependable heirs to the Songun revolutionary cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The organizations of the KCU should prepare all their members as true successors to the Juche revolution, Songun cause, and reliable reserves for the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation under the uplifted slogan \"Ready always for socialist country!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The members of the KCU, keenly aware that how dear the socialist motherland is to them, should value and take great care of the native places, even a blade of grass and a tree and bitterly hate the class enemies and struggle to decisively shatter the vicious moves of the enemies to spread the undesirable ideas and life styles of all sorts inside the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on the members of the KCU to work hard under the uplifted slogan \"Let's learn for Korea!\" and deepen the versatile and rich knowledge useful for the revolution and construction and thus become able revolutionary intellectuals who would shoulder upon themselves the future great prosperous powerful socialist nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

K. Chopra, chairman of the Indian Intellectuals' Society for the Study of the Juche Idea, addressing the meeting, said that Kim Jong Il provided a mighty ideological and theoretical weapon for bolstering the military force and put forward the Korean People's Army as a mainstay of the state and a main force for accomplishing the socialist cause. The KPA has grown to be a matchless army and all the people have been prepared fully enough to cope with any unforeseen situation under his Songun leadership, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Anita Chopra, chairwoman of the Indian Working Women's Society for the Study of the Juche Philosophy, in the lecture entitled \"Great Mother of Korea Kim Jong Suk\" noted that her glorious life totally dedicated to the liberation of the country and the victory of the revolution and her exploits would be always remembered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants of the film show watched the Korean film \"Korean People's Army, Steel-Strong Ranks.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It represents indomitable faith in shattering the aggressive moves of the enemies and firmly defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation and it is pulsating with the iron will of the Korean people to safeguard the interests of the working masses to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the might of Songun that the U.S. imperialists dare not provoke the DPRK while wantonly trampling upon the sovereignty of other countries, preoccupied with the \"doctrine of strength.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To firmly maintain the above-said principles is a major requirement for working constant miracles in socialist construction by giving fullest scope to the creativity of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people could defend and glorify Korean-style socialism to the last as they valued these principles more than their own lives even in the ordeals of the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march. The victory today when the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation is breaking after difficulties and ordeals were overcome is immediately the victory of the steadfast principle of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To firmly adhere to the revolutionary and class principles is a fundamental requirement for strictly upholding socialist character in all aspects of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These principles are being strictly maintained in our society today and the revolutionary and sound morale of life hold sway everywhere. Neither the moves of enemies for ideological and cultural infiltration nor their psychological warfare can work in our society where everybody donates their blood and flesh and even their lives to the society, collective and comrades without hesitation and performs worthy feats for the prosperity of the country and the development of the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will reliably defend the Korean-style socialist system, the cradle of their worthy life and happiness, by firmly maintaining the revolutionary and class principles in all fields in the future, too, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
