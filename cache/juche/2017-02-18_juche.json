            "content": "Minju Joson reitera el rechazo a Key Resolve y Foal Eagle\r\nPyongyang, 18 de febrero (ACNC) -- Los belicistas de la capa militar surcoreana planean ejecutar en la mayor dimension de la historia los ejercicios militares conjuntos Key Resolve y Foal Eagle con Estados Unidos, previstos para marzo que viene.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el periodico Minju Joson publico este sabado un comentario individual que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto comprueba que sobrepasa el limite de peligro la fiebre agresiva de los belicistas titeres surcoreanos para \"derrumbar\" a toda costa a la RPDC mediante la guerra nuclear, al cabo de su inaudita campana para aplastarla que lanzaron en complicidad de las fuerzas extranjeras en todos los dominios como la politica, la economia, la cultura, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad delata a todo el mundo quienes son los vendepatrias opositores a la reunificacion que sofocan la aspiracion nacional a la mejora de relaciones Norte-Sur, la relajacion de tension y la paz en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta claro que la histerica campana de guerra anti-RPDC de la banda surcoreana, enloquecida por el servilismo al imperio gringo y la confrontacion fratricida, y la politica hostil anti-RPDC de EE.UU. que la incita, significan imperdonable desafio a la aspiracion y demanda de los coreanos sobre la paz y la reunificacion y abierto atentado contra la dignidad y soberania del pais socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede expulsar nunca con ninguna logica o solicitud a los bandidos que arremeten esgrimiendo armas.  Esto es la verdad que ensena la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC vino consolidando el disuasivo de guerra de autodefensa y la capacidad de ataque preventivo nuclear para contrarrestar con armas nucleares justicieras los mismos armamentos de agresion y opresion de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellos intentan la aventurera invasion armada menospreciando la voluntad de represalia del ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC, estos reduciran a cenizas en un instante los focos de provocacion con su inimaginable y autoctono modo de guerra."
