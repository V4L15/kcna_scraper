They accused the authorities of opening the rice market and enacting the evil law on part-timers which drive the majority to death just to meet the interests of the minority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The death of farmer Jon is not a simple case of a farmer but a case threatening the death of all the workers and farmers, they said, demanding the authorities properly probe the cause of the murder case and punish those responsible for it without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A statement was read out at the press conference.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was sponsored by the All-People Measure Committee for Checking the Expansion of the U.S. Military Base in Phyongthaek.\r\n At the press conference speakers said that the expansion of the U.S. military base in Phyongthaek is aimed at realizing the \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea and laying the foundation for increasing their role. This will bring the south Korean people nothing but the danger of war and only result in the U.S. forces' permanent occupation of south Korea and all sorts of crimes and the destruction of living environment. They vowed to check the expansion of the U.S. military base at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to all organizations of south Korea and the world's peace-loving people was published at the press conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At this moment the precious fertile soil on this land is in danger of being destroyed owing to the U.S. moves to expand the base for aggression and war in a bid to hold supremacy, not only the inhabitants in Phyongthaek but all the people who have undergone sufferings due to the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea for over half a century should rise up in the struggle against the expansion of the U.S. military base, the appeal said.  The appeal called for achieving success in the December 11 grand peace march for checking the expansion of the U.S. military base in Phyongthaek and realizing peace on the Korean Peninsula for the present.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan should not revise this constitution if it does not want to be called a war state or aggressive state again.\r\n The retrogressive revision of the constitution, which is being accelerated at a final stage in Japan, is an expression of reckless militarist insanity of the Japanese reactionaries preoccupied by the ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves are being stepped up at the zealous instigation of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' undisguised moves for the retrogressive revision of the constitution are a danger signal heralding the emergence of a new war state in Asia and the Japanese militarists' start of overseas expansion. \r\n The reckless constitutional revision and overseas expansion are leading Japan to destruction. The reactionaries of Japan would be well advised to behave themselves, mindful of this.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu.\r\n They found out the poems and songs while studying the old names of the native places and data on their beautiful scenery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poems and songs dated from the period of Koryo Dynasty to the close of Ri Dynasty are rich in content and of high artistic value.\r\n They include various genres ranging from long poem to sonnet, collection of poems, short lyric poem and folk song, which were created by hundreds of writers including Hong Ryang Ho, Ri Si Hang, Kim Si Sup, Nam I and Kim Jong So famous in their ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are thousands of poems and songs related to Mangyongdae and Pyongyang and hundreds to Mt. Paektu and Hoeryong.\r\n Typical of them are a poem \"Mangyongdae\", a long poem \"Mt. Paektu\", words of songs \"Eight Beautiful Views in Hoeryong\" and \"Song of Osan\".\r\n They extol the natural scenery of the Mangyongdae area as the most beautiful one in the East, Mt. Paektu as ancestral mountain associated with the soul of the nation and the Hoeryong area, north gateway to Korea, associated with stories about bravery displayed by people in battles against foreign invaders as symbol of national defence. The poetical compositions are run through with ardent love for the country and great national pride. \r\n The works describe Mangyongdae, Mt. Paektu and Hoeryong as mysterious places permeated with the spirit of the nation and laud their superb landscapes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this shows that the native places of the three generals of Mt. Paektu have been dear to the Korean people from olden times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe newly discovered poems and songs are works of national treasure in adding luster to the unique national characteristics of Juche-oriented literature and gaining a better understanding of fine cultural heritage of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
