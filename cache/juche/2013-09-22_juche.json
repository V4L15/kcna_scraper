Korean Authorities Slammed for Confrontation with Fellow Countrymen\r\n Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- The working-level talks between authorities of the north and the south of Korea for the reunion of separated families and their relatives scheduled to be held on the occasion of the Harvest Moon Day and the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang have been postponed indefinitely, as reported on Saturday. \n\t\t\t\t\t The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea in its information bulletin No. 1042 on Sunday said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime is to wholly blame for this. It is a product of its vicious moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen as it malignantly slandered the broad-minded and sincere efforts of the DPRK to improve the inter-Korean relations and its will for dialogue and deliberately blocked the undertakings for achieving national reconciliation and improving the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans are expressing surging resentment at the puppet regime which has driven the inter-Korean relations again into confrontation and tensions, the bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the puppet regime made a spokesman for the Ministry of Unification release a \"statement to the north\" in which he was so base as to evade the responsibility for it, letting loose a string of poor excuses that \"it is regrettable\" and \"the south worked hard to bring the relations to normal by building confidence in the spirit of mutual recognition and peace\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Worse still, it termed the just steps and warnings of the DPRK \"acts against humanity\". It went the lengths of trumpeting about \"decisive countermeasure\" and \"international sanctions and resolute retaliation\", revealing again its true colors as confrontation maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a revelation of its treacherous scenario to evade its blame for the grave situation through its confrontation with the DPRK and mud-slinging, stoke hatred and antagonism towards the DPRK and stem the trend towards the improved inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is talking about \"settlement of humanitarian issue\" while taking issue with the DPRK but it is nothing but hypocrisy. The south Korean authorities have no face to talk about humanitarianism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were two rounds of reunion of separated families and their relatives at Mt. Kumgang resort in the period of the previous regime when the inter-Korean confrontation was at its height, thanks to the proposal and positive efforts of the north as is the case with the planned reunion. This is a well known fact. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Feeling extremely uneasy about the desire for peaceful reunification growing strong in south Korea, the regime let conservative media and die-hard confrontation maniacs clamor about the fruition of \"process for confidence-building on the Korean Peninsula\" and \"fruition of the theory of principle\". It staged madcap war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK and made much ado about \"pro-communist elements\" and \"forces following the north,\" going against the trend of improving the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is unpardonable violation and mockery of humanitarianism for the warmongers to talk about \"human ethics\", while going hysteric with fever of war against the DPRK after massively introducing war hardware into south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK stands for the settlement of the inter-Korean relations and their improvement including humanitarian undertakings but will never remain a passive onlooker to the reckless acts to encroach upon its dignity and self-esteem even a bit and hurt it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prospect of the inter-Korean relations will entirely depend on the attitude of the south Korean authorities."
