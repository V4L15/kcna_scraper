His remarks prove that his over-sensitiveness has gone beyond the limit in light of its motive and purport. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is, certainly, a political infant and a short-sighted man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is too late for him to share in the benefit of the joint declaration and his crime is too serious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he is concerned about national reconciliation and unity he should apologize to the nation and history for his past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean nation will keep his crimes.    \r\n\r\n"

General Kim Kyong Dok of the Ministry of Defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the recommendation made by the north side's delegation to the inter-Korean ministerial talks and the committee for the promotion of inter-Korean economic cooperation to provide a military guarantee for the project, Yu Yong Chol said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Forces' side delayed the adoption of an appendix to the armistice agreement, which had to be done before the current talks, even one week, badly affecting the preparations for ground-breaking ceremony of the project agreed upon between the two sides of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is fortunate that the inter-Korean military talks have been resumed though there were the U.S. moves going against the north side's will, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he proposed to draft a package agreement on the two projects of reconnecting rail and road links on the east coastal area and rail and road links between Sinuiju and Seoul, not a separate agreement on each project, and to have it signed and effectuated in the shortest possible period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides had an indepth discussion of the issues related to providing a military guarantee for the projects, and an identity of views was reached on the matters discussed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two sides agreed to have their defence ministers sign an \"agreement on fixing zones on the east and west coastal areas to be put under the control of the north and the south sides and  providing a military guarantee for the project of reconnecting rail and road links between the two sides\" and then exchange copies of the agreement with signature between September 16 and 17.    \r\n\r\n"
