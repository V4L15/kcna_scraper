If she truly wants \"demolition of barrier\", she should make a bold decision to pull down, to begin with, the concrete wall built by her father and his followers to divide the territory of the country into two. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time she fully revealed herself she is a modern-type sycophant and traitor and the worst traitor for all ages.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north-south relations are to be improved and peace and stability of the nation ensured, it is necessary to decisively eliminate such hordes of traitors as Park. This is the conclusion drawn by the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her miserable doom has already been sealed."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Denounces U.S. Anti-DPRK Human Rights Racket\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 27 (KCNA) -- The U.S. held a \"high-level meeting on human rights in north Korea\" on Sept. 23 on the sidelines of the 69th UN General Assembly now under way in New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the meeting the U.S. tried to mislead public opinion by creating impression that a \"report\" of the \"fact-finding committee\" on the human rights performance in the DPRK and a \"resolution\" of the UN Human Rights Council which had been already fabricated represented \"the will of the world public.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting was nothing but a despicable \"human rights\" burlesque staged against the DPRK as part of the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has never recognized the \"report\", \"resolution\" and the like of hostile forces as they were prompted by their inveterate repugnancy and plots against it and will never accept them in the future, too. This is because there cannot exist any human rights issue under the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses, the system giving top priority to the interests and convenience of the people and regarding them as absolute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK provides a state guarantee of all rights including the rights to exist, live and develop to the people by firmly defending its ideology and social system. That's why it says human rights precisely mean the state sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as the \"report\" and \"resolution\" made at the meeting are concerned, they are all lies and fabrications cooked up by dishonest hostile forces in a back room before going through any normal procedures without any consultation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are nothing but hackneyed misinformation spread by the U.S. to do harm to the DPRK and \"testimonies\" made by criminals who defected from the DPRK after betraying even their country, nation, parents, brothers and sisters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. was concerned for the settlement of the problem even a bit, it should have produced an impartial report through full discussion and legitimate procedures after studying the report of the DPRK Association for Human Rights Studies which was recently published, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. turned down an official request made by the DPRK delegation for its participation in the meeting. This fact alone clearly proves that the discussion on such issue has no equity and it was part of the U.S. sinister plots against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The U.S. act of barring the DPRK delegation from taking part in the meeting for discussing the \"issue\" of the DPRK while talking about \"dialogue on human rights\" goes to prove that the U.S. recent anti-DPRK campaign over the \"human rights issue\" has nothing in common with the genuine human rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even U.S. media expressed skepticism about the \"human rights\" campaign launched by the U.S. and others rejecting the DPRK delegation's proposed participation in the meeting and are reporting the DPRK's just assertions about the human rights issue every day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S. which should be forced to sit in the dock at a human rights tribunal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is a top class criminal state which has neither justification nor face to pull up other countries as it is the worst human rights abuser in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other hostile forces' persistent political plots, economic sanctions and military threats lay big hurdles in the way of the DPRK government's efforts to promote people's human rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the sinister aim sought by the U.S. in desperately kicking up such human rights campaign to tarnish the international image of the single-mindedly united DPRK and bolster up the lever for stifling it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ruckus of the U.S. would only bring into bolder relief its despicable true colors as the worst human rights abuser."
