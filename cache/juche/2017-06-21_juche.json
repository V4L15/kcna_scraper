As such, the climate change presents itself to the international community as an urgent task whose solution brooks no further delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Agreement when the world devotes ceaseless efforts for the protection of the global environment which is directly connected to the future of humankind is an extreme expression of egoism and moral inferiority seeking after its own well-being only at the cost of the global interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the world second largest greenhouse gas emitting state, the United States is more responsible than any other countries for the prevention of the global warming. However, its self-righteous and selfish action in total disregard to the international agreement or duties is now bringing about denunciation and criticism from various parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Non-Aligned Movement, as an authoritative force that represents the interests of developing countries, should due take concerted measures to resolutely condemn and reject the arrogant and shameless action of the United States which pursues its own interests at the expense of developing countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I take this opportunity to reaffirm the stand of the DPRK to strengthen close cooperation with Venezuela and other member countries of the Non-Aligned Movement in upholding the purposes and principles of NAM and enhancing its role."
