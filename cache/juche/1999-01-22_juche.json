They said that the DPRK must stop \"another launch of missile\" and dispel the suspicion about \"secret underground nuclear facility.\" This means that their argument about \"suspected kidnapping of  Japanese\" changed into \"missile and nuclear issues.\"&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp\r\n   It is ridiculous that they are still branding the launch of an artificial satellite in the DPRK as \"launch of a ballistic missile.\"  what is all the more ridiculous is the fact that they raised the abandonment  of another launch as a \"precondition for improved relations.\" \r\n   It is an independent right of a sovereign state to develop, test and launch artificial satellites or missiles.\r\n   Japan's \"warning\" and \"precondition\" are indeed imprudent.&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp\r\n   The rumour about \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" was first   spread by the U.S. \r\n   There is no need to say that it raised the issue to shove off the responsibility for delaying the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.\r\n   The Japanese authorities are spreading rumours that the DPRK-Japan relations have not yet been improved because of the launch of a satellite and \"nuclear suspicion\" of the DPRK.\r\n   A snag in the way of improving DPRK-Japan relations is Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK and its shameless refusal to liquidate the past. \r\n   Before vociferating about \"precondition,\" the Japanese authorities should unconditionally compensate for enormous losses inflicted upon the Korean people.\r\n\r\n"
