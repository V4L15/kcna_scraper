Koreans Called upon to Wage More Dynamic Anti-U.S. Actions \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 13 (KCNA) -- Soldiers of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea drove their armored car over the two middle schoolgirls on the roadside in broad daylight, killing them in cold blood. This was the most barbaric murder in world history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article carried five years since their tragic deaths. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more than six decade-long history of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' presence in south Korea is a crime-woven history characterized by contempt for Koreans, acts of aggression, murder and all sorts of other crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon landing in south Korea, the U.S. troops massacred the people calling for the establishment of a unified government representing the whole of Korea, trampling down upon the freedom and democracy of the south Korean people. The U.S. imperialists' policy for killing and dominating Koreans found a more vivid manifestation in the facts that they provoked a war of aggression and massacred Koreans without hesitation. In the post-war period, too, the U.S. imperialists did not respect even the elementary sovereignty, democracy and rights of south Koreans but wantonly violated them, turning south Korea into a solid bridgehead for Asian aggression. In consequence, during the more than six decades-long presence of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea, not a single day passed without seeing bloodshed of innocent people and disgraceful cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The murder of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son which triggered off popular anti-U.S. resistance five years ago was just a tip of iceberg of the countless cases of crimes committed by the U.S. forces engrossed in man-hunting. Not only the families of the slain girls but all other south Koreans shook with the resentment at the murderers. It was entirely just for the participants in the candlelight demonstrations to have strongly demanded the U.S. president to apologize for the crime and punish the murderers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces side, however, harbored the murderers for five months, asserting from the very day of the occurrence of the case that it happened while they were \"performing their official duties\" and whisked them away to their country after declaring them not guilty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to prevent such bloodshed and murder of south Koreans unless the U.S. forces' policy of occupation is terminated in south Korea, the article notes, calling upon the south Korean people to completely discard worship and flunkeyism towards America and vigorously turn out in the anti-U.S. struggle not to leave themselves and their beloved sons and daughters and brothers to the tender mercy of the wolf-like Yankees.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

When they found out dancers of the masque, he took a measure to perfect the dance and preserve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lofty will of the President who valued the legacies of the national culture has been carried into practice under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saw it to hold a national presentation meeting of dancers in 1986 on the lapse of 40 years since the President appreciated the dance and took a step to refilmize and perfect scenes of the silent documentary \"Pongsan Masque Dance\" made after the war to suit the requirement of the present reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saw a performance of masque dance given by peasants of the Unjong Special Livestock Co-op Farm in 2003 while providing on-the-spot guidance to it.

Underlying the culture created and developed by each country and nation and its tradition is the role played by language. It is very important to preserve and develop the national language now that the popular masses live on and carve out their destiny with a national state as a unit. Losing a national language means the loss of the soul, dignity and tradition of the nation and its ruin in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A nation can develop independently only when it preserves the purity of its language. The commonness of the language along with one and the same blood makes it possible to preserve the homogeneity of the nation. To preserve the purity of the language is, therefore, of weighty importance in protecting the national language and achieving national unity and development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preserving the national language and making an effective use of it present themselves as an urgent issue at present in view of the reckless and crafty moves of the imperialists to obliterate national languages, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are now working hard to obliterate the national character as well as Juche character of other countries and nations under the brigandish signboard of \"globalization\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their loudmouthed \"globalization\" of language is aimed at integrating diverse national languages into Western languages and assimilating and subordinating all nations to them in a bid to realize their hegemonic ambition with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the imperialists to \"globalize\" languages are part of their operations to obliterate other nations. Recent years witnessed the disappearance of various kinds of languages from the earth. This requires each country and nation to protect their own mother tongues and make the best use of them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
