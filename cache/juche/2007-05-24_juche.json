            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves for Retrogressive Revision of Constitution under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 23 (KCNA) -- A \"law to set referendum procedures for constitutional revision\" was enacted at the session of the House of Councillors on May 14. And this put on the national referendum the issue of the constitutional revision which had been pushed forward by the Japanese ruling quarters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the results of the national referendum turned out to be as the Abe regime had wished, this would mean Japan would have a legal condition for scrapping the 60 years-old \"Pacifist Constitution\" and adopting instead a war constitution. This cannot but be a very dangerous development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists have paid lip-service to \"peace\" under the signboard of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" since their defeat in World War II, while leaving no means untried to remove the framework of the above-said constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking advantage of the change of the international situation after the demise of the Cold War, in particular, the Japanese reactionaries enacted a variety of evil laws for war including the \"law on cooperation in UN peace-keeping activities,\" the \"law on emergency in surrounding areas\" and the \"law on special measures against terrorism\" under the pretexts of making \"international contributions,\" \"coping with the contingencies in the areas around Japan\" and \"settling the crisis caused by terrorism.\" All this has reduced the \"Pacifistic Constitution\" which bans a war to a dead paper. By carrying out the constitutional revision they seek to annul Article 9 of the Constitution which bans possession of war forces and the involvement in any war actions against other countries and legally pave the way for overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on history, Japan is the most brutal aggressor state in Asia as it has become rich through acts of aggression against neighboring countries. The Japanese militarists are so emboldened that they are ready to launch a war to conquer the world, making eyes not only at Asia but the rest of our planet. If the Constitution is allowed to be rewritten through the national referendum to produce a war constitution, the Japanese reactionaries will launch full-scale overseas invasion, totally unhindered. Herein lies the reactionary and dangerous nature of their sinister scenario to execute the law on national referendum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe forces had better halt their criminal moves for the retrogressive revision of the Constitution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now advertising something like a change in their policy of inter-Korean relations, making free with phrases about \"development of south-north relations.\" This is, however, nothing but a third-rate drama intended to hoodwink the public with the approach of the \"presidential elections.\" Just as a poisonous grass grows out of a poisonous root, no other road but that of fascist dictatorship can be followed by the GNP which took over the baton of successive parties of fascist dictatorship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That the dictatorship would be revived, if the GNP came to power, is evidenced by the fact that this band has never repented of the fascist vices committed by its forefathers in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is crystal clear that in case the traitor party which inherited the dirty blood of fascist dictatorship takes power, the flow of the times toward independence, democracy and reunification will be blocked and the past era of fascist dictatorship will be restored as it was.

The Chondoists are enjoying their religious life to the full under the protection of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was founded in 1860 with the idea \"Man and God are one\" as its principle, for the purpose of building an \"earthly paradise\" under the banner of \"Poguk anmin\" (defending the country and providing welfare for the people).  From the outset, however, it had to undergo suppression of feudal ruling classes and foreign invaders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Je U, the founder of the religion who had been called the Most Venerable Suun, and the second leader of the religion were killed by the feudal state of Ri dynasty for their anti-feudal and anti-aggressive spirits.  During the Kabo Peasant War (1894 - 1895) and the March First Popular Uprising against the Japanese imperialists, hundreds of thousands of believers were arrested, imprisoned and killed cold-bloodedly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the early winter in Juche 25 (1936) that the religion met its true guardian. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung appreciated the patriotic nature of Chondoism and met Tojong (a title of a local leader of Chondoist religion) Pak In Jin.  He called for firmly uniting under the banner of the national liberation, transcending differences in ideology, religious faith and political view and led a great number of believers to the sacred war against the Japanese imperialists.  After national liberation, he aroused them to building of a new country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moved by the noble benevolence of the President who embraced and warmly looked after all the people of the country, the wife of Pak In Jin called him as \"Heaven\" when she was honored with his audience in 1992. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chondoists are also enjoying a happy life under the care of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are leading a free religious life with the building on a beautiful bank of the River Taedong.

Now the hegemonic forces are openly seeking interference and domination, aggression and war against other countries and nations in the international arena, taking no notice of the United Nations and international law. This reality proves with hard facts that if a nation wants to defend its destiny, it must have powerful armed forces needed for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is a treasured sword which has placed the DPRK in a position of a powerful state possessed of inexhaustible national power mighty enough to fight any formidable enemy in the world and enables it to firmly defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is patriotic one to defend the dignity and interests of the Koreans not only in the north and the south but overseas and peace of the Korean Peninsula. It is only too clear that once a war breaks out in this land with one and the same vein the north and the south will suffer from it and a nuclear war would endanger the existence of the whole nation itself. But the security of the nation and peace of the country are safeguarded by matchless self-defensive military power of the DPRK built up with Songun and the Songun politics which deals a devastating blow to the aggressors infringing upon its dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas will turn out confidently with redoubled vigor in the noble struggle for the reunification of the country and the prosperity of the nation under the great banner of Songun, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Por lo tanto, se puso a la consulta popular el problema de la reforma constitucional que vinieron impulsando los gobernantes de ese pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si ese sufragio arroja un resultado esperado por el gabinete de Abe, se daran las condiciones legitimas para cancelar la \"constitucion pacifista\" existente durante 60 anos pasados e inventar la otra de guerra. Esto es una evolucion de la situacion sumamente peligrosa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este miercoles y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Despues de ser derrotados en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, los militaristas japoneses abogaron fingidamente por la \"paz\" escudandose detras de la \"constitucion pacifista\". Pero, en realidad se valieron de todos los medios y metodos para romper el marco de esa carta magna. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En particular, al aprovechar el cambio de la situacion internacional creado por el fin de la guerra fria, los reaccionarios japoneses inventaron diversas leyes belicas, entre otras, la \"ley de cooperacion con las actividades de la ONU para el mantenimiento de la paz\", la \"ley para la emergencia del contorno\" y la \"ley de medidas especiales contra el terrorismo\" pretextando la supuesta \"contribucion internacional\", \"tiempos de emergencia en las periferias\" y \"hacer frente a la crisis a causa del terrorismo\". Esto dejo practicamente sin efecto la constitucion arriba mencionada que estipula la prohibicion de la guerra. Mediante la reforma constitucional, ellos tratan de iniciar de manera legitima la agresion a ultramar tras eliminar su articulo 9 que define que Japon no posee las fuerzas armadas de guerra ni participa en las acciones belicas contra otros paises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Este pais isleno es el peor Estado agresivo en Asia que se enriquecio historicamente de la agresion a los paises vecinos. Ahora, los militaristas japoneses, que ya se tornaron demasiado voraces, quieren emprender el camino de la conquista del mundo mas alla del continente asiatico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si se inventa la constitucion de guerra por la consulta popular, ellos pasaran a la agresion a ultramar sin ser restringidos por nada. He aqui el caracter reaccionario y peligroso del sinistro intento de ellos de fraguar y ejecutar la \"ley del plebiscito\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las fuerzas de Abe deben abandonar sus criminales maniobras para modificar de mal en peor la carta magna.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
