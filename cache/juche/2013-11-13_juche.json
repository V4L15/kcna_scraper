They are, at the same time, carrying out undisguised operations to abduct its inhabitants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the chief executive, prime minister and other high-ranking officials of south Korea are hurling human scum into reckless actions to escalate confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The on-going hideous terrorism and conspiratorial racket unprecedented in the history of inter-Korean relations indicate what extent their confrontation hysteria has reached. Such provocation is a revelation of hysteria of those taken aback by the ever-mounting might and great achievements of the DPRK. It is a product of the plot-breeding and confrontation politics pursued by the south Korean authorities to defame and bring down the social system in the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is clearly evidenced by the fact that major institutions of the puppet regime and even the authorities are directly involved in the operations to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK though they had evaded their responsibility, talking about \"deeds of civilians\" in the past. The modes and methods employed in the recently disclosed cases of abduction prove that all of them were crimes committed in an organized and premeditated manner with the puppet authorities involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An agent of the IS was arrested recently in the territory of the DPRK.  His aim, circumstances of his infiltration and contents of his initial statement go to clearly prove that the enemy has perpetrated such terrorism and hatched conspiratorial plots for a long period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are human rights abusers and confrontation maniacs who do not hesitate to deliberately produce more \"separated families\" in the 21st century in a bid to gratify their political ambition and meet the purpose of confrontation, utterly indifferent to the nearly 70-year-long history of national division and pain resulting from it. Their behavior made it clear that \"the universally accepted human rights\" and \"protection of those defectors from the north\" touted by them are nothing but sheer sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History knows no such outrageous ruffians and depraved guys as the puppet forces that openly conduct operations to lure and abduct compatriots in wanton violation of international law and norms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No wonder, even south Korean media and public opinion deplored that such operations can not only seriously affect the inter-Korean relations but be a grave breach of international law and that it is a dangerous act to bribe persons so that they may make false testimonies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a right stipulated in the law of the DPRK to punish criminals and terrorists keen to do harm to the state security and people's life and safety. This is in full line with international law and norms on protecting human rights and combating terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's step is just and it will be merciless in its implementation."
