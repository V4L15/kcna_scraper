The DWP demanded IMF withdraw this demand and apologize to the public for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DWP also asserted that the non-payment by the Dae Woo Motor Company, ltd., and the bankruptcy of a number of companies have resulted from the introduction of the IMF plan. It charged that IMF's move to impose restructuring on South Korea instead of repenting of its policy failure is an impudent act to shift all the responsibilities on to the workers and other people.    \r\n\r\n"

Their massive deployment of aggression troops and war materiel in and around South Korea is to achieve this aim. They worked out the \"Operation Plan 5027-98,\" a scenario for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to create a war atmosphere despite the on-going DPRK-U.S. dialogue and moves for the improvement of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These cannot be construed otherwise than moves to disturb the process of improving the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. and aggravate the situation on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but take a counter-measure as the U.S. conservative hardliners are going to mount an armed attack on the DPRK anytime at any cost.    \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n The progressive people should positively struggle against all sorts of violations and encroachments on sovereignty, the article points out, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respect for sovereignty is a basic condition for building an independent new world. the principle of respect for sovereignty should be maintained to develop relations among countries on good terms and accelerate the building of an independent new world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respect for sovereignty is the main principle which should be observed in international relations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to keep the principle of respect for sovereignty before having any cooperation and exchange among countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when relations among countries are based on the principle of respect for sovereignty can the relations of equality be formed and independent development promoted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When state relations are established on this principle one side will not infringe upon the interests of the other side and it is possible to develop cooperation and exchange on the basis of relationship of impartiality and equality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many countries in the world and all of them have their own characters.    But there can be neither countries, high or low in their positions nor countries that give instructions nor countries that only receive dictates. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the countries have equal authority and each has the right to make a policy and carry it out in conformity with the will and demands of its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody has the right to interfere in other's  political system and way of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important for developing state relations on the principle of respect for sovereignty is that any country should not place itself above other countries nor claim a special status in external relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt to infringe upon the interests of other country and nation and force other country to accept one's intention is an infringement on the sovereignty of other country no matter in what form and way it may be made. This should not be allowed to continue any longer.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only then is it possible to prevent any unsound ideas disseminated by imperialists from infiltrating into our society and dynamically advance the cause of socialism of Korean style, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n"

This is clear from the fact that the programme sets it as the general goal of great national unity to found an independent, peaceful and neutral state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programme says that the north and the south should found a pan-national unified state to represent all parties, all groupings and all the members of the nation from all walks of life, while leaving the existing two systems and two governments intact and the pan-national unified state should be a federal state in which the two regional governments of the north and the south are represented equally, and an independent, peaceful and non-aligned neutral state which does not lean to any great power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls on the north and the south to recognize and respect the existence of different beliefs, ideas and systems, and achieve common progress and prosperity, with neither side encroaching on the other. The programme underscores the need to place the interests of the whole nation above regional and class interests and direct every effort to the accomplishment of the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The other reason is that the programme indicates the way of achieving the prosperity of the whole nation through the unity of the whole nation from the viewpoint on independence vital to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programme says that before and after reunification the north and the south should recognize state ownership, cooperative ownership and private ownership and protect the capital and property of individuals and organizations, as well as all interests concerned with foreign capital. It also clarifies that the north and the south should recognize the social reputation and qualifications of individuals in all domains, and continue to guarantee the benefits granted to people who have performed meritorious services. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programme calls for granting special favours to those who have performed exploits for the sake of the great unity of the nation and the reunification of the country, to patriotic martyrs and to their descendants. It is pointed out in the programme that if those who had turned their back on the nation in the past return to the patriotic road, repentant of their past, they should be dealt with leniently and assessed fairly, according to the contribution they have made to the cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n"
