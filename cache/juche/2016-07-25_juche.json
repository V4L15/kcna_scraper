            "content": "Rodong Sinmun revela por que Japon aplaude ubicacion de THAAD\r\nPyongyang, 25 de julio (ACNC) -- Recientemente, al expresar apoyo de su gobierno al emplazamiento de THAAD en suelo surcoreano, el director del secretariado del gabinete de Japon insistio en que otros paises no tienen derecho a cuestionar la decision correspondiente de Estados Unidos y el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el diario Rodong Sinmun publico este lunes un comentario individual que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa decision de desplegar el THAAD en el Sur de Corea calienta el circulo de prensa y exacerba el antagonismo entre los paises regionales. En estas circunstancias, se ha escuchado  las palabras arriba citadas que exponen la siniestra intencion del pais isleno de sacar provechos agravando las discrepancias en el tema de THAAD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste asunto no es el exclusivo de EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea sino esta relacionado con el mantenimiento de paz y seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico mas alla de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs producto directo de la ambicion malsana de EE.UU. de tomar la heguemonia militar en la region de Asia-Pacifico y de la campana de confrontacion fratricida de los titeres surcoreanos que quieren agredir al Norte de Corea en contubernio con su amo gringo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon recrudece de modo abierto el espionaje militar sobre la RPDC tras firmar el acuerdo de compartimiento de informaciones con EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea y ahora apoya activamente el emplazamiento de THAAD en suelo surcoreano con la intencion de aprovechar el empeoramiento de la situacion para justificar la conversion en potencia militar y emprender la nueva agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reagresion es la via de repeticion de derrota y autodestruccion. Japon no debe burlarse de la humanidad con sus palabras imprudentes, sino darse cuenta de que este vicio puede causarle desastres irremediables."

Por otra parte, cometieron otro acto provocador de introducir el submarino nuclear de tamano supergrande de EE.UU., Ohio, en el Puerto de Pusan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual difundido hoy, el diario Rodong Sinmun condena que tales movimientos militares dejan conocer el peligroso intento de provocar la guerra para aplastar con fuerzas armadas a la RPDC oponiendose obstinadamente al alivio de tension y la paz, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs invariable la intencion de EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos de ejercer la presion militar a la RPDC con incesantes entrenamientos belicos de diferentes tipos, que toman por pretexto la \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" de alguien, y ejecutar a toda costa la agresion al Norte al completar los preparativos de ataque preventivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara ese fin, los titeres surcoreanos desarrollaron esta vez los entrenamientos militares arriba citados en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC es el blanco principal de RIMPAC que libran cada ano EE.UU. y las fuerzas seguidoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no pueden ocultar el caracter agresivo de RIMPAC, que persigue el bloqueo maritimo y el ataque preventivo contra la RPDC, con el rumor de la supuesta \"amenaza de SLBM del Norte\"."
