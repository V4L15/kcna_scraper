But the situation on the Korean Peninsula was not beyond control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time, too, the situation on the peninsula will not be out of control. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An associate researcher at the China Institute of International Studies said that the DPRK leads south Korea in the space field. At a time when south Korea postponed the launch of satellite Naro the DPRK successfully launched its satellite to prove that its social system is advantageous and south Korea is not in a position to solve such high technological problems, the associate researcher added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The defense minister of Japan at a press conference referred to the DPRK's satellite launch. He showed understanding that certainly the DPRK made overall progress not only in the technology for launch but in the technology regarding the main body. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Personages of different social standings in the U.S. were stunned by the successful launch of the second version of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3 in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A former official of the U.S. State Department said that the DPRK demonstrated the steadfast will to fully carry out the behests of Kim Jong Il, chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, through the satellite launch in the run-up to the first anniversary of his demise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The North American Aerospace Defense Command made public a statement shortly after the satellite launch in the DPRK, saying that the DPRK successfully launched Unha-3 rocket and it looked successful in putting an object into space, according to the results of observation system's pursuit. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An American space expert said north Korea has succeeded in putting a satellite into space. Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics said that the Unha-3 rocket launched early Wednesday morning delivered the satellite into orbit and it was a perfect success for north Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An analyzer of the Land Institute of the U.S., national defense and security research body, said that it was something surprising in the aspect of time control and showed that they are master hands at assembling of missile. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A vice-director of Stanford University of the U.S. said that the DPRK has channeled efforts into the development of nuclear and rocket technology to build a thriving nation."

The clan is now locked in \"presidential election\" campaign with bloodshot eyes but also went busy insulting the sacred Kumsusan Palace of the Sun where the fathers of the nation lie in state. \n\t\t\t\t\t The \"Saenuri Party\" seriously insulted the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and incited confrontation, the spokesman said, adding that for this the DPRK warned of the possible grave consequences and advised it to correct the confrontation stand. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, far from exercising restraint, Park and the \"Saenuri Party\" kicked up confrontation racket more frantically and went so impudent as to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the \"Saenuri Party\" is a group of heinous confrontation maniacs little different from the Lee Myung Bak regime and that Park Geun Hye's talk about \"evolution of north policy\", \"confidence-building\" and \"dialogue\" are just tricks to deceive the public and win more winning votes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is now malignantly slinging mud at the successful launch of the second version of satellite Kwangmyongsong-3 and making much ado about \"provocation\" and \"sanctions\" together with traitor Lee Myung Bak.

She should clearly know this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and the people of the DPRK would deal a sledge-hammer blow at those who hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is well advised to clearly understand how the world turns out and behave with discretion."
