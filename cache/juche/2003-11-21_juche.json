This betrays the despicable and ferocious nature of the U.S. warhawks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans should preserve their self-esteem and turn out in a nationwide anti-U.S. struggle to resolutely foil the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices intended to infringe upon the dignity and interests of the Korean nation and drive the aggression troops out of south Korea, not allowing it to transfer its bases.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
