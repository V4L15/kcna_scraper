            "content": "KCNA Ridicules U.S. Mandarin's Reckless Remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, Lefkowitz, special envoy for North Korean human rights issue of the U.S., was impudent enough to poke his nose into the nuclear issue, only to bring shame to himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What he uttered is nothing but rubbish which admits of no argument as it only provoked wry laughter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But what merits attention here is that some American guys who do not know even where they stand, to say nothing of the way the world goes, are watching for a chance to scuttle the processes to settle the nuclear issue and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations, displeased with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the International Herald Tribune, a few hard-line officials in charge of national security at the office of the vice-president and the State Department were reported to have asserted a more confrontational approach towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was in this context that Lefkowitz underlined the need to include the human rights issue in the agenda items of the six-party talks and complained that China and south Korea are not pressurizing north Korea at the American Enterprise Institute, a center of conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This assertion was, in every respect, prompted by a dangerous attempt to sacrifice the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula directly related to the interests of the U.S. and other countries concerned and the peace and prosperity in Northeast Asia for meeting their selfish purpose as it is a revelation of their extreme uneasiness created by their impending political bankruptcy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known, the U.S. conservative hardliners led by neo-conservatives are now seized with extreme uneasiness and anxiety, marginalized in the political arena for the catastrophic consequences entailed by their extreme and subjective way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have neither anything new nor future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lefkowitz, Bolton and others are keen to misuse the process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula for achieving their political ambition under the slogan of hard-line and conservative policy which has already proven bankrupt inside the U.S. Nothing is graver mistake and crime against history than this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hackneyed methods used by the U.S. during the Cold War will never work on the DPRK although they may work on others. The six-party talks cannot be treated the same as the \"Helsinki process\" under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreements reached at the six-party talks on the principle of simultaneous action and progress made in this course are welcomed by all countries. Lefkowitz and others who seek to scuttle them cannot escape public censure and jeer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue remains the general will of the international community and the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We would like to question them what they really seek by turning back the clock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Such nonsensical remarks would never help stem the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Now that the denuclearization process has reached an important phase the U.S. should refrain from irresponsible remarks that may deflect it from its focus and countries concerned should thoroughly abide by the principle of \"action for action.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Researchers' Reckless Remarks Dismissed  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 28 (KCNA) -- Researchers at the Institute for Policy Studies and the Brookings Institute in Washington D.C. and other institutes in the U.S. recently made conflicting assertions about whether to plug south Korea into PSI or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the assertion that even though south Korea is plugged into the PSI, north Korea would not overreact to it but accept it as an unavoidable reality with its \"economic difficulties\" and the \"relations of economic cooperation\" with south Korea in due consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nCommenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Monday observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warlike forces' claim that north Korea would not make a hard-line reaction is a nonsense indicative of its ignorance of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The PSI is a measure aimed to isolate and blockade the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has frantically conducted joint naval exercises in Japanese waters near Korea in recent years. Now it seeks to stage similar multi-national exercises in the waters near Korea after drawing even south Korea into the PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its aim is to demonstrate \"international cooperation\" against the DPRK and tighten isolation and blockade against it by binding even countries around Korea to the PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. strategists seek to bring the DPRK to its knees through threat, blackmail and blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. research institutes serve the purpose of the U.S. administration's foreign policy of aggression. The U.S. foreign policies of aggression are shaped, examined, supplemented and completed at these institutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noteworthy is that almost all those foreign policies proved to be futile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is enough to make even a cat laugh for those think-tanks to calculate they can force the DPRK to abandon its tough principle through the expansion of the PSI. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will remain unfazed no matter how hard the U.S. may work to bring down the DPRK by employing every possible means and method.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Songun revolution is a gigantic one unprecedented in its fierce and arduous nature and a great one as it helps train people into revolutionaries who prize arms with do-or-die spirit and indomitable fighting spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary soldier spirit created under the great banner of Songun is the most vivid expression of the Korean people's strong mental power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people have carried on the revolution, forming a harmonious whole with the illustrious leaders. This has been a decisive factor that enabled them to emerge a people with the strongest mental power, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the Koreans can surely rise above them no matter how big they are if they give overriding importance to their ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Koreans the worth of their genuine life lies in linking their own destiny with that of the nation and working heart and soul for the sacred patriotic cause of national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
