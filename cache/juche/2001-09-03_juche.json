            "content": "KCNA on Japan's moves for militarization \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- The Japan Defence Agency on August 30 reportedly adopted the policy of building a \"specialized unit\" to \"cope with attacks of guerrillas and special units\".\r\n The adoption is nothing but hysteria of aggression intended to further expand and beef up its aggression troops under the pretext of non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK and thus accelerate the militarization of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the Japanese reactionaries cited the \"infiltration of an operation ship of North Korea\" and the case of a \"stranded submarine\" as a pretext for creating the \"specialized unit\" and they are planning to stage a \"field drill\" in Hawaii \"under the simulated conditions of repelling armed guerrillas attack\" and send its agents to U.S. intelligence operation facilities to let them learn latest technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the DPRK's launching of the satellite as a momentum Japan deliberately created a terror-ridden atmosphere internally and craftily built and has consolidated its political and military foundations to step up militarization and fascism, inciting hostility against the DPRK. Japan is now earnestly putting its program of military action into practice while peddling the old fiction of \"threat from North Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and people of Korea are following with surging resentment and vigilance the attitude of Japan putting spurs to the buildup of aggression forces, far from redeeming its blood-stained past, its history of aggression, remaining hostile to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have warned more than once that militarization of Japan will lead to reinvasion and it will get nothing but a final ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to reasonably judge where a real threat and danger come from and get rid of hysteria of militarism before it is too late.    \r\n\r\n"

His visit takes place at a time when the Korean people are making energetic endeavours to build a prosperous and powerful nation and achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Sino friendship is long-standing and has deep roots. The peoples of the two countries have hewed the path of victory, waging the common protracted and arduous struggle against imperialism and for independence, sovereignty and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This friendship continues to develop in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's visit to China in the first year of the 21st century and his visit in the last year of the 20th century marked an epochal event as it brilliantly decorated the history of the DPRK-China friendship and made it possible to further strengthen and develop the friendship in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jiang Zemin's current Korea visit is a demonstration of the bonds of the DPRK-China friendship growing stronger in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese people are hard-working and dignified people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have embarked upon the road of making a new advance to attain a higher goal of socialist modernization with Chinese characteristics under the leadership of the CPC with Jiang Zemin at the core. They are working hard to successfully carry out the three major tasks, thoroughly meet the demands of the \"three represents\" and achieve the reunification of the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The PRC's authority and say are growing stronger in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are pleased to note that everything is going well in China and extend firm solidarity to the Chinese people in their struggle for the complete reunification of the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the workers' party and people of Korea to steadily consolidate and develop the DPRK-China friendship. We are convinced that the DPRK-China friendship will grow stronger in the new century thanks to the joint efforts of the two parties and peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that there is no change in the stand of the government and people of the DPRK to strengthen and develop the DPRK-China friendship in line with the need of the new century and the common interests of the two peoples.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the DPRK's legitimate sovereign right to push forward its peaceful missile program. as already clarified, the DPRK's missiles do not pose any threat to those countries which respect the DPRK's sovereignty but they have no mercy on Japan keen on a dangerous missile launch targeted against the DPRK and some countries which actively support it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan should clearly know this and stop running amuck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n"
