It is unprecedented in terms of its method and cruelty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some time ago, the U.S. in the \"annual report on human rights situation in the world\" took issue with the DPRK over what it called \"human rights problem\" in a bid to cover up the true colors of the U.S. as the worst graveyard of human rights in the world and a most serious human rights violator and isolate and stifle the DPRK. Its anti-DPRK diatribe is a height of baseness and shamefulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The realities of South Korea prove that with the U.S. aggression troops staying in South Korea the sovereignty and dignity of the nation, human rights, peace and democracy are unthinkable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Before talking about \"defense of human rights\" shamelessly, the U.S. should repent of its vicious human rights abuses in South Korea and other parts of the world and make an apology for them. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
