Kim Jong Il enjoys art performances of soldiers\r\n   Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) - Secretary Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), enjoyed art performances given by art propaganda teams of the air force command, the navy command and large combined units 549 and 583 of the Korean People's Army.\r\n   Seeing the art performances together with him were KPA vice Marshal Jo Myong Rok, Director of the General Political Department of the KPA= KPA vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, Chief of the General Staff of the KPA= KPA Admiral Kim Il Chol and generals Hyon Chol Hae, Kim Ha Gyu and Pak Jae Gyong= KPA colonel general O Kum Chol and other KPA generals and officers.\r\n   The audience also included Choe Thae Bok, Kim Kuk Thae, Kim Ki Nam and Kim Yong Sun, secretaries of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea= Choe Ryong Hae, member of the WPK Central Committee and First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League= Ri Yong Chol, member of the Central Military Commission of the WPK and First vice-Director of a Department of the WPK Central Committee= and Jang Song Thaek, member of the WPK Central Committee and First vice-Director of a Department of the WPK Central Committee.\r\n   Art propaganda team members were gripped by deep emotions and joy at giving art performances in the presence of their respected Supreme Commander.\r\n   Through their performances replete with militant stamina and ardour, the artistes showed well the invincible might of the KPA which has grown to be a matchlessly strong army under General Kim Jong Il and the iron faith and will of the servicemen to resolutely safeguard the top echelon of the revolution and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms, remaining loyal to him.\r\n   Secretary Kim Jong Il noted with great satisfaction that the art propaganda team members successfully performed as artistes of the revolutionary army. He highly praised them for giving soldiers confidence in victory, optimism, fighting spirit and courage through revolutionary and militant art propaganda activities with intense loyalty to the Party and the leader.\r\n   He learned about their activities and gave them important tasks to intensify art propaganda among soldiers.\r\n   Giving definite priority to ideological work is the consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea in army-building like in all other fields of revolution and construction, he said, adding that the heroic KPA owes its unshakable ideology and confidence to the primary attention attached to ideological education of soldiers.\r\n   He said impressive art propaganda is of great importance in ideological education of soldiers. He urged art propaganda teams to enhance their role so that revolutionary optimism and militant spirit may overflow and revolutionary songs sound aloud at all times wherever there are soldiers.\r\n   He noted that all units of the KPA ranging from the platoon and the company to the large combined unit conduct art propaganda as vividly and effectively as the anti-Japanese guerrillas did. He called for making propaganda and agitation in the frontline method for revolutionary education of soldiers, as demanded by the Party.\r\n   The KPA is a model in art activities, too, he said, urging the whole society to follow the revolutionary spirit and method of soldiers and make great progress in the revolution and construction.\r\n   He noted that the art propaganda teams of the KPA can conduct their activities with militant and appealing art pieces fully reflecting the soldiers' life, feelings and the demand of Party policy because they always find themselves among soldiers. The artistes of the KPA should become kind educators and friends of soldiers, mindful that they stand in the van of the ideological front, he added.\r\n   He expressed belief that all the propaganda team members will inspire the soldiers with loyalty and positively contribute to the strengthening of the revolutionary armed forces through frequent visits and effective art propaganda activities among soldiers on the frontline, in the rear and at construction sites the way the anti-Japanese guerrillas did. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea show?\r\n  Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today views the retrogressive reamendment to the \"labor law\" by the Kim Young Sam clique of traitors as a political swindle and another bloodless coup. With a vote of the ruling and opposition \"assemblymen\" the fascist clique rattled through \"parliament\" a reamendment bill to the \"labor law\" which had been railroaded by the ruling party \"assemblymen\" at the end of last year.\r\n   The fact fully shows again that both the Kim Young Sam group and the opposition parties of south Korea are political charlatans who are interested in drawing water to their own mill and gratifying their own political desire, the daily says.\r\n   In a commentary the daily notes that the revision of the \"labor law\" gives the south Korean workers and people a serious lesson that they should have no shred of illusion about the fascist rulers and charlatans and they can achieve democratic freedom and rights only through dauntless struggle.  It further says:\r\n   Kim Young Sam, in a bid to win time, bridge over the crisis, assuage the workers' anger and disintegrate labor groups, acceded to \"ruling-opposition talks\" on January 21 seeking a ruling-opposition compromise in \"reamendment to the labor law\".\r\n   The revision of the evil law proves that with the traitor left in power, is it impossible to have a democratic labor law enacted, the working masses' living conditions improved and unfair practices of comprador employers eradicated.\r\n   The south Korean workers and people should continue the anti-Kim Young Sam, anti-fascist law struggle in combination with the spring struggle for wage hike and the struggle for a probe of the Hanbo incident and the punishment of its chief culprits. \r\n\r\n"

Kim Jong Il \r\n   Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Ri In Mo, known as the incarnation of faith and will, wrote a letter to Secretary Kim Jong Il on March 19, four years after he came back to the bosom of the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n   In the letter Ri said: \"At the time when I came back across the demarcation line in Panmunjom, physicians and authorities in the south predicted that my life in the north would last no longer than four weeks. However, I lived four years, over 50 times the weeks,  and have begun to live the fifth year's life in the bosom of the motherland and the Party.\"  He went on to say:\r\n   \"In the past four years I enjoyed, under the care of your respected General Km Jong Il, with greatest pleasure, which had never been in my life of 80 years. What I realised and cherished deep in my mind in this period is the general's great philosophy of faith.\r\n   \"I understand that this philosophy of yours is a significant meaning that revolution is immediately the power of faith and will and losing faith is death.\r\n   \"You have become a model of faith to train all our people to be possessors of strong faith.\r\n   \"Under your politics of great faith, the song of faith 'Let cowards flinch and traitors sneer= we'll keep the red flag flying here' is loudly ringing out in this land. And the people and the army with the faith living not for today but for tomorrow are devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution.\"\r\n   \"Even at this moment people mount on Mansu Hill while servicemen determined to become human bombs and rifles stand guard at the outpost of the forefront and the red flag is flying high at the socialist construction sites.\" \r\n   \"Those marchers of faith are an invincible great army which is ready to overcome any hardships and trials and defeat any formidable enemy. So, we are and will be emerging victorious.\"\r\n   Concluding the letter, Ri said that he, with other people who are making \"arduous march\" with General Kim Jong Il's philosophy of faith as their invariable outlook on life, will devote the rest of his life to the road he has gone along following the fatherly leader President Kim Il Sung and the General in his lifetime of 80 years, no matter what trial may come in future. \r\n\r\n"
