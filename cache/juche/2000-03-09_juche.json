            "content": "Statement of spokesman for DPRK Society for Human Rights Studies \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- It is the sovereign state's legitimate right recognized by international law to protect members of the Japanese \"red army\" who sought political asylum in the DPRK, and nobody can put his nose into this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A spokesman for the DPRK Society for Human Rights Studies stressed this in a statement on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to foreign news reports, the United States argued that at the talks with the DPRK to be held soon, it would discuss the issue of \"declassifying\" the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" on some conditions, one of which is that the DPRK should declare it will not allow members of the Japanese \"red army\" to stay in its territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an unbearable mockery and insult to the DPRK which opposes terrorism and respects human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As for those members of the Japanese \"red army,\" they are political exiles in the DPRK who fled from the Japanese authorities' harsh repression and persecution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the U.S. unreasonably urges the DPRK not to permit their stay any longer. It is an obstructive act of ignoring international usage and the requirement of the international law as well as a grave interference in the DPRK's internal affair. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK society for human rights studies scathingly denounces this act of the U.S. as an encroachment upon sovereignty of the DPRK and a wanton violation of the international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As well known to the world, over the last more than 50 years of its military occupation of South Korea the U.S. has wantonly violated the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and frequently committed terrorism against innocent people and raped and killed women as it pleased. It has been brought to light one after another that the U.S. aggression forces committed massacres of people during the last Korean War. Some time ago, a South Korean woman was killed by a gi. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is engaged in such international terrorism as wantonly violating the dignity and human rights of other nations. It committed blatant armed intervention against Iraq and Yugoslavia and other countries, thus encroaching upon their sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has also detained a large number of people of other countries in its territory under the name of \"political asylum,\" gravely infringing upon independent rights of people. Recently, it detained a Cuban boy saved from distress at sea and has refused to send him back to his country where his kinsmen are waiting for him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This clearly shows that the U.S. is the world's biggest sponsor of terrorism which engages itself in terrorist activities everywhere on earth and a vicious violator of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever an opportunity presents itself, however, the U.S. tries to brand the DPRK as a \"terrorist state\" under the pretext of \"human rights issue.\" This brigandish sophism is just like a thief crying \"stop the thief.\"   Worse still, preposterous sophism was let loose by the U.S. against the dialogue partner at a time when contact and negotiation are under way being held between the DPRK and the U.S.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a clear proof that the U.S. does not want the improvement of relations with the DPRK but is still clinging to a hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. must not employ an ill-intentioned tactics of insulting the dialogue partner under the pretext of \"human right abuses\" and \"terrorism,\" dancing to the tune of right-wing conservative elements of Japan but respect the DPRK as a dialogue partner from a sincere stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Success of the DPRK-U.S. talks wholly depends upon the U.S. attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never remain a passive onlooker to any sinister acts of the United States to impair the dignity and authority of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. must immediately stop hostile acts to hurt the DPRK but show its proper stand and willingness to ensure peace on the Korean peninsula and improve relations with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n"

One million people were killed by them in less than one year after the outbreak of the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korean casualties caused by the U.S. forces since the truce that took effect in July, 1953 have reached hundreds of thousands.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  \r\n   There are more than 200 U.S. forces bases in Tongduchon, Uijongbu and other parts of South Korea which have become a source of murder and terror. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At least 2,400 South Korean civilians lost their lives or got injured during the military exercises staged by the U.S. forces in firing ranges and drill grounds inside their bases in about 8 years of the 1990s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yun Kum I and Ho Ju Yon were among those many South Korean women who were cruelly killed by GIs after being raped in their bases or in areas near them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The total material and manpower loss and mental damage inflicted by the U.S. upon the Korean people are estimated to be at 15,000 billion dollars.    &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces should be forced to pay for all their crimes. \r\n\r\n"

So to speak, he encouraged Japan to rewrite the peace constitution that bans war for its full-scale aggression overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This laid bare the U.S. sinister attempt to use the Japanese armed forces as a shock brigade in carrying out its military strategy to dominate the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To this end, the United States has trained Japanese armed forces systematically after World War II. Last year it instigated Japan to adopt the legislation related to the \"U.S.-Japan Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" so as to legalize the overseas military actions of Japanese militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By doing so, the U.S. made a short cut to using Japanese armed forces as it pleases in carrying out military operations in the Asia-Pacific region. The present Japanese constitution is the only hurdle in its way. If the constitution is revised, the Japanese armed forces can be involved in any war of aggression in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States' attempt to draw them in a war is as dangerous as drawing water to a water-mill of Japanese militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. reckless move to revive Japanese militarism goes to prove that the U.S. is the arch harasser of the world peace. \r\n\r\n"
