The \"agreement on the transfer of the U.S. base from Ryongsan\" in 1990 has no legal guarantee as it was concluded by the U.S. pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The negotiations on the transfer of the Ryongsan base violating our sovereignty and the interests of the people should be immediately stopped. \r\n If the government continues the negotiations to conclude a disgraceful agreement in defiance of such demand, civic and public organizations and people would wage a powerful struggle to annul it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Those who were related to the Pyongyang summit made contributions to the nation. Yet, the GNP group forced them to stand trial and face sentences. It even went to the lengths of committing such shuddering crime as driving the former chairman of Hyundai Asan to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the GNP which is keen on reviving the fascist dictatorial system and holding in check the movement for independence, democracy and reunification in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are a group of most wicked henchmen as they are more zealously taking part in the outsiders' anti-DPRK racket than any others to bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the nation. And it is again the GNP which is hatching every crafty plot to stem the nation's strong trend towards reconciliation and reunification under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and bring the favorably improving inter-Korean relations back to those at the time of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This group of traitors spent such staggering amount of fund for its party's unsuccessful seizure of power. This lays bare what a despicable and sinister aim it seeks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is high time that the south Koreans passed a death sentence to the party of thieves who misappropriated such a stupendous amount of money under the signboard of a political party, the statement said, calling on the south Koreans from all walks of life to mete out a stern judgment to the GNP, mercilessly punish it and throw it overboard.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. unilateral withdrawal from the ABM Treaty, its refusal to fulfil the \"Kyoto Protocol\" and its claim at the International Criminal Court for the immunity of U.S. troops and its launching a war against Iraq in disregard of the UN Charter and international law were all high-handed and arbitrary practices of the U.S. \"view on value\" based on reactionary pragmatism preaching that anything \"useful\" and \"beneficial\" to the U.S. is \"truth\" and \"practicable\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionary and anti-popular nature of the view finds expression next in that it speaks for the interests of a tiny handful of big monopoly capitalists. The bourgeois politicians in the U.S. today are waxing quite eloquent about the U.S. \"interests\" under the cloak of the U.S. \"view on value,\" but this, in essence, means meeting the interests of big monopolies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The view is also an ideological tool of the U.S. imperialists to realize their ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are lording it over in a legitimate sovereign state after brutally overrunning it to monopolize the oil in the Mideast and are escalating military infiltration in the African region to plunder its resources. This represents the \"view on value\" of the U.S. which resorts to war and pillage in utter disregard of the UN and international law for its interests, for the high-rate profits of the monopolies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pressurizing all the countries in the world to follow its political and economic modes, way of life and \"view on value\" in the interests of the monopolies and at their requests, making no bones to fall back on military pressure and sanctions, armed intervention and state-sponsored terrorism and war against the countries and nations refusing to accept its demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"view on value\" defending the interests of its monopolies is bound to go bankrupt.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Submission to U.S. under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan, Seoul, is prompted by the U.S. interests and it has nothing to do with south Korea as it is aimed to serve the purpose of the U.S. strategy to dominate the DPRK and meet its \"security interests,\" says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is obliged to bear all the expenses to be incurred by the transfer of the U.S. military base in Ryongsan under the \"memorandum\" on the transfer concluded between south Korea and the U.S. in 1990. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities were so servile as to implore the U.S. to cut down the expenses even a little, far from demanding the repeal of such humiliating document. But with their solicitation rejected, they are inclined to cover all the expenses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have offered many young south Koreans as bullet shields for the U.S. forces, behaving like a rat before a cat. As if it were not enough, they are going to spend the money collected from the people as taxes for the transfer of the U.S. military base from which to start a war on this land. This behavior is touching off towering indignation among the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is clear from the controversy over the transfer of the U.S. base is the fact that south Korea is no more than a servant of the U.S. All those countries in the world which have U.S. bases receive rent from the U.S. but it is only south Korea that bears even the expenses for the transfer of its base. How wretched they are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are keen on tickling the fancy of outsiders, utterly indifferent to the interests of their people, can never get rid of subjugation but are destined to go to ruin. The south Korean authorities should take a pro-nation stand based on independence and reason and properly handle the issue of the transfer of the U.S. military base.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea said this in a statement issued on Friday as regards the recent disclosure of the list of over 400,000 Korean victims of forcible drafting.\r\n The statement continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over half a century has passed since the end of war but the Japanese authorities have deliberately prevaricated this or that way over the issue of Japan's past crimes in a bid to flee from their responsibility for them. This has touched off towering indignation among the workers and other people of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should clearly face up to the trend of the times, thoroughly probe the truth behind the human rights abuse against Koreans and make an unconditional and immediate apology and compensation to the victims and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called upon the trade union organizations in Japan and all other countries and the international organizations that value justice and conscience to raise voices critical of the Japanese authorities' shameless and foolish attempt to evade their responsibility for Japan's past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
