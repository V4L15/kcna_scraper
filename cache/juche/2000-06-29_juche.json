But today the \"SDF\" plans massive landing operations and surprise air raids against the DPRK. The new system to be introduced to the ground \"Self-Defence Force\" under the pretext of dealing with someone's \"landing operation\" is aimed at aggression against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised not to forget the lesson drawn from its past defeat but discontinue such a foolish act as inviting misfortune of its own accord. \r\n\r\n"

In that period the industrial output value increased 3.5 times. As a result, the foundations of industrialization were successfully laid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK worked out the first seven-year plan for the comprehensive realization of industrialization (1961-1967) whose main tasks for the industrial sector were to further perfect the production structure and build comprehensively developed independent industry and wisely led the work for its fulfillment. This resulted in readjusting and reinforcing the foundations of heavy industry the core of which is machine-building industry and establishing a self-reliant industrial system which depends on locally available raw materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Technical equipment in all the fields of the national economy was radically improved and electrification and automation were widely introduced there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During this period the DPRK adopted a new line of simultaneously carrying  on the building up of economy and defenses to cope with the ever more pronounced moves of the enemies to launch a new war and took a measure of extending the period of the plan 3 more years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During this period the total industrial output value grew 11.6 times that in 1956: The production of means of production swelled 13.3 times and that of consumer goods 9.3 times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the entire period of industrialization (1957-1970) the industrial production registered average annual growth of 19.1 percent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The share of industry in the total industrial and agricultural output value rose to 74 percent in 1969 from 34 percent in 1956. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The socialist industrialization was completed in the DPRK in a matter of 14 years.

All the countries and nations of the world are required to find their own way suited to their specific conditions and solve all the problems in keeping with them as they have different histories, national traditions, views on value, feelings and emotions and conditions.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDoing one's own way means solving all the problems by one's own efforts in keeping with one's actual situation and national interests with one's own view and methodology. In short, it means thoroughly preserving and applying Juche character and national character in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only when all the countries and nations live their own ways, can they achieve the independent and well balanced development and prosperity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   One's own way is the only way out for every country and nation. \r\n\r\n"
