            "content": "KCNA Blasts Rice's Outcry \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Rice, when interviewed by Asian reporters on July 22, uttered that north Korea is such an irresponsible and dangerous country as refusing to issue an advance notice about its missile launches to different directions and openly claiming that it has nuclear strike capability.\r\n Obviously, Rice made such outcry in a bid to justify the U.S. hostile policy to pressurize the DPRK with the ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum at hand and draw regional countries into its pressure campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her remarks are nothing but a sheer distortion of the reality which can convince no one. They only betray her political ignorance because her remarks are so naive that one can hardly interpret them as the words uttered by the diplomatic chief of a country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration sparked a new global nuclear arms race and a vicious cycle of terrorism under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" after deliberately listing legitimate sovereign states as an \"axis of evil\" and openly threatening to mount \"preemptive nuclear attacks\" on them. We would like to ask Rice if there is any other country more dangerous and irresponsible than the U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Bush administration is made up of the worst gangsters in the world because it adopted it as its state policy to perpetrate wars and genocide after dividing the world into \"good and evil\", refusing to face up to the trend of history towards peace and security, and does not hesitate to commit invasion against other countries and kill guiltless civilians in order to meet its selfish political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n It was none other than Rice who let loose a spate of such piffles over the launch of a few missiles as part of military training to cope with the U.S. reckless moves for aggression and war. This cannot be construed otherwise than an outburst made by a political imbecile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK launched missiles only after airspace, land and waters of the sea had been confirmed to be completely safe from them. Their launches, therefore, hurt neither ships nor civilian planes nor anyone. This fact was admitted even by the neighboring countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States now technically at war with the DPRK had been kicking up a war atmosphere for a month in collusion with Japan, threatening to intercept any missile to be launched. Had the DPRK announced its plan for missile launches in advance as demanded by Rice, an extremely grave situation would have been created in the Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what kind of foreign policy is followed by the Bush administration whose secretary of State is free to make such reckless remarks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Noting that the U.S. is resorting to the moves to stifle the DPRK instead of drawing lessons from its defeat in the Korean War in the 1950s, he stressed that under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il the Korean People's Army has been prepared to destroy any provocative moves of the U.S. at one blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Adolf Pilz, chairman of the Society for the Promotion of the Relations between Austria and the DPRK, in a speech expressed his resolution to more activate the movement for supporting the Korean people in their efforts to force the U.S. troops out of south Korea and achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the film show Korean film \"The Korean People's Army, Steel-like Ranks\" was screened.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind its much touted slogans of \"peace\", \"security\" and \"anti-terrorism\" is its design of aggression. The U.S. is a hideous wrecker of peace which pushes the world into instability through high-handed and arbitrary practices.

The paper warns that the whole nation will never pardon such renegades of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korean organizations including the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the Solidarity for Implementation of the South-North Joint Declaration in their statements note that the \"RIMPAC\" is the most provocative and dangerous war exercise against the north in the light of its scale and period. The U.S. which incites only confrontation and war is the chieftain of war crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Overseas Koreans also strongly demand that the war exercise be given up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United Confederation of Koreans in the Far Eastern Region of the Russian Federation sent a letter to Bush, the head of U.S.warhawks. It demands that the United States give up anachronistic wild dream to hold in check the independent reunification and prosperity of the Korean nation while deliberately aggravating the DPRK-U.S. relations, branding the joint military exercise as a grave provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is also joining the Koreans in denouncing the exercise. The British Association for the Study of the Songun Policy, the British Friendship Society with Korea and the British Branch of Association for Friendship with the Korean People issued a joint statement, calling upon the world progressive people to oppose the war exercise of the U.S. imperialists and its followers and firmly unite for supporting the socialist Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They can never evade this in any case. Nevertheless, national discrimination and violence against Koreans in Japan are committed without hesitation still today. We can never remain an onlooker to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The threats and assaults on Korean students committed without letup nowadays in Japan are not mere crimes of a few gangsters. They are crimes committed on the extension line of the Japanese reactionaries' moves to stage a comeback to Korea and under their hostile policy against the DPRK and Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already warned the Japanese authorities that the encroachment upon the national rights and vital rights of the Koreans in Japan is immediately an infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and made it plain that they will have to pay a dear price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities would be well advised to look straight into the seriousness of the matter and take an urgent measure to prevent the recurrence of hostile acts against Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
