The U.S. is putting military pressure upon the DPRK and amassing armed forces for war in and around south Korea under the pretext of the \"nuclear and missile threat\" from the DPRK, escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula. This is aimed at igniting a nuclear war on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves for a nuclear war which have become more reckless as the days go by only harden the resolution and will of the army and people of the DPRK to bolster the physical deterrent force to defend the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. option for a nuclear war would only precipitate its own self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Finding themselves isolated, completely losing popularity, they are now running about like a headless chicken to lift the rate of support to them which has fallen on the ground.\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Koreans should eliminate on the political scene the ultra-right conservative forces in the upcoming \"National Assembly election\" and, by giving all the votes to the progressive reformist forces, make it an occasion for bringing the much awaited political reform and new politics. \r\n The GNP is the main target of the fighting in the election. To expect \"a fresh start\" from this party is an illusion that does so harm but not any good. There is nothing more to expect from this party. What remains to be done is to bring down this traitorous party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The coming \"National Assembly election\" in south Korea is the capital chance to make a dramatic progress in the struggle for social justice and new life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation is opportune. It is time the south Koreans made a bold decision. The voters, men and women, young and old, should all participate in the election and sternly judge the remnants of the ultra-right conservative forces. The ballots should be cast for the progressive reformist forces at all the polling booths to bring about a complete change in south Korean politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Bachri who is heading the Indonesian government cultural delegation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Russian delegate, the head of a Chinese delegation, Chairperson Mitsuko Ogasawara of the Japan-Korea Musical and Artistic�@Interchange Society, an Egyptian delegate, and delegate of the DPRK Pak Hyong Sop, director of the Korean National Music and Dance�@Institute, made speeches under the respective titles \"April Spring Friendship Art Festival is an international art festival most�@famous in our planet,\" \"An elementary view on the development of the world's national art in the present times,\" \"Korean songs�@truthfully represent the people's noble feelings and their life which are of social significance\", \"Science and beauty\" and \"On�@successfully preserving the Juche character and national identity in music by actively encouraging folk songs in the DPRK\".�@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers stressed the need to develop the national art on a new basis and, at the same time, introduce achievements made by�@other national art and register successes in developing beautiful art by the creative efforts of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey also underscored the need to actively develop the popular art based on the Juche character and national identity as required by�@the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
