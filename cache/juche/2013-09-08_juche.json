It is going in the direction of deliberately straining the situation as the international community is more vocally querying the reason why the U.S. forces will stay in south Korea if the tension on the Korean Peninsula will be defused.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. used to claim that if its forces withdraw from south Korea, a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula right now but the situation on the peninsula has been strained to extremes due to the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than south Korea under U.S. military occupation where dangerous war scenarios have openly been declared and saber-rattling has been staged with huge forces enough to fight a total war involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly proves once again the true colors of the U.S. imperialists as the arch criminal bringing the danger of a nuclear war to the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a source of a war on the peninsula and the root cause of threatening and wrecking peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. forces' withdrawal from south Korea would mean the removal of the most dangerous hotbed of a war from the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces should withdraw from south Korea as early as possible for peace and security in the peninsula and the rest of the world."
