This project had to be carried out in more unfavorable topographic conditions and environment as compared with the preceding projects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The builders launched the project in August 2010, making a signal leap forward from the first drive for damming waters to build breakwaters Nos. 1 and 10.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The land and several islets were completely linked till the Day of the Sun last year and the project for the first damming to build breakwater No. 7 was completed on August 23 of the same year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The project for the first damming in all sections of all breakwaters was completed except breakwater No. 6, making a breakthrough in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the section between breakwaters getting closer, the water pressure increased and the water current gained in speed. However, the last section of breakwater No. 6 was successfully dammed off and the rush of sea water into the tideland stopped thanks to the indomitable will and heroic self-sacrificing spirit of the builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another trial befell the builders when they completed the project for the first damming in the whole section of breakwater in November 2011.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The breakwater burst out due to the worst tsunami in hundreds of years, but they did not yield to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t None of the builders left the work sites. They finally wound up  46,000 square meters of  stonework for breakwaters Nos. 2, 3, 4, 5 and 8 till the end of last year."
