It groups 76 organizations. Among them are the reunification solidarity, the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the (South) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Democratic Workers' Party.\r\n A statement on the purpose of its inauguration was read out at a press conference held in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n July 27 this year marks the 50th anniversary of the armistice agreement, the statement said, contending that peace has not yet settled but an unstable situation, in which a war may break out again anytime, is prevailing in the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee proposes to set July, the month when the AA was concluded, as a \"month of peace\" and July 27 as a \"day of peace\" and conduct a pan-national movement for establishing a permanent peace-keeping mechanism on the peninsula, it stated. \r\n    \r\n"

This cannot be construed otherwise than an insidious challenge intended to seriously get on the dialogue partner's nerves, hamstring the smooth progress of the talks and, furthermore, block the dynamic advance of the fellow countrymen toward national reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such anti-national, anti-reunification confrontation and war moves of the South Korean military hawks will only encourage the united states in its dangerous anti-DPRK war moves and accelerate their self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop at once their reckless confrontation and war moves to be staged in support of the U.S. war scheme.    \r\n"

            "content": "Koreans called upon to preserve Juche character and national identity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today devotes one whole page to an editorial article stressing the need to stand firm against the imperialists' ever-more undisguised moves and firmly preserve the Juche character and national identity to protect the sovereignty of the country and achieve the prosperity of the nation.\r\n It is an urgent necessity to preserve the Juche character and national identity in order to firmly defend the sovereignty of the country and the nation now that international justice is seriously violated, the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n State-sponsored terrorism and moves for domination are openly committed in the world today under the pretexts of \"combating terrorism\" and establishing a \"new world order\", going against the desire of humankind for complete equality and peace. This calls for more firmly maintaining the Juche character and national identity to stand firm against the imperialists' high-handed and arbitrary practices and their moves for domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to counter the imperialists' moves to put other countries and nations under their control by force. Even a small country and nation can certainly build up its power strong enough to frustrate the imperialists' moves for domination by uniting the people as one and tapping all its potentials if it firmly preserves the Juche character and national identity with extraordinary determination and persevering will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national identity, a valuable foundation for the existence of the nation and its prosperity, should be more firmly preserved as the relations and exchange among the countries and nations grow in scope and strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"globalization\" much touted by the imperialists today is aimed to disseminate their reactionary political and economic systems, corrupt ideology and culture and their way of life worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"globalization\" for which the imperialists are using huge information media and modern science and technology is a hideous criminal act to westernize the whole world and exterminate all other nations on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialists' moves to obliterate other nations have a long history. In the past they worked hard to assimilate some nations to their own nations in a physical way. But today they are seeking to put all nations of the world under their control by using developing information media and expanding cooperation and exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any people who value their country and nation should firmly preserve the Juche character and the national identity to foil the moves of the imperialists for \"globalization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fundamental principle of the Korean revolution and a consistent strategic line of the Workers' Party of Korea to preserve the Juche character and the national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary cause of Juche is a sacred cause based on love for the country, the nation and the people as the WPK has most successfully settled the issue of protecting the Korean people's independence and meeting the interests and requirements of the nation since its very start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is socialism based on national independence, socialism strong in Juche character and national identity. This is a brilliant result of President Kim Il Sung's faith of independence and patriotic will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy of the WPK is a true patriotic policy as it is aimed to protect the fundamental interests of the country and nation and preserve the excellent national identity of our people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the imperialists are deciding the fates of other countries and nations by military force as they please, the Songun policy provides the only right way of preserving the Juche character and the national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm will of leader Kim Jong Il to build a great prosperous powerful nation based on the Juche character and national identity in this land under the great banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary cause of Juche is sure to triumph as the Juche character and the national identity are being firmly preserved in the revolution and construction under that banner. \r\n\r\n"
