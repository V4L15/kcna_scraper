            "content": "Kim Jong Il Inspects Weak current Apparatus Factory\r\n Pyongyang, January 10 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the Kangdong Weak current Apparatus Factory wonderfully renewed to meet the requirement of the era of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the factory before a map showing its panoramic view, he went round the interior and exterior of the factory rebuilt on a modern basis for hours to learn in detail about its technical updating and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied with the fact that its workers have successfully put the production processes on such modern and scientific basis as the CNC technology to make radical progress in production of light electrical apparatuses. This is a striking demonstration of the validity and vitality of the WPK's policy of holding on to science and technology as lifeline in building an economic power, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the advantages and vitality of the independent national economy of the DPRK can be displayed more strikingly on a full scale when the Juche character of the economy is steadily intensified while realizing the modernization and scientification based on the latest science and technology like the said factory, he highly appreciated the revolutionary working spirit and aggressive working attitude of its workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The quality of various building parts and daily necessities the factory has produced by making good use of by-products is very high, he said, praising its employees' spirit of serving the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he made rounds of a cultural house, a dining hall and other cultural and welfare service facilities built in peculiar style by the factory. The factory is reminiscent of a rest center, he said, highly estimating its officials for having provided the workers with the good living conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He urged all the units to zealously follow the good example of the factory, saying that it is a model in all aspects including the work for putting production processes on a modern and scientific basis and establishing the cultured ways in production and life and the welfare service for the employees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The credit for the shining successes achieved by the factory in recent years goes to its officials who have conducted overall business administration such as production, technical updating and welfare service on a scientific and profitable basis in line with the principles of Korean-style socialist economic management, he said, stressing that it is of weighty significance in accelerating the advance of great surge for the officials to carefully map out the economic operation and management on a scientific basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced the highly important tasks to be fulfilled by the factory and expressed great expectation and conviction that the officials and workers of the factory would creditably play the role of the vanguard and shock brigade in implementing the economic policy of the WPK in the future, too."
