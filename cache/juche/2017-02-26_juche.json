She even said without hesitation that it is \"shameful for south Korea to request Japan to make apology for the past\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Ryong's husband Sin Tong Uk rushed to the hospital where the U.S. ambassador in south Korea was taken after sustaining a knife attack in front of which he performed \"fast meant to beg apology for heinous crime\" only to be blamed and jeered by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Exposing the hideous anti-reunification crimes committed by the father and daughter, the indictment continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Chung-hee belittled and insulted the July 4 joint statement which the north and the south agreed for the first time as \"a piece of paper\" and has opted for confrontation with the fellow countrymen and national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grudge-bearing concrete wall that cuts across the territory of Korea is a clear proof of the anti-reunification crime committed by traitor Park Chung-hee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye's hysteric fit will make even her father get dumbfounded.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soon after becoming the boss of Chongwadae, she trumpeted about \"north policy\" such as \"confidence-building process\" and \"Dresden declaration\", disclosing her ambition for confrontation with the fellow countrymen and unification of systems and insulted the sacred desire for reunification of the nation with such vulgar words as \"luck for unification\" used by traders and gamblers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She wined and dined human scum at Chongwadae and egged them on to scatter anti-DPRK leaflets and set up the UN \"office on human rights in north\", anti-DPRK plot-breeding organization, in south Korea which her predecessors dared not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She closed the Kaesong Industrial Zone, a product of the June 15 era of reunification and the last hope of the north-south relations, an anti-reunification and confrontational act putting into the shade the crime committed by her father by building a concrete wall to divide the territory of the country into two.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is holding all kinds of DPRK-targeted nuclear war exercises together with her American and Japanese masters almost every day and is agitating \"defection from the north\", not content with the racket for smear \"human rights\" campaign against the DPRK. These remind one of the hysteria of her father who kicked up the racket for a war against the north as they can be committed only by the offspring of traitor Park Chung-hee who dreamed a wild dream while crying out for \"unification by prevailing over communism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Exposing the \"new records\" of tyranny set by the dictatorial family, the indictment goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through 18 years of office Park Chung-hee enacted fascist evil laws of all descriptions and formed suppression organizations, turning whole south Korea into military prison, an area without freedom and human rights and a veritable hell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the hands of the dictator, more than 2,000 evil laws were enacted or retrogressively revised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye eulogized and justified her father's dictatorial rule and fully revived \"yusin\" dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She turned south Korea into the barren land of democracy and human rights while crying out for \"defending system\" and \"eliminating the forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Chung-hee and Park Geun Hye worked harder than any other successive puppet rulers to suppress legitimate media as evidenced by the ban on Minjok Ilbo and Jaju Minbo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye family members are all ugly human rejects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History and nation will never pardon such despicable group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, the eldest daughter of the family of traitors, is waiting for the stern punishment by history while breathing her last in a dark room in Chongwadae with her \"presidential\" duty suspended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Miserable end is an unavoidable fate sealed for the most despicable family of traitors."
