In these questionnaires it strongly urged them to give clear answers to them if they truly want dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the wake of this development, strong voices are heard from different circles in south Korea urging the puppet government to apologize and repent of things it had done to bring the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"Grand National Party\" on which Lee Myung Bak counted also called for totally bolting from him while urging his defection from the party and resignation. It kicked up such a row as reshaping the \"keynote of its north policy\" and changing its name.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the meantime, media of south Korea are following every move of the group and deriding it, as it is even seeking a roundabout method to resume dialogue even after being deprived of every justification for negotiating with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group is vehemently rebuffed by the south Korean public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is ridiculous, indeed, for the group to trumpet about \"resumption of dialogue\" as it is completely isolated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can cover up the anti-reunification and traitorous nature of the joint nuclear war maneuvers it is going to stage with outside forces and hold the upcoming \"general election\" in its favor through its publicity stunt of \"dialogue.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tClear is the stance of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group can neither be a dialogue partner of the DPRK nor expect any dialogue as long as it declines to give answers to the questionnaires.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIts \"waiting strategy\" will only precipitate its political ruin."
