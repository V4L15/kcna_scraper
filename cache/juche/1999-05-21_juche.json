            "content": "Spokesman of DPRK Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee on anti-DPRK campaign\r\n     Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued today a statement denouncing the South Korean intelligence service and venal news media for false propaganda designed to spoil the atmosphere of international food aid to the DPRK and tarnish the image of the DPRK.\r\n   The statement says:\r\n   The South Korean Intelligence Service and venal news media have recently been engaged in an anti-DPRK smear campaign with groundless assertion that \" wandering children are gathered at camps\"  and that the \" massive outflow of refugees to northeast China requires cooperation of international refugees organisations.\"       Some media of the West blindly join in this anti-DPRK diatribe.\r\n   They dislike successful international humanitarian aid to the DPRK. They say international cooperation organisations in the northern half of Korea are taken in by a \"drama\"  of the north and that China does not cooperate with international refugees organisations, in a bid to convince the international community of a \" suspicion\"  of the effectiveness of the humanitarian aid to the DPRK.\r\n   The South Korean Intelligence Service had been engaged in false propaganda that three million people were starved to death in the northern half of Korea for the last four years only to find itself disgraced under the eyes of the world.\r\n   Their recent assertion is little different from the false propaganda.\r\n   In any country natural disaster is a source of the loss of huge materials as well as of human lives.\r\n   Primary attention was paid to the children bereft of houses and parents to provide them with temporary shelters and food and send them to their relatives and at the same time steps were taken to send them to baby homes and primary and middle schools as part of the efforts to do away with the aftereffects of natural disasters of years, including the rare-be-seen flood damage that hit the northern half of Korea in 1995.\r\n   Under the socialist system established in the northern half of Korea where man is valued most there is no social source of \"wandering children\"  and \" refugees.\"   \r\n   The children who lost their parents and houses because of natural disasters and the residents in the afflicted areas have been looked after under the warm care of the state and society. It is the true picture of our society that such beautiful traits are the commonplace.\r\n   Clear is the purpose of the anti-DPRK diatribe by the South Korean Intelligence Service and venal news media turning their back on such realities of ours.\r\n   Their smear campaign is designed to do harm to the high international prestige of our republic, tarnish its image, obstruct the international humanitarian aid to the DPRK and undermine the traditional DPRK-China friendly relations.\r\n   The smear campaign of falsehood and fabrication can no longer go down with any one, however crafty it may be. \r\n   The South Korean Intelligence Service and venal news media are mistaken. Their frantic anti-DPRK campaign will only betray their true colors as dishonest elements. They should be aware of this and act with discretion.\r\n   Some of the western news media that advocate \"impartiality\" and \" objectivity\"    had better stop playing into  the hands of the South Korean Intelligence Service infamous for its great hand at plot.    \r\n \r\n"

Korean dictator denounced\r\n     Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentary denouncing the South Korean rulers for intensifying harsh suppression of democratic forces.\r\n   The commentary says:\r\n   The South Korean authorities on Wednesday applied for arrest warrants for eight leading members of the Seoul Subway Trade Union, claiming that they \" orchestrated a wholesale strike and impeded business.\"     Earlier, they kicked up a racket of arresting students of six universities, including leaders of the Pusan and South Kyongsang Provincial Federation of University Student Councils, on \" charges\"    of involvement in various demonstrations.\r\n   This is an outrage of the ignorant and uncouth fascists who are clean indifferent to democracy, human rights and working masses' vital rights but are engaged only in bayonet-wielding actions.\r\n   The struggle of South Korean workers, students and other people is a patriotic struggle of justice to overthrow the colonial fascist ruling system of the U.S. imperialists and the authorities and build a country independent, democratic and reunified. It should never be a target of repression.\r\n   The rulers, driven into a corner by their vigorous anti-U.S., anti-\"   government\"  struggle, are now intensifying the offensive of harsh suppression of the pro-democracy patriotic forces in a bid to bridge over the crisis.\r\n   The spearhead of repression is directed to the (South) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the (South) Korean Federation of University Student Councils, which stand shoulder to shoulder in the van of the struggle.\r\n   Such suppression of workers and students is a recklessly desperate effort of the traitors driven into a crisis of destruction by the just struggle of the people.\r\n   The South Korean people have already condemned the present rulers to death.    \r\n\r\n"
