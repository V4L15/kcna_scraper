He highly appreciated their feats and extended warm greetings to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The complex has been updated as required by the new century and is now turning out a lot of products thanks to the indomitable revolutionary spirit of its workers who have a glorious tradition of unconditionally carrying out any difficult task if it is the decision and instruction of the party, he said, adding that this is the revolutionary spirit of the heroic Korean working class who have glorified the sacred annals of the revolution with struggle and exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that during the \"arduous march,\" the forced march when they had to undergo all difficulties the workers of the complex protected the precious production equipment like their own lives full of confidence and optimism about the future, spruced up the complex and made a breakthrough towards reenergizing the production by their own efforts, he stressed that this spectacular success goes to prove the inexhaustible mental power of the Korean people who grew under the care of the President who made a great history of the nation-building in the spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Putting forward the tasks to be fulfilled by the complex, he stressed the need for it to further strengthen the Juche character of the chemical industry and continue energetically pushing forward the updating of the complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed expectation and belief that the workers of the complex would hasten the updating and steadily increase the production capability with all their wisdom and enthusiasm and thus fully display the might of the complex as a model of the nation's Juche-based industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, and Pak Nam Gi, its department director.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a criminal and aggressive military consultative mechanism as it has served to strengthen the U.S. military occupation and domination over south Korea, disturb the struggle of the Korean nation for peace and peaceful reunification of the country and steadily escalate the military confrontation and tension and war crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean puppets are now strengthening their cooperation and military tie-ups for a war against the DPRK on a more grave phase, going against the trend of the times, the commentary notes, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak regime in south Korea is acting a faithful servant and shock force in carrying out its master, the United States' policy of aggression and war, turning aside from the national cooperation and calling for the strengthened \"alliance\" with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his recent trip to the U.S. traitor Lee Myung Bak came out with the proposal of what he called \"strategic alliance in the 21st century,\" revealing his intention to closely cooperate with the U.S. in realizing its wild ambition for world supremacy and aggression on the DPRK. He has also bent all his energies to cook up the dangerous \"tripartite military alliance\" while crying out for \"strengthened international cooperation\" and \"close relationship\" of the U.S., Japan and south Korea under the pretext of non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the Lee Myung Bak group, who has indulged in reckless military provocations against the fellow countrymen in cooperation with the outsiders by kowtowing to them, are bringing the inter-Korean relations to a bankruptcy and further aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground for the \"annual security consultative meeting\", a criminal conspiracy mechanism of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers for aggression on the DPRK, to exist any longer in the era of independent reunification, the era of \"By our nation itself\".

This is an inevitable product of traitor Lee Myung Bak's pro-Japanese humiliating diplomacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson Wednesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have repeated this far-fetched assertion. Such moves are getting evermore pronounced after the islet has been known to be abundant in resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their ulterior intention to make the islet an object of international dispute by misleading public opinion through persistent assertion for Japan's claim to it and then usurp the islet when a chance presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this purpose, they are intensifying the education in Japan's \"dominium over Tok Islet\" so as to mobilize the younger generations in realizing Japan's ambition for reinvasion. Not content with such education only for high school students, they seek to give the same education to primary and middle school students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to renounce the unfeasible design for reinvasion and apologize for Japan's crimes committed against the Korean nation and take a step for reparation of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is at issue is that their reinvasion scheme to infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation is being pushed ahead in real earnest after the Lee Myung Bak's group came to power in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In February when the Japanese foreign ministry daringly posted on its homepage a document stating the Tok Islet is part of Japan's territory, Lee Myung Bak or the minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade of south Korea uttered no word about it, far from making any official statement. In April when he visited Japan, Lee called for \"future-oriented new era of cooperation,\" prattling that the past would not be put in question. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the facts show, Lee's \"pragmatic diplomacy\" is instigating the Japanese reactionaries to realize their wild ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though belatedly, Lee should apologize for the crimes he committed by selling off the dignity and sovereignty of the nation through his humiliating \"pragmatic\" diplomacy toward the U.S. and Japan, the commentary urges. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
