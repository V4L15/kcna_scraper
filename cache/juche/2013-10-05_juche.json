This is an uncivilized and immoral behavior hard to find in any part of in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye, a politician, must have known about it very well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should have opened her mouth, well aware of what consequences were to be entailed by her evil remarks rattling the nerves of the dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is unpardonable provocation and unbearable mockery of the DPRK that such depraved villains bereft of elementary common sense and etiquette in the inter-Korean relations are talking about \"courtesy,\" \"unreasonable behavior\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that Park and her group claimed as if they were trying to \"make efforts to build confidence step by step\" through dialogue and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Park has done after taking office is nothing but confrontation and war moves she has stepped up under the signboard of \"confidence\", deepening the mistrust between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than Park and her group who openly worked out the \"principal plan for the development of the south-north relations\" in which she scrapped the inter-Korean declarations, a landmark for reunification common to the nation, and officially declared the confrontation of the social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is again the puppet regime which insulted the DPRK by describing the operation in the Kaesong Industrial Zone, an offspring of the June 15 era, as someone's \"source of money making,\" and worked out a sinister scenario to introduce U.S. special force into the zone, making much fuss about the \"incident of detention,\" \"rescue of hostages.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the regime that scuttled the six rounds of the talks for reopening the Kaesong Industrial Zone, which were arranged by the positive efforts of the DPRK, by setting absurd preconditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime, obsessed with the confrontation with compatriots, checked the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang, a cooperative undertaking common to the Korean nation, under the pretext of banning \"source of money making\" of the DPRK. The regime went so brazen-faced enough as to describe the reunion of the separated families and relatives from the north and the south of Korea, that was arranged with much effort, as the fruition of south Korea's \"theory of principle\", abusing it for escalating the confrontation. The reunion, therefore, proved abortive.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war-like forces' moves to unleash a nuclear war against the DPRK, in particular, have reached an extremely reckless phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Madcap south Korea-U.S. joint nuclear war exercises targeting the DPRK are being staged in south Korea even at this moment and massive nuclear strike means, including a nuclear carrier of the U.S., are being transported through the sky, land and sea to be deployed in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days ago, south Korea and its American master held a military confab and worked out and officially announced the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" aimed at mounting preemptive nuclear attacks on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her regime only deepens the feelings of antagonism, confrontation and distrust through the racket for escalating stand-off and igniting a war, not building confidence step by step through dialogue and cooperation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the truth of the \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" about which the Park group talks a great deal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Decrying the stand clarified by the DPRK to adhere to the line of pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force simultaneously to cope with the increasing nuclear threat of the U.S., the group jabbered that \"the north should dismantle its nukes and opt for changes\" and \"the line is not helpful to the inhabitants in the north at all.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As fair-minded world public opinion unanimously recognizes, the DPRK's nukes serve as a treasured sword for protecting the destiny of the country and the nation from the U.S. threat of nuclear war and a national treasure for reunified Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for the DPRK to have had access to nukes and bolstered up them to protect its dignity and the security of the nation under the situation where the U.S. nuclear threat persists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the nuclear issue on the peninsula is to find a fair solution, it is necessary to defuse the U.S. nuclear threat which spawned the nuclear issue, force it to roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK and make its aggressor forces pull out of south Korea taking with them all nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the height of ridicule for Park and her group to take issue with the above-said line of the DPRK this or that way, bereft of any elementary common sense and reason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Demand of the international community\" touted by the puppet regime is nothing but the brigandish one of the U.S., its master. \"Trend of the times\" on its lips is no more than the anti-DPRK conspiratorial racket of such followers of the U.S. as the puppet group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group makes much fuss about somebody's \"changes\" whenever an opportunity presents itself. This is nothing but sheer sophism intended to force the DPRK to divert from the roads of independence, Songun and socialism and realize its scenario for aggression in league with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than Park and her group, servants of the U.S., who should face up to the trend of the times and come to their senses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is now driving the south Korean puppet group to use it as a shock force in the war of aggression, making it bound to the military alliance more tightly and placing it deep under \"nuclear umbrella\" in a bid to realize the scenario for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Poor, indeed, is the south Korean puppet group trying hard to please its U.S. master, ballyhooing about \"closer south Korea-U.S. alliance\", unaware of the serious harm done even to its heart by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park and her group would be well advised to mind their own business before talking nonsense about someone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are not willing to utter proper words in this bright world, they better shut their mouths.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group would be well advised to stop making reckless remarks, paying heed to the just criticism and proper warning made by the DPRK, though belatedly. They should behave themselves if they want to escape a miserable end."

It reported as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had she taken office as \"president\" than she dared slander the dignity and social system in the DPRK, blaring that the \"north should be led to abandon the line on simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force and to make a proper choice of change\", the statement said. It added that the army and people of the DPRK will invariably advance their own way to attain the goals set by them to build a prosperous country, by maintaining the line on simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Phoenix Satellite TV, Hong Kong, China reported as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the Policy Department of the DPRK NDC in a statement warned south Korea that it will be little short of digging its own grave if it gets hell-bent on forcing the DPRK to lay down nuclear weapons with an aim at overthrow of the social system in collusion with outsiders under the pretext of leading Pyongyang to \"change\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear weapons possessed by the army and people of the DPRK are powerful deterrence to prevent the nuclear disaster to be inflicted by the U.S. and a treasured sword common to the nation to defend the destiny of the country and the nation, it added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The content of the statement was also aired by Chinese Xinhua News Agency, South China Morning Post of Hong Kong, Voice of Russia, Ekho Moskvi Radio of Russia, Russian paper Moskovskiye Novosti, VOA, Kyodo, Tokyo Shimbun, AFP and the British newspaper Independent and several Russian internet websites."

            "content": "Nacion coreana recuerda 6 anos despues de publicada Declaracion de 4 de Octubre\r\nPyongyang, 5 de octubre (ACNC) -- En la Cumbre Norte-Sur, celebrada el 4 de octubre de hace ahora 6 anos en Pyongyang, fue aprobada la Declaracion para el Desarrollo de las Relaciones Norte-Sur, la Paz y la Prosperidad. \n\t\t\t\t\tEsto fue un acontecimiento historico que infundio un nuevo animo a la lucha nacional por la reunificacion de la patria y preparo el jalon por el cumplimiento de la causa del 15 de Junio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor la publicacion de la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre la era de reunificacion independiente acogio una nueva era dorada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde entonces, todos los coreanos en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar aceleraron con animo el movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria y hasta ahora recuerdan aquellos dias despues de publicado este programa comun de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe realizaron las charlas de politicos, economicos, culturales, artistas, academicos, etc. y los dialogos multifaceticos entre ambas partes coreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el Sur de Corea tuvieron lugar las actividades propagandisticas y culturales de apoyo a la historica Cumbre Norte-Sur de Pyongyang y a la publicacion de la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas direcciones nortena y surena de la Alianza Pannacional por la Reunificacion de la Patria y otras entidades del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar publicaron las declaraciones de apoyo a la declaracion mencionada y se levantaron para ejecutarla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe activaban cada dia mas las labores de reconciliacion y cooperacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, los medios surcoreanos publicaron los articulos como \"Hacia la era de la paz y prosperidad destruyendo la barrera de desconfianza\" y \"La Declaracion del 4 de Octubre abre nueva pagina de la paz de Peninsula Coreana\" estimando que \"se ha preparado la base para la paz de la Peninsula Coreana\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todas las partes del pais estremecian las aclamaciones de \"!Somos uno!\" y todos los integrantes de la nacion estaban esperando la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la banda traidora de Lee Myung Bak que conquisto el \"poder\" hablando de la necesidad de \"rescatar 10 anos perdidos\" nego totalmente la declaracion Norte-Sur desde el primer dia de su mandato. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCritico las declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur como \"producto de estrategia del Norte sobre el Sur de Corea\" e insistio en que \"hay que mantener con firmeza el principio en las relaciones intercoreanas aunque pase mucho tiempo\" y que \"es intolerable la reunificacion segun la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsulto el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\" como \"nacionalismo de estrecha vision\" y \"nacionalismo chovinista\" y disparateo que \"no se puede resolver con esto las relaciones Sur-Norte\". E impidio completamente los actos de reunificacion por la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien pusieron obstaculos artificiales en los actos de reunificacion de las entidades civiles presentando pretextos injustos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 15 de junio y el 4 de octubre de cada ano lanzo a los fulanos y menganos a la campana contra la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y llevo a la ruptura total todas las labores de cooperacion Norte-Sur por la coprosperidad nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas en actual mandato tambien llevan las relaciones intercoreanas a la fase catastrofica preconizando el \"enfrentamiento con dialogo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos 6 anos pasados despues de publicada la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre demuestran que los principios de relaciones intercoreanas y el punto de partida de la confianza estan en respetar y ejecutar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre que sintetizan la aspiracion y demanda de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa aspiracion de la nacion coreana a la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad no puede ser la victima de los vendepatrias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda de Park Geun-hye sigue impidiendo la corriente nacional con la confrontacion fratricida, como lo hicieron sus antecedentes, sera condenada severamente por la historia."
