This clearly indicates that Japan reveals its intention to take an active part in military operations against the DPRK.\r\n   The South Korean authorities openly tighten tie-up with the aggression forces of Japan, the sworn enemy, that engaged itself in all sorts of bloody massacres during its 40-odd-year-long occupation of Korea. Availing of this opportunity, the Japanese reactionaries bereft of reason are getting frantic in anti-DPRK campaign, looking with covetous eyes on a chance for reinvasion hourly.\r\n   More than once we spoke about the criminal and provocative nature of such dangerous tie-up, as well as the consequences arising therefrom.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean authorities do not want to precipitate their self-destruction, they should approach our warnings prudently. \r\n\r\n"

It is an unbearable, grave provocation against the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   He visited South Korea and showed up at Panmunjom, a theatre of north-south high-pitched tension, on January 7 in company with scores of suite members and South Korean Brasshats.\r\n   Commenting on the fact, the daily says his unusual inspection of panmunjom at the beginning of this year reminds one of dulles, a warmonger who came up to the 38th parallel as a special envoy of the U.S. President and examined the \"plan of northward advance\" in June 1950.\r\n   The South Korea trip of the Japanese military boss clearly showed the full preparations for reinvasion of Korea accelerated by the Japanese reactionaries along with the efforts for converting Japan into a military giant, the daily says, and continues:\r\n   It should go unnoticed that his South Korea trip was made at a time when the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean rulers were engaging in the fulfilment of the adventurous \"operation plan 5027.\" \r\n   His visit was a dangerous trip aimed at starting the U.S.-Japan-South Korea military chariot under the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK war plan.\r\n   As the U.S. imperialists, South Korean rulers and Japanese reactionaries are apparently  watching a chance to invade the DPRK, we can never remain a passive onlooker to their war preparations. \r\n\r\n"

On top of it, the South Korean rulers clamoured for \"sanctions\" after fabricating false incidents against the DPRK.\r\n   In an attempt to bar their U.S. masters from implementing the Geneva agreement, they are also actively taking part in the execution of the U.S. \"operation plan 5027\" for a second Korean war and are trying to unleash a nuclear war.\r\n   What they seek in  their scheme to block the radical solution to the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula is to step up the development of nuclear weapons under the \"nuclear umbrella\" provided by the united states and, furthermore, stifle the DPRK together with outsiders and attain their design for \"unification by northward invasion.\"\r\n   However, theirs is a foolish dream such as lifting the axe to-cut their own foot.\r\n   The South Korean rulers, together with their masters, will take responsibilities for serious consequences to be entailed by their reckless moves against the Geneva agreement and will be made to pay dearly for this. \r\n\r\n"
