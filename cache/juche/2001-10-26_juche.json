            "content": "Bush's remarks under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- Some time ago Bush told the lie that the U.S. wants to have dialogue with the DPRK, but the latter has not responded to it and said this or that about what the Korean people value more than their lives.\r\n Commenting on his remarks, Minju Joson (paper of government)today says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks prove that he does not know any elementary etiquette and has no common sense as a statesman, not to speak of a head of state. The DPRK, therefore, cannot but take a very serious view of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-U.S. relations have been cooled down again and the DPRK-U.S. dialogue came to a stalemate. All this is attributable to the vicious hostile policy of the Bush administration toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"resumption\" of the bilateral dialogue proposed by the bush administration in June is, in essence, a product of a sinister purpose to shift the responsibility for the rupture of dialogue onto the DPRK, not for the resumption of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. tries to disarm the DPRK, while persistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK, the DPRK is not interested in any dialogue and improvement of relations with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot remain a passive onlooker to the anti-DPRK behavior of the Bush administration which has no political sense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is an independent country where the leader, the party and the people form a harmonious whole. The people and army of the DPRK never tolerate any attempt to do harm to it. They hardly repress indignation at Bush's remarks. They are determined to make him pay dearly for his remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration should make a sincere apology to the Korean people for Bush's reckless remarks and adopt at least the same stand as taken by the preceding administration in its last period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only then will an atmosphere for unbiased DPRK-U.S. dialogue be created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will follow the future attitude of the bush administration.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on U.S. contradictory and shameless�@argument \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- The United States is insisting on its very contradictory and shameless argument about the issue of resuming the DPRK-U.S. dialogue.\r\n U.S. ambassador to South Korea Harvard in a seminar held on October 23 expressed his contradictory stand, when he once again clamored for the issue of the reduction of the conventional armed forces of the DPRK, while asserting that U.S. is ready to respond to the dialogue with the north without any precondition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explaining the reason, he argued that the DPRK's conventional armed forces are a threat to the U.S. forces present in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Was this prompted by his ignorance or a premeditated plot? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One cannot interpret this otherwise than a plot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's conventional armed forces are means for self-defence to defend peace from the reckless war moves of the U.S. and its followers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. proposed to discuss the issue of the reduction of armed forces for self-defence hardly acceptable to the other party which is technically at war with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is little short of provoking its dialogue partner in a bid to torpedo it after spreading the story that it proposed to resume the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks is to convince the international community that the DPRK-U.S. dialogue is not resumed because the DPRK refuses the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very trite method unbecoming for the U.S. styling itself a \"superpower\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's stand to develop relations with the U.S. too. But it is a serious miscalculation if the U.S. thinks the DPRK will accept the proposal for the dialogue aimed to disarm it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK explicitly states once again that it will further increase its capability for self-defence to wipe out the U.S. and its followers at one swoop if they dare ignite a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK's conventional armed forces are a threat to the U.S. forces present in South Korea, the problem will be solved when they pull out of South Korea. The half century-long history proves that the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea is a cancer-like threat to the peace on the Korean peninsula and the stability in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the typical U.S. gangster-like logic that its aggressor forces that keep half of the land of other country under its occupation are \"deterrent forces\" while the DPRK's forces for self-defence are a \"threat\" to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly understand that the DPRK is not a party that will accept such logic.    \r\n\r\n"

The falling water raises a great spray as it clashes against the rocks below. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The waterfalls, like many falls with multiple streams, show a peculiar and colourful scene blending in with the black rocks revealed between the streams, the clear lake under the falls and the surrounding forests in every season. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The area is garbed in azaleas in spring, green forests in summer and golden leaves in autumn. On clear days, water drops spring out, forming a rainbow by reflecting the sunlight. In winter, the falls are frozen but some streams continue to flow between the icicles. Water coming out from underground meets the cold air and turns into mist which forms into frost on the surrounding trees. It provides scenery rarely seen elsewhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The falls are protected as a living monument for their beauty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Above the falls is a pavilion, and nearby are camping sites where President Kim Il Sung stayed when he marched into the homeland leading the main force of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army in May Juche 28 (1939).    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Paper calls for strengthening military force \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article stresses the need to strengthen one's own military force. \r\n If a country has not its own powerful military force, its people cannot discharge their responsibility and role as an independent driving force for the revolution and construction nor preserve the Juche character and national identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent development of a country cannot be achieved without its own military force, the paper says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence of the popular masses is guaranteed by military force. Powerful military force is able to defend independence. The people with weak military force may be conquered by aggressor forces and reduced to slavery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no independence apart from military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Military force is also needed for defending the independence already achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present international situation makes it incumbent upon the revolutionary party and people to build up their own military force more firmly than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the end of the cold war the imperialists are resorting to arbitrariness in the international arena to model the world order to their pleasure. they use a military offensive if their brigandish demands are not met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the countries and nations which value independence should build military force strong enough to cope with any aggression by the imperialists. so do small countries. this is proven through a lesson of history and the present reality.\r\n Revolutionary parties and peoples and small nations should make every effort to have their own powerful military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, they should build and develop an independent national defence industry so that they may provide against any military situation on their own initiative and frustrate and defeat the imperialists' invasion with counter-attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, they should concentrate on developing science and technology, which helps arm their army and people with sophisticated weapons and defend the sovereignty of their country creditably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they should have powerful military means for defence and offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So justifiable are the DPRK policy of attaching importance to military affairs, the line and principle of building the self-defensive revolutionary armed forces and the Korean way of military counter-action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the revolutionary parties and peoples build powerful military force, the imperialists dare not commit aggression and war against them.    \r\n\r\n"
