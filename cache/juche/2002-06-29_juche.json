This is, therefore, the largest multi-national offensive naval maneuver in the pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RIMPAC-2002 is aimed to set several countries on the move to carry out the U.S. plan for a war of aggression and thus realize its ambition to dominate Asia by \"containing\" the DPRK and other independent countries in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It can not but arouse concern and vigilance among the international community as the exercise was launched at a time when the U.S. is loudmouthed about \"preemptive attacks\" on independent countries under the pretext of \"combating terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the exercise the U.S. seeks to round off the multi-national forces' combat capability and control system and make them serve its war purpose any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the keynote of the U.S. strategy for dominating Asia to put the whole of Korea under the U.S. control and use the peninsula as a springboard from which to realize its military domination over Asia. \r\n To this end, the U.S. is conducting ceaseless sabre-rattlings against the DPRK after deploying huge armed forces in Japan and in and around the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Regarding the Korean Peninsula as a main theatre of its military operation, the U.S. is keen to perfect its offensive operation scenario to invade the DPRK through \"RIMPAC\" mainly targeted against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation where the U.S. is escalating its moves for confrontation to contain the DPRK by \"strength\", while talking about \"dialogue\" with it, compels it to heighten vigilance against the moves and further increase its capacity for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The on-going exercise is bound to result in straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region and harassing global peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the trend of the times toward a peaceful world free from war, get rid of its cold war mentality and drop its reckless ambition to dominate the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
