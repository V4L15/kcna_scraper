This was a historical event that guaranteed the eternal future of the country and the nation, he said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t July 27 is a proud revolutionary holiday in which the DPRK beat back the formidable U.S. imperialism for the first time in the world history of wars and recorded the first page of great victory in the history of confrontation with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Fatherland Liberation War was an actually hard-fought battle for the just 2-year-old DPRK as it had to beat back the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces, and it was the fiercest revolutionary war in the world history of wars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was something beyond common sense for the DPRK with a short history of its regular army and weapons found insufficient and weak economic potentials to fight a modern war against the U.S. imperialists which became corpulent and fatty through aggression and plunder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the whole world was following the developments in Korea, holding its breath, President Kim Il Sung, an ever-victorious and iron-willed brilliant commander, expressed the resolute will to show the stamina of the Koreans to the enemies and aroused the entire army and all the people to the do-or-die battle against the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In hearty response to his speech \"Every Effort for the Victory of War\" aired over radio, the Korean army and people rose as one and waged a do-or-die battle to defeat the U.S. imperialist aggressors and created a legendary story about the victory in the war, going beyond the expectation of the world people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shining victory won by the Korean people in the war was a military miracle in the 20th century that put an end to the myth of the U.S. \"mightiness\" and made the beginning of final ruin of U.S. imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The feats of significance in the history of the nation and the world performed by the President, who led the war to victory and thus saved the destiny of the country and the nation and made undying contributions to the anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle and the cause of human emancipation, will shine for all ages with the victorious advance of the great Paektusan nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are now working hard to mount a reckless military attack on the DPRK, taken aback by its might getting stronger day by day as a world-level nuclear and rocket power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies keep to the \"theory of preemptive nuclear attack\" threatening their own lifeline, misjudging the strategic position of the DPRK, the invincible Paektusan army will mount the most telling preemptive nuclear attack on the heart of the American empire without any warning or advance notice, as it had already declared, and thus eliminate the U.S. from the surface of the earth and achieve the historic cause of the country's reunification without fail."
