While in the exercise, six commandos died. This fact eloquently shows how frantically the exercise was held.\r\n   Far from drawing a lesson from the past wrong confrontation policy, the present South Korean regime is rushing headlong along the road of confrontation and war against the north as its predecessor did. Its war rackets are little different from the \"civilian\"-veiled rulers' in their aspect and wildness.\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters must draw lessons from the disgraceful doom of the \"civilian\" warmaniacs and stop the war exercises against the north at once.\r\n   It is no use crying over spilt milk.\r\n   They must ponder over things before it is too late for regret.    \r\n \r\n"

In view of social life, the U.S. way of life is different from that of Asian countries. Asians and Americans are diametrically different from each other in race, customs and skin color, the article says, and goes on:\r\n   The U.S. is pursuing the policy of interference in the internal affairs of Asia, clamouring for its identification with Asian countries. Because the U.S. has the power of life and death over South Korea, its colony, and regards Japan as an ally under its control and \"an unsinkable aircraft carrier\".\r\n   The U.S. is trying to organise a \"band\" of some Asian countries with South Korea and Japan at core and become its conductor.\r\n   The U.S. is attaching importance to the Asia policy, caused by its internal factor.\r\n   Financial and economic crisis has recently swept Asia. \r\n   But the U.S. does not think that the strategic and economic status of Asia will be weakened in the future. This is why the U.S. is trying to realise its strategic interests in the region by disguising itself as \"An Asian country.\"\r\n   It is the U.S. strategic plan to establish a new order in Asia under the U.S. control and make Asian countries move according to its baton and will.\r\n   The U.S. argument is a reactionary U.S.-centered doctrine on domination over Asia.    Never can it be justifiable in any case. Nor can the U.S. ambition for domination over Asia be realised.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
