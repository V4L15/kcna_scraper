The Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported that conscientious men of the press in south Korea satirized this as preposterous.\r\n   Ri, a pressman of the Donga Ilbo newspaper in south Korea, said that it is only too natural that the press of the north sharply retaliated the Chosun Ilbo for its vicious slander of the north's system and added:\r\n   \"The authorities have described the anti-DPRK propaganda of the Chosun Ilbo as freedom of the press.

By doing so, they not only severely trample down the freedom of the press but also hinder unbiased information services.\r\n   Worse still, they have forced the press organs to distort facts, carry false reports and conduct black propaganda. Chosun Ilbo's editorial is a thing which proves this.\r\n   It is a crime against the freedom of the press and an illegal act which deprives the people of the right to know.   \r\n   It is an insult that Kim Young Sam, a fascist tyrant and a kingpin of repression of the press, has mentioned about the freedom of the press.\r\n   Kim Young Sam should make public the truth behind the anti-DPRK editorial carried by Chosun Ilbo by manipulating the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", apologize for it and step down.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
