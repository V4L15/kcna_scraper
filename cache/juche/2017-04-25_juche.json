            "content": "U.S.-led International Pressure Can Never Work on DPRK: Foreign Ministry Spokesman\r\nPyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA Tuesday as regards the fact that the U.S. is working hard to stoke the international atmosphere for pressurizing the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, the U.S. is seeking to gain public support at home and abroad for a newly worked out policy called \"maximum pressure and engagement\" in a bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Trump personally invited the delegates of the member states of the UN Security Council to the White House to discuss the issue of the DPRK. A closed-door briefing on the new policy toward the DPRK will be reportedly held in the White House for the senators in the presence of high-ranking officials including the State and Defense secretaries. Against this backdrop, the U.S. secretary of State is going to sponsor a ministerial meeting concerning the denuclearization of the DPRK at the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just a risky act little short of lighting the fuse of a total war under the present touch-and-go situation on the Korean peninsula as they openly cried out for ratcheting up pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy pursued by the U.S. to isolate and stifle the DPRK and the nuclear threat posed by the U.S. to the DPRK for more than half a century are the root cause of pushing the DPRK to have access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump administration has gone so ridiculous and foolhardy to devise the policy characterized by the \"maximum pressure and engagement\" without any elementary sense about the reality, far from recognizing the changed strategic position of the DPRK and the thousand-fold retaliatory will of its service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the U.S. has unsheathed a dagger to stifle the DPRK at any cost, the DPRK will stand against it with a sword of justice and cut the windpipe of the U.S. imperialists by dint of the strong revolutionary forces with the nuclear force, an almighty treasured sword, as their pivot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present reality helps the DPRK keenly realize once again that it was entirely just when it opted for bolstering the nuclear force both in quality and quantity under the uplifted banner of the great line of simultaneously developing the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a saying that those who are fond of playing with fire are destined to perish in the flames. The same can be said of the U.S."

Korean Authorities for Overlooking U.S. Biochemical War Plan\r\nPyongyang, April 25 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet authorities are overlooking the U.S. implementation of its plan for a biochemical war.\n\t\t\t\t\t These days the U.S. forces in south Korea announced that they brought experimental equipment for Jupiter Plan, a plan for a biochemical war against the north, to the U.S. military base in Pusan Port.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. criminal scenario to turn south Korea into a testing ground for its biochemical war and bring horrible disaster to the Korean nation is sparking off the bitterest anger of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Jupiter Plan pushed forward by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces is an extremely dangerous war scenario the keynote of which is to massively use biochemical weapons in the future war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the last Korean War, the U.S. imperialists indiscriminately massacred Korean people by using germ and chemical weapons although their use is banned internationally. The brutal killings and their terrible consequences are making all Koreans tremble with rage even now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists dropped germ-bombs over 700 times on more than 400 different places from late January to late March in 1952. Owing to the brutal germ and chemical warfare, more than 50 000 people lost their lives in the northern half of Korea alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean servants of devils actively align themselves with the brigandish U.S. moves to unhesitatingly exterminate the Korean nation to realize its ambition for world domination, far from protesting it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As made public already, there are more than 15 kinds of germs such as pest and botulinus to be used for the Jupiter Plan. In 2015 alone, the U.S. introduced active anthrax germs called \"white powder of horror\" 16 times into the U.S. military bases in south Korea to conduct germ weapon tests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Park Geun Hye group of traitors shielded the criminal act of the U.S., saying that the anthrax germs introduction was a \"mere mistake\" and that \"it is hard to term it a violation of the rules of the Status of Forces Agreement.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They even claimed \"it was a self-defensive act to cope with anthrax germ attack from the north.\" Not content with this, they asked the U.S. to update the Jupiter Plan, stunning the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group can never escape the severe punishment by history as they are frantic in the moves to exterminate the nation, after leaving the country as a testing ground for the U.S. nuclear and biochemical war, being hell-bent on escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from all walks of life and all other Koreans should never allow the pro-U.S. conservative group's such moves."
