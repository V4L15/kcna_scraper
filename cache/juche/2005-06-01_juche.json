            "content": "U.S. Projected Creation of \"Rapid Task Force\" under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 31 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush recently talked about the need to create a \"rapid task force\" capable of coping with the crisis in those countries that fight for freedom or to be free from dictatorship. He blustered that this force would be on stand-by so that it may rush to \"regions\" required for its substantial operations within days or weeks, not months or years.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday carries a signed commentary in this regard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"spread of freedom and democracy\" touted by the U.S. means the worldwide spread of the U.S. view on value and political mode, the commentary observes, and goes on: The proposed creation of the force is part of Washington's moves to put the theory of \"worldwide spread of freedom and democracy\" into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"spread of freedom and democracy\", the keynote of the foreign policy of the Bush administration, is nothing but an intention to escalate the \"war on terrorism\" worldwide and it is mainly targeting independent countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group dared brand those countries which go independent, disobedient to it, as \"rogue states\" and \"dangerous forces\". As if it were not enough with this, it labeled them \"outposts of tyranny\" in a desperate bid to seek regime changes there and bring down their systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush forces asserted that if they rise up for freedom, the U.S. will join them. This is an outright agitation for internal disturbance and coup and little short of a declaration of aggression to carry out military operation to bring down systems under the pretext of \"chaos\" or \"request for assistance\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being a detached force to bring down the systems in other countries, the above-mentioned force is mainly targeted against the independent countries and aimed to operate worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that its creation and intensified activities would disturb the world, inflicting greater misfortune and disaster upon the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite doubtless that the proposed force will primarily target against the DPRK, the commentary says, adding its army and people will keep themselves fully ready to go into action with high revolutionary vigilance against the U.S. evermore desperate and dangerous moves to bring down the system in the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He even went the lengths of uttering that the south Korea-U.S. alliance has made a substantial contribution to political and economic stability and progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard Minju Joson Tuesday in a signed commentary says that it is something unprecedented that U.S. high-ranking officials vied with each other to fault the south Korean authorities' use of the word \"independence\" at official meetings in a bid to press them to boost the alliance with the U.S. \r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, the U.S. has reduced south Korea to its colony under the unctuous name of \"alliance,\" wantonly infringing upon its sovereignty and imposing division, confrontation and war on the Korean nation. As a result, Korea was divided into the north and the south against its people's wishes and suffered the three year-long war disaster. The south Korean people underwent such tragedy as the massacre in Kwangju. Many young south Koreans are serving the U.S. as cannon fodder in shambles of U.S. war of aggression. This is the true nature of the U.S. loudmouthed \"alliance\" and \"contribution\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. persists in its military presence and colonial rule over south Korea, it will not be able to escape the nation-wide fierce anti-U.S. resistance but forced out of south Korea with disgrace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
