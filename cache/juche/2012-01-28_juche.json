Y los educandos tambien son los partidarios del \"poder\" de Lee Myung Bak como cabecillas del circulo militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El traidor Lee no tiene desde el principio ningun ideal ni la politica sobre la reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El nuevo curso de los traidores surcoreanos no persigue otro objetivo que tomar a la RPDC en virtud de su politica anti-reunificacion, lo cual no sucedera nunca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y pueblo coreanos se burlan de la camarilla surcoreana que suena con la \"reunificacion mediante la fusion de regimenes\" esperando la \"situacion de emergencia\" que no hubo ni acontecera en la RPDC."
