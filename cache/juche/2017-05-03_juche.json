            "content": "Commentary on DPRK-China Relations\r\nPyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- Kim Chol released a commentary on Wednesday, urging Chinese newspapers to refrain from making reckless remarks undermining the DPRK-China relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that a string of absurd and reckless remarks are now heard from China everyday only to render the present bad situation tenser, the commentary says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The People's Daily and the Global Times, widely known as media speaking for the official stand of the Chinese party and government, have recently carried commentaries asserting that the DPRK's access to nukes poses a threat to the national interests of China. They shifted the blame for the deteriorated relations between the DPRK and China onto the DPRK and raised lame excuses for the base acts of dancing to the tune of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those commentaries claimed that the DPRK poses a threat to \"the security in the northeastern region of China\" by conducting nuclear tests less than 100 km away from its border with China. They even talked rubbish that the DPRK strains the situation in Northeast Asia and \"offers the U.S. excuses for deploying more strategic assets\" in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with such paradox, the commentaries asserted that to remain averse to the DPRK's access to nukes is to preserve interests common to the U.S. and China, calling for slapping harsher sanctions against the DPRK in order to avert a war which would bring danger to China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The newspapers, even claiming China holds the initiative in handling the DPRK-China relations, made no scruple of letting out a string of provocative remarks urging the DPRK to choose one among such options if it doesn't want military confrontation with China--\"whether to face protracted isolation or to preserve national security by making a U-turn\" and whether to break Sino-DPRK friendship or to dismantle its nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is just a wanton violation of the independent and legitimate rights, dignity and supreme interests of the DPRK and, furthermore, constitutes an undisguised threat to an honest-minded neighboring country which has a long history and tradition of friendship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China is hyping up \"damage caused by the DPRK's nuclear tests\" in its three northeastern provinces. This only reveals the ulterior purpose sought by it, being displeased with the DPRK's rapid development of nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as \"violation of national interests\" oft-repeated by politicians and media persons of China is concerned, it is just the issue that the DPRK should rather talk much about.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just the DPRK whose strategic interests have been repeatedly violated due to insincerity and betrayal on the part of its partner, not China at all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some theorists of China are spouting a load of nonsense that the DPRK's access to nukes strains the situation in Northeast Asia and offers the U.S. an excuse for beefing up its strategic assets in the region. But the U.S. had activated its strategy for dominating Asia-Pacific long before the DPRK had access to nukes, and its primary target is just China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China should acknowledge in an honest manner that the DPRK has just contributed to protecting peace and security of China, foiling the U.S. scheme for aggression by waging a hard fight in the frontline of the showdown with the U.S. for more than seven decades, and thank the DPRK for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some ignorant politicians and media persons of China daringly assert that the traditional relations of the DPRK-China friendship were in line with the interests of each county in the past. They are advised to clearly understand the essence of history before opening their mouth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their call for not only slapping stricter sanctions but also not ruling out a military intervention if the DPRK refuses to abandon its nuclear program is no more than an extremely ego-driven theory based on big-power chauvinism that not only the strategic interests but also the dignity and vital rights of the DPRK should be sacrificed for the interests of China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One must clearly understand that the DPRK's line of access to nukes for the existence and development of the country can neither be changed nor shaken and that the DPRK will never beg for the maintenance of friendship with China, risking its nuclear program which is as precious as its own life, no matter how valuable the friendship is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, which has already become one of the most powerful nuclear weapons state, does not feel the need to think over how many options it has now.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China should no longer try to test the limits of the DPRK's patience but make proper strategic option, facing up to the situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t China had better ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by its reckless act of chopping down the pillar of the DPRK-China relations."

Now it is trumpeting \"it is an issue up to the next-term south Korean president\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a trite trick to calm down the daily-increasing south Koreans' struggle against THAAD and rebuff from the countries around Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. THAAD deployment in south Korea is, from every aspect, aimed at neutralizing Russia and China's ability for nuclear retaliatory strike and holding a hegemony in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the final decision on THAAD deployment last July, new confrontational structure has appeared in the region including the Korean peninsula, and conflict and tensions among powers have escalated with each passing day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea, in particular, is suffering from political and economic pressure from countries around it for the Park Geun Hye group's act of pursuing the THAAD deployment, and even it has been exposed to huge military threat as it has been designated as the first target of strike from the relevant countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upset by the persistent struggle of the south Koreans against THAAD, rebuff from neighboring countries and increasing regional and international denunciation, the U.S. is setting afloat such deceptive story like \"it is up to the next-term president\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, with no trick can the U.S. cover up its black-hearted intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At dawn on April 26 just a few days after its official announcement of the delay of the THAAD deployment, the U.S. deployed all of a sudden core hardware of THAAD in the designated place. This clearly proves once again that the U.S. is harasser and destroyer of peace, indifferent to regional stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the south Koreans who will suffer most from the THAAD deployment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The deputy director of the General Operational Bureau of the General Staff of the Russian Armed Forces on April 27 said the recent computer-aided simulation test showed that THAAD targets Russia and China, warning that \"Russia will be left with no option but to take countermeasure\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Re-clarifying the government's fixed stand over the THAAD issue, a media of China contended that merciless \"coordinated strike\" should be mounted on south Korea to let it realize how miserable the consequences of its act of siding with the U.S. THAAD deployment is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea can suffer great disaster any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is exactly for this reason that the south Koreans are raising voices denouncing the conservative group, saying that it is \"well known a fact that THAAD is for the U.S.\" and urging the south Korean conservative group to \"come to its senses, mindful of unrelenting punishment\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans should wage unflinching struggle to resolutely foil the despicable THAAD deployment pushed forward by the aggression-minded conservative forces pursuant to the U.S."

            "content": "Papers on Lesson of History in Movement for National Reunification\r\nPyongyang, May 3 (KCNA) -- Leading newspapers of the DPRK Wednesday carry an article dedicated to the 45th anniversary of President Kim Il Sung's clarification of the three principles of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The thorny path covered by the north-south relations and the protracted movement for national reunification teach a historical lesson that one can never realize the great cause of independent reunification ardently desired by all Koreans if one persists in depending on outsiders and kowtowing to them, the article says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south ties are plagued by an evil cycle of distrust and confrontation and a stumbling block is lying on the way to national reunification. This is entirely because the preceding rulers of south Korea were keen on sycophancy toward outsiders, blindly following them and cooperating with them to stifle the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is possible for all Koreans to achieve their genuine reconciliation and unity only when they thoroughly foil the confrontation moves of the anti-reunification separatists fostering antagonism and distrust among the compatriots. This is another important lesson drawn from the north-south relations that plunged into an evil cycle of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confrontation policy persistently pursued by the south Korean puppet conservative regime is an anti-reunification doctrine of confrontation between social systems hamstringing the efforts for great national unity, disturbing the improvement and development of the north-south ties and hindering the common prosperity of the nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another lesson of history is that the security of the nation will be imperiled and peaceful reunification will be impossible unless the uninterrupted north-targeted nuclear war moves of the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces are ended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The three principles of national reunification agreed upon and proclaimed by the north and the south clearly indicate the path ahead of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north, the south and abroad should turn out as one in the struggle to pave an avenue to independent reunification as indicated by the three principles of national reunification and thus write a new history of the nation-wide movement for reunification."

She even sold out her private house in Samsong-dong which had been used for a long period and was busy with employing a new lawyer.\n\t\t\t\t\t This is her sinister intention to reduce punishment by delaying time even a bit at any cost, Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that traitor Park's procrastination is unthinkable without the moves of the conservative forces seeking to come back to power, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park's impeachment, detention and the whole course of the forthcoming trial can be said to be a punishment on the puppet conservative group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Birds of a feather flock together.

Pero, la estrategia norteamericana de dominio sobre la region de Asia-Pacifico se inicio ya antes de que la RPDC contara con armas nucleares, tomando como blanco principal a China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebidamente, China merece expresar agradecimiento a la RPDC reconociendo con sinceridad el hecho de que ella contribuyo a la defensa de la paz y seguridad del continente chino frustrando el intento de agresion de EE.UU mediante la enconada lucha de mas de 70 anos en la primera linea de la confrontacion antiyanqui. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnos estupidos politicos y hombres de prensa de China disparatean atrevidamente que las relaciones tradicionales de amistad Corea-China convinieron a los intereses de ambos paises en aquel tiempo. Ellos tienen que hablar con la correcta comprension sobre la esencia de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDicen que si la RPDC no renuncia las armas nucleares, no vacilaran en ejercerle duras sanciones economicas y cometer hasta la intervencion militar, lo cual no pasa de ser una arrogante logica chovinista de gran potencia, segun la cual para los intereses de China deben ser sacrificados debidamente no solo los intereses estrategicos, sino tambien la dignidad y derecho a la existencia de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie puede cambiar ni modificar la linea de posesion nuclear de la RPDC indispensable para la existencia y el desarrollo del Estado. Y por muy preciosa que sea la amistad Corea-China, la RPDC nunca la mendigara intercambiandola con las armas nucleares consideradas como la vida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, convertida ya en la potencia nuclear, no tiene la necesidad de rediscutir que son varios sus opciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChina no debe tratar de examinar el limite de nuestra  paciencia, sino tiene que tomar la justa opcion estrategica viendo con serenidad la realidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChina debe reflexionar de las consecuencias graves que se produciran por su imprudencia actual que derriba el pilar de las relaciones Corea-China."
