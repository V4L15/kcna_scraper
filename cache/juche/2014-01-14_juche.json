It plays the role of the Korean People's Army's wing, which is to defend the home front in cooperation with the KPA or independently from the enemy's attack in the event of emergency while conducting socialist construction in peacetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Red Guards, involving workers, peasants, working intellectuals and all other civilians, has performed admirable feats in socialist construction and defence of the country and in the showdown with the U.S.-led imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Deeply aware of the truth that the country should be defended with arms, the civilians of the DPRK have striven to grasp the idea of giving priority to arms and the Juche-based war tactics of the WPK and improve their marksmanship under the slogan of \"Rifle in one hand and hammer or sickle in the other!\", though they have been busy with production and construction. They, together with the KPA, smashed the enemies' every move for a war, laying solid foundations for building a thriving nation during the Arduous March, the forced march.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Worker-Peasant Red Guards developed into invincible force commanded by leader Kim Jong Il with strong military discipline. Its might was clearly displayed through the military parades celebrating the 60th, 63rd and 65th anniversaries of the DPRK and on other occasions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is now growing stronger as a Juche-based militia under the guidance of Kim Jong Un, supreme commander of the Korean People's Army."
