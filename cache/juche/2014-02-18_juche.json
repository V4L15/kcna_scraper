The U.S. is busying itself doing so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun on Tuesday observes in an article in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. seeks is to set up the Asian version of NATO and, on its basis, dominate the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past period the U.S. had made alliance with some forces following it in the Asia-Pacific region while laying stress on Europe only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It considers that it cannot dominate the region, Northeast Asia in particular, through such alliance. So, it is trying to fake up an integral military bloc to contain big powers in the region. The core of the scenario is to round off the bilateral alliance between the U.S. and south Korea and between the U.S. and Japan as a triangular military alliance and develop it into a multinational military alliance comprising Australia, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that the Asian version of NATO is an aggressive military bloc for realizing the U.S. Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is which is the primary target of attack of this Asian version of NATO. It is the DPRK. The U.S. calculates that only when it puts the Korean peninsula under its control, can it contain neighboring big powers with the peninsula as a springboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a new aggressive military bloc is knocked into shape with the huge U.S. forces as an axis in the region, arms race, confrontation, military conflict and war in the region will be inevitable."
