            "content": "KCNA on U.S. deceptive call for \"dialogue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 5 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell reportedly told at a joint press conference on Feb. 25 that the United States \"would continue to pursue dialogue and negotiations with North Korea.\" This admits of no argument as it was a repetition of the call for \"dialogue\" made by U.S. President Bush during his recent South Korea junket. However, the DPRK cannot but reclarify its principled stand because this is frequently heard from among U.S. diplomatic authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, the DPRK's position is to resume the dialogue for the improved bilateral relations on the basis of the Bush administration's respect for the agreement reached between the DPRK and the preceding U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, the Bush administration is more desperately pursuing its hostile policy toward the DPRK, far from respecting the bilateral agreement. worse still, it has made such remarks as denying the political system of the DPRK. This situation has caused the DPRK to lose any confidence in the U.S. and any justification to negotiate with the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's stand on dialogue is to get its political system recognized by the U.S., not to allow itself to be disarmed or abandon its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the DPRK made clear its stand that it can never respond to any \"dialogue\" called for by the Bush administration seeking a pretext for invasion while refusing to recognize the DPRK's system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This position is neither \"brinkmanship\" claimed by the U.S. side nor a \"prelude\" to dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. argument about \"dialogue\" is, in a word, nothing but a camouflaged \"big stick\" logic and the Trojan Horse Tactics against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his South Korea visit, Bush revealed a criminal intention to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and contain it by force, describing it as \"most dangerous regime\". This is clear evidence proving the deceptive nature of their call for \"dialogue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His call for \"dialogue\" is aimed to quell the mounting anti-U.S. sentiment of the South Korean people and the condemnation of the world public, triggered off by his war moves. It is also motivated by his insidious intention to disarm the DPRK while using \"dialogue\" as a lever of pressure upon it and unleash a war against it when an opportunity presents itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no guarantee that such call will not lead to an outbreak of war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will keep itself fully ready to fight the U.S. out.     \r\n\r\n"

Very pleased to hear that, the president repeatedly praised her. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He even spared time to have a photograph taken with her and other officials against the background of the chick house. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On May 10, Juche 47 (1958) he took the tribune of a mass rally held on Hyesan square during his on-site guidance to Ryanggang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Two first-year girls of the primary school presented him with bouquets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After making his speech he invited the two girls to get on his car.
