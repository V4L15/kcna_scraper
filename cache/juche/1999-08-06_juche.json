This shows that they are determined not to tolerate such deeds any longer but put an end to the pro-U.S. flunkeyist and treacherous politics of the Kim Dae Jung regime. \r\n \r\n"

Meanwhile they are stockpiling a great amount of nuclear materials, disregarding the worldwide protest and denunciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These facts clearly show that Japan's aggressive design for domination over the world will remain unchanged forever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our planet will face a nuclear scourge anytime by Japan, which has neither honestly apologized nor repented of its past bloody history.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The appeal stressed the need for the world youth and students to further strengthen the international unity and solidarity in the just struggle to decisively smash Japan's ambition for reinvasion and defend the peace and security of Asia and the rest of the world so as to build a new world without the imperialist aggression forces. \r\n\r\n"

It is growing stronger than ever before with the approach of the August 15 grand pan-national pro-reunification festival, which will demonstrate the spirit of independence of the nation and the might of its great unity. Nevertheless, the South Korean authorities are throwing a wet blanket over the desire of the fellow countrymen for national reunification with intensified anti-DPRK confrontation moves and arms buildup and bringing the situation to a brink of a war by staging frantic war exercises targeted at the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Having dropped even the fallacy of \"threat from the north,\" the South Korean authorities do not bother to disclose their criminal intention to attack the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is the true colors of the South Korean ruling quarters going under the mask of \"people.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are well advised to behave with discretion.

This is another undisguised challenge and provocation to the DPRK, the commentary observes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK's launch of a satellite has been universally recognized and the threat to regional security comes not from the DPRK but from Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHaving developed and test-fired various types of missiles long ago, Japan is now running wild to deploy even the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, no one can predict when and where missiles will come from Japan. The Japanese reactionaries'  ambition for overseas aggression has reached a climax. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is their aim to occupy Korea and, afterwards, invade other Asian countries with Korea as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their loudmouthed \"north Korean missile launch\" and \"its threat to regional security\" are nothing but an insidious ruse to find an excuse to launch the reinvasion of Korea.   Japan is the sworn enemy of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has so many things to settle with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Once the Japanese reactionaries opt to stage a comeback to Korea, the DPRK will never pardon them. \r\n\r\n"

At the confab the U.S. and Japan reportedly agreed to work out programs for joint \"defense cooperation\" aimed at achieving  \"desired results\" as required by the updated \"U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The guidelines is a document of war against the DPRK by the U.S. and Japan and its effectiveness means \"successful launch\" of their aggressive war against the DPRK.

In opposition to it, South Korean moviemen, the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, the Citizens' Solidarity for Democratic Society and other dissident organizations, more than 30 in all, have been in an anti-U.S., anti-\"government\" struggle since mid-June. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers are about to drastically cut down even the days of South Korean film compulsory screening or totally abolish the compulsory screening system. This is part of the moves to obliterate the national culture and a treacherous act of benumbing man's consciousness and mental and cultural life and pushing the life of the moviemen to a blind corner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is entirely just and natural for moviemen and people of all social standings in South Korea to have risen in a powerful anti-U.S., anti-\"government\" struggle against the U.S. pressure to open a market to its films in a bid to make them ideological cripples and bring all sorts of misfortunes and disasters to them, and the authorities' servile obedience to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their staunch struggle will certainly culminate in putting an end to the colonial fascist rule of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities, firmly defending  the dignity and sovereignty of the nation and regaining the usurped culture and good manners and customs of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

On the contrary, it will compel the DPRK to further increase its capabilities to react to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We warn the U.S. once again that whether we launch a satellite or missile it belongs to our sovereign right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTherefore, no one has the right to fault it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. projects a \"military countermeasure\" at any cost, the DPRK will retaliate against it with a stronger countermeasure. \r\n\r\n"

The campaign is nothing but a despicable plot to tarnish the dignified image of the north at any cost and dampen the pro-north reunification sentiments running higher among the students and the people in South Korea with each passing day, it observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean Students Committee bitterly denounces the anti-north \"human rights\" campaign to be launched by the South Korean authorities through the government-sponsored student organizations as an intentional criminal act to incite antagonism against the fellow countrymen in the north and throw a wet blanket over the reconciliation and unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In fact, there can be no \"human rights\" issue in the Korean-style anthropocentric socialist society where the popular masses enjoy an independent and creative life as its masters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korea is the world's worst wasteland of human rights in which the most elementary rights and freedom of people are ruthlessly trampled down. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters are not only harshly suppressing the patriotic students and pro-reunification patriots in their just struggle for the independence and democratization of the society and national reunification but also making millions of workers jobless by enforcing murderous \"re-structuring\" and \"lay-off\", driving them to starvation and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The projected campaign is, therefore, nothing but a move to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and abroad and cover up their serious human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should be clearly mindful that their ever more frantic anti-communist, anti-north smear campaign will lash people at home and abroad into a greater fury. \r\n\r\n"
