Korean Puppet Forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 4 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces have stepped up confrontation moves against the DPRK over its legitimate satellite launch and nuclear test.

This fact once again proves how just the DPRK was when it had access to powerful nuclear deterrent for self-defence to cope with the hostile forces' increasing threat of aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's access to nuclear deterrent constitutes a great contribution not only to the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula but to the peace in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. Had the DPRK failed to bolster up war deterrent in every way to cope with the evermore undisguised new war moves of the U.S., a nuclear war would have broken out on the peninsula more than ten times and humankind would have undergone the same nuclear disasters as those in Hiroshima and Nagasaki.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's nuclear deterrent has been diversified and its performance has grown stronger than ever before. This serves as an iron fist for foiling the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces' military provocations and war moves against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the DPRK to decisively react to military pressure with an all-out action and a nuclear threat with nuclear deterrent for self-defence, concludes the article."

Security Council, while taking issue with its satellite launch for peaceful purposes and nuclear test for defending its sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were more than 2 000 nuclear tests and over 9 000 satellite launches in the UN history, but never has there been such a UNSC's resolution that banned any country from conducting a nuclear test and launching satellite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC's \"resolution on sanctions\" against the DPRK was an expression of serious prejudice and double-standard policy which go quite contrary to the international organ's mission to respect the sovereignty of its member states and ensure the world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UNSC should condemn the U.S. for its military confrontation policy extremely escalating the tension by threat of a nuclear attack, not blaming the DPRK, which is using the outer space for peaceful purposes in line with its legitimate right as a sovereign state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace-loving and progressive forces on the globe should conduct the solidarity movement for urging the U.S. to come out to negotiations to immediately defuse the tension on the Korean Peninsula mounting day by day due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, and sign a peace treaty with it."
