            "content": "KCNA on Japan's row over \"missile threat\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 31 (KCNA) -- The DPRK launched a satellite on Aug. 31 last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time its friends were unsparing in their praise of this while the hostile forces screamed with fright and raised a hue and cry over \"threat from North Korea\" in a bid to achieve their sinister political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Especially, the Japanese reactionaries created a terror-ridden atmosphere as if something very serious had happened, kicking up a row over \"missile threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the successful launch of our satellite, the Japanese reactionaries and venal media spread \"fear of missile\" all over Japan, groundlessly insisting that it was a missile launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their false propaganda continued even after KCNA released an official report on the satellite launch on Sept. 4 last year and the U.S., which had provided misinformation to Japan, recognized our satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the approach of the first anniversary of the launch of our satellite, they kicked off the similar row over \"relaunch of missile\" and, worse still, made a far-fetched assertion that \"neither missile launch nor satellite launch in North Korea can be allowed.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan which keeps mum about missile test-fire by the U.S. and other big powers makes so much ado about our missile and insists that we have no equal right to launch a satellite aimed at the peaceful research into the space. This sophism reveals the Japanese reactionaries' inherent double-dealing nature characterized by height of their servility and arrogance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries persistently argue that \"North Korea poses a serious threat to the security of Japan.\" This is nothing but a sheer fiction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 100-year-long history of the Korea-Japan relations has already clearly proved who is the assailant and who is the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As clarified by the recent DPRK government statement, Japan is the sworn enemy of the Korean people, who has not made any apology and compensation for his past crimes but has posed a constant threat to us by pursuing his policy to become a military power and his hostile policy towards the DPRK, watching for a chance of reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Clear are the aims sought by the Japanese reactionaries in kicking off an unprecedented row over our satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their first aim is  to brand the DPRK as \"a state posing a nuclear threat.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan, which had already joined the U.S. in raising a hue and cry over our \"nuclear issue,\" is going to bring the \"nuclear issue\" into bolder relief again through the row over the \"launch of missile,\" means of nuclear arms delivery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The second aim sought by them is to justify their anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK under the pretext of \"threat from North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their third aim is to realize their ambition to become a military power and nuclear power at an early date and strengthen \"cooperation\" with the U.S. and South Korea in a bid to thoroughly isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As proven by the reality, today the Japanese militarist forces are not simply blinded with their wild ambition, but have become dangerous aggressor forces, their design for overseas aggression entering the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has modernized its \"Self-Defense Forces\" with the world's second largest military spending and is in the process of legalizing the  right of belligerency and operation in pursuance of \"Japan-u.s. Defense cooperation guidelines.\" It has gone the length of working to revise the present \"peace constitution \" as a war constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these militarist moves of Japan have been pushed ahead with under the pretext of \"threat from North Korea\" since the cold war. In particular, they have been rapidly escalated for the last one year with the brigandish assertion that our satellite launch was a \"missile launch.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The frantic row based on sheer sophism about \"missile launch,\" \"missile relaunch\" and \"serious threat to the security of Japan\" was naturally prompted by a criminal intention to stifle the DPRK, a bulwark of peace and socialism, by force of arms, and use Korea as a bridgehead for its reinvasion of Asia and thus realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This frantic row of the Japanese reactionaries will only compel us to more fully exercise our inviolable sovereign right. If they dare provoke a war, we will not miss the opportunity to revenge upon the sworn enemy a hundred, nay thousand times. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has always harbored an ambition to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. occupation of South Korea for more than half a century is intended to attain its purpose to militarily stifle the DPRK. Therefore, our people cannot live in peace even a moment due to the U.S. ceaseless military blackmail and threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is now casting a darker shadow over the DPRK-U.S. relations on the pretext of the DPRK's non-existent \"missile threat.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The threat to the peace and security of northeast Asia comes not from the DPRK's missile but from the U.S. moves to provoke a new Korean war as well as from its actions to establish the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of development, production and deployment of missiles pertains to the sovereign right of the DPRK from A to Z. Moreover, under the present situation where the United States is increasing its military pressure upon the DPRK, the DPRK cannot but strengthen its self-defence capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK's principled stand towards the DPRK-U.S. relations remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States withdraws its forces from South Korea and refrains from military threat and economic sanctions against the DPRK, the latter will treat  the former with good faith and generosity. \r\n\r\n"

So, the festival became three-way solidarity rally of delegates from the north, south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Timed to coincide with the festival, a delegation of the South Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and its pro-reunification worker-football team visited Pyongyang and the latter had soccer games for reunification to make the festival more meaningful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grand festival was a great success every day with unique formulas and colourful events in conformity with the idea of independence and great unity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grand opening ceremony was held at the Kim Il Sung Stadium, where shouts of slogans \"national reunification\" and \"national independence\" reflecting aspiration of the nation shook it. It reminded people of a plaza of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Several pro-reunification events held in Panmunjom, symbol of division,  were an epitome of a reunified country which showed the Korean nation's will to achieve reunification of the country through national independence and great unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A congratulatory group of the Korean Children's Union on Panmunjom Hill ardently called upon the participants in the festival to use the word \"reunified country\" only when they will meet again at the next grand pro-reunification festival, touching the right chord in the hearts of the delegates from the north, south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The grand festival in August, indeed, demonstrated to the world once again the will of the fellow countrymen to certainly reunify the country with three-way unity of the Koreans in the north, south and overseas. \r\n\r\n"
