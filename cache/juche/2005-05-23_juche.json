In this regard Minju Joson Sunday in a signed commentary terms this a direct product of the U.S. policy of abusing human rights.\r\n Nothing is more intolerable insult to the personality of the Muslims and more unbearable encroachment upon their human rights than this profanation of their holy Korans, the commentary notes, and observes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Religious freedom is an elementary right granted to a human being. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" the United States arrested and imprisoned Muslims en masse and has inflicted all descriptions of mental and physical sufferings upon them.

This shows that the U.S. is harboring extreme antipathy towards the Muslims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the practice of the U.S. which advocates human rights, while talking about the \"religious freedom.\" The U.S. has no right to talk about\r\nhuman rights as it abhors Islam merely because it differs from its own religion and pursues national chauvinism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They shared understanding of the issues related to the cross- straits relations.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Sunday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a natural fruition of the policy pursued by the Communist Party of China for peaceful reunification on the principle of \"peaceful reunification, one country and two systems\" and a historic event, a result of the protracted arduous struggle of the party and government of China. \r\n The above-said party leaders' tours of the mainland constitute response to the sincere will and efforts of the party and the people of China to prevent the permanent division of the country and create an environment favorable for territorial integrity and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the Chinese party and government took important steps to legally guarantee and stipulate the country's reunification and sovereignty and territorial integrity, prevent \"Taiwan's independence\" and achieve the reunification of the whole country. The \"Anti-Cessation Law\"\r\nadopted at the Third Session of the Tenth National People's Congress of China is supported and approved by the Chinese at home and abroad as it reflects the unanimous wishes and will of all Chinese people.  The successful visits of the above-said opposition parties of Taiwan to the mainland deal heavy blows at \"the pro-Taiwan independence\" forces who pursue cessation and work hard to break the cross-straits ties, fanning up enmity towards the mainland and at the foreign forces who have unreasonably interfered in the internal affairs of China. These positive results go to prove the unshakable stand and will of the Chinese party and government to promote the peaceful reunification of the country and achieve the stability and progress of the cross-straits relations and will encourage the Chinese people in their struggle for the peaceful reunification in the days ahead.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Hit for Its False Propaganda \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists resort to false propaganda based on sheer lies against other countries in a bid to invent pretexts for aggression and military intervention. It is a vicious and crafty method for them to do so before aggression and war. Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the U.S. that it can avoid accusation and denunciation from the international community and achieve its aggressive aim with ease only when it tarnishes the images of those countries to be invaded by it, puts international pressure on them before invading them after building up world public opinion favorable to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time the work of the weapons inspection team in Iraq came to a close with no results, clearly proving that there is no WMD there. This irrefutably proves that the story about Iraq's \"possession of WMD\" floated by the U.S. as a justification for launching the Iraqi war was a sheer lie and it was deliberately faked up and spread by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively brought its aggression forces and modern military hardware to south Korea and its vicinity and staged ceaseless large-scale military exercises. Meanwhile, it has escalated the false propaganda and smear campaign against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is groundlessly pulling up the DPRK over its \"nuclear and missile issues\", \"human rights issue\", etc. in a desperate effort to invent a pretext for military aggression against it. This is proved by the fact that a recent issue of the Washington Post carried a shocking report that the U.S. government offered false information to south Korea, Japan and other countries that north Korea exported nuclear weapon grade substance to Libya in a bid to pressurize north Korea. Washington once asserted that north Korea was building \"underground nuclear facilities\" and they were posing a \"threat\" to the U.S. But this turned out to be a sheer fabrication, bringing it to shame. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important requirement for protecting world peace and security and defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation for each country to build up powerful military strength and deal heavy blows at the aggressors, keenly aware of the grave consequences to be entailed by the crafty and vicious false propaganda of the U.S. imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This only creates confusion in guessing the U.S. stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will continue to closely follow the U.S. attitude and its stand will be officially conveyed to the U.S. side through the contact channel in New York when an appropriate time comes.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Protection of Biodiversity in DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Various activities for the protection of biodiversity are being conducted in the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n A scientific and technological symposium on the protection of ecological and natural environment and the improvement of reserve management is being organized on the sidelines of the activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The symposium continues till August. It is divided into two sections, one for the protection of ecological and natural environment and the other for the improvement of reserve management and the protection of biodiversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The second section is discussing research achievements and experience gained in the establishment of reserves and their management system, valuation of actual biodiversity, the work for the protection and proliferation of animals which are rare, indigenous and at crisis and in the education and propaganda on the protection of ecological environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an interview with KCNA on the occasion of the International Day of Biodiversity (May 22), Vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Natural Conservation Union of the DPRK An Pyong So said that a campaign for the protection of biodiversity is conducted in the country every year amid the care of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the decision of the DPRK Cabinet adopted in April Juche 92 (2003), reserves have been subdivided into several hundreds. Among them are natural parks, natural reserves, reserves for migratory birds, districts for protecting natural monuments and districts for preserving historical relics, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to protect ecology, lots of trees are planted in the country during the tree-planting month and the periods of general mobilization for land management in the spring and autumn every year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many efforts have also been directed to the scientific research work for the proliferation of animals which are rare, indigenous and at crisis along with the activities of providing conditions for their protection and proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state has set months for the protection of useful animals and marine resources and for the prevention of forest fire and aroused all people to action for this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is strengthening education and propaganda for the protection of biodiversity and taking measures to increase exchange and cooperation with other countries in this field.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
