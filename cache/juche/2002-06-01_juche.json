Paektu.\" through these works they represented their faith that every February and April they greeted while serving tens of years-long terms in solitary prison cells, their hands and feet bound to chains, were springs of faith and will for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They began to learn how to draw paintings and make calligraphy to remain true to their idea, conscience and sense of obligation for scores of life in jail secluded from society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having no brush and paper, they had to put their fingers into water to write any letters on the floor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After their release from prison, they tried to draw and do calligraphy but nobody paid attention to them in the South Korean society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whatever painting and calligraphy they produced were not recognized as they lived under constant watch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not until they came into the care of the DPRK that they could improve their lot and keep their talents in full bloom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea provided them with all conditions and facilities so that they might draw paintings and produce calligraphy and saw to it that their works were displayed at national exhibitions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ages of the above-said former unconverted long-term prisoners average 72. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are active as members of the Korean painters union. \r\n"

It is the greatest honour and pleasure in my life to have enjoyed such extravaganza, he noted, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While seeing the performance I knew well that such excellence of human culture and arts can be created only under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yos Son, head of the delegation of the People's Party of Cambodia, said that the performance is the greatest masterpiece beyond human imagination. It is, indeed, a successful work truthfully representing Korea in the past tormented by ordeals and prospering Korea today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Valery Garev, head of the delegation of the Party of Communists of the Moldovan Republic, said that he felt as if he was in a dreamland each time performers presented a fascinating scene. Watching this performance one can know well how high the Korean people's artistic talents are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Claudio Campos, head of the delegation of the October 8 revolutionary movement of Brazil, had this to say: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performance \"Arirang\" can be created and staged only in the DPRK, a country of Juche. It really baffles human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a pity that I cannot find proper words enough to describe the scale and elegance of the performance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While seeing the \"Arirang\" performance, I deeply felt once again how great the immortal revolutionary exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung, the peerlessly great man in the 20th century, are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can match the might of the Korean people singleheartedly united around Kim Jong Il, the sun of the 21st century. \r\n"

They still seek to perpetuate the division and confrontation between Koreans. This requires the Korean nation to achieve the country's reunification only by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the lesson taught by the history that it is possible to attain the goal of the country's reunification only when the Koreans pool efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the June 15 joint declaration was an epoch-making event which marked a landmark for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the course of implementing the declaration is by no means a smooth sailing. obstructive moves of the U.S. are laying obstacles in the process of improving the inter-Korean relations and march for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the nation should harbor not a slightest illusion about U.S. imperialism but jointly react to the U.S. policy of domination over the Korean Peninsula and it is possible to preserve the June 15 joint declaration and achieve the country's reunification only through reconciliation and unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can break the national unity and hold in check the nationwide movement advancing under the banner of national independence and patriotism. \r\n"
