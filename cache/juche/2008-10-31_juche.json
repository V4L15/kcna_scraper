Korea\r\n Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The Joint Defense Panel of the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration in south Korea refuted the indictment of the puppet prosecution against members of the solidarity on Oct. 24.\n\t\t\t\t\t The panel recalled that on the same day the prosecution authorities detained and indicted four leading members of the organization by invoking the article \"charge of forming and joining in an organization benefiting the enemy\" of the \"National Security Law\", terming it suppression of them under the pretext of \"security\" going against the trend of the times as well as part of retaliation against candlelight actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It accused the prosecution authorities of labeling in their indictment the solidarity an \"enemy-benefiting organization aimed at praising and encouraging the north or sympathizing with it\" while branding all its activities as \"actions benefiting the enemy.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLurking behind this is a reactionary design to disturb and block national reconciliation and cooperation and bring to collapse the inter-Korean relations which have favorably developed since the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, it held, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prosecution authorities' act of cracking down upon the organization labeling its activities \"enemy-benefiting ones\" is an intolerable anachronistic action. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The panel stressed that in the future, it would thoroughly probe the conservative media's possible release of false reports after the prosecution authorities' suppression and take a positive action against it and, at the same time, disclose in the course of trial the injustice of the above-said suppression on the charge of violation of the NSL quite contrary to the trend of the times."
