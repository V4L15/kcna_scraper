They are poised to send their troops to dispute-torn areas in a bid to act an \"international gendarme\" and realise their ambition for overseas expansion by military means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese chief executive was reported to have asserted that the SDF may be dispatched overseas but \"they should refrain from using force.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing this as sheer sophism, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government took a measure of drastically easing the restrictions on the use of arms by Japan's forces overseas so that they may use all types of weapons.\r\n Before the SDF was limited to such non-combatant activities as logistic support and medical service. But now that these restrictions have been lifted, the SDF is allowed to participate in combat operations like forces of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' ambition for overseas aggression has not changed at all, the commentary notes, calling on the Asian and other people of the world to remain highly vigilant against the Japanese reactionaries' policy of overseas expansion and frustrate it.     \r\n\r\n"
