This cannot be construed otherwise than a premeditated move to realise their ambition to dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to hold up the process for reconciliation and reunification on the Korean peninsula by pursuing a hardline policy towards the DPRK and strain the situation there again in a bid to carry out their strategy to invade it. This is a vicious challenge to and anachronistic provocation against the desire of the Korean nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Bush administration should do as regards the Korean issue is to honestly implement the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, withdraw its aggressor forces from South Korea and take its hands off the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reactionary conservatives' moves against the DPRK and reunification have put into a danger Korea's reunification and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' moves to stop the process for reconciliation and reunification of the Korean nation under the absurd pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK should be checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists are allowed to keep Korea divided into two parts forever and seek their interests in it, the Korean nation will never achieve the reunification of the country nor escape from serious disasters.    \r\n\r\n"
