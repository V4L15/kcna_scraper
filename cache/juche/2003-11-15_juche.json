It is the observation at home and abroad that the main purpose of his junket is to pressurize the south Korean authorities to dispatch combat troops to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why America is so keen on south Korea's dispatch of troops to Iraq. GIs are killed almost every day by Iraqi resistance forces' anti-U.S. actions. The U.S., therefore, seeks to replace its troops by young south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. sinister intention to drive south Koreans as bullet shields and achieve its aim of aggression at the cost of their blood. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to define the main target of the struggle in order to fundamentally settle this issue. The issue of the troop dispatch is a product of the U.S. pressure. In order to block the additional troop dispatch to Iraq it is necessary to hold higher such anti-U.S. slogans as \"No U.S. pressure for additional troop dispatch\" and \"We oppose U.S., chiefly to blame for troop dispatch to Iraq.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should clearly speak for the people and express its resolute stand against the troop dispatch, away from its servile attitude of unconditionally meeting the U.S. demand. This alone would help them get people's support and save themselves from being censured as traitors in the future.     \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

Dismissing this as wrong, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary observes: \r\nThe most urgent task before it to settle the outstanding issue between the DPRK and Japan is not to solve the \"issue of abduction\" but redeem its past crimes. And herein lies a key to normalizing the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"issue of abduction\" cropped up in the long-standing abnormal relationship between the DPRK and Japan. This issue, however, was already settled by Koizumi's visit to Pyongyang and the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's singling out the solution to the \"issue of abduction\" as the basic guidelines of its diplomacy towards the DPRK can not be construed otherwise than a premeditated and deliberate act to lead the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan to an extreme phase of confrontation, indifferent to improving the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important for normalizing the relations between the two countries is for Japan to liquidate its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, Japan has gone without compensating for its past crimes though more than a half century has passed since its defeat in the war. On top of this, it is keen on downplaying, embellishing and justifying them. Such reckless acts only stoke the Koreans' bitterness towards Japan. The Korean people are greatly enraged by Japan's fickle attitude towards the issue of redressing its past when comparing it with the German approach toward the compensation for its past wrongs. Japan keeps complicating the issue which admits of no argument as it had already been settled, shelving the most essential and fundamental issues in the relations between the DPRK and Japan. This is little short of building a higher barrier between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attitude is not in line with the wishes of the two peoples for improved bilateral relations and may adversely affect not only the bilateral ties but the efforts to ensure peace and security in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a political framework for improving the DPRK-Japan relations, ie the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the two countries respect the declaration whose core item is Japan's liquidation of its past and sincerely implement it, they can smoothly improve their relations and bring about positive results.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts New Type Missile Deployment in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 14 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities announced that they would deploy at least 100 tactical ground-to-ground missiles with a 300 km firing range long enough to strike the whole of the DPRK within this year, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK.\r\n Those missiles manufactured by the U.S. Lockeed Martin Company are reportedly capable of striking the strategic targets including rear bases, munitions factories and communications facilities in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a very dangerous development as it would deteriorate the military situation on the Korean peninsula growing tenser due to the U.S. strategy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK which has entered the stage of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is, therefore, intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean war servants' frantic missile deployment for the U.S. war of aggression against the DPRK arouses the unanimous denunciation of all the Koreans as it is an anti-national and anti-peace criminal act of violating the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits serious attention is that the missile deployment is part of the U.S. arms buildup for a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. added 20-odd Longbow AH-64Ds capable of flying more than 370 km to a Apache battalion of the U.S. 6th armoured brigade in south Korea, according to its arms buildup plan. It also forward deployed all kinds of modern task forces including \"PAC-3\" in south Korea in a bid to finally round off its preparations for another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warhawks' missile deployment aimed to keep pace with the U.S. war preparations reflects their political aim to take the lead in executing the U.S. plan to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is no secret that the south Korean military has long cried out for an urgent need to boost the missile defence capacity under the absurd pretext of a missile attack from the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and south Korea even agreed to escalate the military moves to stifle the DPRK at the U.S.-south Korea meeting to discuss the policy on future alliance held on October 6. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The missiles being deployed against this political and military backdrop are entirely targeted against fellow countrymen in the north. Once they are tipped with U.S. nuclear warheads, Koreans will suffer a nuclear holocaust and all their territory will turn into debris. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes without saying that both the north and the south will fall victim to a nuclear war if it breaks out on the peninsula. \r\n The north builds up a deterrent force for self-defence to cope with the increasing nuclear threat from the U.S. The south Korean bellicose forces' moves for missile deployment, therefore, fundamentally differs from it in their mission and nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The destiny of the Korean nation is exposed to the greatest threat posed by the U.S. If the south Korean authorities go in for military standoff and war to serve the outsiders behind the scene of dialogue, exchange, reconciliation and cooperation, they will have to own full responsibility for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
