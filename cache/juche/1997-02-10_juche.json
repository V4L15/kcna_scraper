It is really a preposterous, brazen-faced charge.\r\n   It is well known a fact that Kim Young Sam, in a bid to brutally suppress the students' events, ordered the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" to victimize one or two riot policemen and blame students for their death.\r\n   The South Korean people will never tolerate the Kim Young Sam group, who have harshly suppressed workers calling for vital rights and democracy and penalized students taking the lead in the movement for national reunification.\r\n   They must promptly stop trying to stifle \"Hanchongryon\" and release the patriotic-minded students who were arrested on unreasonable charges. \r\n\r\n"

The tragic division of Korea is remaining because the U.S. is introducing a great number of troops and military equipment into South korea, interfering in the internal affairs of the Korean People and the present South Korean authorities  are resorting to the anti-national and anti-reunification policy, inciting overall confrontation with the north, in reliance on the U.S., he said, and continued:   \r\n   The three mainstays, three charters of Korea's reunification advanced by the President Kim Il Sung are the three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity, the proposal for founding the  Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo and the 10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation. \r\n   The imperialists and reactionaries are now frantically scheming to stifle people's Korea and realize \"unification by prevailing over communism\", considering the DPRK as a major obstacle in maintaining their control over the Asia- Pacific region. \r\n   The U.S. is undisguised in its political offensive, economic blockade and military provocations against the DPRK, with the result that a dangerous atmosphere of confrontation is always prevailing in the Korean Peninsula in which a war may break out any time.\r\n   The South Korean authorities are persistently arguing about \"threat from the north\", contending that \"the north-south issue can be settled only by military force\".  They are dreaming of \"unification by prevailing over communism\", taking advantage of the U.S. imperialists' Korea policy as the preceding military dictators did.\r\n   What attitude and position the U.S. takes towards the reunification of Korea and peace on the Korean Peninsula is important for affirmative solution of the Korean problem. \r\nThe U.S. has not yet accepted even the proposals of the DPRK for establishing a new peace mechanism to replace the old armistice system and for concluding a tentative agreement.\r\n   The reporter pointed to the solidarity activities of the committee and the direction of the solidarity movement this year.\r\n   The committee worked out and distributed bulletins, information and explanatory materials in the basic spirit elucidated in the 1996 action program and appeal early last year and played a coordinating role in encouraging organizations of friendship and solidarity with the Korean people to issue statements and press statements and conduct solidarity activities including demonstrations, lectures, signature campaigns,  he said and went on:\r\n   The solidarity activities this year should be oriented to organizing and developing the international solidarity campaign supporting Korea's reunification by means of confederacy, upholding the three mainstays, three charters of national reunification advanced by President Kim Il Sung, and to creating international opinion and putting pressure upon the U.S. to sign a tentative agreement with the DPRK and, furthermore, a complete peace agreement.\r\n   The international community should  put collective pressure on the U.S. to stop its interference in the internal affairs of Korea, withdraw its troops from South Korea and on the South Korean authorities to repeal the north-south closed-door policy and the \"national security law\" and remove the concrete  wall.\r\n   It needs to strengthen international support to the patriotic struggle of the workers, students and other people of South Korea. \r\n   The committee favours the decision and appeal of a joint meeting of DPRK political parties and organisations on making this \"a year of solidarity of the north, south and overseas for national independence and peace\" and will actively wage a campaign for solidarity with the nationwide struggle of the Korean people to this end.\r\n   Speeches were made and the 1997 action program of CILRECO was adopted at the meeting. \r\n\r\n"
