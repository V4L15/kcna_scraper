            "content": "Telephone message to chief of south side delegation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 18 (KCNA) -- Kim Ryong Song, head of the north side delegation to the north-south ministerial talks, today sent a telephone message to Hong Sun Yong, chief of the south side delegation, in connection with the fact that the authorities' talks due on Mt. Kumgang on October 19 will not be held as scheduled.\r\n Recalling that the south side repeated unreasonable assertions unacceptable to anyone while groundlessly taking issue with the sincerity of the north side, the message said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Your side suddenly \"discussed measures to cope with the movement of the north army\" and put the whole army and police on \"emergency alert\" one week before the exchange of the fourth visiting groups of separated families and relatives and the Seoul visit of the Taekwon-do exhibition team. This is quite contrary to the fundamental spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the points agreed upon at the fifth north-south ministerial talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, it is a hostile act toward our side that your side brought more air force from the U.S. under the pretext of filling up the \"military vacuum\" with the humanitarian visit just ahead, though your side talks about the importance of the \"issue of separated families.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Your side is hell-bent on distorting the fact through media in the wake of the unreasonable moves. This is a perfidy to the dialogue partner. It is designed to evade the responsibility for the present situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our side considers that the present difficulties created by your side should be removed as soon as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from this stand, our side demands your side immediately take steps to create circumstances and atmosphere acceptable to the dialogue partner by all forms of efforts if your side has a willingness to respect the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and make reconciliation and unity with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We assure you that if your side shows a positive response to this just demand of ours, we are ready to exchange the visiting groups of separated families and relatives and the Taekwon-do exhibition teams anytime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We also consider that talks, agreed upon between the two sides, should be held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the forthcoming north-south authorities' talks to pep up Mt. Kumgang tourism, your side should no longer obstruct the holding of the talks over the issue of their venue which is not in accord with the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Out of the stand to provide the progress of dialogue between the north and the south at any cost, our side proposes to hold the authorities' talks to pep up Mt. Kumgang tourism on October 25 because it is impossible to hold as scheduled the talks slated for October 19 on Mt. Kumgang. We also proposes to hold on Mt. Kumgang the 2nd meeting of the north-south committee for the promotion of economic cooperation on November 5 and the 6th north-south ministerial talks on October 28 as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We expect that your side will affirmatively respond to our reasonable proposal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
