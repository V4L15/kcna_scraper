            "content": "Kim Jong Un Visits Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace\r\nPyongyang, December 1 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, visited the Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace successfully remodeled as required by the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t Feasting his eyes on the Mangyongdae Schoolchildren's Palace, he said that the palace built to depict the care of the WPK under which the children live looked magnificent and very nice as its exterior was decorated with granite and high-quality building materials. The palace is the edifice which no other country can build or imitate and a monumental one demonstrating the advantageous socialist system in our country, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched President Kim Il Sung's autographic proposition newly displayed in its lobby.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the meaningful proposition reflecting the President's noble outlook on the rising generation, future and revolution was prominently displayed with due respect, he said that reading every jewel-like word of the proposition, one can keenly realize how deeply the President loved the children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the newly arranged room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room which houses revolutionary relics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The relics and mementoes that bear witness to the noble outlook of the President and leader Kim Jong Il on the younger generation and future are the precious treasures which should be handed down to posterity, he said, underscoring the need to effectively conduct the education of the officials, teachers and school youth and children through the immortal leadership exploits of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the palace built under the loving care of the great leaders has been remodeled as required by the new century, he said he felt his heart ache at the thought that how happy children would have been, if they had given the New Year's eve performance in the presence of the great leaders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round various places of the palace to learn in detail about its remodeling and preparations for its operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the science hall looked peculiar as it has a large relief Korean map and a model of a rocket for carrying satellite \"Unha-3\", etc, he praised the builders for successfully decorating the interior of the palace in such a way as to help school youth and children properly know about nature and geology of their country and nurture ambitious dreams and ideals to excel the world standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the palace is the comprehensive extracurricular education center for school youth and children of the country, he gave precious instructions which would serve as important guidelines for managing and operating the palace and took benevolent measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted that the remodeling of the palace was a very vast and difficult project, but the party spared nothing for it as it was an important one for preserving the bright smile and happiness of the children and their cheerful laughter meant hurrah for the final victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the palace has been successfully remodeled, he proposed holding an inaugural ceremony with splendor. He gave an instruction concerning its inauguration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Yang Gon, Ri Il Hwan, Jo Yong Won and Ma Won Chun."

Consequently, not a single day passes without bloody conflict and confrontation there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same is the case with Yemen, a country called \"paradise of Arab\" from the olden times for its favorable natural and geographical environment and rich natural resources.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yemen was deprived of its sovereignty by the U.S. policy of escalating \"war on terrorism\" aimed at interference in the internal affair and has long been torn with discord and conflict among religious sects and political factions.

It is more ridiculous for the U.S. to go reckless, unaware of who its rival is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have our own style socialist system centered on the popular masses which is envied by the world people and the single-minded unity of the army and people and the nuclear deterrence for self-defence which reliably protects everything valuable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. despicable \"human rights\" farce being staged in different parts of the world will fail with the bankruptcy of its foolish anti- DPRK \"human rights\" racket as a momentum."
