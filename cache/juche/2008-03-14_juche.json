            "content": "Moves for Stronger \"Triangular Military Alliance\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- The United States, Japan and south Korea at the recent fourth meeting of the \"security research consultative council\" adopted a \"declaration\" calling for setting up a mechanism called \"three-nation coordinating committee\" and building it into \"a new model of international cooperation among military forces\" and creating its \"working group\" made up of those who hold important posts in the military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, Minju Joson Thursday observes: The warmongers of the United States, Japan and south Korea were crafty enough to put forward research institutes and hold a confab on tightening their military collusion and nexus under their signboards. This indicates that they are putting spurs to the moves to reinforce the \"triangular military alliance\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to prove that the U.S. has long promoted the moves to create the \"triangular military alliance\" involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea, the news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"three-nation coordinating committee\" which the U.S., Japan and south Korea recently decided to knock into shape can be called an official signboard of the \"triangular military alliance\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is made the first target of the above-mentioned alliance. It is as clear as noonday that the creation of the above-said committee would make it possible for the warmongers of the U.S., Japanese and south Korean militaries to escalate the moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK in an evermore undisguised manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream for them to seize the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to ponder over the consequences to be entailed by the moves to reinforce the alliance and roll back its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are brandishing their swords to stage a comeback to Korea, pursuant to the above-said U.S. policy. This, however, is touching off bitterer hatred of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK for Japan. Those reactionaries should bear this in mind and stop their moves for reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warmongers would be well advised to behave themselves, well aware that they will be unable to escape a stern judgment for persisting in the military provocations against compatriots in collusion with their masters U.S. and Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But it has been systematically reinforcing its military forces in the Asian-Pacific region surrounding the Korean Peninsula in a bid to provoke a new Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Modernly armed U.S. forces, including nuclear-powered carriers, have been massively deployed in south Korea and Japan and other vicinities of the peninsula, and the war exercises against the DPRK staged frequently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. made it a fait accompli to provoke a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and has sped up the preparations for it. This was motivated by its scheme to invade the DPRK with south Korea as a springboard and, furthermore, conquer the Asian continent and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. war-thirsty forces seek to occupy the DPRK at a stretch with huge modern armed forces, including nukes, in case they unleash a war of aggression on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality hints that a nuclear war may be ignited on the Korean Peninsula at any time by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers should not act on impulse, clearly mindful that any nuclear threat does not work on the DPRK possessed of the strong war deterrent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Blasting him for asserting that the U.S. is under the heavy financial burden incurred by its war on terrorism in Iraq and Afghanistan and other areas, the statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces in south Korea are pushing forward the expansion of military bases and drill grounds in Phyongthaek, Kunsan, Mugon-ri and other places and forcing south Korea to cover the expenses for disposing of the scrapped ammunition and de-polluting the contaminated environment in the U.S. military bases that had been returned to south Korea. It is brazen-faced for the U.S. to pressurize south Korea to pay a stupendous amount of funds for the upkeep of its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The amount of the illicit fortune accumulated by the U.S. forces by use of the money they collected from the south Korean side till now under the pretext of sharing the funds for their upkeep exceeds that of the fund it should pay as its share for 2008, it deplored.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
