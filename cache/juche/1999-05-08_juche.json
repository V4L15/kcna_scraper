In order to develop contacts and dialogues between the north and the south the anti-reunification institutional devices in South Korea, including the \"security law\" and \"Intelligence Service\", should be removed and a new reunification-oriented phase of dialogue be created.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers, preoccupied with the anti-reunification divisionist moves regardless of reunification, are seeking  dialogue not for reunification  but for division and an anti-national dialogue for inciting antagonism and confrontation between fellow countrymen.   All Koreans at home and abroad should wage an active struggle against the criminal moves of the South Korean rulers to monopolize inter-Korean dialogue and use it for anti-reunification separatist purpose.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article calls for checking and foiling  the moves of the anti-reunification forces to suppress and obliterate the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) and the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils.

It is, therefore, beyond doubt that they will badly affect human civilization and world peace.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Yugoslav crisis eloquently proves that each country should have powerful self-reliant defence forces equipped with defensive and offensive means to creditably defend its sovereignty and national security.\r\n   Entirely justifiable is the policy of the Worker's Party of Korea on giving priority to the army, its line and principles of building self-reliant revolutionary armed forces and Korean-style military countermeasures.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary calls upon the world's progressive people to  discard fear and illusion about the United States and concentrate the anti-imperialist, anti-war struggle to defend peace on the U.S. \r\n\r\n"
