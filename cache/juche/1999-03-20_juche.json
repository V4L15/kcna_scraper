As a consequence, the withering Chinese characters and a mixed language are appearing again in \"formal papers,\" road markers and publications, and Korean culture is exposed to the cultural poisoning from the neighbouring countries, including Japan. the \"government\" is an outcome of pro-Japanese traitorous nature of the present chief executive of South Korea.\r\n   NDFSK considers the present rulers who play a role of shock brigade for reinvasion by the Japanese militarists, selling off Korean language, to be the worst traitors who put to shame the \"five traitors of \r\n   Pursuance of the policy of \"combined use of Chinese characters\" on the part of 1905\" who had traded off the country to the Japanese imperialists, and earnestly calls for an immediate drop of the \"policy\" aimed to nip the soul of the nation in the bud.\r\n   NDFSK and patriotic-minded people from all walks of life will turn to more powerful struggle to check the traitorous \"combined use of Chinese characters\" by the present \"government\" and preserve the Juche character of the Korean nation and defend its dignity.    \r\n\r\n"

Every year, the forests yield abundant wild fruits and a large quantity of timber.\r\n   The thick foliage provides an ideal habitat for wild animals and birds, especially pheasants and roe deer. This proves due credit to the villagers in their massive tree-planting campaign over several years. For the past three years, they raised 2,500 pheasants and let them fly away.\r\n   Further, the farmers have kept the eight-km-long waterway of the River Sujong in good shape and against any possible flood damage, and built a minor power station with due reward.\r\n   It has also straightened out the roads and built 300 modern dwellings. Every farmhouse has been encouraged to plant at least five fruit trees, and now the whole farm is a sea of fruit trees.\r\n   Land rezoning is also in full swing to adapt all the paddy and dry fields for use of machinery.\r\n   This achievement is all the more valuable as it has come over recent years of the \"arduous march.\" It is a praiseworthy result of the farmers' patriotism, self-reliance and fortitude.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
