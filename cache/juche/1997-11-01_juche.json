Korean inhabitant defects to north\r\n Pyongyang, November 1 (KCNA) -- Jong Min (46), an inhabitant of south Korea, came over to the northern half of the country some time ago.\r\n   Hailing from Mokpho city, south Jolla Province, he had the makings of artist. But he could not realize his hope for lack of money. He, therefore, had been engaged in business in Seoul, Japan and Australia.    \r\n   Before his defection, Jong conducted business activities in Ansan city, Kyonggi Province while active as member of the council of the city sports association and member of the \"National Congress for New Politics.\"\r\n   On the motive of his defection, he said:  \"Travelling ten odd countries on business and other missions, I felt that south Korea is a badly rotten and corrupted, veritable hell on earth.\"   \r\n   \"The prestige of the respected leader Kim Jong Il, who was elected General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, is precisely the prestige and authority of the Korean nation. \"I realized once again that the north which becomes an object of envy of the world progressives and is shining all over the world is the future of the nation and the land where everybody can enjoy a worthy life.\"    \r\n\r\n"
