It also verified the heat-resistance capability of warhead in the re-entry section and its flight stability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It provided a sure sci-tech guarantee for developing the system of strategic weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire was successfully conducted without giving any slightest effect to the security of surrounding countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Expressing great satisfaction over the test results, he said with joy that this happy news would give the conviction in sure victory and optimism to the army and people of the DPRK and that it is a great event as it strikingly demonstrated again the invincible might of Juche Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only the enemy but also the whole world may properly assess the capability of the DPRK's medium long-range strategic ballistic missile only with its flight track, he said, declaring with conviction: We have the sure capability to attack in an overall and practical way the Americans in the Pacific operation theatre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To reliably defend the security of the country and its people from the constant threats of the U.S and other hostile forces, we should have the powerful offensive means able to pose a constant threat to the enemy, he said, adding: It is needed to increase in a sustained way our preemptive nuclear attack capability and continue the study and development of diverse strategic attack weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The real foe our nuclear force has to confront is a nuclear war itself, he said, stressing that the nuclear attack capability should be steadily bolstered up to protect the country and its people and the Korean revolution from the U.S. imperialists' nuclear threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The current test-fire marked an important occasion in further strengthening the nuclear attack capacity of our state, he said, stressing the need to more thorougly establish the unitary leadership and management system over the strategic nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In congratulation of the successful test-fire of surface to surface medium long-range strategic ballistic missile Hwasong-10, he had a photo session with the defence science soldiers involved in the test-fire."

This was something abnormal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the U.S. which invented and orchestrated such absurd farce that contradicts the function of the UN secretary general and lacked impartiality and independence of the UN activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the main purpose sought by the U.S. to strangle a sovereign state at any cost even by cooking up UN Security Council \"resolution on sanctions\" and by employing all illegal and brigandish means and methods while finding fault with the right to self-defense and legitimate rights of the sovereign state recognized by international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the U.S. introduced all kinds of strategic assets to the Korean peninsula and areas around it, pushing the instable situation on the peninsula to an extreme phase and is getting all the more frantic in its racket for ratcheting up sanctions and pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves once again the justice of the line of simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are ready for both dialogue and physical measures and have in place everything necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to face up to the strategic position of the DPRK and the trend of the times and make a bold decision to roll back its anachronistic and hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. persists in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the latter will further bolster its nuclear deterrence for self-defence in quality and quantity and will continue to exercise its legitimate right to develop space for peaceful purposes no matter what others may say."

            "content": "MINREX critica carteo instigado por EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 23 de junio (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que Estados Unidos instigo al secretario general de la ONU a remitir una carta que niega el derecho de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea al lanzamiento de satelite artificial, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio el dia 23 a la ACNC la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC registro oficialmente a la ONU el satelite de observacion de la Tierra Kwangmyongsong-4 pasando por los tramites legales en virtud del convenio sobre el registro de los objetos lanzados al cosmos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho significa que el mundo reconocio que Kwangmyongsong-4 es un patrimonio que contribuye a la prosperidad comun de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el 15 de junio, el secretario general de la ONU envio una carta incoherente al presidente del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la misiva el escribio que \"fue registrado un objeto disparado por la RPDC al cosmos el 7 de febrero de 2016 e informado su resultado a los paises miembros de la ONU\", segun el convenio arriba mencionado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY continuo que \"este registro no pasa de ser un tramite tecnico correspondiente al convenio\" y \"transmite al Consejo de Seguridad el entendimiento de que no atribuye ninguna legitimidad ni justeza al susodicho lanzamiento de la RPDC\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFue orquestada por EE.UU. la presente farsa contradictoria al cargo de secretario general de la ONU y carente de imparcialidad y autonomia de las actividades de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl objetivo principal de EE.UU. es fabricar la \"resolucion de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU cuestionando el derecho a la autodefensa y los otros legitimos del Estado soberano, reconocidos por la ley internacional, y asfixiarlo a toda costa usando todos los medios y metodos ilegales y gangsteriles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, EE.UU. lleva al extremo la ya inestable situacion de la Peninsula Coreana volviendo a despachar sus medios estrategicos de todo tipo a la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y recrudece por otra parte la campana de sancion y aplastamiento contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La realidad vuelve a comprobar que justa es la linea optada por la RPDC de impulsar simultaneamente la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Estamos preparados tanto para el dialogo como para las medidas fisicas y disponemos de todo lo necesario para ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  EE.UU. debe justipreciar la posicion estrategica de la RPDC y la corriente de la tendencia y tomar la decision de cancelar su anacronica politica hostil contra ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Mientras se mantenga la politica hostil norteamericana, la RPDC consolidara mas en lo cualitativo y cuantitativo el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa y seguira ejerciendo, digan lo que digan otros, su legitimo derecho al desarrollo espacial con fines pacificos."
