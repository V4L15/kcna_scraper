This is an unpardonable anti-reunification fascist crime.\r\n   It is unreasonable for the authorities to suppress these organisations, branding them as \"pro-north\" and \"enemy-benefiting\" while calling for a grand festival with the north.\r\n   This shows the South Korean authorities pursue a sinister aim to disrupt the great event of the nation.\r\n   If they are truly interested in national reconciliation, unity and reunification, they must not squeeze into the August 15 grand pro-reunification festival and lay hurdles in its way. They must allow the participation of the south headquarters of Pomminryon and Hanchongryon in the festival, ensure them free activities, immediately release the members of the south headquarters of Pomminryon and all other patriots and stop branding these organisations as \"enemy-benefiting.\" at the same time, they must unconditionally repeal the worst \"National Security Law\" that incriminates any meeting between north and South Korean people.    \r\n\r\n"

The South Korean authorities must take immediate measures to stop slandering the dignified system of the north.\r\n   If they continue hurling mud at our system despite our warning, we will have to take strong countermeasures.\r\n   They must act with discretion, mindful of grave consequences of the anti-north campaign.\r\n   We will watch their future attitude.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

It also  reorganised the 5th Fleet with the Persian gulf region as its main theatre and is deploying it in Japan.\r\n   The air force has also been reorganised in the Asia-Pacific region where over 2,600 u.s. Strategic and tactical planes are deployed. It has been reinforced with planes of the latest type.\r\n   A surprise attack on the DPRK is the U.S. design of aggression which still remains unchanged. To this end the U.S. plans to call out the naval and air forces and, at the same time, land the marines in coordinated operation with the forces and let them join in a ground mobile warfare.\r\n   The U.S. plan is judged by the task of the mobile strike force which is being reorganised. The reorganised U.S. armed forces are often involved in military manoeuvres.\r\n   Especially, the U.S. has staged large-scale joint military manoeuvres \"RIMPAC\" in the heart of the pacific from July 6.\r\n   The U.S. Should stop reorganising its armed forces and pull its aggression forces out of South Korea and the Asia-Pacific region.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
