It serves as a powerful instrument for the development of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification can be accomplished only when the whole nation achieves unity, placing the common interests before anything else, given that differing ideas and systems exist in the north and south of Korea and neither side gives them up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Korea's reunification is not one of system and idea but one of relinking the blood ties of the nation and establishing its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole nation's concord and unity precisely mean the reunification of the country desired by the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great national unity is awfully needed for national independence against outsiders and the independent settlement of the reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important for great national unity to stick to the principle of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon the whole nation to work hard to reunify the country, rallied close under the patriotic banner of national reunification, irrespective of idea, system, political view and religious belief and the interests of classes and strata.    \r\n\r\n"
