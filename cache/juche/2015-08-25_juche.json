Korean Media for Cooking up Fabrications\r\nPyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a commentary lashes out at conservative media in south Korea for going busy with false propaganda against the DPRK by use of misinformation. \n\t\t\t\t\t Channel A and MBC recently spread groundless lies to tarnish the dignified social system of the DPRK and incite north-south confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a petty amount of money those despicable human scum of Channel A and MBC told rubbish about \"a decree\" in a bid to bitterly hurt the intense loyalty of the people in the DPRK. They even took issue with the rule of becoming health seekers of the Pyongyang Home for the Aged, uttering this or that. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is enraging everybody is that the south Korean puppet forces keen on money making dared take issue with the amazing reality of the DPRK, the commentary says, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their disgusting remarks are the major cause bedeviling the north-south relations and increasing danger of war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already warned the south Korean authorities of driving the north-south relations to the worst phase through anti-DPRK smear campaign and quasi media blindly following them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Journalists and anchor persons of Channel A and MBC agitating confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north and war had better stop recklessly wagging their tongues, properly understanding the strong will of the service personnel and people of the DPRK to take revenge upon them."
