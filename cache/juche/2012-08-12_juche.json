Korean Authorities Accused of Hurting Compatriots in London Olympics\r\n Pyongyang, August 12 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued information bulletin No. 1006 Saturday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of the bulletin reads as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 30th Olympics is under way in London, UK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Olympics is the sacred festival of humankind desirous of promoting friendship and unity among countries and nations and achieving peace and progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean regime of traitors only is resorting to mean and poor charade as slandering the DPRK and inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen even in London, quite contrary to the noble idea of Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime carried to London riff-raffs and human scum, a group of wicked men serving the policy of confrontation with the DPRK, and held a \"photo show on human rights in the north\" in a street of London from August 5.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They put up pictures and photos distorting and fabricating the reality of the DPRK and independent life of its people, saying \"they vividly show human rights performance in the north\" and \"they drew attention of London citizens and Olympic tourists.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The regime brought human rejects to the Olympics to escalate confrontation with the DPRK, not content with its attempted hideous terrorism for hurting the dignity of its supreme leadership. This is another grave politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK and an insult to the Olympic spirit desired by mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people are admiring at the high spirit and might of the country of Mt. Paektu which is emerging as a powerful and rich country under the leadership of the dear respected Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Witnessing the reality in the DPRK in which human idea is coming true despite imperialists' challenges, personages of various countries visiting the DPRK are deriding rat-like Lee Myung Bak for going intent on hurting the dignity of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the countries hostile toward the DPRK lavish praises on the successes made by DPRK players in Olympics who demonstrated the dignity and might of their country to the whole world while longing for their leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This meant a heavy blow to the Lee group who has worked hard to create the atmosphere of hostility toward compatriots through distortion and fabrication and render the situation extremely tense through reckless subversion and sabotage activities against the DPRK in a bid to mislead the public opinion and tide over strong protest of the south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of Olympics has recorded innumerable cases that stunned human beings. But never has there been such a disgusting group of confrontation maniacs and traitors as Lee group which slandered the fellow countrymen even in the Olympics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly shows once again that the Lee regime is the wicked enemy of the nation that perpetrates evil doings until it breathes its last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Trouble-makers should be removed immediately as they foster distrust and antagonism within the nation and invite confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK really meant it when it declared that it would wipe out those involved in hideous crimes and their backstage wire-pullers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime will be made to pay dearly for its despicable anti-DPRK smear campaign."

Owing to the confrontation moves of the Lee regime, the north-south relations plunged into a deadlock and big hurdles are lying in the way for cause of independence and peace and prosperity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean ruling quarters have an iota of idea for national reunification to meet the aspiration and demand of the Korean nation, they should think about dropping the anachronistic confrontation policy and implementing the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration, instead of getting concerned for \"Jar of Unification\" and \"financial resources for unification\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are trying to bring down the DPRK which has the single-minded unity of the army and people with such despicable \"Jar of Unification.\" It is a miscalculation and daydream. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's answer is clear as long as they are going desperate to hurt the DPRK, going against the trend of the times for independent reunification. The DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the traitors obsessed with confrontation of social systems with the united strength of the entire nation at home and abroad and surely achieve the historic wishes for national reunification."

However, the past four years in which confrontation policy was openly pursued by the anti-reunification forces drove the inter-Korean relations to collapse. This caused a U-turn in the situation at home and abroad and resulted in a wall rising higher in the way for peace and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now not only the north-south dialogue but NGO exchanges and cooperation have been stalled, creating tense situation of military conflicts in this land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present grave situation is attributable to the south Korean regime's denial of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and escalation of confrontation with fellow countrymen. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, no hurdles can ever check the nation's powerful advance toward reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A key to removing the danger of confrontation and war and opening up new era of peace and reunification is in respecting and implementing the north-south joint declarations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans at home and abroad!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us pool our efforts to open up the second June 15 era of reunification which is to be full of joy and emotion for reunification free from danger of a war!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let us unite close and open up a new horizon for national reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification under the banner of the north-south joint declarations!"
