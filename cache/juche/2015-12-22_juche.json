But after the investigation we invited a Canadian delegation as an exception and allowed its members to take part in the trial as observers and also let Rim contact a consulate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So the Canadian government has no legal justifications whatsoever to find fault with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government is obliged to make an apology for the hideous anti-DPRK crimes acknowledged by him and take steps for the prevention of the recurrence of similar case. However, it shielded Rim and pointed an accusing finger at the DPRK just like a thief crying \"Stop the thief\". We can never remain an on-looker to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Canadian side's unreasonable and uncouth response would only render the situation more complicated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the Korean people are demanding heavier punishment on Rim, hardly repressing their indignation at his crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should be understood that the law of the DPRK punishes whoever harbors hostile feelings toward the ideology and social system of the country and whoever is set to undermine them."
