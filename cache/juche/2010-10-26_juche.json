tunnels and the servicepersons' hall are preserved as they were in the past in Hamji Valley in the township of Hoechang where the CPV Command was located during the past Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung visited there on Oct. 19, 1951 and on various other occasions, laying down a strategic policy for the victory in the war and bringing about a new phase in the war in close cooperation with the CPV Command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Looking round various places in the site of the command where the traces of the wartime were clearly visible, Kim Jong Il recollected with deep emotion the unforgettable historic days when the army and people of the DPRK were waging the sacred war of resistance against the U.S., sharing life and death, weal and woe with the servicepersons of the CPV.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On October 25, 1950 when the Korean people were waging a hard-fought battle to beat back the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces, the Chinese party and government led by Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, dispatched to the Korean front the Chinese People's Volunteers organized with the best sons and daughters of the Chinese people under the banner of \"resisting America and aiding Korea, safeguarding the home and defending the motherland\", helping at the cost of blood the Korean people in their just struggle, he said, adding that this disinterested assistance, material and moral, given by the party and government of China to the Korean people even under so difficult conditions right after the founding of the PRC was a living example of proletarian internationalism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that a great many well-known and unsung fighters of the CPV including Hero Huang Jieguang who covered the muzzle of an enemy machine gun with his body on Sanggam Pass, ensuring his unit's victory in a battle and Mao Anying, son of Mao Zedong, dedicated their precious youth and lives on the Korean front without hesitation, he noted that though 60 years have passed since then, the army and people of the DPRK always remember the heroic feats performed by the fallen fighters of the CPV in their courageous battles, shedding blood in mountains and plains of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the historic responsibility and important mission common to the DPRK and China to properly hand down to posterity and develop the unbreakable DPRK-China friendship which was sealed in blood in the struggle for independence against imperialism and for socialism and which the leaders of the elder generation of the two countries bequeathed to the two peoples as a priceless treasure, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traditional DPRK-China friendship will last forever and remain shining generation after generation in line with the invariable will and desire of the parties, governments and peoples of the two countries, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast policy of the WPK and the DPRK government to further consolidate and develop the DPRK-China friendship which stood all tests and trials of history, he noted, expressing expectation and belief that all the servicepersons and people would set store by the traditional DPRK-China friendship and join the Chinese people in dynamically boosting the bilateral friendly and cooperative relations at a higher level."

Such absurd logic can never work in the world today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to stop deceiving the world and drop the criminal nuclear ambition."

            "content": "Living-body Test Perpetrated by US Dismissed\r\nPyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- It was disclosed by the U.S. media that in the 1940s the U.S. murderers under the mask of scientist conducted infection test on prisoners and detainees in lunatic asylum in Guatemala in a deliberate manner without getting approval by its government under the pretext of verifying the efficacy of an antibiotic against infectious pathogen. \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. by using even citizens of other country as guinea pigs in broad daylight under the signboard of \"treatment\" are heinous and barbarous crimes against humanity in utter disregard of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that the living-body test was organized and conducted by the U.S. government in a premeditated way, not by an individual American. This has brought to light the true colors of the U.S. as the heinous murderer and the worst human rights abuser.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the U.S., it is not qualified to talk about someone's human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. in which many people roam about the streets, not even their elementary rights to existence ensured and it is again the U.S. which is harassed by racial discrimination getting rampant and all sorts of crimes including killing and robbery occurring in an unbroken chain.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the aggressor and the worst state-sponsor of terrorism as it has wantonly violated the sovereignty and dignity of other countries and launched missiles and dropped bombs over women and children without hesitation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights abuses committed by the U.S. fully reveal the hypocritical and deceptive nature of the assertion about its oft-repeated \"defending human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how loudly the U.S. may trumpet about \"advocating human rights\", it can never cover its nature as the world's worst human rights abuser and enemy common to humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better honestly confess on its heinous human rights abuses and face a fair judgment of the international community before taking issue with someone's \"human rights\"."

            "content": "Wild Remarks of Puppet Army Chief of Staff Blasted\r\nPyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, puppet Army Chief of Staff Hwang Ui Don at an inspection of administration of the south Korean National Assembly asserted that the \"conception of 'principal enemy' has been internally used\" while daring list the DPRK's party, army and power as \"enemies\". \n\t\t\t\t\t Dismissing his remarks as bellicose outbursts, quite contrary to the trend of the times, Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary:  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known, the treacherous and anti-reunification theory of confrontation and war has long been thrown into the garbage ground, severely punished by history as it defined the compatriots as \"principal enemy.\" The rubbish theory of \"principal enemy\" let loose by Hwang this time has touched off the towering indignation of all the Koreans desirous of improved north-south relations and peaceful reunification as it incites confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers have cried out for \"dialogue\", but behind the scene they have become frantic in escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen, while trumpeting about the theory of \"principal enemy\". This has resulted in destroying the hard-won atmosphere of dialogue and pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula closer to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, war exercises against the DPRK have been recently staged in south Korea almost every day. A typical example is a large-scale joint air battle exercise that was staged in the air above the western part of the Korean Peninsula from October 15. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The PSI exercises the south Korean warmongers staged in the waters off Pusan and the combined anti-submarine exercises they waged with the U.S. imperialists in the West Sea of Korea were all targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts prove that such warmongers as Hwang Ui Don who are peddling the theory of \"principal enemy\" are a group of traitors as they push the inter-Korean relations to an uncontrollable catastrophe and the brink of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities have a willingness for improving the inter-Korean relations, they should give up the theory of \"principal enemy\" which goes against the trend of the times and stop at once the moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK, the commentary urges."

internacionalismo proletariado, siendo expresion viva de las relaciones de obligacion moral revolucionaria establecidas en el sendero de lucha conjunta antiimperialista, comenzo el orador y prosiguio:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los ejercitos y pueblos de Corea y China lucharon juntos con valentia y lograron la fulminante victoria en la Guerra de Liberacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t De esta manera, defendieron las preciosas conquistas de la revolucion de los dos paises y contribuyeron grandemente a la preservacion de la paz de Asia y el resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Aun despues del cese de fuego en Corea, los combatientes del cuerpo chino realizaron grandes proezas laborales participando activamente en la reconstruccion posbelica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La tradicion de amistad Corea-China preparada por el Presidente Kim Il Sung junto con los dirigentes de vieja generacion de China se desarrolla en la nueva etapa mas alta y acoge la era de plena prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El PTC y el gobierno de la RPDC tienen la firme e inconmovible orientacion de fortalecer mas la amistad Corea-China que supero toda clase de pruebas de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el futuro tambien, la RPDC apreciara mucho la tradicional amistad Corea-China y se esforzara activamente por desarrollar dinamicamente en el nivel mas alto las relaciones de amistad y cooperacion Corea-China junto con el pueblo chino.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy, bajo la correcta direccion del PCCh encabezado por el Secretario General Hu Jintao, el pueblo chino lucha energicamente por construir una armoniosa sociedad socialista basada en la concepcion cientifica de desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Deseo que en lo adelante tambien, el pueblo chino logre mayores exitos en la lucha por construir una sociedad socialista armoniosa y desarrollada en todos los aspectos y realizar la reunificacion de todo el pais bajo la direccion del PCCh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora, el ejecito y el pueblo de Corea acogen el periodo de nuevo viraje historico en el cumplimiento de la causa revolucionaria del Juche, la de construccion de la gran potencia prospera socialista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al luchar continua y dinamicamente uniendose monoliticamente en torno al PTC encabezado por el Dirigente Kim Jong Il, lograran un viraje decisivo en el desarrollo economico y la vida del pueblo y realizaran sin falta el proyecto de construccion de la gran potencia prospera presentado por el PTC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Es inconmovible la posicion de la RPDC de mejorar las relaciones Norte-Sur e impulsar la reunificacion de la patria basandose en la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Olvidadizos de la leccion sacada de la gran derrota sufrida en la pasada guerra coreana, EE.UU. y la banda traidora titere del Sur de Corea siguen recurriendo a las imprudentes maniobras para aplastar a la RPDC y acarrean el nubarron de la guerra de agresion sobre este territorio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si los enemigos desatan finalmente la guerra de agresion desafiando a la reiterada advertencia del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea y al rechazo de la sociedad internacional, la RPDC destruira por completo el bastion de los agresores utilizando toda la potencialidad militar incluido el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa, consolidada bajo la bandera del Songun, y construira una potencia reunificada y prospera en el territorio patrio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En el futuro tambien, bajo el invariable ideal de la politica exterior de independencia, paz y amistad, la RPDC desarrollara las relaciones de amistad y cooperacion con todos los paises del mundo que respetan la soberania de nuestro pais y los pueblos pacifistas y seguira luchando dinamicamente por preservar la paz y la estabilidad del mundo y cumplir la causa de independencia de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Le siguio en usar la palabra el coronel general Guo Boxiong, vicepresidente de la Comision Militar Central de la RPCh, quien dijo como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hace ahora 60 anos, el Cuerpo de Voluntarios del Pueblo Chino se lanzo sin vacilacion a los campos de combate para defender la justicia bajo la bandera de defensa de la paz y rechazo a la agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Junto con el Ejercito Popular de Corea, rechazo la agresion de los imperialistas y logro el gran triunfo de la guerra al cabo de dos anos y 9 meses de ensangrentadas batallas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta victoria significo un golpe duro a los agresores fanfarroneados y frustro el complot de los imperialistas de dominar todo el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Y defendio la paz y la seguridad de China y Corea y estimulo grandemente a los pueblos de todos los paises que luchaban heroicamente por la independencia nacional, la libertad y la liberacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Ademas hizo importante aporte historico a la aceleracion de la causa por la paz del mundo, la justicia de la humanidad y el progreso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cerca de tres millones de miembros del Cuerpo de Voluntarios y cientos de miles de habitantes participaron directamente en la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Numerosas personas derramaron su sangre en los combates y mas de 100 mil oficiales y soldados chinos ofrendaron su valiosa vida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No olvidamos nunca el precioso apoyo brindado al pueblo chino y al Cuerpo de Voluntarios por el Presidente Kim Il Sung y el pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El audaz Ejercito Popular de Corea lucho cooperando estrechamente con el Cuerpo de Voluntarios y muchos civiles coreanos apoyaron valientemente al frente aun bajo la lluvia de bombas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La amistad entre China y Corea fue preparada con sangre por los pueblos y ejercitos de los dos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La paz de hoy fue alcanzada a costa de sacrificio de los habitantes y militares de los dos paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Estamos contentos de que bajo la direccion del Secretario General Kim Jong Il y el Partido del Trabajo de Corea, el pueblo y el ejercito de Corea lograran incesantemente nuevos exitos en la causa para desarrollar la economia, mejorar la vida del pueblo y construir un Estado prospero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejercito y el pueblo de China dan continuos y nuevos pasos en su gran empresa de construir generalmente una sociedad elementalmente acomodada e impulsar el socialismo con peculiaridades chinas bajo la guia del Secretario General Hu Jintao y el PCCh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En esta nueva etapa historica, estamos convencidos de que bajo la profunda atencion del Secretario General Hu Jintao y el Secretario General             Kim Jong Il, se profundizara y se desarrollara constantemente de generacion en generacion la tradicional amistad China-Corea preparada y ampliada por el Presidente Mao Zedong, el Premier Zhou Enlai, el Presidente Kim Il Sung y otros lideres de veterana generacion de ambos paises."
