And they went the lengths of blocking the seminar in the end under the unreasonable pretext of the \"present situation of the inter-Korean relations\" and \"personal safety.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This behavior is a blatant challenge to the just struggle of the women in the north and the south to regain the dignity of the women which had been violated by the Japanese imperialists and boost the solidarity and alliance for national independence and the country's reunification.

Esto es descarada ambicion y norma de accion de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste imperio debe abandonar su artimana tendente a realizar el proposito malsano bajo la llamada \"amenaza de misiles\" de alguien."
