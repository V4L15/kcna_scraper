This was an event of particularly great significance in strengthening the party and carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il formulated the revolutionary idea of President Kim Il Sung as Kimilsungism and successfully accomplished the historic cause of proclaiming it as the supreme programme of the party to model the whole society on Kimilsungism. This helped the WPK underscore the revolutionary character as the party of Kim Il Sung which carried out party construction and activities as intended by Kim Il Sung only with Kimilsungism as the only guiding idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past four decades which the WPK has covered under the banner of imbuing the whole society with the monolithic idea represent a proud history in which the example of the times was set in the party ideological work and a precious treasure was provided in the ideological work to be held fast to by the WPK forever.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A success made in it is that a radical turn was brought about in the contents of the ideological work.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t New principle, system and method were established and powerful information and agitation means and forces provided.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The militant might of information and agitation was fully displayed in the socialist construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The system and method of the party ideological work and strong forces and foundation provided by Kim Jong Il serve as valuable legacy for the development of the ideological work of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undying exploits performed by him for the party ideological work have been steadfastly carried forward by supreme leader Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He formulated the revolutionary idea of the WPK as Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism and set it as the supreme programme of the party to model the whole society on Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.
