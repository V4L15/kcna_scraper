Conservative media including Chosun Ilbo, Choongang Ilbo and Dong-A Ilbo and government-controlled broadcasting services are kicking up \"a racket against the forces following the north\" by releasing misinformation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement called for judging the treacherous and anti-reunification sycophantic forces and getting the SL repealed without fail."
