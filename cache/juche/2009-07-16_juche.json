These moves cannot be construed otherwise than very ill-boding developments when their frantic moves to turn Japan into a military giant and launch reinvasion are taken into consideration. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article of the Constitution of Japan banning its participation in a war has become defunct, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the demise of the Cold War, the Japanese reactionaries have zealously pushed forward their moves to have in place offensive armed forces for reinvasion while openly disclosing their true militarist colors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the outset of the new century, in particular, Japan has frantically stepped up its moves for militarization under the strong backing and patronage of its U.S. master and escalated the overseas advance of the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces (SDF)\" and military operations in combat areas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, Japan has entered the stage of realizing space militarization, arousing great caution and concern of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries have paved a wide avenue for the \"SDF's\" overseas military operations by adopting a variety of war legislations under the spurious signboard of \"contribution to peace\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has designated overseas military operations as its state policy and, on this basis, busied itself infusing the militarist idea into the minds of the rising generation in a bid to hurl them into the actions to realize the wild ambition of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which the Japanese imperialists failed to do in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits particular attention in the above-said moves is that Japanese reactionaries are openly advocating the theory of \"preemptive attack\" and that of \"acquiring capability to attack enemy bases\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is ridiculous is the fact that the Japanese militarists are now raising a hue and cry over someone's \"military threat\" and making much ado about the \"threat to the security\" of Japan. All this is, however, nothing but rhetoric intended to cover up the aggressive nature and danger of its moves to turn itself into a military giant and those for overseas expansion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History goes to prove that Japan likes to launch a preemptive attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, the preemptive strike touted by Japan at present is bound to lead to self-destruction, warns the article."

This represents the unity of the pro-reunification democratic forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The brutal suppression of the progressive organizations in south Korea is little short of an unpardonable anti-reunification fascist offensive as it is aimed at branding all activities to achieve the concord of the nation and the country's reunification and co-prosperity by implementing the said declarations as \"illegal\" and \"enemy-benefiting\" ones and indiscriminately suppressing them and stamping out the movement for the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If these repressive actions are allowed to go on, not only the above-said organizations but all the progressive organizations of the reunification movement in south Korea will fall victim to the fascist crackdown at the point of bayonet and this will entail irrevocable grave consequences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only way out is for the pro-reunification democratic forces of various circles to decisively frustrate the fascist repressive offensive of the group of traitors going against the trend of the June 15 era of reunification by their concerted efforts."
