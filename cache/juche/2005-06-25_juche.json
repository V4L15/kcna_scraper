This is the repetition of the family evacuation din kicked up just before the U.S. launched the Korean war. Such a thing can be seen only on the eve of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another proof that the Korean war was not \"a sudden event\" for the U.S. is found in the fact that it had worked out beforehand a draft resolution on the invasion of the south by the north to be submitted to the United Nations. The U.S. lodged a complaint against the \"invasion of the south by the north Korean army\" as it had planned and dragged troops of 15 satellite states beside the south Korean forces into the war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The move of the U.S. forces in Japan on the eve of the war vividly unveils the true colors of those who provoked the Korean war. They busily ran about to leave nothing incomplete in the preparations for the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Robert, head of the U.S. military advisory group, who was dismissed from his post and called back home in the first half of June, 1950, at a press conference in San Francisco confessed that the story of north Korea's preparations for a war was an utterly groundless rumor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what jugglery the U.S. may try to cover up its true colors as the provoker of the Korean war, reversing black and white, it will not get it anywhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialist warhawks start another war of aggression in this land, oblivious of the lesson of their bitter defeat in the last Korean war, they will perish in its flame never to come back to life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n Pointing out that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" serves as a basis for achieving the great unity of the whole nation and realizing national cooperation, the article goes on:\r\n In order to win a decisive victory in the struggle of the Korean nation to protect peace, it is necessary to strengthen the driving force of the nation in every way. The master of the destiny of the nation is the nation itself and the nation is also capable of protecting its destiny. The might of the driving force of the nation lies in the unity of the whole nation. No force on earth can overpower the nation united to realize its common aspiration and will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" serves as a powerful spiritual weapon as it makes it possible for the Koreans to pool their will and efforts in the struggle against outsiders and aggression. The vitality of the idea lies in that it helps embrace and unite all the members of the nation who value and enshrine the soul of the nation and love the country and the nation, irrespective of ideology, social system, class and social strata.\r\n Only when all the fellow countrymen in the north, the south and overseas are firmly united as one, based on the noble idea of \"By our nation itself\", is it possible to significantly increase the might of national independence guaranteeing the victory in the struggle to protect peace and successfully carve out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should pool the patriotic aspiration and will under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" and thus decisively frustrate the criminal moves of foreign forces for aggression and war with the might of national cooperation and further glorify the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, the era of national independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
