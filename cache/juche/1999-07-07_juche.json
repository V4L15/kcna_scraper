It goes on:   On May 3, Juche 61 (1972), he received the South Korean delegate who came to Pyongyang to attend the inter-Korean high-level political talks and  made public the three principles of national reunification, which  he conceived and matured for a long time.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles of national reunification -- independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity -- were recognized  by the north and the south as a common reunification program  which was followed by the publication of the historic July 4 north-south joint statement the keynote of which is the principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the report to the sixth congress of the  Worker's Party of Korea in October Juche 69 (1980), the President set forth an important proposal for attaining the national reunification by the method of creating a confederal state  through the concerted efforts of the north and the south with different ideas and systems  left intact.  As the only most realistic one in Korea, the proposal on creating the DCRK mirrors most fairly the interests of the north and the south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the 5th session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly in April Juche 82 (1993), the President reiterated the  idea of the great national unity  which calls on all the Koreans to tangibly contribute to the national reunification and the prosperity of the reunified country, those with strength dedicating their strength, those with knowledge  contributing their knowledge and those with money  donating their money,  and put forward \"10-Point Program of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the second part the memorandum says the cause of President Kim Il Sung for the national reunification has now been creditably carried forward by the great leader Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\", a historic work he published  on August 4, Juche 86 (1997) on the 52nd anniversary of the liberation of the country, he defined as the three charters of national reunification the three principles of national reunification, the ten-point program of the great unity of the whole nation and the DCRK founding proposal, advanced by the President, thus setting up a strong pillar for reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On April 18 last year, he published the historic work \"Let Us Reunify the Country Independently and Peacefully through the Great Unity of the Entire Nation\", in which he proposed the five-point policy for great national unity -- adhering  to the principle of the national independence, uniting under the banner of patriotism and national reunification, improving the inter-Korean relations and struggling against outsiders' domination and anti-reunification forces, ensuring  travels, contacts and dialogues among all fellow countrymen and strengthening solidarity and alliance of the whole nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The five-point policy for great national unity is the great charter of national unity which evolved in depth the fatherly leader President Kim Il Sung's idea on great national unity in conformity with the requirements of new era.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, who is creditably carrying forward the respected President Kim Il Sung's instructions for national reunification, the DPRK government will do its utmost to bring earlier the independent and peaceful reunification of the country with the support and encouragement of governments and peoples  of all countries of the world loving peace and justice. \r\n\r\n"

This is a far-fetched argument to avoid the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nKim Sang Jin, 42, in Hwangju county, North Hwanghae Province, said:   I was rescued by the northerners when our fishing boat was drifted away at sea in June 1992.   I would have already been dead if there had been no help from northern brothers. In the north, I have been accorded hospitality as a human being.   I settled in the north of my own accord as I found  the socialist system in the north very good. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Shamelessly enough, the South Korean authorities are describing this as an \"abduction by the north\".   It is preposterous for the South Korean authorities to call for the \"exchange\" of the unconverted long-term prisoners desirous of returning to the north for the defectors who are not willing to go back to South Korea.   There is not a single man among the defectors living in various parts of the northern half of Korea, who is willing to go back to South Korea, he stated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSin Kyu Thak, 71, residing in Unryul county, South Hwanghae Province, said:   The South Korean authorities'  call for \"exchange\" is a foolish one intended to take to the south  by force those who defected to the north of their own accord.   I served in the 17th regiment of the 8th division of the army and joined the Korean People's Army in March 1951 to fight the enemy.Defectors from \"ROK army\" are not \"POWs\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should send back to the north all unconverted long-term prisoners who wish to come to the north, whether they are the north-origin prisoners or south-origin people. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Cohen's remarks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense Cohen recently said that the U.S. has \"war deterrent force strong enough\" to provide against emergency on the Korean peninsula, according to a report.   He also said that if the DPRK test-fires a missile again, \"it would complicate the four-way talks and the implementation of different agreements.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Cohen's remarks represent an impudent threat and foolish bravado of the aggressors and provocateurs, who have become extremely arrogant after the air raids on Yugoslavia as these are intended to spark a new war of aggression and justify it.\r\n   He took issue with our self-reliant revolutionary armed forces. However, the U.S. forces are really cancer-like ones who divided the Korean peninsula and are persistently increasing the danger of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was none other than the U.S. forces who instigated the recent armed conflict in the West Sea of Korea.   It is a sheer sophism that Cohen called the U.S. forces \"deterrent force of war.\"  And it is impudent interference and blackmail that he pulled up us over our missile issue.   We have already repeatedly declared that such things as missile development, production and test launch belong to our sovereignty and no one has the right to take issue with the rights of a sovereign state.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A few days ago, the U.S. openly announced its test launch of an inter-continental ballistic missile. Nevertheless, the U.S. is complaining about our missile test launch. Cohen's remarks show that the U.S. warmongers are so deep in vertigo of war that they cannot distinguish the Korean peninsula  from the Balkans.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. is truly interested in the four-way talks and the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement, it should not turn aside from the issue of replacing the armistice agreement with a peace agreement and the issue of withdrawal of its forces but, first of all, have a proper understanding of the DPRK and its self-reliant revolutionary armed forces.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Cohen's utterances that the U.S. is now \"fully ready\" betrayed his bellicose attempt to carry on the \"operation plan 5027-98\" at any cost and control the DPRK militarily.   We warn once again that we will punish  any provocateurs encroaching upon our national sovereignty, whoever they may be. \r\n \r\n"

Korean authorities' misuse of national songs\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary denouncing the South Korean rulers for their undisguised misuse of national songs.\r\n   Popular songs created and sung under the Japanese  colonial rule are withering away or misused by others in South Korea owing to the authorities' moves to stamp out national music.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that intelligent and talented Korean writers and composers created songs representing the miserable plight of the stateless people,  resentment at Japanese imperialism and love of the country, subjected to the harsh national humiliation and suppression by the Japanese imperialists,  the commentary observes.  They bear witness to the colonial history  and ordeals and, at the same time, represent a priceless national musical legacy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The successive South Korean ruling quarters, however, indiscriminately banned songs created and disseminated in the days of the Japanese colonial rule for the mere reason that most of them were created by writers and composers who came to the north after the country's liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nConsequently,  many songs created by Jo Ryong Chul, Pak Yong Ho, Ri Myon Sang and Kim Hae Song, which had been so popular in the teeth of harsh suppression by the Japanese imperialists, have disappeared. This is an offspring of the South Korean authorities' hostile policy toward the north and their moves to obliterate the national culture. It is another indelible crime committed by them against the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It must not go unnoticed that songs created and sung during the period of the nation's ordeals are being undisguisedly misused. \r\nNearly 1,000 songs including 500 songs written by Jo Ryong Chul have been misused by others due to swindles and frauds of the villains  who have neither ethical morality nor an iota of conscience. The missuses have been given a fabulous amount of  money for writing with the authorities' connivance.\r\n   The South Korean authorities' moves to obliterate and misuse enlightenment songs can never be tolerated. \r\n\r\n"
