            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Rocket Firing Drill of Strategic Force of KPA\r\n Pyongyang, July 27 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, guided a rocket firing drill of the strategic force of the KPA on the spot.\n\t\t\t\t\t The drill was staged on July 26, a day before the anniversary of the victory in the Fatherland Liberation War. It was conducted by a firepower strike unit of the strategic force of the KPA tasked to strike bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He examined a firing plan mapped out in consideration of the present location of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces' bases in south Korea and under the simulated conditions of the battle to strike and destroy them before guiding the drill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The drill proved the high combat capability of the firepower strike unit and the perfect performance of its tactical rockets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un expressed his great satisfaction over a series of successful drills of the strategic force, saying: \"Rocket test-fire drills were conducted many times recently to develop the Juche-based rocket science and technology and firing methods. As a result, the strategic force is fully ready to successfully carry out any firepower strike mission in modern warfare. The roar heard from today's firepower drill conducted to mark the war victory day is just like a thrilling gun report heralding the completion of the strategic force's combat preparations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing history can never be altered, concealed and cooked up, he recalled that the U.S. and the south Korean regime are staging a ridiculous charade of describing their past defeat in the war as \"victorious one\" through Obama's unjustifiable \"speech\" and Park Geun Hye's \"presidential memorial address\" made on the occasion of July 27, instead of drawing a lesson from their ignominious defeat in the past war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He declared:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Masters of the White House have been replaced by others since the 1950s. However, the U.S. harsh hostile policy toward the DPRK has not changed at all. It was the shameful tradition of the U.S. imperialists that they have sustained setbacks, hit hard in history, and it is the proud tradition of the DPRK that it has successfully foiled every reckless move pursued by the U.S., counting on its growing muscle. These law-governed two traditions will last forever in the future, too.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever dares challenge the just cause of the service personnel and people of the DPRK is bound to meet a final ruin, he stressed, calling for wiping out the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea and other forces following them on this land at an early date and accomplishing the historic cause of national reunification without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Hwang Pyong So, Ri Yong Gil, Yun Tong Hyon, Ri Pyong Chol, O Kum Chol and Pak Jong Chon."

Y enfatizo que estas dos tradiciones logicas e invariables continuaran en el futuro tambien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Acoto que sucumbiran todos los desafiadores a la justa causa del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea y asevero que debemos lograr sin falta la causa historica de la reunificacion de la patria tras aniquilar cuanto antes a las tropas agresoras norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y sus seguidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Le acompanaron Hwang Pyong So, Ri Yong Gil, Yun Tong Hyon, Ri Pyong Chol, O Kum Chol y Pak Jong Chon."
