This is the revelation of the intention to turn a war of aggression on the DPRK into a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The facts make us doubt whether the U.S. proposal for resumption of dialogue with the DPRK is a trick to get rid of the plight of being isolated within and without due to his aggressive nuclear war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not want improvement of relations with the United States while conceding its principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people's army and people of Korea are enraged by the U.S. double-dealing policy and are ready to counter a war any moment. \r\n   \r\n\r\n"
