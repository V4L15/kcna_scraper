Ri Sang Gol to the 15th anniversary of the publication of the famous work of Secretary Kim Jong Il \"On the Juche Idea\".\r\n   The work makes a comprehensive compilation of the precious ideological and theoretical exploits of Secretary Kim Jong Il in enriching and developing in depth the Juche idea, founded by President Kim Il Sung, with new principles and contents to suit the requirements of the present time and developing revolution, the article says, and goes on:\r\n   The Juche idea gives a perfect philosophical exposition of man by defining independence, creativity and consciousness as the essential features of man, a social being, considering man in  social relationship.\r\n   On the basis of this scientific exposition the Juche idea clarifies the philosophical principle that  man is the master of everything and decides everything.  The uniqueness of the Juche idea different from the preceding philosophy is found in elucidating the law governing the domination and transformation of the world by man and the fundamental way of carving out the destiny of the popular masses. \r\n   The Juche idea was founded by the practical requirement of the Korean revolution which took the untrodden road of the national and class liberation for the first time in the world. It has been developed and enriched in popularizing the practical experience of the Korean people in revolution for soveregnity, independence and socialism. \r\n   The Juche idea has become a revolutionary philosophy oriented to expounding the law of the social movement  and a powerful weapon of the revolutionary struggle with the main contents of the fundamental principle, viewpoint and methodology of revolution.\r\n   The Juche philosophy is the genuine philosophy of people which is linked with their destiny, life and struggle and which they regard as a weapon of their struggle as it was founded and developed on the basis of the idea of President Kim Il Sung \"the people are my god.\" \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n   Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Papers here today in commentaries denounce the south Korean puppets for staging war exercises against the north.\r\n   A few days ago, the puppets staged a large-scale marine exercise off the eastern coast of Korea, while conducting a \"joint exercise of civilians, government officials and  servicemen\" to cope with a possible limited chemical war started by the north.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun brands the frantic war exercises of the Kim Young Sam group as a deliberate and premeditated criminal move for destroying peace on the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation to the brink of war and as an open declaration of war against the north.\r\n   The puppets' reckless war drills are a product of their serious ruling crisis, the paper says, and goes on:\r\n   The puppet clique are in the position of a fish out of water for the retrogressive revision of fascist labour law, the largest-ever  Hanbo loan scandal, Kim Young Sam's son's meddling in power and other catastrophic incidents.\r\n   Their drills are aimed at diverting public criticism and escaping from the crisis. \r\n   Minju Joson notes that the Kim Young Sam group should look straight at the trend of the times, stop the war drills against the north and act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"
