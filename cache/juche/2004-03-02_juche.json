It was a patriotic uprising as it fully demonstrated the Korean people's staunch spirit of struggling for independence against outsiders and dealt a telling blow at the Japanese imperialist colonial rulers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nearly a century has passed since the uprising. This is a glorious history of the struggle for independence against foreign forces as the Koreans have waged a strenuous struggle to put an end to the outsiders' domination and their moves for aggression and build new Korea, reunified and free. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung is a peerless patriot as he embarked upon the road to save the nation's destiny in order to realize the nation's strong desire for sovereignty and independence and performed immortal exploits in the history of the nation through tireless energetic leadership and great devotion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national independence pioneered by Kim Il Sung is being inherited and carried out by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present generation has an urgent task to fulfill for the nation. They should put a definite end to the outsiders' aggression and interference and accomplish the cause of independent reunification, carrying forward the history and tradition of struggle for independence against outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's struggle for independence against outsiders is a nationwide patriotic struggle against the U.S. and Japan to resolutely smash the U.S. and Japanese aggression forces' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and pave a wide avenue for national reunification with high national self-respect, awareness of independence and the might of the concerted efforts of the Koreans. All the Koreans should turn out as one in a just and patriotic struggle to frustrate the U.S. and Japanese aggression forces' reckless moves to invade Korea in a do-or-die spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should renew their strong will for independence against outsiders to reject and oppose outsiders keen on aggression and protect the dignity and the sovereignty of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should build a structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. through practical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should form a front of a powerful common struggle against the U.S. in denouncing its moves to interfere in the internal affairs of the Korean nation and launch a military aggression against the DPRK. They should wage a dynamic anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle, true to the Songun politics, proud of being protected by the politics praised by the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should give a strong impetus to the process of reconciliation and the cause of reunification under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nï¿½@The victory in the struggle for independence against outsiders hinges upon all the Koreans' full play to the Korean nation-first spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the United States is trying hard to dominate the whole world, prompted by a nuclear strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has become all the more outspoken in revealing its plan to launch a nuclear preemptive attack on those nations that  are standing in the way of the execution of its strategy for world supremacy and are out of favor with it, and non-nuclear weapon states, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, after designating the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as part of the \"axis of evil\" and a target of its nuclear preemptive attack, has published ahead with the development of small nuclear bombs for the purpose of destroying the DPRK's underground targets. The United States has already deployed weapons of mass destruction including some 1,000 nuclear weapons in south Korea to attack the DPRK. Not content with them, however, it has brought to south Korea sophisticated weapons tested in the Afghan and Iraqi wars of aggression. The fact indicates that the U.S. intention to start the second war of aggression, a nuclear war, on the Korean peninsula at any cost has already begun to be translated into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But if a war breaks out in Korea, it will not be confined only to the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bikini disaster should not be repeated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Anti-Nuke Peace Committee, together with such organizations in the world, will fight staunchly to prevent a nuclear disaster.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Terauchi, the first \"governor-general\", raved that Koreans should obey to Japanese law or die and drove the military and police to the harsh repression of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Pyongyang, thousands of citizens including young people and students gathered in the playground of Sungdok Women's School at twelve noon on March 1 when a bell was telling time. There they solemnly declared Korea was an independent state and staged a demonstration, shouting the slogans \"Long live the independence of Korea!\" and \"Japanese and their troops, get out of Korea!\" The number of demonstrators reached more than 100,000 in a short time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Seoul, too, there was a demonstration involving hundreds of thousands of people. Among them were peasants who came to Seoul from different parts of the country to see the funeral service of King Kojong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The uprising developed into a nation-wide resistance, spreading from Pyongyang and Seoul to all the 13 provinces of the country and other countries including the northeastern areas and Shanghai of China, the Far East region of Russia and Hawaii. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists mobilized mounted police and troops to cold-bloodedly massacre over 100,000 demonstrators by showering bullets on them or sabring them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The cheers of the uprisers are still reverberating in the country, giving rise to national indignation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely make Japan pay for all the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists and for the blood shed by the uprisers.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
