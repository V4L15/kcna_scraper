They tenaciously took issue with the DPRK over the \"abduction issue\" and spurned its sincere efforts in this regard without batting an eye. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are abusing the DPRK's sincere efforts to render the matter more complicated. In this way they seek to invent a pretext to incite hostile feelings toward the DPRK among the Japanese and win popularity and justify their full-dressed moves for militarization on the plea of the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They must clearly know that they will taste a bitter cup of setback, should they continue to behave shamelessly. If they persistently tried to find fault with the DPRK, its innocence will be proved more convincingly and their sinister intention and ugly colors be dragged into the light of day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang and start of the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ) construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the inter-Korean cooperation has been disturbed by the United States in recent months. The U.S. is obstructing the KIZ construction which started in June last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is going to dispatch more than 20 personnel concerned including the secretary general of the U.S. side to the Military Armistice Commission in the U.S. army base in Ryongsan to the Joint Security Area of Panmunjom and the demilitarized zone to \"approve\" and \"permit\" the personnel and materials of the south side going in and out there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reveals the heinous intention of the U.S. to keep the joint security area of Panmunjom and the demilitarized zone under its control and, at the same time, to block the north-south cooperation including the KIZ construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has hampered its progress in every way from the very start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has strictly controlled money and electricity, alleging that they could be used for military purpose. And it has delayed the construction with an excuse of \"investigation\", threatened businessmen not to invest in the project and hindered the introduction of equipment and materials by dint of the unreasonable export law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an interview with KCNA, a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland brands the U.S. as a vicious disturber and a heinous aggressor who is trying to meddle in and obstruct all the Korean nation is doing by itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Korean National Economic Cooperation Federation in a statement called for determinedly frustrating all the U.S. obstructions, stressing that if they were allowed, the Korean nation would be deprived of the reunification era brought by the June 15 joint declaration and could never escape from a war disaster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not fortuitous that even south Korean media said it was none other than the U.S. that was obstructing the south-north relations and the U.S. was nervous of seeing the south and the north might solve the issue of peace and reunification by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation strongly denounces the U.S. for blocking the joint economic activities of the nation while deteriorating the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and keeping the country divided into two.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
