Korea's Moves to Tighten Military Nexus with Japan Assailed \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- South Korea's moves to tighten the military nexus with Japan come under fire by bylined commentaries of papers here Thursday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group rushed the GSOMIA through \"a Cabinet meeting\" behind closed doors only to trigger off strong domestic and foreign criticism and popular resistance. It was, therefore, compelled to declare that its signing would be put off. It is now busy running the whole gamut of absurd pretexts, claiming it was to \"cope with the threat of the north's nukes and missiles\" and \"the agreement was good in its contents but there were only procedural matters.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Lee group is doing represents the treachery of the pro-Japanese lackeys in the 21st century as it was nothing but a revelation of its black-hearted intention to calm down the angry south Koreans and ink the agreement at any cost, watching for a chance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Any military nexus with foreign forces amounts to a grave challenge and an act of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's ambition to stage a comeback to Korea has gone beyond the tolerance limit since Lee came to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists invaded Korea under the plea of \"rescuing\" Japanese residents a century ago. Japan seeks to repeat the same crime under the same pretext.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is set to conclude the agreement with the Japanese reactionaries keen to reinvade Korea, shamelessly justifying its history of colonial domination woven with all sorts of unethical crimes and working hard to grab Tok Islets. This treachery is little short of paving the way for Japan's comeback to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a more serious attention is that the south Korean regime's moves are being pushed forward as part of the scenario for knocking into shape the \"triangular military alliance\" aimed at invading the north under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Lee and the \"Saenuri Party\", the most faithful  pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese lackeys, are allowed to sign the agreement, it will be clear that the Korean Peninsula is bound to turn into a theatre of scramble for influence among foreign forces and the Korean nation will fall victim to them just as what happened early in the 20th century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conclusion of the agreement should be cancelled at once.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls upon all fellow countrymen to turn out as one in the struggle to wipe out the pro-Japanese lackeys keen to hurt the dignity of the nation and turn the peninsula into a war theater of foreign forces."

Korea's Attempted Politically-Motivated Terrorism\r\n Pyongyang, August 2 (KCNA) -- It was fully disclosed that the U.S. and the south Korean puppet regime attempted shocking politically-motivated terrorism to demolish statues symbolic of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and its grand monuments.\n\t\t\t\t\t This bespeaks that the anti-DPRK campaign of hostile forces is on the verge of total fiasco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by the condemnation by the service personnel and people of the DPRK and worldwide criticism, the U.S. and the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors are busy with their moves to put the situation under control, but this is just like crying over spilt milk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are busy claiming that the much publicized case was \"groundless,\" adding there were neither institution that sponsored terrorism nor persons involved in it. Their rhetoric to hide it is, however, only adding to their crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent case was the most vivid expression of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. They assert that they have neither hostile intent nor will to invade the DPRK, but the hostile policy remains invariable as \"national policy\" of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. evermore desperate moves against the DPRK have reached such an extreme and reckless phase that it is busy sponsoring and encouraging such terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nobody's secret that the U.S. has steadily pushed forward heinous terror operation and psychological warfare to bring down the social system of the DPRK behind the facade of the February 29 agreement for improving the DPRK-U.S. relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. worked out a scenario for the above-said terrorism and set in motion its running dogs the Lee Myung Bak group to carry it out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its objective was to destabilize the people's mindset and do harm to their single-minded unity and thus bring down the DPRK social system in the end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S.-led imperialists were known to have rallied hostile elements and human scum for destabilization operations against Libya and other countries. The U.S. and its south Korean lackeys were so foolish as to use the same method against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While working hard to create social chaos, the U.S. is busy amassing forces of aggression in south Korea and its vicinity, talking about provision of \"extended nuclear deterrent\" to the Lee group. The U.S. and the Lee group were hell-bent on an anti-DPRK smear campaign, crying out for the dismantlement of nuclear program of the DPRK and stop to its missile launches at various international arenas including the ministerial meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts eloquently prove that the U.S. does not have even an iota of willingness to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing itself of the recent cases, the DPRK has roundly exposed the U.S. unpardonable scenario for aggression in the eyes of the world. The trend of the present times requires the U.S. to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The International Herald Tribune recently reported that U.S. experts on Korean affairs jointly contributed an article titled \"Peace first\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to think twice about the assertion of its media that it can save its face only when it repents of what fatal consequences were entailed by its hostile policy based on a wrong understanding of the political system in the DPRK, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will counter the U.S. hostile policy towards it with practical toughest actions."
