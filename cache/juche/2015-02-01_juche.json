This means, in essence, refusing dialogue as it is aimed to disarm the dialogue partner, first of all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the U.S. president openly said that it would bring down the social system in the DPRK. It is preposterous and a height of American-style shamelessness and hypocrisy to claim that the U.S. keeps the door of dialogue with the DPRK open. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK feels no need to sit at a negotiating table with the party totally denying the ideology and social system chosen by the Korean people and desperately working to bring down them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will resolutely counter the U.S. as long as it refuses to make its Korea policy switch and seeks \"collapse of system\" in the DPRK."
