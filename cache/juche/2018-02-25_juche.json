            "content": "Portavoz del CCPAP exige a autoridades japonesas tomar medidas especiales\r\nPyongyang, 25 de febrero (ACNC) -- Ultimamente, llega a la etapa muy grave la histerica campana de las autoridades y los reaccionarios derechistas de Japon contra la RPDC y la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon).\n\t\t\t\t\t Al respecto, el portavoz del Comite Coreano por la Paz de Asia y el Pacifico (CCPAP) publico el dia 25 una declaracion condenatoria que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sobre las 3 y 50 de la madrugada del pasado dia 23, dos elementos derechistas armados de Japon cometieron el acto terrorista de disparar varias balas hacia la casa que sirve de sede del Presidium del Comite Central de la Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Presidium del CC de la Chongryon representa la dignidad y los intereses de esta organizacion y los coreanos residentes en Japon y cumple la funcion de mision diplomatica de la RPDC, ya que no existen las relaciones diplomaticas entre Corea y Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde la constitucion de la Chongryon hasta la fecha, los sucesivos gobiernos japoneses y los reaccionarios derechistas del mismo pais cometieron maldades de toda indole contra la Chongryon y los coreanos residentes en Japon, pero no se atrevieron a tirotear hacia la Casa Central de la Chongryon, sagrada zona bajo la soberania de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl atentado terrorista reportado esta vez no es el simple caso accidental sino una provocacion politica intencional y el peor crimen que cometieron los reaccionarios japoneses contra la RPDC y la Chongryon con el siniestro objetivo de agravar al maximo la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y realizar, tomandola por pretexto, su anejada ambicion de la \"esfera de coprosperidad de la gran Asia Oriental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el curso de investigacion a los criminales arrestados, las autoridades japonesas enganan a la opinion publica hablando como si el atentado fuera obra de alguna entidad o individuo. Pero, esta insistencia no pasa de ser una excusa para disimular su intencion malsana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su intento de hacer realidad su sueno ilusorio, ellas instigaron a los gangsteres derechistas armados por si mismas a disparar contra la Casa Central de la Chongryon, lo cual significa un desafio abierto a la RPDC y el preludio de la represion total contra esa organizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras los reaccionarios japoneses se pongan mas feroces en la campana anti-RPDC y anti-Chongryon, se pondra con mas claridad a la vista del mundo el asqueroso atributo de Japon como destructor de la paz y sirviente de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas deberan esclarecer de punta a cabo el motivo trasero y las verdaderas facetas del incidente, castigar duro a los autores y sus complices y tomar las medidas especiales para que no se repitan mas nunca los crimenes violentos y terroristas contra la Chongryon y los coreanos residentes en el pais isla."
