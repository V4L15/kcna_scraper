Loyalty to the basic idea and principles of the movement should always be a criterion whereby to assess and receive new applicants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underscoring the need to develop south-south cooperation, an important condition for the growth of the movement, the article touches on its significance and importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The present reality goes to prove that the mission and idea of the movement is valid and it is growing stronger and developing, the article notes, and stresses: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government will in the future, too, remain as ever loyal to the basic idea and principles of the movement and dynamically advance alongside other non-aligned countries in the struggle to build a new independent world free from imperialism. \r\n\r\n"
