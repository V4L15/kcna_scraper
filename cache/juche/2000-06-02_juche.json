The indictment dated May 27 called for strictly trying the criminal case concerning the GIs' killings of civilians under the international law and the Geneva Convention on wartime protection of civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pak Kwang Gi, chief of the NDFSK Pyongyang mission, informed Korean and foreign reporters here of this on Thursday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment described the last Korean War provoked by the United States as a war of aggression aimed at annexing the north of Korea and a barbarous war to kill innocent civilians in order to exterminate the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to it, the U.S. aggressors killed more than 1,100,000 innocent civilians in cold blood in areas south of the 38th parallel alone during the June 25, 1950-July 27, 1953 Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It recalled that the U.S. aggression troops attacked civilian villages not related to their military operation theatre and employed most cruel and bestial methods to kill peaceable civilians who had nothing to do with combat actions during the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   GIs' massacres of civilians during the war was an organized and premeditated criminal case. They were state-sponsored organized crimes that have so far been concealed by the successive governments of the U.S., the indictment said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These are serious war crimes and crimes against humanity which are in violation of the August 12, 1949 Geneva  Convention on wartime protection of civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The central committee of the NDFSK, invested with a litigious right by the victims of massacres of civilians by GIs during the Korean War, files a complaint at the international court asking it to severely judge the crimes related to GIs' mass killing of civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment demanded the U.S. war criminals, assailants, be brought to the international court and the U.S. admit its crimes and make an open apology to the South Koreans in the name of the government and compensate for the crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those assailants who directly executed massacres of civilians during the war, military officials who ordered the shooting and the then U.S. military and government authorities should be sentenced to capital punishment as war criminals, the indictment urged, concluding:  The U.S. troops branded as war criminals responsible for massacres of civilians should be forced to withdraw from South Korea at once. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
