            "content": "Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Work Marked\r\nPyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Sunday devotes an article to the 14th anniversary of the publication of leader Kim Jong Il's work \"The Songun-Based Revolutionary Line Is a Great Revolutionary Line of Our Era and an Ever-Victorious Banner of Our Revolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\tThe work published on January 29, Juche 92 (2003) serves as an monumental document which comprehensively deals with the essential character and revolutionary nature of the Workers' Party of Korea's line of the Songun revolution, Songun politics, its validity and invincibility, and important guidelines clearly indicating tasks and ways for hastening the final victory of the Juche revolution under the banner of Songun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecalling that more than a decade has passed since the work was published, the article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the period the service personnel and people of the DPRK have deeply grasped the truth that Songun is the banner for winning one victory after another and the prosperity of the country and happiness of the generations to come can be achieved only through the Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLeader Kim Jong Il always took the lead in making journeys along steep mountain roads leading to the forefront, sailing despite stormy waves and weathering snowstorm in the northern areas of the country with the firm faith that armed forces guarantee victory of socialism and prosperity of the country and the nation. Our people will never forget his high-intensity forced march made with ardent patriotism and devotion. It was thanks to the total dedication of the peerlessly great man that the dignity and national power of the DPRK were put on the highest level, the grand march was made to reach the world level and the June 15 era of reunification and the history of great victory in the nuclear standoff with the U.S. were opened. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il honorably protected socialism of Juche and gave steady continuity to the lineage of the Korean revolution by pursuing the Songun politics in the rigorous period when the destiny of the country and the nation was at the crossroads of rise and fall. These precious feats will always go down in the history of the country."

Korea-U.S. \"Mutual Defense and Assistance Agreement\"\r\n Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- 67 years have passed since the U.S. cooked up the \"Mutual Defense and Assistance Agreement\" for aggression with traitor Syngman Rhee on January 26, 1950 under the signboard of \"defense\" and \"assistance\", says Rodong Sinmun Sunday in an article.\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"agreement\" is a product of the U.S. brigandish aggressive scenario to strengthen military domination and subjugation of south Korea under the signboard of \"alliance\" and realize its wild ambition for invading the DPRK, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"agreement\" granted the U.S. limitless rights to deploy its aggressor forces and set up military bases anywhere in south Korea while oppressing and exploiting its people. Contrary to this, it obliged the south Korean authorities to meekly meet any U.S. brigandish demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"agreement\" helped the U.S. dramatically bolster up south Korean puppet forces' capability to attack the north. Pursuant to the already worked out scenario, the U.S. instigated traitor Syngman Rhee to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK on June 25, 1950.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last Korean War clearly showed what grave consequences were caused by the criminal scenario pursued by the U.S. to dominate the whole of Korea after signing the above-said \"agreement.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves escalated by the U.S. and its lackeys to stifle the DPRK would only prompt the latter to bolster up its capability for self-defence and for preemptive attack with nuclear force as its pivot."
