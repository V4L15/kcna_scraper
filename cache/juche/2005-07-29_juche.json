Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a by-lined commentary. It continues:\r\n Once Japan's possession of a regular army is legalized, it will again harass the peace and stability of Asia and the rest of the world as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan claimed that it should possess self-defensive forces under the pretext of what it called self-defense, international peace and stability. This is, however, nothing but a deception and mockery of the public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionary forces defy any law in their desperate bid to emerge a military giant and realize territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago the Japanese military boss asserted that the interceptor missiles jointly developed by the U.S. and Japan can be delivered to a third country. This is a gross violation of Japan's \"three principles of arms export.\" \r\n It is as clear as noonday what consequences will be entailed by the delivery of such missiles to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why are the Japanese reactionary forces seeking to export weapons to other country? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is designed to provide leverage and a springboard for its military expansion overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the actions being conducted by Japan under the signboard of \"international peace and stability\" are aimed at emerging a military giant and realizing its wild ambition for overseas expansion. Through the retrogressive revision of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" the Japanese reactionary forces seek to legalize and institutionalize their moves for emerging a military giant and realizing overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan goes on reckless, seized by the wild ambition for military expansion overseas, failing to face up to the changed world and reality, it will have to pay a dear price for it.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Civilians \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- The Korean people will never forget the massacre committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in Rogun-ri 55 years ago as it was an organized and premeditated massacre of civilians and a crime against humanity, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has not yet admitted this monstrous crime, far from making any apology and compensation for it. It merely staged a farce of erecting a \"monument to the dead.\" This is little short of inflicting double or treble death upon the dead and an intolerable mockery of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the last Korean War the U.S. imperialist barbarians killed more than 1.24 million peaceful inhabitants in different parts of south Korea including Rogun-ri, Kochang, Uiryong, Hamyang, Tanyang, Mungyong and River Rakdong area. As if it were not enough with this, they committed ceaseless brutal killings of south Korean civilians even after the war. The cries made by the martyrs in Kwangju with towering grudge against the U.S. and the screams made by the two schoolgirls when they were breathing their last under the caterpillars of the U.S. forces armored car in broad daylight are still ringing in the ears of the Koreans, adding to their pain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminals should be forced to pay for the blood shed by the south Koreans. The Korean nation can never pardon the U.S. imperialist aggressors who have imposed immeasurable calamities and sufferings upon the Korean people, keeping south Korea under their occupation for 60 years. A severe punishment of them alone would give vent to the bitter grudge of those killed by the American ogres in cold blood and meet the unanimous demand of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S.-Japan Conspiracy Condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 28 (KCNA) -- It is one hundred years since the conclusion of the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\", a product of the U.S.-Japan criminal conspiracy aimed to invade and dominate Korea.\r\n In this regard, the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of the Fatherland (DFRF) released a statement on Wednesday to denounce the indelible crimes the U.S. and Japanese imperialists committed by ruthlessly trampling down upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\" was a product of the bargaining of the U.S. and Japan in which they flouted and decided on the inalienable territory of Korea and the destiny of its nation as they pleased. It was the most piratical \"agreement\" in the imperialist history of aggression, the statement said, adding: This aggressive conspiracy was a collusion made between the two forces of evil as it was the combination of the highhanded and crafty nature of the U.S. imperialists and the wicked and cunning nature of Samurais of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement cited concrete facts to disclose that the fabrication of such illegal \"agreement\" set the stage for the zealous collusion and tie-up between the U.S. and Japanese imperialists in invading the Korean Peninsula and caused the Korean nation with a 5,000-year long history and brilliant culture to undergo all sorts of ordeals and untold miseries and sufferings for so many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unprecedented in history that the two imperialisms colluded with each other in invading other country for many years as they did against Korea, it noted, and went on:\r\n The situation prevailing in the Korean Peninsula reminds one of the situation a century ago when the \"agreement\" was cooked up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One hundred years ago, the U.S. and Japan colluded with each other in their bid for colonial domination over the territory of Korea. Today dirty collusion is being made to step up the U.S. campaign against the DPRK over its nuclear issue and Washington's moves for a war against it and help Japan realize its ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States supports Japan's moves for reinvasion and militarization in an effort to use the latter as a shock brigade in its war actions for world supremacy and anti-DPRK nuclear campaign. Meanwhile, Japan is backing the U.S. in its hostile policy toward the DPRK and its moves for a war of aggression to realize its old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" with the help of the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is with the U.S. support that Japan is so hell-bent on the campaign to grab Tok Islet and distort history despite the strong protests at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is helping the U.S. more zealously than any other countries in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK moves have gone beyond the danger line and the Japanese reactionaries accustomed to fishing in troubled waters always with the help of a big power are recklessly taking the lead in the U.S.-led moves to lay a siege to the DPRK and unleash a dangerous nuclear war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is now waging a struggle against the U.S. and Japanese moves for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japanese imperialists are grossly mistaken if they calculate that they can infringe upon the destiny of the Korean nation as they please by inventing the second and third \"Taft-Katsura agreements\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 1905 Japan forced a disgraceful \"treaty\" upon Korea, bringing it to ruin. But, in 2005, the DPRK is demonstrating its honor as a country which, possessed of nuclear deterrent, is protecting its dignity on its own. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan would be well advised to stop their rash acts, properly understanding the strength and stamina of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's resentment toward the U.S. and Japan has been pent up in the course of the just struggles against their aggression and domination for the last one century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is sure to win in this struggle. This alone would lead to pulling down the barrier of division and putting an end to the history of national sufferings and bring about a reunified great prosperous powerful nation and prosperity common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should courageously turn out in the sacred struggle to terminate the disgraceful history in which the gangster-like \"Taft-Katsura Agreement\" was cooked up a century back and smash the U.S. imperialists' war moves and Japan's design for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The progressive people of the world should actively struggle to check the high-handed practices of the U.S., an empire of evils, and the militarist design of Japan fawning on the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DFRF Central Committee takes this opportunity to call upon the progressive governments, political parties and public organizations and peoples of the world who value justice, truth, peace and social progress to voice stronger support and solidarity with the Korean people in the just struggle to terminate the 100-year history of colonial rule by the U.S. and Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also clarified the idea that the Juche philosophy serves as a revolutionary and political philosophy of the Workers' Party of Korea and principled issues in studying and explaining the Juche philosophy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in an article dedicated to this day says that the work constitutes the most vivid expression of Kim Jong Il's unbounded fidelity to the Juche idea fathered by President Kim Il Sung and, at the same time, the fruition of the outstanding ideological and theoretical activities of Kim Jong Il characterized by originality, the need of the times and scientific accuracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work clearly explained the originality of the Juche philosophy and increased the historical position and the attraction of the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il in his work clearly proved that the Juche philosophy set out by the President is a unique philosophy evolved and systematized with its own principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche philosophy was the first in history to make a scientific and perfect clarification of the essential character of man and, on this basis, establish the most correct world outlook, socio-historical view and revolutionary outlook centering on man, thus overcoming the limitation and immaturity of the preceding philosophies and bringing about a fundamental change in the development of the human philosophical thought. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the work that once again clearly elucidated the historical position of the Juche philosophy as a new revolutionary philosophy which means the highest stage in the development of the human philosophical thought and represents the era of Juche, the historic era quite different from that to which the preceding theories belonged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This work also demonstrated the might of the Juche philosophy as a weapon for revolutionary practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il lucidly explained in the work that the Juche philosophy is a popular and revolutionary philosophy which was formulated and developed in depth reflecting the demand and will of the popular masses and generalizing the experience gained in their struggle and which has turned into a weapon in the struggle of the popular masses and a political philosophy clarifying the principled basis of politics leading the social development along the straight path. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work clarified the fundamental guidelines that should be firmly held fast to in the study and explanation of the Juche philosophy, in particular. This is of great historic significance in glorifying the Juche philosophy as a weapon for revolutionary practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
