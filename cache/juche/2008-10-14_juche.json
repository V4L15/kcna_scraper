Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The space development has been a monopoly of the developed countries in the past. But it is quite different in the present times when the international environment has changed and the world entered the age of information industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the world today shows, developing countries as well as developed ones are actively exploring the area of space development, accelerating the scientific and technological development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The space development has become an irresistible international trend and entered a new phase of development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is important here is that the space development should strictly serve a peaceful purpose and be favorable for international security and the development of human civilization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But what should not be overlooked is that the undesirable forces are getting evermore undisguised in their moves to use the space for a military purpose in order to achieve their criminal aims. The U.S. is conducting what it called exercises of shooting down satellites, putting spurs to the building of missile shields in a bid to establish a military monopoly on the space and realize its wild ambition for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is hell-bent on the criminal moves to use the space for its military purpose as evidenced by its launch of spy satellites and the enaction of the \"basic law on space\", etc., pursuant to the U.S. policy for space militarization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality requires the world peace-loving people to check the dangerous space militarization and push forward the space development for a peaceful purpose.

However, they firmly protected the sovereignty of the country and socialism, weathering out trials under the leadership of the WPK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK has advanced along the only road of victory without making even a single mistake and undergoing twists and turns in implementing its line despite all sorts of tempests of history. This was possible entirely thanks to the distinguished great men. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK was founded and developed by President Kim Il Sung and its history and tradition have been given steady continuity by General Secretary Kim Jong Il. It is, therefore, fully demonstrating its might as an organizer and guide of all the victories of the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK is invincible because it has the Juche idea, a guiding idea publicly recognized in the era of independence, as its steadfast guidelines. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK will always emerge victorious under its fluttering flag, a symbol of victory and glory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bulletin also carried the picture of the emblem of the WPK."
