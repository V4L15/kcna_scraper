            "content": "KCNA on principled stand of DPRK on terrorism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 13 (KCNA) -- As already clarified, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea decided to sign the \"international convention for the suppression of the financing of terrorism\" and \"international convention against the taking of hostages.\"\r\n This means that the DPRK has basically acceded to all the existing major international anti-terrorism conventions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This measure once again clearly shows the principled consistent position of the DPRK that it is opposed to all forms of terrorism and to whatever any aid to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, regarding the dignity of the man as most valuable, has made all its efforts to combat all forms of terrorism which are in contravention of world peace and stability, national independence and respect for sovereignty, social justice and humanitarian ideal and waged a principled struggle to root out terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dominationist high-handed and arbitrary practices, national and social inequality, distrust, conflict and antagonism caused by religious prejudice and extremism, etc. are the root cause of international terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unilaterally resorting to a violent retaliatory war, under the pretext of combating terrorism turning a blind eye to this root cause, would not help prevent the vicious cycle of violence accompanied by severe destruction and death of innocent civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will, therefore, cooperate with the international community in the fight against terrorism, firmly adhering to the principled position on terrorism in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community and the world public opinion have positively appreciated this measure, a manifestation of the DPRK's consistent position and efforts, as a significant step forward in the efforts to strengthen the worldwide cooperation in the fight against terrorism and criticized the anachronistic nature of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was also reported to have welcomed the measure taken by the DPRK. But it is undisguisedly inciting mistrust and antagonism towards the DPRK, still keeping it on the \"list of sponsors of terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a true will to drop its unreasonable hostile policy towards the DPRK and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations, it should not repeat only empty words but respect and implement what had been agreed with the DPRK and take even a single practical measure at least. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This bilateral confidence alone would make the dialogue between the DPRK and the U.S. constructive and promote the process of improving their relations. This would also be greatly helpful to the international cooperation in the fight against terrorism.    \r\n\r\n"

Security Council. This is the job to be done by Japan before anything else. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary slamming Japan for impertinently working to sit on the sc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is showing such increased zeal in the debate on the SC reform after raising again the issue at the ongoing U.N. General Assembly Session. This is aimed at getting the permanent membership of the SC and handling world affairs to meet its selfish interests while behaving as a political power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan cannot sit on the SC as it pleases. To get its permanent membership is not as easy as crossing the threshold of other's house nor is it something like an antique to be sold or bought. Its membership requires support of the world people. Japan can get it only when it honestly fulfils its obligation with fair conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For Japan to vociferate about its \"contribution to peace\" and \"U.N. reform\" before redressing its crimes committed in the past is little short of getting extremely perfumed sitting on a garbage box. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to stop behaving indiscreetly and redeem its past as early as possible, to begin with.     \r\n\r\n"

This is a lesson taught by a long history of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north-south joint declaration serves as a declaration on independent reunification common to the nation as it indicates a way of solving the issue of national reunification with the nation playing a main role, free from foreign interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reason why national independence serves as a main spirit of the joint declaration can be explained by the fact that it is based on national independence. Underlying the declaration is the strong spirit of national independence that ours is a homogenous nation strong in independence and an independent nation capable of achieving national sovereignty by itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration is based on the idea that the Korean nation is a nation inseparable because of love of the country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas will surely achieve great national unity in the spirit of the declaration and achieve the nation's historic cause of reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

This is an elementary requirement for resuming the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Unite States is massively beefing up its forces in South Korea under the pretext of its military operation against Afghanistan and persisting in its malignant anti-DPRK smear campaign over the non-existent \"religious and human rights issues.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves of the united states are only intended to fool the public and lead the DPRK to slacken its vigilance in a bid to escalate its unchangeable hostile policy towards the DPRK and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States truly wants dialogue with the DPRK, it should not pay lip-service to \"unconditional dialogue\" and the like but respect the DPRK and opt to create an atmosphere of dialogue and build confidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The process of normalizing the DPRK-U.S. relations and dialogue will make smooth progress only when the U.S. rectifies its policy towards the DPRK and stops posing a threat to it.    \r\n\r\n"

The cause of reunification of the country allows no bargaining and it can never be achieved by means of equivalent exchange. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification should be achieved in the spirit of patriotism based on the common ideal, of the nation. Ri Hoe Chang, who downplayed such must be more of a peddler than the leader of a political party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that :\"reciprocity\" asserted by him is aimed to defile the north's system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words by \"reciprocity\" he meant \"reciprocity\" which presupposed any \"change\" in the north. It was a height of folly for him to try to impose any \"change\" upon the north. This was a gross breach of the basic agreement between both sides on recognizing and respecting the two differing systems in the north and the south and an undisguised challenge to the highly dignified system in the north. The north and the south can neither be hold any dialogue nor can they improve their relations on the basis of such \"reciprocity\". This conception only invites acute conflict and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spurious \"reciprocity\" peddled by Ri is part of his anti-reunification diatribe to block the inter-Korean dialogue and national unity and incite confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He will have no future if he negates the historic north-south joint declaration provided by the two heads of the north and the south and persistently pursues confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon those standing in the way of unity and reunification.   \r\n\r\n"
