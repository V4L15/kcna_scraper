Debarajan, secretary of the Central Committee of the All-India Forward Bloc, in a statement made public on Aug.13 on the occasion of the 59th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, said Japan can never evade its obligation to atone for its past crimes. The Democratic People's Republic of Korea has the legitimate right to get apology and compensation from Japan for the forcible drafting and massacre of Koreans and its crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army, he held.\r\n Recalling that the Japanese imperialists, after occupying Korea, robbed the Korean people of their national sovereignty and enforced a medieval repressive policy to reduce Korea to their eternal colony, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upwards of 8.4 million Koreans were taken to battlefields of a war of aggression and sites of hard labor and 200,000 women of them were forced to serve the Imperial Japanese Army as \"comfort women.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSo monstrous were the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against the Korean people in destroying and looting a fabulous amount of material resources and cultural assets of all kinds and trying to exterminate the nation during their occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though nearly 60 years have passed since the defeat of Japan, the relations between the two countries have not been brought to normal. This is entirely attributable to Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There is no change in its disposition and nature.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Herein lies a sinister intention of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries which the U.S. termed \"dangerous states\" and \"rogue states\" are independent countries opposed to it. \r\n The Bush ruling quarters are putting unprecedentedly strong military pressure upon those countries under the pretext of their \"illegal production of nukes\" and \"proliferation of nuclear substance\" while escalating its brigandish armed invasion and war of aggression worldwide under the signboard of the removal of a \"threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces listed those countries as \"states creating nuclear threats\" and \"sponsors of terrorism\" not because those countries posed any real threat but because they were prompted by their aim to seize regions of military and strategic importance and realize their strategy for world domination, using those regions as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. final goal of world supremacy is to weaken Russia and China, strong powers in the Euro-Asia continent, and put them under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. seeks to swallow up the Korean peninsula, Iran, Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan, strategic vantage points in the continent, in a bid to create military conditions favorable for attaining such strategic goal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim sought by the U.S. in this row is to secure an unchallenged nuclear edge and lord it over the world. It is working hard to deter the anti-U.S. independent countries from increasing their military capabilities for self-defence and disarm them under the pretext of not allowing the \"illegal production of nukes\" by the \"rogue states\" and \"dangerous forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no artifice can the Bush regime justify its criminal nuclear war policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its brazen-faced moves to realize its ambition for world domination with nukes under the signboard of holding in check \"illegal production of nukes and proliferation of nuclear substance\" by the above-said countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
