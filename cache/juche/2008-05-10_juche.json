As a result, the dangerous military tension under which a war may break out anytime prevailed in the Korean Peninsula. The DPRK, which has been consolidated into an invincible bulwark under the great Songun policy, took resolute self-defensive measure against the U.S. imperialists' war moves and pressure, and thus demonstrated to the whole world the mettle and might of Songun Korea. On the basis of the Songun idea and the line of attaching importance to military affairs, the DPRK has persistently directed primary efforts to increasing the national defence capability to build up the combat efficiency of the Korean People's Army in every way and develop the self-reliant national defence industry. But for our invincible revolutionary armed forces and self-reliant national defence industry, a war would have already broken out in the Korean Peninsula by the imperialists and Korean-style socialism could have hardly been defended. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace can never be ensured by means of begging and compromise. It can be achieved and defended only by the tremendous military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To further increase the military strength is more indispensable for the developing countries or small countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is more important in the present showdown with the imperialists and the U.S. to keep the unshakable revolutionary faith. A people strong in faith can defend the dignity of their country and nation and emerge as final victors, but when they fail to keep such faith, they will face death, misfortune and national ruin. This is a serious lesson taught by the world situation at present. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Moves for Military Confrontation Disclosed\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- A military commentator issued an article disclosing the truth of the moves of traitor Lee Myung Bak for military confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article cites facts to prove that Lee and the bellicose forces of the puppet military formed by him set it as their general goal to escalate pressure on the north to the maximum and began their racket for military confrontation by opening a new prelude to military tension with all efforts focused on holding an \"unchallenged military edge.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When traitor Lee's regime emerged and there was a sign of change in its policy toward the north, the bellicose forces of the puppet military characterized by conservatism took the lead in creating an atmosphere in favor of securing \"military edge,\" it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, they are directing efforts to stirring up antagonism and establishing \"view on principal enemy\" and are giving spurs to intensifying combat readiness of the units of the three services and stepping up the planned arms buildup while calling for enhancing consciousness of \"security\" which went weak for the past ten years in south Korea, indifferent to implementing all the military agreements reached between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All espionage acts intensified in the ground, seas and air and the undisguised military provocations in areas along the demarcation lines where the north and the south stand in confrontation including maritime encroachment remind one of the situation on the eve of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently they have staged large-scale aerial and maritime strike exercises one after another after deploying a combat fleet including nuclear-powered submarine and even latest strike flying corps such as F-15Ks of the U.S. and the satellites in south Korea and its vicinities while asserting that the \"military edge\" being kept with the relations of \"alliance\" as the main part of its axis would become a means for putting heavier pressure on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their loud-mouthed \"military edge\" is, in a nutshell, an undisguised negation of the three principles of national reunification and the north-south agreement on non-aggression and it cannot be construed otherwise than a grave provocation little short of a declaration of a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By origin, the policy and strategy of the south Korean authorities are the ones of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that Lee, who was a poor businessman with a few pennies without his own things, cannot but follow his master's war policy and strategy as he is unable to know politics and military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He admonished the puppet military organs characterized by sycophancy towards the U.S. and conservatism, and units under them to raise anti-DPRK consciousness to keep \"the attitude pertaining to the army\" during his inspection to them and called for making all efforts to complete preparation for war. This was aimed at currying favor with his master and the bellicose forces of the puppet military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It was against this backdrop that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and other warmongers who occupied top military positions by Lee Myung Bak have gone busy channeling all efforts into achieving political and military \"international cooperation\" pursuant to the U.S. policy and strategy towards the DPRK, asserting that they should not miss the good opportunity for the \"recovery of the weakened relations of alliance\" after Lee's junkets to the U.S. and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As they promised their master brasshats of the south Korean puppet army have taken measures for a stop to the reduction of the U.S. forces in south Korea and pushed ahead with the building of \"ultra-modern, elite and efficient army\" to suit the enhanced position to purchase military hardware from the U.S., hatching plots almost every day. This is just a few typical examples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To aggravate military tension and confrontation pursuant to the master's policy for aggression and war scenario is another treachery of selling off the country through sycophancy and servitude, oblivious of a historical lesson and of trying to stifle the fellow countrymen by force of arms with the help of sworn enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past the south Korean military warmongers infiltrated their warships into the territorial waters of the DPRK side under the pretext of \"controlling ships of third country\" and \"identifying suspected target,\" asserting that they would show their will to preserve the \"northern limit line\" in practice. These days, however, they have escalated the infiltration with the deployment of huge naval armed forces in the West Sea, openly vociferating about defence of the \"northern limit line.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their military confrontation row clearly proves that the Lee Myung Bak gentries are, indeed, traitors laying a hurdle in the way of developing inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity, war servants bringing clouds of war to hang over this land and anti-reunification elements seeking the permanent division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more military tension and confrontation escalate, the more the inter-Korean relations go perilous. In the long run, it will never help settle the nuclear issue and ensure peace and stability of the Far Eastern region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, it will not be helpful to the \"economy revival\" on which Lee Myung Bak stakes big fate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggravated military tension and confrontation lead to conflicts and the third skirmish in the West Sea and the second June 25 war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We want improved inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity, but never feel afraid of military conflicts and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Traitor Lee and the south Korean military bellicose forces should not act rashly, mindful that military tension and confrontation will bring them noting but disgraceful destruction and grave.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
