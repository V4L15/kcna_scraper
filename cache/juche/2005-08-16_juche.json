The victory in the anti-Japanese war and the liberation of Korea were the events which diverted the trend of history in the 20th century.\r\n The history in which the DPRK has advanced, holding Kim Il Sung in high esteem, is the one in which the Koreans pioneered their own way and successfully accomplished the cause of socialism centered on the popular masses, the ever-victorious one in which the sovereignty of the Korean nation has been firmly defended, standing on the forefront of anti-imperialist struggle, and a great one in which a solid foundation has been laid for the eternal prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 60 years of victory and glory covered by the DPRK are marked with the immortal exploits leader Kim Jong Il has performed by successfully implementing Kim Il Sung's idea and cause of building the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has devoted his all to the struggle to implement the above-said idea and cause of the President as his closest comrade-in-arms and revolutionary comrade for several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has led the cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation, while making ceaseless long journeys for Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to steadfastly defend the banner of Juche adds lustre to the history of his leadership over the building of a rich and powerful country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now faced with the historic tasks to get the whole Party and army and all the people single-heartedly united to dynamically speed up the general march for Songun revolution in order to achieve the prosperity of the country, which the President liberated and built up. It is necessary to firmly uphold and thoroughly implement the idea and line of the President generation after generation. The whole Party and army and all the people should single-mindedly unite around Kim Jong Il and uphold his leadership with loyalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson calls upon all the people to strikingly demonstrate to the whole world the dignity and honor, wisdom and spirit of the country liberated by the President and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche under the Songun leadership of   Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
