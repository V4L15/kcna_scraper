Paektu plateau, more than 1,100 \r\nmetres high above sea level, in the northeastern part of the \r\nmt. Paektu lava ground which is 400 kilometres long from the \r\nnorth to the south and 240 kilometres wide from the east to \r\nthe west, around mt. Paektu, the holy mountain of the \r\nrevolution. \r\n   Before the liberation (August 1945), there were only  \r\nthick forest and some patches cultivated by fire-field \r\nfarmers.\r\n   The farm was founded in July 1952 when Korea was in the \r\nthick of war.\r\n   At that time, the great leader President Kim Il Sung, \r\nwith a far-sighted plan to turn the vast mt. Paektu plateau \r\ninto a fertile area, saw to it that state integrated farm \r\nno. 5 (the predecessor of the present farm) was founded.\r\n  The president gave on-site guidance to the farm on several \r\noccasions and gave it highly important teachings hundreds of \r\ntimes, so as to indicate the orientation and ways for the \r\nfarm's development in a concrete way.\r\n   Over the past 40 odd years since it was founded, the farm \r\nhas taken on a wonderful look.\r\n   Cultivated area increased to 10,000 hectares and a 1,400 \r\nkm-long shelter-belt was made on the farm.\r\n   Wheat, barley, potato, vicia and other crops grow on the \r\nwell-shaped fields.\r\n   All farming processes from ploughing and sowing to \r\nharvesting and threshing are all mechanized.\r\n   Each farmer is in charge of 30 hectares of arable land.\r\n   Stockbreeding bases and local industrial foundations have \r\nbeen built creditably on the farm.\r\n   Modernly-built dwelling houses, schools, hospitals, \r\nkindergartens and welfare service facilities are seen in \r\nresidential quarters. \r\n   The farm has built five medium- and small-sized power \r\nstations on its own. The electric output is more than enough \r\nto meet the demand of the county. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
