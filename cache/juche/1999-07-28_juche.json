It is very reasonable from a humanitarian viewpoint to repatriate them to the north as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that the 70 million countrymen's aspiration after reunification is growing stronger than ever before, the resolution stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf the South Korean authorities repatriate the unconverted long-term prisoners without any condition, it will bring a thaw in the inter-Korean reconciliation and dialogue that has been frozen by the recent west sea incident and mark an occasion of giving momentum to the movement for peace and reunification in this country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The resolution urged the South Korean authorities to abandon \"reciprocity\" which flouts unconverted long-term prisoners and brings disappointment to the entire nation and world people, and take a positive  action for the solution of this problem in the spirit of the great unity and the love of the nation. \r\n\r\n"

These crimes are something unprecedented in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For Japan to repent of and apologize for its history of aggression and war and liquidate the past is an unavoidable responsibility and obligation in view of the international law and from the humanitarian and moral point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan, far from apologizing and compensating for the past wrongdoings, is sharpening its sword to reinvade Korea,  while going ahead with its extremely provocative anti-DPRK moves  including preparations for an \"preemptive attack\" on the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan wishes to escape from abuses and denunciation from world public and greet a new millennium, feeling clear and clean, it should promptly make a bold resolution to liquidate the past and doing so is good for Japan itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The letters strongly urged the Japanese authorities to comprehensively investigate and open to the public the truth behind the human loss and material damage inflicted upon the Korean people as soon as possible, punish those responsible for them and make a state apology and compensation for them. \r\n \r\n"

It should also abolish the \"U.S.-Japan Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" which reveals its ambition to reinvade Korea and stop militarist military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., Japan and South Korea should stop triangular  military alliance and joint military exercises.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe north and south should take the road of mutual cooperation for rejecting outside forces and saving the nation in order to prevent the nuclear war which may bring catastrophe to the nation.
