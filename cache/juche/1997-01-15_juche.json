The analyst goes on:\r\n   It is the height of impudence that Kim Young Sam \r\nattempted to justify the retrogressive revision of the laws \r\nby clamouring about \"International competitiveness\".  The \r\nSouth Korean economy is poor in \"Competitiveness\" and is \r\nsuffering from an \"Incurable disease\" owing to his \r\nsycophantic and anti-social economic policy.\r\n   Kim Young Sam contended that the strikes of the South \r\nKorean workers are attributable to their poor knowledge of \r\nthe new \"Labor laws\" and that the retrogressive revision \r\nof the laws was an \"Inevitable choice\" for the \"Revival of \r\nthe deteriorating economy.\" his utterances are a mockery of \r\nand insult to the South Korean people as well as a shameless \r\ndistortion of facts.\r\n   He also cried for the \"Removal of working people's \r\nuneasiness\"  and \"improvement of living conditions\". This is \r\nas good as tears of a crocodile. If he was concerned about \r\nthe living conditions of the workers, he should not have \r\nrevised the labor laws the workers set themselves against.\r\n   He had the impudence to say that he could \"Pigeonhole the \r\nrevision of the laws\" to spend his remaining term of office \r\nwithout difficulties, but he could not do so any longer as \r\nit was an urgent task directly linked to the economy and \r\nliving conditions of the people.\r\n   The realities call the workers and people of other social \r\nstandings to a more powerful struggle for the withdrawal of \r\nthe fascist laws and for the overthrow of the Kim Young Sam \r\ngroup. \r\n"

This is the truth \r\nof the revolution the Korean people realised through their \r\nexperience and a historic summing-up of the Korean \r\nrevolution.\r\n   Independence against imperialism is the cornerstone of \r\nthe foreign policy and external activities of the WPK and \r\nthe government of the democratic people's republic of Korea.\r\n   We analyse and appreciate the international situation and \r\nstrengthen international unity and solidarity, proceeding \r\nfrom the anti-imperialist, independent stand.\r\n   Our people fully discharge their duty in the struggle for \r\nindependence against imperialism.\r\n   The great leader comrade Kim Jong Il stands at the head \r\nof the struggle.\r\n   He imbues the Korean people with the idea of independence \r\nagainst imperialism and wisely leads them to further \r\nstrengthen the anti-imperialist struggle under the present-\r\nday situation of revolution.\r\n   Our confrontation with the imperialist reactionaries is \r\ngetting fiercer than in the period of the Cold war.\r\n   Ours is a people who regard independence as their life \r\nand Soul.\r\n   The invariable stand and will of the Korean people, once \r\na people of a ruined country, is not to yield to any \r\npressure and power politics of the imperialists, but to \r\nfight against them.\r\n   It is the truth proved through the experience of the \r\nKorean people that if they remain true to the stand of \r\nindependence against imperialism, they can win a victory, \r\nand if they abandon it, they fail.\r\n   The Korean people will never give up the stand of \r\nindependence, though the adherance to it needs the cost of \r\ntheir lives. \r\n\r\n"
