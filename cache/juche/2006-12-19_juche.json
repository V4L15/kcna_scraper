            "content": "KCNA Accuses Japan of Working Hard to Evade Settlement of Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- Japan has put the DPRK-Japan relations to the lowest ebb by persistently working to internationalize the \"abduction issue.\" \r\n Japanese Prime Minister Abe, addressing the government-sponsored \"meeting of people thinking about the abduction issue\" on Dec. 14, blustered that Japan can never normalize its relations with north Korea unless the abduction issue is settled. Foreign Minister Aso and other political heavyweights of Japan vied with each other to ask mandarins of other countries to cooperate in settling the issue. In another development, right-wing forces gathered in Tokyo and held a \"photo exhibition demanding the settlement of the abduction issue\" and an \"international meeting for discussing the issue of abductees.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the \"Headquarters for Measures for the Settlement of the Abduction issue\" adopted it as a policy to conduct the work to let Japanese know about the \"abduction issue\" and others from 2007. To this end the government decided to ensure that broadcasting programs are produced and request broadcasting services in south Korea and Europe to air them toward the DPRK. It also decided to discuss the matter with the Ministry of Finance to include a total of 226 million yen in its additional budget for this year.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By deliberately hyping and internationalizing the \"abduction issue\" which had already found its settlement the Japanese authorities seek to create the impression that \"the abduction issue is the focal point in the DPRK-Japan relations in a bid to evade their responsibility to redeem the crimes committed by Japan in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is chiefly to blame for abduction as it forcibly drafted at least 8.4 million young and middle aged Koreans and forced many of them to do slave labor and abducted and reduced more than 200,000 Korean women to \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army after invading Korea. These were the most hideous crimes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should have properly reflected on and settled these crimes right after its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, however, has neither honestly apologized to the Korean nation for these wrongs nor expressed its intention to compensate for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, Japan is an assailant while the DPRK is its victim as far as the \"abduction issue\" is concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Japan, the world's arch abductor dares to cry out for internationalizing the \"abduction issue\" of somebody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNothing is more foolish and wicked than this behavior of Japan as it tries hard to paint the cruel assailant as a \"miserable victim\" in a bid to cover up its crimes and go away without redressing them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's settlement of its past crimes is not a simple matter which allows it to go without settling it but a political issue that should be solved without fail no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and no matter how frequently the chief executive is replaced by another. It is the real issue that should be internationalized. Japanese politicians should bear this in mind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Sinister Design on Eurasian Continent Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 18 (KCNA) -- Japanese Foreign Minister Aso in a lecture recently blared that Japan would actively \"get its hand\" on the affairs of the Eurasian continent, relying on the Japan-U.S. axis. In other word, Japan would launch into \"activities for freedom and prosperity\" to render zealous \"aid\" in the settlement of the \"democratic system\" and development of the economy in Southeast and Central Asian and East European countries with the patronage and backing of the U.S.\r\n Branding the slogan of \"freedom and prosperity\" hung out by the reactionaries of the island country as a reversed slogan of aggression and plunder and a replica of \"the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" chanted by the Japanese imperialists in the past, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Throwing off the mask of \"a pacifist state,\" Japan is making its debut as a war-seeking state. Many countries are lifting up voices against the Japanese reactionaries' moves for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the main objects of Aso is to quell the concern of the Eurasian countries over Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the aegis of the U.S., Japan is going to hasten, among other things, the expanded dispatch of troops of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" overseas. Within the frame of this design, Japan is planning to elevate the Defense Agency to the ministerial status from January 9 next year while getting evermore outspoken in its moves to grab others' territories and distort history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The profusion of phrases used by Japan about \"freedom\" and \"prosperity\" are nothing but mishmash to mislead people, turning its back on justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that Japan, which is intensifying its hostile policy against the DPRK and intentionally worsening relations with its surrounding countries, can neither engage itself \"in activities for freedom and prosperity\" nor appear with a new image before the peoples of the Eurasian countries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
