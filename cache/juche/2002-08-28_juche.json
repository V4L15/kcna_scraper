In this course many of them had the honour of becoming young heroes and heroines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More brilliant feats were performed by them during the \"arduous march\" and the forced march which the DPRK had to carry out due to the imperialists' moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il the young people waged a heroic struggle, holding high the slogan \"Let us glorify youth\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Young shock brigades built the 100-odd-km-long railways between Wonsan and Mt. Kumgang, breaking through difficulties and hardships, before switching them over to electric traction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Young people built the youth hero motorway, a large-scale express highway, in a matter of less than two years, displaying the heroic spirit of the Korean youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Anbyon Youth Power Station, the Jangsongang Youth Power Station, the Kwangmyongsong Saltern, the Unsong Youth Reservoir, the Hamhung City Youth Goat Farm and other monumental edifices of the army-based era are all associated with the wisdom and stamina of the youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over 860 of the edifices built in different parts of the country over the last six years after the Socialist Working Youth League of Korea was renamed the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League bear the name of \"youth\" to be brilliantly recorded in the history of the struggle to build a powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n"

Delayed withdrawal would be unfavorable for the United States, either.\r\n Minju Joson Wednesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on the fact that since south Korean schoolgirls were killed by a U.S. armored vehicle, the south Korean people's struggle for the punishment of the murderers and the U.S. pullout has continued for more than 70 days, the paper says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadfast is the Korean nation's will to put an end to the U.S. military presence in south Korea and achieve the independent reunification of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. wants to keep its troops in south Korea, it will face the south Korean people's strong anti-U.S. resistance and its troops will be shamefully driven out of south Korea. It would be favorable and wise for the U.S. to withdraw its troops from south Korea before it suffers disgrace under the very eyes, of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. most be capable of distinguishing between the favorable and the unfavorable.
