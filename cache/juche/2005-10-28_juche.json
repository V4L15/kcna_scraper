This is a dangerous agreement wholly denying the joint statement of the six-party talks which confirmed that the U.S. has no intention to attack and invade the north with nuclear or conventional weapons, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the council meeting it was also agreed to reaffirm that the \"successful completion of the transfer of the U.S. military bases in south Korea is a cornerstone of future south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and the strategic flexibility of the U.S. forces is of sustained importance. It is a humiliating and subordinate war agreement which further strengthens the south Korea-U.S. alliance and harms peace in the Korean Peninsula. \r\n With the joint statement of the six-party talks the U.S. troops have lost any justification for their presence in this land.
