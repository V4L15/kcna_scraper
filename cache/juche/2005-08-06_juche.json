After suffering a defeat in Korea, the U.S. imperialists sustained setbacks in Cuba and Vietnam, too, and are repudiated and denounced in various parts of the world.\r\n Under the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il the Korean people are standing on the forefront of the international anti-U.S., anti-war struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a film show took place in France on July 25 on the occasion of the month of international solidarity with the Korean people under the sponsorship of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers supporting the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Korean film \"Koreans Hands in Hands\" was screened at the film show. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After watching the film, officials of the association resolved to conduct more positive activities for supporting and encouraging the reunification of Korea in keeping with the favorably improving relations between the north and the south of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Respect for independence is a fundamental requirement and the best way for promoting reconciliation, unity and friendship and establishing a new and fair international order among countries and nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respect for independence is essential for ensuring global peace and chiefly guarantees it. Historical facts go to prove that world can be thrown into uncontrollable confusion and chaos and it cannot escape a war if individual countries are allowed to exercise any privilege away from the principle of respect for independence and the principle of impartiality is violated in the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to establish a new and fair international order and ensure global peace in the new century it is necessary for each country to maintain independence in relations with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people have firmly maintained independence in the whole course of the revolution and construction and victoriously advanced the cause of socialism. As a result, the DPRK is demonstrating its might and dignity as a powerful socialist state, independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in national defence. Its Songun policy is a successful application of its independent line and a most vivid expression of independent politics. The Korean people will wage a dynamic struggle to protect independence in the international arena under the uplifted banner of Songun, the banner of independence, and thus positively contribute to establishing a new and fair international order and ensuring global peace in the new century.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
