He said the multipart feature film \"the Nation and Destiny\" was a national treasure that would be handed down along with the history of the Korean nation.\r\n   The seed of the serials on the working class is the \"philosophy of molten iron\", which means that as scrap iron is turned into red molten iron in the furnace, so a man with a chequered career grows up to be a loyal subject in the working class trained by the Workers' Party of Korea.\r\n   The 10-odd-part film gives a vivid representation of a furnaceman's family and those with different and complicated background and their growing to be members of a large harmonious family of the Kim Il Sung's nation, moved by the appeal and patriotism of the furnaceman's family. \r\n   The first four parts of the film \"the Nation and Destiny\" with Choe Hyon Dok as a hero were released in Juche 81 (1992), later followed by scores of parts with Yun Sang Min, Cha Hong Gi and Hong Yong Ja as heroes and heroine.

Besides, grain was distributed to industrial sectors, livestock domain, public catering service, workers and office employees. As a result, the total stock of grain was 167,000 tons as of January 1.\r\n   With this stock, 300 grams were distributed to each person on a daily average in January and 200 grams in February. \r\n   Even if 100 grams are distributed in March, the stock will run out in mid-March.\r\n   We hail the UN inter-agency consolidated appeal on Feb. \r\n   12 after the WFP made public on Jan. 6 a fresh appeal for 650,000 tons of food in assistance to the DPRK. We are also grateful to the international community including the WFP, the European Union, different countries and organizations willing to continue this year offering assistance, mainly food to the DPRK.\r\n   The international food aid will encourage our people in their efforts to eradicate aftereffects of the natural disasters and normalize production in agricultural and other sectors of the national economy.\r\n   Though the aftermaths of the disasters are serious, our people will make all efforts to solve the acute food shortage this year by successfully doing farming.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
