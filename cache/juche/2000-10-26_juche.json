Korean authorities hit for joint military maneuvers \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 26 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today answered a question put by KCNA as regards \"2000 Foal Eagle\" joint military maneuvers of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the South Korean authorities began \"2000 Foal Eagle\" joint military maneuvers against the DPRK in Seoul and other parts of South Korea on October 25. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the DPRK and the U.S. published a joint communique declaring that neither side will have hostile intent toward  the other side, high-level visits are made to improve the bilateral relations and contacts and negotiations between the military authorities of the north and south are under way in the wake of dramatic changes in the relations between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The large-scale joint military maneuvers that began against this backdrop is an open challenge to the dialogue partner. It is as good as spoiling the good atmosphere created in favor of reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The maneuvers proves that the U.S. is still pursuing the policy of \"strength\" in its strategy towards the DPRK and that the South Korean authorities are following with increased zeal the U.S. strategy, instead of implementing the north-south joint declaration which calls on the nation to solve problems by itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1992 talks which were arranged with so much effort for the implementation of the north-south agreement broke down owing to such joint military maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and South Korean war hawks should act with discretion. \r\n\r\n"

The Chinese People's Volunteers, which was made up of excellent sons and daughters of China before 50 years ago, crossed the Yalu River under the banner of justice to defend peace and resist aggression and fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army, thus achieving a great victory in the life and death battles that lasted for two years and nine months, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the war to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea was a great victory of the peace-loving people of the world and a heroic feat to defend justice and fight against hegemonies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was a splendid epic of patriotism and revolutionary heroism and a grand monument built by the Chinese people in maintaining world peace and human progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the leadership of Kim Il Sung and the Worker's Party of Korea the heroic Korean people indomitably fought against the formidable enemy, winning respect from the peoples of China and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean government and people took care of the Chinese volunteers, loved and sincerely helped them. The two peoples and armies sealed great militant friendship with blood, sharing weal and woe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the exploits made by the Chinese people's volunteers and their spirit of fortitude during the Korean War, Jiang Zemin said the CPV fought for peace and justice and demonstrated the national and military power of new China in the war of resisting America and aiding Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was quite a just and grand feat that the CPV defended peace and fought against aggression through its operations conducted after leaving the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tens of thousands of excellent sons and daughters of China laid down their precious lives for the sake of world peace and justice and independence and freedom of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victory in the Korean war greatly encouraged the oppressed and exploited people in their just struggle to achieve liberation, he said, adding this provided good conditions for the socialist revolution and construction in the two countries and gave great impetus to the conviction and enthusiasm of all nationalities and people of the country who built new China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We commemorate the victory of the war to resist U.S. and aid Korea, observing and reviewing it in the light of history and reality, just in an effort to better promote the lofty cause of the world peace and human progress, Jiang Zemin stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commemoration of this victory of the war is aimed to learn from the noble spirit and great traits displayed by all the Chinese People's Volunteers, let the Chinese give full play to patriotism and revolutionary heroism, step up the party building in all aspects in keeping with \"requirements of three delegates\" and assiduously carry out all the work of the party and state, he noted. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But I overcame it as I was swayed by the thought of the benevolence of Kim Il Sung who enabled me to devote myself to the homeland as an independent man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 1990s was another unexpected period of ordeals for the unconverted long-term prisoners, but we were neither frustrated nor disappointed because we got an inspiration from Kim Jong Il who remained true to Kim Il Sung's will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the firm belief of the unconverted long-term prisoners that Kim Jong Il would bring them back to the motherland at any cost. \r\n\r\n"
