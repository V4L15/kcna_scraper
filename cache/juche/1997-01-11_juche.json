But, he at last revealed his true color as a wicked vampire and a fascist murderer of the worst type who mercilessly bleeds the working people white.\r\n   At the meeting, Kim Young Sam blared that the \"fantastic debate on reunification\" must not be allowed and every security preparedness must be maintained in view of the present relations between the north and the south.\r\n   This reveals his criminal intention to ruthlessly suppress the struggle of workers and other sections of people against the amended laws under the pretext of \"security\" by branding it as an \"illegal act benefitting the enemy\".\r\n   Facts show that the Kim Young Sam group plan to launch another new bloody repressive campaign to lay the institutional foundation needed for the stability and prolongation of power and crack down upon the just struggle of workers and people from other social standings.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group will not be able to dampen the fighting spirit of the South Korean workers and people no matter how desperately they may try, wielding the sword of fascist dictatorship. \r\n   An analyst of Minju Joson says the repression of the struggle for existence and democracy can never serve to prolong the fascist rule. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Ambition for domination revealed\r\n   Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on the New Year press conference of Japanese prime minister Hashimoto.\r\n   He told newsmen that it is time Japan's values and philosophy were disseminated throughout the world. He also called for dispelling the idea that global peace and prosperity can be guaranteed only by the United States.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   None of his predecessors had ever provoked the United States, Japan's senior ally, so unhesitatingly at an official place while calling for disseminating Japan's \"values\" and \"philosophy\" all over the world. \r\n   Japan, an economic power, has embarked on the road to a military power and has grown so arrogant and ambitious as to dream of playing the leadership role in the world.\r\n   Japan's strategic goal is to free itself from U.S. control and virtually hold the position of a major power, with the \"Japan-U.S. security system\" as a springboard.\r\n   It is no accident that Hashimoto not only called for dispelling the idea and view about U.S.-guaranteed global peace and prosperity but also insisted that Japan should \"Guarantee stability in the Asia-Pacific region.\" \r\n   Stability in this region can never, and need not, be guaranteed by Japan. As a matter of fact, Japan is not able to do so.\r\n   \"Dissemination of Japan's values and philosophy throughout the world\" and \"Japan-guaranteed stability in the Asia-Pacific region\" mean Japan's overseas aggression and domination of the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean foreign debts amounting to  dlrs 100 billion\r\n   Pyongyang, January 11 (KCNA) -- The South Korean economy is now at a standstill by the general strike of the workers which is gaining momentum with each passing day in South Korea, according to the recent reports of foreign news media, including reuter, the Japanese Yomiuri Shimbun and Sankei Shimbun.\r\n   The South Korean economy is on the verge of bankruptcy owing to the failure of economic and open market policies pursued by the traitor Kim Young Sam after coming into power.\r\n   Foreign news media have given wide publicity to the bankruptcy of the South Korean economy, saying that South Korea with the \"export-oriented economy\" suffered a deficit of 23 billion dollars in trade last year.\r\n   The Yomiuri Shimbun said that according to the 1996 export statistics issued by the South Korean \"Government\", a balance of payments deficit recorded 23 billion dollars in trade, or 3 times the 7 billion dollars it predicted.\r\n   The figure showed that the deficit increased 230 percent from 10 billion dollars of 1995.\r\n   Foreign debts, too, are exorbitantly high.\r\n   The Sankei Shimbun said that last year foreign debts of South Korea were 100 billion dollars, the highest ever known in history.\r\n   According to foreign news media, the general strike of the South Korean workers suspended the operation of big businesses, brought a great confusion in traffic, hospital and services. This pushes the already ailing South Korean economy into further recession. \r\n   As of the end of last year more than 5,000 enterprises, including some 100 big businesses, were hit and idled,  the damage amounting to 1 billion dollars, they said.\r\n   The labor movement which paralyses key industries has developed into a political strike, shakening the Kim Young sam \"Civilian government\" to its foundations, they added.  \r\n\r\n"
