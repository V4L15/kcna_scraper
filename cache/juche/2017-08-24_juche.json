Let us all the compatriots at home and abroad wage a vigorous struggle to oppose the frantic Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises by the U.S. and its vassal forces!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us all Koreans turn out as one in the nation-wide anti-U.S. sacred struggle for defending the security and peace of the nation, feeling responsible as the masters of their own destinies and peace!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us stage a nation-wide struggle against the attempt to unleash a war by the U.S. introducing THAAD and all other nuclear strategic assets into south Korea!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us invigorate the struggle to frustrate the U.S. moves for igniting a nuclear war everywhere fellow countrymen live!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Let's wage dynamic nationwide struggle to drive out the U.S. forces out of south Korea!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the U.S. invariable ambition to make the Korean peninsula a stronghold for realizing its strategy for putting Northeast Asia under its control. It does not care even though a nuclear war breaks out on this land and tens of thousands of Koreans die. This is the real intension of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's resolutely reject the U.S. arrogant behavior of attempting to turn three thousand-ri land of Korea into a nuclear war theatre and offer the Koreans as cannon fodder of a nuclear war, and strikingly demonstrate the nation's dignity and spirit!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad turn out in the struggle to immediately drive the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces out of south Korea and achieve the lasting peace of the country!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's wage dynamic nationwide movement to make the U.S. forces pay a price for all the crimes it committed against the Korean nation!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Let's resolutely foil the acts of serving the U.S. and the moves for escalating confrontation with the fellow countrymen by the forces standing against the reunification at home and abroad!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tToday the north-south relations have reached the catastrophe and they fail to make even an inch of advance, and the military tension has reached the height on the Korean peninsula. This is attributable to the south side authorities' servile act of following the U.S. vicious policy hostile toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south side authorities have to make a serious option at crossroads of pursuance of outsiders, national independence, peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's never tolerate the vicious traitorous act of leaving the destiny of the nation and its interests to the tender mercy of outsiders but thoroughly reject it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet's denounce the vicious policy of serving the U.S. and the policy of submitting to outsiders and maintain firm stand of national independence and the stand of giving priority to the nation and attaching importance to it!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad get firmly united, foil the U.S. and its followers' frantic moves for provoking a nuclear war and usher in the new era of peace and independent reunification of the country!"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun critica la falta de imparcialidad del Consejo de Seguridad\r\nPyongyang, 24 de agosto (ACNC) -- La \"resolucion de sancion\" inventada en la ONU cuestionando el lanzamiento de prueba del cohete balistico intercontinental de la RPDC como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" constituye de punta a cabo un producto de la brutal campana de aislamiento y atropello de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\tAdelanta asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual difundido hoy, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU nacio para la paz y la seguridad del mundo y no es un medio de despotismo y arbitrariedades de las potencias nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstos paises persiguen abiertamente la ambicion de mantener para siempre la hegemonia nuclear realizando el mayor numero de pruebas nucleares y lanzando a menudo los ICBM.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs el climax de la pauta de doble rasero que tales paises hayan \"fabricado\" las \"resoluciones\", que incriminan las medidas de la RPDC para el incremento de sus fuerzas armadas nucleares de autodefensa, y le impusieran la sancion pretextando la \"violacion\" de esos documentos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre las potencias nucleares de hoy hay un pais que logro la posesion del artefacto nuclear a riesgo de la sancion y presion insistiendo en que \"hay que vender hasta los pantalones si se necesita para poseer las armas nucleares\" y otro que esta sometido a la sancion persistente de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin pensar en ello, hasta esos paises se sumaron a la campana de sancion de EE.UU. criticando absurdamente el arma nuclear y el ensayo de ICBM de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho deja conocer que el Consejo de Seguridad se ha convertido en un espacio de regateo de los intereses de EE.UU. y otras potencias y en un aparato politico de la Casa Blanca para la implementacion de la politica hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al proceder despotico de las fuerzas imperialistas acaudilladas por EE.UU., se desprecian abiertamente los principios de relaciones internacionales reconocidos mundialmente y se invierte lo justo en lo injusto segun los intereses de las potencias nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de ahora comprueba una vez mas el hecho de que solo cuando un pais sea fuerte, podra exponer dignamente su posicion en la escena internacional, defenderse frustrando el extremado egoismo y la ambicion dominacionista de las potencias nucleares y preservar la justicia y los principios de relaciones internacionales."
