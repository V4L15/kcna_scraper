            "content": "Representante coreano ante la ONU envia carta al secretario general de la ONU\r\nPyongyang, 7 de enero (ACNC) -- El representante permanente de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea ante la ONU envio el dia 5 una carta al secretario general de esta organizacion para expresar la opinion sobre la carta de respuesta remitida por el subsecretario general de Asuntos Politicos por el encargo del ex secretario general de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa misiva senala como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuisiera adelantar la conclusion de que la carta enviada por el subsecretario general de Asuntos Politicos no es la respuesta a mi pregunta sobre cual es el fundamento legal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, aprobadas en contra de las pruebas nucleares y el lanzamiento de satelites con fines pacificos de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las cartas al ex secretario general de la ONU fechadas 23 de mayo y 5 de diciembre de 2016, respectivamente, yo pregunte si hay algun articulo en las leyes internacionales que haya estipulado que las pruebas nucleares y los lanzamientos de satelite y cohete balistico constituyen una \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" siendo el fundamento legal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el Secretariado de la ONU ha mencionado solo el articulo 39 del capitulo VII de la Carta de la ONU sin ninguna palabra de respuesta a mi pregunta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya se ha discutido en el circulo juridico internacional, el articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU no puede ser el fundamento legal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 1966, cuando Rhodesia proclamo la independencia desde el regimen colonial de Gran Bretana, el Consejo de Seguridad adopto por primera vez en la historia de la ONU una \"resolucion de sancion\" aduciendo como fundamento legal el articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU. Al respecto, el circulo juridico internacional lo califico de un acto de abuso del poder insistiendo en que la proclamacion de la independencia no es una amenaza o perturbacion de la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta los elaboradores de la Carta de la ONU aclararon que ellos han ideado el articulo 39 teniendo en cuenta un acto de agresion, no para imponer sanciones en el tiempo de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la prueba nuclear o el lanzamiento de satelite y cohete balistico fuera considerada como \"amenaza a la paz y seguridad internacionales\" segun el articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU, el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU debio haber cuestionado e impuesto sanciones a EE.UU. y otros paises que realizaron mas de 2 mil veces las pruebas nucleares y los lanzamientos de satelites y cohetes balisticos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto comprueba claramente que el articulo 39 de la Carta de la ONU no tiene nada que ver con la prueba nuclear o el lanzamiento de satelite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa fabricacion de las ilegales e inmorales \"resoluciones de sancion\" contra la RPDC y la imposicion de las sanciones del tipo de bloqueo que incluyen en su lista de blancos hasta los rifles, balas, arcos y flechas de uso deportivo son precisamente el acto contra la humanidad y civilizacion que amenaza gravemente el derecho a la vida de nuestro pueblo y destruye la civilizacion moderna para hacer al mundo entero volver a la oscura epoca medieval.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa prueba de la bomba H, la de explosion de ojiva nuclear y el lanzamiento de ensayo de ICBM y otros medios de ataque devienen el ejercicio pleno del derecho legitimo estipulado en la Carta de la ONU siendo medidas de autodefensa para adquirir el disuasivo poderoso que pueda eliminar las fuentes de provocacion en el caso de que las fuerzas hostiles violen nuestra soberania y derecho a la existencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras EE.UU. y sus satelites mantengan la amenaza y chantaje nucleares y no dejen de realizar en nuestra nariz los ejercicios de guerra descritos por ellos como \"anuales\", se consolidara significativamente nuestra capacidad autodefensiva y la de ataque preventivo con fuerzas armadas nucleares como su eje.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspero que el Secretariado de la ONU cumpla con su responsabilidad asumida ante la sociedad internacional al considerar seriamente las cuestiones sobre el fundamento legal de las \"resoluciones de sancion\" anti-RPDC y dar respuestas imparciales a ellas en conformidad con la mision basica de la ONU para la paz y seguridad internacionales."
