They confiscated hundreds of thousands of history books related to Tangun in all parts of Korea and burned them. They committed such a hideous distortion of history as painting Tangun as a mythical man. They also forcibly closed Tangun temples handed down to posterity and banned even memorial services for Tangun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All fabrics of social life including politics, economy and culture in south Korea have been Americanized and Japanized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy pursued by leader Kim Jong Il is the best patriotic policy in the world as it makes it possible to protect the independence and dignity of the nation by matchless military muscle. Thanks to this great policy the DPRK is firmly defending the sovereignty of the nation while doing and saying what it likes to do even under the ever-changing situation and the Korean people are defending with pluck and bringing into fuller bloom the cultural heritage which bears witness to advantages of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not until President Kim Il Sung was acclaimed as the leader of the Korean nation that its cultural heritage which had been buried into oblivion due to the past sycophancy and national ruin has been restored to its former glory and shines as a symbol of the independent nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb of King Tongmyong, the founder king of Koguryo, and the tomb of King Wang Gon, the founder king of Koryo, have been restored to their original state to stand majestically as national treasures clearly proving the orthodoxy of the history of the Korean nation under the meticulous guidance of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK was led by the President, the supreme incarnation of the national identity, the patriotic spirit of Chondoism could be estimated as the strong national religion and its activities be actively encouraged in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble patriotic intention of the President who devoted his all to glorifying the advantages of the nation with ardent love for the country and the nation is becoming a stirring reality thanks to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, carrying forward the love of the President for the nation, has invariably trusted and put forward the Chondoists and brought into reality the patriotic idea of Tonghak (a kind of Korean religion) for which Chondoists had longed for more than a hundred years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inspired by his warm patriotism and transparent spirit of national independence, the movement for national reunification is now advancing along the road of independent reunification in the spirit of our nation-first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the advent of the Songun era of prosperity under the rays of the Songun sun the cultural heritage of the Korean nation has attained its highest value and reached the highest watermark of its development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea's Moves to Dispatch Troops to Iraq Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities are working to railroad the \"motion on troop dispatch to Iraq\" through the \"National Assembly\" in a bid to take an active part in the U.S. war against Iraq, says Minju Joson Friday in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean Defense Ministry has already set to work for dispatching an advance unit while stepping up in the final stage the formation of units to be dispatched to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' scheme to dispatch troops to Iraq, yielding to the U.S. pressure, means cooperating with the U.S. and involving themselves in the unjustifiable war, the war of injustice and the war for aggression. It is preposterous for the south Korean military to assert that it is possible to maintain the security of the Korean peninsula and pep up economy only when south Korean troops are sent to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has grown so arrogant through the Iraqi war that it is now carrying on intensive training to apply to the projected Korean war the tactics based on the experience it gained in the Iraqi war after shipping into south Korea lethal weapons it tested in the actual war in Iraq, while openly crying that north Korea is the next target. It is the unanimous view of foreign military experts that the U.S. would start a war in Korea after fully pacifying Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is interested neither in peace nor in security on the Korean peninsula. Troop dispatch to Iraq would bring dark clouds of war over Korea at added pace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military's assertion that troop dispatch to Iraq would revive the economy of south Korea does not stand to reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. has nothing to bring to south Korea. It is its true intention to meet its own interests at the sacrifice of the south Korean economy. It is a gross mistake to think that the U.S. would offer something to south Korea in reward for troop dispatch to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Woefully serious will be the consequences to be entailed by the dispatch of south Korean troops to Iraq, warns the commentary, adding: The south Koreans will never pardon the authorities if they send troops to Iraq to drive them to death.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
