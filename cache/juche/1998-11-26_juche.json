Korean economic bankruptcy\r\nPyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea (GFTUK) published a statement on Wednesday, nearly one year after the South Korean economy was placed under the trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund owing to its catastrophic crisis.\r\n   The statement said:\r\n   Running for \"presidential elections,\"  the present chief executive had committed himself to free South Korea from IMF trusteeship. Although one year has passed since then, however, the crisis of the South Korean economy has been further deepened  and prolonged  instead of being defused.\r\n   The South Korean economy is now breathing its last, heavily saddled with hundreds of billion dollars of foreign debts. Businesses have gone bankrupt en masse, radically  increasing the number of the unemployed, continuously sending  prices soaring up and devaluating the currency. \r\nNow, the \"second crisis\" is looming over the economy.\r\n   After all, the present catastrophic crisis gripping the South Korean economy as a whole is an inevitable result of the present rulers' anti-people flunkeyist and treacherous rule  depending on outsiders.\r\n   The South Korean rulers have fired millions of working masses, yielding to the brigandish demand of IMF. This is as good as a death sentence upon them.\r\n   The statement expressed the expectation that the South Korean workers would draw a serious lesson from the immeasurable misfortunes they have undergone so far under the IMF system and turn out more vigorously in the struggle to defend their independent dignity and vital rights and find a way out by their own efforts. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- Papers here today comment on anti-north war confab between the U.S. President, Bill Clinton, and the South Korean chief executive.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun charges that the recent trip to South Korea of the U.S. President was designed to pursue a \"tough policy against the north\" so as to give a shot in the arm to the authorities in the grip of the unprecedented politico-economic crisis and encourage them to follow the aggressive U.S. Korea policy.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   During the recent trip the South Korean authorities showed hearty response to the \"tough policy against the north\" on the lips of Clinton, their master, and begged for \"support\" for the alleged \"sunshine policy,\" a reversed edition of the anti-north war policy.\r\n   Clinton and the South Korean authorities incited war fever without hesitation over the \"suspicion of underground nuclear facility,\" a product of their plot against the north.\r\n   They alleged that there is an \"underground nuclear facility\" in the north and in case the north refuses to allow an inspection of it, there will be a \"tough countermeasure.\" \r\n   Their allegations are an unbearable provocation to the north. Those allegations of theirs can be made only by war mongers who are running amuck to stifle the north by force of arms.\r\n   We are on the alert against the reckless military provocation moves of the U.S. military and the South Korean bellicose elements. We cannot but take a relevant self-defensive measure.\r\n   We are going to make clear who is to blame for the prevailing tense situation.\r\n   The danger of war is increasing in the Korean peninsula and there is the same tense situation as before the adoption of the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement. The provokers will be held responsible wholly for all the ensuing consequences.\r\n   We remind the bellicose elements at home and abroad of this position of ours.\r\n   Minju Joson warns that if the danger of war increases in the Korean peninsula and the situation goes back to the original state before the adoption of the DPRK-U.S.framework agreement, the U.S. and the South Korean authorities will be held responsible entirely for all the consequences arising therefrom.  \r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, it is a fair reunification formula which does not seek only the supremacy or interests of one side nor does any harm to the other.\r\n   The confederacy formula also calls upon the north and south to reunify the country on the principle of co-existence, one side not conquering the other side or being conquered and not overwhelming the other side or being overwhelmed, which causes neither dispute nor conflict. \r\n   In fact, the reunification by means of confederacy is the most realistic and reasonable way of ensuring the peace of the country under the condition in which different ideas and systems exist in the north and south. It also makes it possible to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country with the united effort of the whole nation in conformity with demands and interests of the nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
