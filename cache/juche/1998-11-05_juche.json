It also fully demonstrated the ardent desire of the Korean people for national reunification and their will to realise it without fail.\r\n   The South Korean authorities have arrested and persecuted the champion of reunification who should highly be praised. \r\nIndeed, they are enemies of reunification and nation. They will certainly face a stern punishment by history and nation.\r\n   They should immediately stop violating her human rights and set her free at once.\r\n   Minju Joson notes:\r\n   The South Korean authorities can never chain nor break the will of Hanchongryon to reunify the country. They should stop persecuting and immediately release the illegally arrested Hwang Son. \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on U.S. \"evacuation drill\" plan\r\n Pyongyang, November 5 (KCNA) -- The United States had planned to stage a drill for \"evacuating\" families of U.S. troops present in South Korea to Japan in mid-October under the simulated condition of \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   The planned \"evacuation drill\" failed to be put into practice owing to bad weather conditions. However, the plan itself shows that the United States has made it a fait accompli to unleash another war on the Korean peninsula and is trying to translate it into practice.\r\n   Evacuation of non-combatants including servicemen's families can be seen only on the eve of war. The world history of war shows that the evacuation is part of war procedures. The United States \"evacuated non-combatant members\" before it invaded the DPRK in June 1950.\r\n   A large-scale war exercise codenamed \"98 Foal Eagle\" is being staged in South Korea with the involvement of a large number of U.S. troops and the South Korean army and many military means including aircraft carriers, amphibious attack vessels and the flagship of the U.S. Seventh Fleet. \r\nSynchronising with the exercise, the \"98 Hwarang\" war game of the South Korean  against the north has now reached the climax.\r\n   It is only too clear what the \"evacuation drill\" planned under such conditions means.\r\n   We value peace but never beg for it.\r\n   If the aggression forces dare ignite a war in Korea, we will rise up in defence of our sovereignty and dignity and make thousand-fold retaliatory strikes at the aggressors.\r\n\r\n"
