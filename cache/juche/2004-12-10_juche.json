            "content": "Japan Not Qualified for Permanent Membership of UNSC \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Committee of the Council for International Solidarity Demanding Japan's Liquidation of the Past called a press conference here on Dec. 8 as regards a joint statement adopted by the council denouncing Japan for making a bid for permanent membership of the UN Security Council while evading its responsibility to apologize and compensate for its crimes committed against humanity in the past.\r\n Hwang Ho Nam, vice-chairman of the DPRK Committee of the council, in a joint statement issued at the conference noted that December 8 is the day Japan started the Pacific War 63 years back, but it has not yet shaken itself of the ill fame of an enemy state nor has it got reconciled with the countries where people are still suffering from the aftermath of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi clarified its intention to make a pitch for permanent membership of the UNSC and asked all countries for cooperation, the Council for International Solidarity strongly opposed this, he said. On behalf of all victims including the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army and victims of the forcible drafting he strongly demanded Japan make an apology and compensation to those victims at the earliest before making such a bid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang recalled that the meeting of coordinators of the council held in Beijing in the latter part of November earnestly discussed measures for intensifying the activities for international solidarity demanding Japan's settlement of its past crimes in 2005, 60 years after Japan's defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explaining the purport and backdrop against which the council released the joint statement for accusing Japan of making a bid to sit on the UNSC, he told the attendants that the committee decided to call a news conference on Dec. 8, 63 years after Japan's start of the Pacific War, to make public the joint statement according to the decision of the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He urged Japan to stop its anachronistic move to evade the liquidation of its past but strive to genuinely get reconciled and cooperate with the Asian people including those victims as early as possible.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Arms Build-up under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- All the Koreans are working hard to achieve reconciliation, peace and reunification true to the June 15 joint declaration while denouncing the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war of aggression against the north. Yet, the south Korean authorities are frantically stepping up the arms build-up to invade the north in collusion with the outsiders who pursue the same aim. This is a perfidy to the joint declaration and an intolerable move for confrontation against reunification as it challenges the country's peace and reunification. Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article.\r\n Branding the south Korean authorities' arms build-up as an act of hostility toward their fellow countrymen in the north with whom they are to get reconciled and cooperate and a grave military provocation, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the inter-Korean relations are concerned, big progress has been made in different fields since the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south of Korea should achieve national cooperation and expand cooperation in the spirit of the joint declaration to create an atmosphere of peace and peaceful reunification and consolidate it. The plan of the south Korean authorities to step up the arms build-up without doing such a thing only goes to clearly prove that they do not recognize the north as a party with which to get reconciled and cooperate but only seek to invade it, considering it as a \"principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their arms build-up is a very dangerous move for a war as this means actively joining the U.S. in its moves to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its military moves to invade the north, keeping pace with the \"reduction\" and relocation of its forces in south Korea and the resultant massive arms build-up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are desperately pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK, while seeking to plug south Korea into the criminal moves to attain its aim. The south Korean authorities' irresponsible act will only put peace and security on the Korean Peninsula at peril and spark a fratricidal war on this land as planned by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities' arms build-up is little short of digging their own graves.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was proved by historic remains found out in ruined kiln No. 1 unearthed in Wonsan-ri of Paechon County and ruined kilns Nos. 2 to 5 in Pongam-ri of Pongchon County of South Hwanghae Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the earthenware from the ruined kilns are trumpet-shaped mouth pot and jar, tray-shaped mouth jar, washbowl, large deep bowl, steamer and others. Many of them are the same with those unearthed around the Anhak Royal Palace and King Tongmyong's mausoleum, relics belonging to the period of Koguryo, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Especially, the kiln remains including plates and bowls are light yellow and greenish gray or grayish blue. Unique and elegant are broken pieces of white celadon painted with yellow, reddish brown and green enamel and with blue and white enamel. They are exactly the same with those discovered in a tomb group in Jian, China and with those in tomb No. 4 unearthed in Puldanggol in Honam-ri, Samsok District, Pyongyang. The tomb No. 4 belongs to the fourth or fifth century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts prove that the world-famous Koryo celadon  originated from the Koguryo porcelain.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

And they selected eight indices of the inherent taste of kimchi and put on a scientific basis the method of preserving the taste with the help of the lactic acid bacilli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The powder, which controls the acid density below 0.8 percent at maximum, keeps the taste of kimchi unchanged and promotes its fermentation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new method is to kill 100 percent of colitis germs and 99.8 percent of other germs and produce 3,000,000- 5,000,000 lactic acid bacilli in kimchi juice per one milliliter by mixing the spices with the powder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The scientists also developed a new method of packing kimchi mixed with the powder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As cabbages are treated with ion water, the taste, color of the packed kimchi remain unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The packed kimchi can be kept for one month in cooling condition and for four to seven days during travel.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
