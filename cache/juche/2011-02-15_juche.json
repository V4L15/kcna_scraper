Germany made a thorough survey of damage done not only to those countries which suffered from it but also to individual organizations and persons. On this basis it took a state measure for reparation while taking criminal actions according to the relevant legal procedures by ferreting out former Nazi war criminals. In this way Germany showed internally and externally its will to break with its past.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the attitude of Japan, the same war criminal state, was quite different from Germany's behavior. Though more than half a century has passed since its defeat, Japan has not yet admitted of its past crimes. It is so brazen-faced as to distort and justify its past crimes, letting loose sheer sophism that it did not invade Asian countries but \"protected\" them from aggression by European and U.S. powers and helped Asian countries in the development of civilization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is shameful for Japan to run the whole gamut of cunning methods to embellish its past crimes and keep them buried into oblivion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The monstrous crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists can neither be played down nor written off no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how frequently an old generation is replaced by a new one. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to pay heed to the warning of the international community that it can never expect better future unless its past crimes are redressed."

A bitter lesson drawn from the preliminary talks is that no success can be expected from dialogue if a dialogue partner pursues confrontation out of evil will. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a bylined article. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK made every possible effort to realize dialogue and negotiations and the public opinion at home and abroad strongly called for the improvement of the north-south relations. The south Korean authorities came out to the preliminary talks, weighed down by this call. But their real intention was to evade public criticism branding them as a group of traitors going against the requirement of the nation and the trend of the times and press for confrontation policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the DPRK took steps for dialogue the south Korean authorities fueled the distrust and confrontation with the north in collusion with foreign forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that they treated the DPRK as the confrontation partner, not as the dialogue partner from the outset. The south side deliberately scuttled the north-south dialogue, displeased with it. Naturally no progress was made in the recent military talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent talks clearly showed that only when the south Korean ruling forces drop the policy for confrontation with fellow countrymen and take the stand for the nation is it possible to open a way for improving the north-south relations and achieving independent reunification."

Korea's Approach towards Dialogue Proposed by DPRK under Fire\r\n Beijing, February 15 (KCNA) -- Wang Linchang, expert on the Korean issue of the Chinese Society for Asia-pacific Studies, contributed an article on the failed north-south military working talks to Huan Qiu Shibao. \n\t\t\t\t\t The article said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One cannot but observe that the north-south military working talks that opened in Panmunjom on Feb. 8 were a great turning point in the efforts of both sides to switch to dialogue from confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These talks, however, failed to narrow down the differences over the \"Cheonan\" warship incident and the Yonphyong Island incident. The working talks ended up getting familiar with each other's stands, failing to fix the specific date for the next round of talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, there was a reception between media of China and south Korea. On way home, a friend of mine put the following question to me: \"At present both the north and the south of Korea call for dialogue. One side asserts unconditional dialogue while the other calls for conditional dialogue. Which side's assertion do you agree with?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I told him a story about the contradictions between the two neighbors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The two neighbors which were in the harmonious relationship quarreled over the issue of profits. Their trade of bitter accusations led to striking blows at each other. If both of them wish to get reconciled, they should let bygones be bygones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The friend had nothing to say.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Generally speaking, if both sides hold contacts for the high-level military talks and make a switchover to an unconditional contact from conditional dialogue, people will regard this as a positive signal and a development helpful to stabilizing the situation on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  In order to solve this big problem, there should be great wisdom. There was a precedent in which both sides displayed such great wisdom in settling their relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The north-south summit clearly showed such high level of wisdom on the part of the two sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Such wisdom finds a vivid expression in the attitudes of both sides looking into the future called national reunification and showing the will for reconciliation and cooperation, putting aside differences before them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK launched a strong offensive for north-south dialogue. Its government, political parties and public organizations proposed having various talks at an early date on the resumption of tour of Mt. Kumgang and the Kaesong industrial zone including the talks between authorities. The precondition was \"unconditional.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This term of \"unconditional\" showed the urgent intention of the DPRK to have dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea stood on the defensive, unable to cope with the above-said strong offensive for dialogue, and reacted to it with \"conditional\" dialogue. Meanwhile, it tried hard to overpower the other side in dialogue by bolstering up the military capability, while paying attention to expanding arms and intensifying military exercises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the north and the south of Korea treat each other as compatriots, this will bring about a phase of appeasement to bring back or prolong what used to be good in the past under new conditions."
