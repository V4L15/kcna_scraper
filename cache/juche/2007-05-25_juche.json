Secondly, the barrier of division must be removed and free travel and a full-scale open-door policy effected between the north and the south.  Thirdly, the north and south must develop their foreign relations on the principle of creating an international climate favorable for the independent, peaceful reunification of the country.  Fourthly, we must develop the dialogue for national reunification.  Fifthly, a nationwide united front for the country's reunification must be formed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy gave correct answers to the principled problems arising in the course of realizing the national reunification and won absolute support and welcome from broad sections of the world people as well as the entire Korean people for its realistic and fair nature.  And its vitality has been clearly proved in practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The policy has positively encouraged the Korean people in their efforts for the reconciliation and unity of the nation and for national reunification over the last ten-odd years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts for national unity and national reunification were turned into a pan-national movement and a new historical era for the reconciliation and collaboration between the north and the south and for an independent reunification opened up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A north-south summit meeting was provided in 2000 for the first time since the division of the nation and the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration gave the new vitality to the fellow-countrymen aspiring after the reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Colorful pro-reunification functions, contacts, co-operations and exchanges in the fields, political, economic and cultural, are being extensively held between the north and south in the teeth of obstructions of the internal and external enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national reunification movement still faces manifold difficulties but the Korean people will achieve the cause of independent reunification without fail with the concerted efforts of the nation.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
