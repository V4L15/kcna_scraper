The banner of the DIU was a banner of Songun, banner of the most vigorous struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is a powerful revolutionary party holding high the banner of single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the greatest feats performed by the DIU was that it gave origin to the unity of revolutionary ranks around the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK has become an ideologically pure party as all its members are replete with the Juche-based Songun idea and the spirit of devotedly defending the leader. And it has become elite ranks in which all members act as one in accordance with the intentions of the leader and fully display the spirit of devotedly implementing them.
