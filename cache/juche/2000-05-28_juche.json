After the rally they staged a street march, conducting propaganda activities. Then they joined the students standing by the front gate of Pusan National University to hold a meeting of citizens and students demanding a stop to suppression of Hanchongryon and repeal of the \"Security Law\" and condemning GIs' massacres of civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hanchongryon was going to hold an exhibition and lecture meeting on the anti-U.S. struggle and the struggle for national reunification on May 27 as planned and then \"its inaugural ceremony\" from 23:00 to 01:00 on May 28.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt also planned to hold a rally at the central district of Pusan and take a street march on Sunday morning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the authorities deployed more than 6,000 policemen of 50 companies in every corner of Pusan city, arguing that Hanchongryon's rally cannot be allowed as it has been defined as an \"enemy-benefiting organization.\" \r\n\r\n"

Discontent with such actions they are now seeking to unleash another war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is none other than the U.S. who manipulated the Kwangju massacre behind the scene and placed the South Korean economy under the trusteeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mass killings in Rogun-ri, the case of spraying defoliant and the intentional bombing in South Korea evidently revealed again the U.S.'s colors as aggressors and murderers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is clear that as long as they remain in South Korea it is impossible to achieve independence and democratization  of the South Korean society and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those hack pressmen will be severely punished by the nation for their dirty and despicable deed. \r\n\r\n"
