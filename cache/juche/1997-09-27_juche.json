The \"guidelines\", however, is a criminal war scenario designed to invade the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and intensify manoeuvrings of aggression and war in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n   While engaging themselves in anti-DPRK campaign over the \"nuclear issue\", the U.S. and Japan started the review of the \"guidelines\" allegedly to respond to the situations in the Korean Peninsula and other areas surrounding Japan. And they revised the original \"guidelines\" to cope with the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula, taking issue with the DPRK. The geopolitical areas that the new guidelines cover remain undefined. But, officials of Japan and the United States repeatedly said that the \"guidelines\" were worked out to aim at the Korean Peninsula before any other areas.\r\n   All the contents of the \"guidelines\" were reviewed to cope with the \"event of contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S., for example, insisted on choosing civil seaports and airports of Japan opposite to the East Sea of Korea for the use of its troops and the U.S. and Japan had discussions on \"economic sanctions,\" \"guerrilla and commando attack,\" \"ballistic missile attack\" and other issues against the DPRK.\r\n   The U.S. and Japan alleged that the guidelines is a new development in bilateral defense cooperation.\r\n   The \"guidelines\" had already begun to be carried into practice before the announcement.\r\n   This shows that the U.S. and Japan are working harder to round off war preparations against the DPRK with the review of the \"guidelines\" as an occasion.\r\n   Such dangerous and anachronistic moves of the U.S. and Japan wrecking peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and the rest of the world cause a great concern of many countries. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
