Cheers of \"hurrah\" raised by participants of the civilian parade represented their firm determination to believe in him as in heaven and follow him in rain or snow. Torchlight held high by youth and students also reflected the unshakable resolve to make a long journey for revolution under his leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand October Festival was a proud one of victors who are devotedly materializing the idea and intention of the party and the leader, in hearty response to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was also a grand political festival which powerfully demonstrated the high organization and discipline of the Korean army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a great pride and honor for the WPK and the Korean people to have staged such a wonderful festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses is an eternal wealth of the Korean revolution and a banner for its certain victory. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
