            "content": "Great leadership for country's prosperity\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Nowadays the progressive people all over the world are extending heartfelt congratulations to General Secretary Kim Jong Il in connection with the lapse of 35 years since he started work  at the central committee of the Worker's Party of Korea (WPK) (June 19).   This represents the progressives' boundless trust in and praise of Kim Jong Il for his enduring feats.   Kim Jong Il has decorated the 35 years in this land with prosperity with the party as a weapon for making the revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the 60's he made the revolution in the literary and art field that plays an important role in the party's ideological work and helped Korea enjoy a reputation as a \"source of revolutionary renaissance in the 20th century.\"\r\n   He proclaimed the program of modeling the whole society on the Juche idea in February Juche 63 (1974) and gave guidance to the work to transform the nature, society and people as required by Juche, thus ushering in the heyday in the 70's and 80's.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis period witnessed such an amazing success as the \"70-day battle\" recorded in the history of the economic construction and the appearance of a number of edifices conducive to strengthening the foundation of self-reliant national economy, including the laying of the large-scale long-distance belt conveyer in the Unryul Mine and the Musan-Chongjin  long-distance concentrates transport pipelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"period of Pyongyang prosperity\" that demonstrated the powerful national strength was also registered in building the Tower of the Juche Idea, the Arch of Triumph, the Grand People's Study House, the Pyongyang Maternity Hospital, the Changgwang and Munsu streets, and in completing over 260 projects including Kwangbok Street for the 13th world festival of youth and students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All edifices that had sprung up in the thick of the \"speed of 80's\", including the construction of the West Sea Barrage, the northern railways, ore-dressing plant no. 3 of the Komdok Mining Complex, are permeated with the great tireless efforts and total dedication of Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ever since the beginning of the 90's, the DPRK has undergone unprecedented trials and difficulties due to the breakdown of socialism in the former Soviet Union and east European countries and the isolation and suffocation moves of the imperialists.\r\n   The severe natural disasters for the last several consecutive years have adversely affected the national economy as a whole making it impossible to supply necessary food and daily necessities to the people sufficiently.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this historical period known as the \"arduous march\" in the revolutionary history of Korea, Kim Jong Il tided over the harsh difficulties of the revolution, realized the cause of upholding the immortal leader and defended socialist Korea with unshakable faith and will.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAt a time when the world was concerned about the destiny of Korea, the single-hearted unity of the leader, the party and the masses was attained in Korea and with its strength Korea could be listed as a state possessing a satellite and demonstrate the greatness of Korea of Kim Il Sung to the world, thus providing a creditable guarantee for building a powerful state. This is unthinkable apart from the leadership of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Bright is the future of Korea as it is led by Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The world will, in the near future, witness the reality of Korea that has emerged a powerful state. \r\n \r\n"

Therefore, in case other countries overtake or outstrip the U.S. in the field of ultramodern technology, it spreads preposterous rumour that they illegally \"stole or obtained technology from the U.S.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Recalling that China dismissed the \"Cox report\" as a fabrication and many in the U.S. view the \"report\"  as a distorted one, the paper says.    Having the biggest nuclear arsenal on the earth, the U.S. is posing a nuclear threat and creating a danger of a nuclear war. It is overheated with fever over other countries' nuclear issues, while covering up its own crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNow lost in \"persecution mania,\" the u.s. Does not bother to describe \"exchanges and cooperation\" that have been under way as part of the efforts to build \"strategic partnership,\" as \"theft of secrets.\"\r\n   The U.S. is well advised not to waste time searching other countries' nuclear facilities but exert more efforts to take a measure for the elimination of its nuclear weapons, as demanded by humankind. \r\n\r\n"

The book published in December 1818 is a systematic and scientific review of experience and theories which were accumulated in astronomical and meteorological observation in a long period.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The book has 4 volumes.\r\n   Vol. 1 of the book deals with the \"Soungwan\" institution's  official position, its system  and standards for the astronomical and meteorological observation.\r\n   Vols. 2, 3 and 4 deal with the theory of calendar, old records on astronomy and meteorology, books on astronomy and meteorology, observation apparatuses and remarks.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recorded in the book are eight classified abnormal phenomena such as comet and earthquake and 25 classified phenomena such as solar eclipse, lunar eclipse, rain, snow and fog as well as methods of observing and recording each phenomenon. For example, there was the \"Thaebaekjuhyon\" which described the phenomenon of the Venus being visible in a clear sky as an unusual phenomenon at the time before the publication of the \"Soungwanji.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut the Soungwanji deals with it as an usual phenomenon which can usually be visible in a certain direction at a certain time depending on the distance between the sun, the Venus and the earth. It gives eight definitions to rain.\r\n   This means that astronomy and meteorology in Korea had clear aspects and system as a natural science. \r\n\r\n"

Articles reported by media and slogans displayed in streets and work-sites carry the determination of the Korean people to build a powerful socialist nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among them are such phraseology as \"Untiring efforts\", \"Let us create things from nothing \", \"One minute and one second for the fatherland\", \"Let all of us become heroes\", \"Everything by oneself\", \"Let us highly display the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance.\"   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They reflect the firm resolution and mettle of the Korean people to build at all costs a powerful nation through self-reliance by tiding over all sorts of difficulties caused by blockades, isolation and suffocation moves of the imperialists and the continued natural disasters.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The phraseology \"One minute and one second for the fatherland\" mirrors the style of work of the Korean people.   The Korean workers and all other people are working hard, counting every second and minute.   They are performing feats in every second and minute while the scientists are devoting themselves to fresh scientific researches and invention, saving time.   The pilot hero Kil Yong Jo set a lofty example of resolutely defending the leader in 25 seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Also popular are such phraseology as \"Everybody is master of farming\", \"Goal to be attained at a time\", \"As the men work hard, the field seethes\", \"Let us begin transplanting rice seedlings in a creditable manner\" \"Paddy field is the work place for officials,\"  \"Let us ensure full-capacity operation of the rice transplanting machines\", \"Actions speak louder than words.\"  They represent the patriotic zeal of the Korean people who have vigorously turned out in farming in the same sense of responsibility for farming as that of agricultural workers.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Man who treasures a gun is a loyal subject\", \"Relay club of a frontline soldier that carries forward the spirit of preceding generation\", \"Let us live today, too, as we did in wartime days\", \"Let us not forget the bloody lesson\" and \"Road of defending socialism\" -- this phraseology reflects the unshakable determination of the Korean people to resolutely defend and glorify the socialist system.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among them are \"Let's always be cheerful, although our path is thorny \" \"Are you running at a canter?\"  \"Second grand Chollima march\", \"Let us make a breakthrough on a steed\" and \"Let us work as in those days when the country seethed with enthusiasm to build the country\", which indicate that the Korean people are now running at a canter making a new breakthrough toward building a powerful nation, full of confidence and optimism. \r\n\r\n"
