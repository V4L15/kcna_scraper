            "content": "Abe's Wicked Sophism under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, Abe, chief Cabinet secretary of Japan, asserted that it is the view of the government that it would be impossible to normalize DPRK-Japan relations unless the \"abduction issue\" is settled and called for \"sincere response\" from Pyongyang.\r\n Minju Joson today observes in a signed commentary in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most essential for settling the issues related to the DPRK-Japan relations is not the \"abduction issue\" but the issue of Japan's liquidation of its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan originated from Japan's crime-woven past and these bilateral relations have not yet improved chiefly because Japan has not redressed its crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bilateral relations have steadily deteriorated since Japan's invasion of Korea. Japan has long sought a chance to invade Korea and reduced it to a colony more than 100 years back. As a result, the Korean people's grudge and resentment against Japan have been pent up and the bilateral relations have gone from bad to worse. Japan, however, has not made any apology and compensation to the Korean people for such crimes committed against them historically and, on the contrary, worked hard to evade its responsibility for them though 60 years have passed since its defeat in the World War II.\r\n This time Abe distorted the basic issue in the settlement of the bilateral relations in a bid to attain his sinister political aim. He is keen to sacrifice even the important matters related to establishing state relations with other country in a bid to improve his personal image and satisfy his greed for power. Worse still, he negated even Japan's legal and moral responsibility for the settlement of its past, thereby encroaching upon even the future interests of the state in the long run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan can never succeed in its unreasonable bid to go without settling its past wrongs at any cost, turning its face away from the hardcore point in the bilateral relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
