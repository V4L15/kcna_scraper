            "content": "Upgrading Japan Defence Agency to Ministry Termed Move for Overseas Invasion \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 22 (KCNA) -- Some days ago the House of Councilors in the land of Japs finally adopted the bill on upgrading the Defense Agency to the Defence Ministry at its session despite strong protest at home and abroad in the wake of the passage of the bill through the House of Representatives.\r\n This is a very dangerous development indicating that the Japanese reactionaries' scenario for overseas invasion has entered into the phase of its full-scale implementation, says Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has systematically increased its military spending for the past years to bolster the \"Self-Defence Forces\" as modern regular forces, thus emerging a country with the world's second largest military spending next to the U.S., the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reactionaries of the island country have worked hard to lay a legal foundation for hurling the SDF into any part of the world while developing it into offensive-type troops for aggression. They drastically revised the \"Law on Self-Defence Forces\" enacted in 1954 under the pretexts of \"rescuing overseas Japanese in case of emergency,\" \"emergency in the surrounding areas,\" \"cooperation in the war on terrorism,\" etc. They also enacted the \"Law on Cooperation in UN Peace-keeping Operations,\" \"Law on Emergency in Surrounding Areas,\" \"Law on Special Measures to Combat Terrorism,\" \"Law Related to Emergency\" and other laws. All this was meant to lay a legal foundation for the overseas dispatch of the SDF and its operations there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The upgrading of the agency to the ministry made it possible for the SDF to conduct overseas military operations as its major mission and this land of Japs to round off all preparations for launching overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' replacement of the \"pacifist constitution,\" which they have maintained for form's sake, by a war constitution would mean clearing the last stumbling block in their way for overseas aggression. It is not hard to imagine what serious consequences this alarming development will entail.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
