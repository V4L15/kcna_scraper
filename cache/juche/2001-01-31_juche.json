            "content": "Japanese defence agency chief's solicitation diplomacy under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 31 (KCNA) -- Japanese Defence Agency director general Saito, when meeting with the commander-in-chief of the French armed forces during the former's visit to France, said that \"there is little change in Pyongyang's missile development program\" and wooed France to help set out a proposal drawing \"global attention\" to check it.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses this as a remark revealing Japan's sinister intention to escalate the false propaganda against the DPRK and internationalize its moves to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also lurking behind his remark is Japan's mean attempt to drive a wedge between the DPRK and the EU in the process of warming their relations and isolate Pyongyang, the commentary observes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature of the DPRK's missile issue will remain unchanged no matter how strongly outsiders demand or pressurize it as this issue belongs to its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not hide its missile development, for it is a self-defensive military measure against the moves of the hostile forces to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK warns again the Japanese reactionaries against frequenting other countries to entreat them to join their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK in a bid to meet their selfish purpose from the onset of the first year of the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to swim with the trend of the times in the new century towards reconciliation, friendship, peace and development if it does not wish to bite the dust.    \r\n\r\n"

That is why Japan is stepping up its moves to turn Japan into a logistic base on the premise of the outbreak of the second Korean war in a bid to meet another \"golden shower\" by offering its land as a logistic base of the U.S. imperialist aggression troops and leaving its industry and manpower at their disposal just as it did during the last Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves are a continuation of its dangerous adventures. They, in fact, clearly indicate Japan's continued pursuance of its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should clearly know that the new century is not like the past century when they invaded and plundered Korea and other parts of Asia as they pleased backed by a big country, and stop their adventurous moves for a war of reinvasion.    \r\n\r\n"
