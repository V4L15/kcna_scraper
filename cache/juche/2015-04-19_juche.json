Paektu Area\r\nPyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- Fighter pilots of the Korean People's Army toured the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu from April 11, on orders of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t On April 17 Kim Jong Un met on the spot with those pilots who successfully finished the tour and gave a pep-talk to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He attended an oath-taking meeting of the fighter pilots held in the compound of the Samjiyon Grand Monument where the statue of President Kim Il Sung stands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made a speech there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he was very pleased to meet them in Samjiyon County where leader Kim Jong Il was born and which is very near to Mt. Paektu, a sacred mountain of the revolution where the Songun (army-first) revolution began and the Korean revolution took root.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he made a long journey, shelving all the state affairs, not only to show his love for the fighter pilots but also to implant the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, deeper in the hearts of them who spent the Day of the Sun, the greatest national holiday, in snow-stormy Mt. Paektu area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is most precious for the fighter pilots is the revolutionary faith, he said, and went on: Showdown in the sky is that of idea and faith and the revolutionary faith and spirit is the basic factor decisive of victory in showdown in the sky where there is no room to step back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fixed resolution and will of the Workers' Party of Korea to defend the revolutionary traditions and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche in the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu, he stressed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is hard to expect the victory of the Korean revolution without the revolutionary traditions and the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, he said, adding: We should struggle with burning hearts, like the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters who won victory weathering all hardships and ordeals, always looking up to Mt. Paektu, and thus glorify the revolutionary feats of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for all ages and carry forward the revolutionary traditions of Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He indicated the tasks and ways for a fresh turn in rounding off the combat preparations of the Air and Anti-Air Force and strengthening its combat capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fighter pilots should become the first followers and implementers of the Party's idea and cause and thus lead the whole army in making it politically, ideologically and morally stronger, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also called upon them to keep themselves in a regular combat posture, under the slogan that they always wait only for the sortie order from the Party, and firmly prepare themselves to be a-match-for-a-hundred red goshawks defending the Party and the revolution in the sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Party entrusts the very clear and blue sky of the country entirely to the fighter pilots, he said, adding he would always stand by the heroic fighter pilots defending the country's blue sky.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ardently called upon all of them to vigorously fight for the final victory in the building of a thriving socialist nation, cherishing deeper in mind the revolutionary spirit of Paektu, the spirit of the blizzards of Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then oath-taking speeches were made at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers made a firm resolution that the red goshawks of Kim Jong Un's guerilla army would carry through the important tasks set forth by the Supreme Commander in his historic speech and thus dash toward the targets, pointed by the Supreme Commander, before anyone else when an order is issued and win in the great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A letter of pledge to the Supreme Commander was adopted at the meeting. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Supreme Commander had a photo session with members of the KPA fighter pilots' expedition of the revolutionary battle sites in Mt. Paektu area in front of the statue of Kim Il Sung at the Samjiyon Grand Monument. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Choe Ryong Hae, Kim Yang Gon, Ri Jae Il and Ri Pyong Chol."

Paektu and undergoes the blizzards over it, one can experience its real spirit and harden the resolution to accomplish the Korean revolution. Climbing Mt.

Paektu is not yet over, he expressed expectation and belief that the fighter pilots would fully discharge their mission as heirs to the Songun revolution.
