            "content": "Koreans Called upon to Force U.S. to Pay for Blood Shed by Them \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Koreans will never forget the monstrous massacres committed by the U.S. imperialists but certainly force them to pay for the blood shed by them.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary, 60 years since the U.S. imperialists massacred workers in Hwasun Coal Mine, South Jolla Province, the first mass-killing of Koreans after their occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On August 15, 1946 the U.S. made a surprise attack on the coal miners on their way to Kwangju to participate in the event to mark the first anniversary of the liberation of the country and killed them by mobilizing troops, planes and tanks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The past more than six decade-year long history of the U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea was a history of massacre and plunder. The October popular resistance, Jeju islanders' uprising, soldiers' revolt in Ryosu, the April popular uprising, October resistance for democracy and the Kwangju popular uprising were savagely put down by the beast-like U.S. imperialists. Many civilians fell victim to their medieval crackdown and massacre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also committed monstrous massacres of Koreans after provoking a war of aggression against Korea in the mid-20th century. Their mass killings of innocent civilians in the temporarily occupied northern half of Korea, to say nothing of the brutalities perpetrated by them in different parts of south Korea including Rogun-ri, were crimes against humanity that baffled human imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The souls of those Koreans who met tragic deaths in different parts of this land at the hands of the U.S. imperialists whose brutality and bestial nature far surpassed those of the Hitler clique  to loudly cry for the punishment of these man killers. Even a thousand days would not be enough to indict the U.S. imperialists for their mass killings of Koreans. They are now working hard with blood-shot eyes to launch aggression and war to inflict a nuclear holocaust upon the Korean nation. The U.S. imperialist aggressors are the sworn enemy of the Koreans with whom they can not live under the same sky.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Wild Ambition for Comeback to Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government recently approved the \"2006 white paper on defence\".\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary carried in this regard terms the white paper a document for aggression and war as it reveals the Japanese reactionaries' invariable wild ambition to stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries in the \"white paper\" unreasonably raised a hue and cry over \"threat\" from the DPRK once again, the commentary says, and continues:\r\n This is aimed at securing a legal pretext for the reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the Japanese reactionaries to grumble about \"threat\" from the DPRK. They seek to realize their dream of reinvasion of Asia, backed by the U.S. In the meantime, the U.S. is keen to carry out its Asian strategy for aggression with ease with Japan as a main player. The Japanese reactionaries in the \"white paper\" asserted that it is necessary to boost the Japan-U.S. alliance in order to ensure peace and security in Japan and its vicinity. This is an indication that they are working hard to realize their wild ambition for reinvasion by strengthening the military collusion with the U.S. \r\n They regard the DPRK as the primary target of their overseas aggression. Their noisy call for \"preemptive attack\" upon the \"enemy's\" base is aimed at staging a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the \"white paper\" they also claimed that Tok Islet is part of the inalienable territory of Japan, thereby betraying their wild ambition to reinvade Korea. Now that all arrangements have been made for staging a comeback to Korea, they are set to turn the islet into an area of international dispute in a foolish bid to internationalize the issue and secure a legal pretext for reinvading Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the \"white paper\" they made much ado about the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK and described Tok Islet as part of the \"inalienable territory\" of Japan. This is a shameless provocation against the DPRK and a reckless act of a gangster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion have gone beyond the danger line. They are seized with such day dream that they are oblivious of the grave consequences to be entailed by their moves for reinvasion. They would be well advised to stop such reckless acts of disturbing peace and stability in Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Ceaseless Bomb-Dropping Exercises Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued information bulletin No. 921 in connection with the disclosure of the fact that U.S. fighters keep conducting bomb-dropping exercises in the air over the firing range of the U.S. forces in Maehyang-ri, Hwasong County, Kyonggi Province, south Korea which they claimed \"closed\" a year ago.\r\n The bulletin said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The continued bomb-dropping exercises of the U.S. forces in the air over the area of Maehyang-ri are an intolerable insult and mockery of the south Korean people and a blatant challenge to the public opinion at home and abroad as they bring to light the attempt of the U.S. to continue using the firing range in Maehyang-ri. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now pressurizing the south Korean side to offer another firing range for the U.S. forces under the pretext of closing the firing range in Maehyang-ri. This is, indeed, the demand of a brigand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is utterly indifferent to the fate of the south Korean people and doing whatever it pleases in south Korea, even misleading the public opinion in order to meet its aggressive interests and serve its purpose of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-loudmouthed \"transfer of military bases,\" \"transfer of the right to war-time operation\" and \"reduction of the U.S. forces\" are nothing but a charade intended to evade the U.S. forces' withdrawal from south Korea. These phraseologies are, in essence, aimed at perpetuating the presence of its forces in south Korea and escalating their war moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people from all walks of life should see through the deceptive nature of the U.S., hold higher the anti-U.S., anti-war slogans and turn out as one in the struggle to take back Maehyang-ri usurped by the foreign occupation forces and drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Redeem Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 14 (KCNA) -- The Korean people will surely force Japan to pay generation after generation for all the human and material losses and mental pain the Korean nation suffered under the 40 odd year-long medieval military fascist rule of the Japanese imperialists. A spokesman for the DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and Victims of Forcible Drafting declared this in a statement issued Monday in connection with the fact that Pak Yong Sim, victim of sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army, died in Kangso County, South Phyongan Province, at the age of 85 on Aug. 7 with her bitter grudge against the Japanese imperialists unsettled. \r\n The truth about what Pak suffered provided a most typical example of the criminal sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army that has been proved by irrefutable evidence and witnesses and widely known worldwide, the statement noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government has not yet uttered even a single word of apology nor paid even a penny in compensation though more than six decades have passed since then.\r\n This behavior added to the sufferings and grudge of the victim and resulted in damaging her health and this was the main cause of her death. \r\n As the victims unanimously hold, the Japanese government has persistently resorted to delaying tactics with the calculation that it would be no longer responsible for liquidating Japan's past if there remains none of the victims, the witnesses of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past. \r\n The Japanese government should drop its anachronistic ambition to evade the settlement of the past and honestly repent of all the hideous human rights abuses and clarify them and, on this basis, opt for redressing the past crimes as early as possible. It should make full compensation to the dead and their bereaved families.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

For this purpose, they took Korean and other Asian people as the objects of murderous living body test. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unit 731 was so notorious among them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists called the objects \"logs\" at that time and sent hundreds of Koreans and Chinese to Unit 731 for living-body test annually in accordance with the \"special supply system\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It carried out most barbarous experiments on them beyond of human imagination. They included putting a living body in a centrifuge and turning it, changing the whole blood of human body with that of monkey or horse and filling the stomach with poisonous gas or rotten tissue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It drove people into an enclosed room and blew poisonous gas into it to measure how long they survived and take pictures of their wriggling scenes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Documents on such barbarities and biochemical weapons including poison-gas bombs are being discovered one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was disclosed recently that the Japanese imperialists planned to mount an attack with germ weapons right after their surrender in the world war and the task was assigned to Unit 731. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Japanese imperialists handed over the materials on the germ and poison-gas experiments conducted on more than 3.6 million people to the U.S. imperialists and helped them on the spot. They also mass-produced and supplied large amounts of war equipment and bio-chemical weapons to the United States to drop various kinds of germ and poison-gas bombs upon the Korean people, during the Korean War.\r\n Japan is bound to be punished by Korean people for its cruel living-body tests and the bio-chemical warfare.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It, worthy of national treasure, was published in Pyongyang for the first time in April 1226. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book was published in reflection of the demand of the then times for developing an independent medicine.
