However, a  long spell of dry weather in the sowing season has  impeded the growth of the crops.\r\n   Worse still,  the tidal wave and cold weather which hit different areas, including the east coast and northern inland of Korea, in early June brought heavy damage to the growth of the crops, so the harvest of early crops, including potato, barley and wheat, cannot be expected.\r\n   This year, too, therefore, the shortage of food remains a difficult problem.\r\n   An increasing number of households are running short of food.\r\n   The people are tapping all possibilities and reserves and eking out  their living in reliance upon substitute food.\r\n   All the families improve methods of processing staple food and  lessen the amount of meals in order to support themselves in such  adversity.\r\n    The Korean people are moving ahead merrilly in the teeth of the present difficulties.\r\n   They are convinced that led by General Kim Jong Il, they will certainly emerge victorious.\r\n   They, under the slogan \"Let's be always cheerful though our way is thorny \" Are stepping up socialist economic construction in high spirits.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Without their participation the  opening of the festival is unimaginable.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not turn down their just demand for the participation in the festival but stop the suppression of them at once.\r\n   For an atmosphere of the festival, they should also abolish the \"National Security Law,\" which is standing in the way of the country's reunification, unconditionally release patriotic-minded students and pro-reunification activists and expel Kang In Dok, a thorough-paced separatist, from the post of \"Minister of National Unification.\"    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Territorial problem, dowry for \"misalliance\"   = KCNA commentary =\r\n Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- Foreign media have commented on the unofficial Russo-Japanese summit held in the Japanese coastal city of Kawana in April and the \"New hashimoto Proposal\" brought forward by the Japanese Prime Minister at the summit.\r\n   According to Japanese sources, the \"new proposal,\" which boilds down to \"formula of Hong Kong,\" envisages that boundaries will be drawn in a certain section of the southern kuriles and the troubled islands be gradually retroceded to Japan.\r\n   Japan is now eager to see Russia's reaction to the proposal.\r\n   It, hoping that there will be an affirmative response to the proposal from Russia at an official summit scheduled to be held in Moscow in late autumn this year, has expressed \"optimistic expectations of good results.\"\r\n   The fact proves that Japan's deep-rooted desire for territorial expansion has become all the more frantic under the pretext of the conclusion of a \"peace treaty\" and \"solution to the territorial dispute\" since the collapse of the Soviet Union.\r\n   A Russian radio made clear long ago that since the collapse of the soviet union Japan had been deeply interested in kuriles in a bid to settle its claim for the islands with a new position by boosting its military and economic power and winning a permanent seat on the United Nations Security Council. Japan also intends to build a nuclear testing ground and nuclear facilities on the islands, said the radio.\r\n   Meanwhile, Russia has taken a prudent attitude towards Japan's position. Foreign media describe such an attitude of Russia as an expression of caution.\r\n   According to foreign media reports, the deputy chief of the Presidential Administration, who accompanied President Yeltsin in his Japan visit, told inhabitants of Kunashir, one of the troubled islands, that Russia has no waste land, so they should not lend an ear to the rumour that the southern kuriles will be put under other country's jurisdiction in future. After returning home, Yeltsin stated that there were no discussions on change of the border during the visit.\r\n   A German newspaper said, \"Russia has already been in the grip of an economic crisis. But the retrocession of the kuriles may be as good as a political suicide for Yeltsin. \r\n   The Russians, who lost their prestige in the international community after the collapse of the socialist bloc and the Soviet Union, may regard the disclaimer of even an inch of their land as an insult to national dignity.\"\r\n   In actuality, the territorial dispute between Russia and Japan was caused by the war of aggression started by Japan.\r\n   In the past Japan unleashed wars of aggression and plunder against not only Russia but Korea and other Asian countries and committed immeasurable crimes including the \"comfort women\"-related crime.\r\n   Though half a century has passed since the end of the war, Japan has still refused to make an apology and compensation. It has served the united states as its shock brigade for aggression on Asia. It has already become a dangerous belligerent force thrusting its aggressive claws into the northeast Asian region including the Korean peninsula.\r\n   Shamelessly, however, Japan has sought only a solution to the territorial dispute with Russia under the pretext of the \"postwar settlement,\" fully revealing its political and moral baseness and shamelessness.\r\n   A Russian newspaper said no progress was made in Russo-Japanese relations at the Kawana summit due to the territorial problem and that a \"dowry,\" that is the four islands, still remains to be solved in the \"marriage\" between the two countries.    It described the bilateral ties as \"misalliance.\"\r\n   Japan, which has not yet cleared itself of the stigma as \"enemy state,\" had better properly make an apology and compenstation for its disgraceful history and refrain from hurting the security of the northeast Asian region and obstructing Korean reunification, instead of getting mad in one-sided love and drawing worldwide ridicule.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
