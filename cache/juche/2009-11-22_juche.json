Its basic factor is the decadent material life, poor mental and cultural life and reactionary political life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In capitalist society where exploitation and plunder by capital are getting evermore pronounced and the people are not allowed to be put under the state protection, it is impossible to expect the equality in material life no matter how much material wealth increases. The rich are steadily getting richer and the poor are getting poorer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The capitalist class massively spreads the reactionary and anti-popular idea and culture and the way of corrupt bourgeois life in a bid to benumb the independent ideological consciousness of the working masses, make the people meekly serve the capitalist system of exploitation and reduce them further into the slaves of money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The escalated pauperization in mental and cultural life can never be deterred in those countries under the capitalist social system which is based on extreme selfishness and the almighty dollar principle and governed by the law of the jungle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The imperialists and monopoly capitalists are enforcing the reactionary politics in a craftier way while more tightly taking hold of the state mechanism to keep their ruling system which is worsening day by day. On one hand they oppress and keep the working masses under their control by means of appeasement and deception and, on the other hand, fascistize the reactionary ruling mechanism and intensify the aggression and war policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For its anti-popular nature, the capitalist system can never tide over imbalance between the deformed material life and the mental and cultural life getting poorer and imbalance between the popular masses' growing demand for independence and the political life getting more reactionary."
