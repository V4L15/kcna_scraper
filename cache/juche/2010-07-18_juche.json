These resolutions were in gross violation of the UN Charter as they were worked out without any correct investigation into the truth about the outbreak of the Korean War and forcibly adopted without the participation of a DPRK delegate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Using its dominant position at the UNSC, the U.S. manipulated behind the scene this body to work at its proposal and contain the false contents against the DPRK in those resolutions of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists wantonly violated all the regulations related to operation of the UNSC session and never invited a DPRK delegate to the adoption of the said resolutions. In this way they cooked up the illegal resolutions that shifted the blame for the Korean War on to the DPRK and gave the name of \"UN forces\" to their aggressor forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have often besmirched the reputation of the UN for more than half a century and are still injuring the world community's trust in the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They seek to commit in the DPRK the same crime as they did in Iraq by usurping the name of the UN. In recent years they did not hesitate to commit such despicable actions as escalated sanctions and pressure upon the DPRK by calling to task its exercise of independent rights including the legitimate satellite launch and abusing the UNSC. These actions would bring the Korean Peninsula to the dangerous situation in which a war may break out at any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves of the U.S. imperialists are intended to provoke another June 25 war, the second Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists should never do such action of abusing the UN to conceal its criminal colors as a provoker of war as done in the past."

However, member states of NATO including France and Germany are independently exercising the right to command their armies. It is only south Korea in the world which has left the right to command its army to foreign army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief executive of south Korea can never hide his pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous nature, revealed through the above-said extension, with any excuses and tricks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should behave themselves, bearing deep in mind the fact that sycophancy and dependence on foreign forces only lead to shame and destruction."

Korea Urged\r\n Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- An acute confrontation is now taking place between the ruling and opposition parties, the progressive and conservative forces and the democratic forces and the dictatorial forces in south Korea in the run-up to \"parliamentary by-elections.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t In this regard Rodong Sinmun Sunday says in a signed article:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the people from all walks of life standing against the conservative group rise up as one in unity, they can successfully defeat the dictatorial forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is proved by the last \"elections to local self-governing bodies\". The progressive forces' sweeping victory over the ruling conservative forces in the \"elections\" reconfirmed the truth that the people are always righteous and any appeasement and blackmail can never check the popular masses' aspiration and strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people should redouble their efforts to inflict another crushing defeat on the fascist dictatorial forces in the forthcoming \"by-elections\" in the same way as they dealt a telling blow at the group of traitors in the last \"elections\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group's defeat in the \"elections\" does not mean the end of its high-handed practices, and the ruling conservative forces are making more frantic efforts to maintain their remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more serious is the fact that the conservative group is persisting in its anti-reunification \"policy toward the north.\" The group is still pursuing the policy for confrontation with the DPRK in league with foreign forces, instead of drawing a serious lesson from the collapse of inter-Korean relations and danger of war caused by its criminal \"policy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The old forces do never give in of their own accord, and those doomed to downfall make more desperate efforts. This is a serious lesson taught by the present stern reality and the Korean nation's history of reunification movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people should more vigorously wage the struggle for independence against the U.S., for democracy against dictatorship and for national reunification, not remaining satisfied at the victory in the \"elections\"."

In the postwar period it built a socialist power, independent in politics, self-supporting in the economy and self-reliant in national defence, in the flames of the Chollima great surge. And it reliably defended socialism despite the severe trials of the \"Arduous March\", the forced march and made world-startling epochal changes through the new revolutionary great surge last year. These successes were ascribable to the fact that the popular masses were trained to be persons strong in ideology and faith and their mental power was displayed to the full.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The idea that the strong mental power of the popular masses represents the foremost national power is imbuing all the servicepersons and people with the great pride and self-esteem that our country is an invincible socialist power with the strongest national power. It is also serving as the inspiring banner that enables our army and people to push ahead with the advance for great surge, full of conviction in sure victory and optimism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With this strong mental power of the army and people, the single-minded unity of the DPRK remains so steadfast and its army grows stronger and our country is fully demonstrating its dignity as the fortress of independence and the invincible socialist bulwark making rapid progress toward a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is well proven by the present stirring reality in which epoch-making events for opening the gate to a thriving nation are taking place one after another across the country and the hot wind of making new leap forward and pushing back the frontiers of latest science is sweeping all over the country, considerably increasing the might of the Juche-oriented industry."
