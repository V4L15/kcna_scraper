They were disseminated after taking formal shape as a new variety of music in the 1920s-1930s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These songs were created by Jo Ryong Chul, Ri Myon Sang, An Ki Yong, Ri Kon U and other conscience-minded musicians who strove hard to preserve the soul of the nation.  They vividly reflected grief over the sufferings of the nation, burning patriotism and aspiration for the new. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The discovery of these songs has made it possible to fill up a blank in the history of music which has remained unknown for a long time and estimate their value as national treasure and heritage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Many pamphlets on those songs are being brought out amid the deep attention of the Worker's Party of Korea and the state to the development of the national music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the literature and art press group published \"Collection of Selected Songs Dating Back To Period of Enlightenment\", which contains the newly discovered 34 songs dating back to the period of enlightenment, 52 children's songs, 18 lyric songs, 59 new folk songs and 27 popular songs. Edited in the collection are original copies of music of songs as well as the background against which they were created, years in which they appeared, names of creators and relevant historical materials to help the readers clearly understand social conditions, the level of creation and people's taste in those days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The press group will publish pamphlets, including \"Collection of New Folk Songs\", \"Collection of Lyric Songs and Children's Songs\" and \"Collection of Popular Songs\" which deal with different branches. \r\n\r\n"

The pond is about 30 hectares wide and its bottom is layered with mud over sand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This amphibian tortoise is native to northeast Asia. The specimens occur in Kosong and Thongchon counties of Kangwon Province, Jangphung county in Kaesong city and Paechon, Yonan and Ongjin counties of South Hwanghae Province. Its shell averages 15 to 20 cm in length and it weighs 1.2 to 1.5kg. The shell is divided into top shields, or solid plates and underside shields. Normally found on ponds or riversides, it feeds on fish and frogs but can go without food for several years on end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its four thick and short legs are charcoal gray and its webfoot enable it to swim. It lays three to nine white eggs and buries them in the sand. The eggs are hatched in 60 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The tortoise is a rare animal whose supplies are swiftly deleted on the planet. It is under special protection in the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"
