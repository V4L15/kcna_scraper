During his junkets to the U.S. and Japan, he called for alliance with foreign forces and confrontation with the fellow countrymen, imitating others' \"diplomacy of value concepts.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He prattled that south Korea and the U.S. should build the \"alliance of confidence\" in order to expand co-interests in military affairs, political diplomacy, economy, social culture and all other fields on the basis of the common concepts of value called \"democracy\" and \"market economy.\" And he went the lengths of claiming that \"the most important task facing south Korea and the U.S. is how to cope with north Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that \"principled pragmatism\" advocated by the Lee Myung Bak gentries as \"doctrine of diplomacy\" is, in fact, a treacherous and sycophantic \"doctrine\" as it is a mixture of \"pragmatism\" and \"diplomacy of value concepts\" from the U.S. and Japan and the doctrine of anti-DPRK confrontation from the \"Yusin\" architects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak regime has been steeped in flunkeyism and treachery to the marrow of its bones from its outset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If not, how could he do such foolish things as peddling in the U.S. the \"proposal\" on the relations with the fellow countrymen, which includes the issue of establishing the \"liaison office\" for \"diplomacy towards the north\" like relationship between countries? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is to be done between the fellow countrymen is not diplomacy but to achieve unity and peace and prosperity under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\" So it is nonsense to talk about diplomatic relationship between the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flunkeyism makes a man become an idiot and if a nation follows it, it will destroy its own country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As it is mad with flunkeyism, the Lee Myung Bak group has turned to be a fool totally ignorant of the inter-Korean relations and a political servant of the outsiders who poses threat to the lives of the fellow countrymen by subserviently opening the beef market and resisting the reduction of aggression forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"pragmatic diplomacy\" of the Lee Myung Bak regime is just \"tribute-offering diplomacy,\" \"diplomacy of drain on resources for outsiders\" and \"treacherous diplomacy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the results of the first overseas trip of traitor Lee who has pursued the \"tightened alliance,\" talking about the \"commonness in concepts of value.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee Myung Bak should be mindful that the developments in recent years, in which pro-American elements were expelled from power in Europe and Japan one after another, are a serious warning to him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Time will prove how contradictory and catastrophic the Lee Myung Bak group's mixture of \"pragmatism\" and the anti-DPRK, sycophantic and treacherous \"diplomacy of value concepts\" is.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This glaringly reveals his dirty colors as a guy keen on dependence on outsiders and anti-reunification confrontation as it indicates his inveterate enmity toward the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He cried that he would not negotiate with the DPRK, talking about \"blackmail\" from it, while defending \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\", his anti-reunification policy toward it. This was an open agitation for confrontation with the DPRK. The traitor even said that \"not only the south but also the north should be changed\", a total denial of the north-south relations that have undergone change after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. The \"change of the south\" touted by him reflects his intention to stop national cooperation and \"change of the north\" his attempt to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true nature of his junkets for inciting confrontation with the DPRK was brought into bolder relief in the \"human rights racket\" kicked up by him. The traitor took fault with the non-existent \"human rights\" issue, a provocation little short of infringing upon the high dignity and authority of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will certainly reckon the heinous crimes committed by the traitor keen on serving the outsiders and inciting confrontation against the reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

George Washington which is to arrive at the Yokosuka Port in August is said to perform operation duties in waters around the Korean Peninsula also in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, papers today say the U.S. intention to have new carrier instead of the old one in waters around the Korean Peninsula on a permanent basis is a serious military move which can never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun cites facts to prove that the ultra-modern military hardware is being bolstered up in areas around the peninsula, dismissing it as a deliberate and premeditated move to drive the situation on the peninsula to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers have become all the more pronounced in posing a military threat to the DPRK while shipping huge up-to-date military hardware to areas around the peninsula. This is a vivid expression of their undisguised act of wrecking peace and the hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. advocates \"dialogue\" in front but behind the scene it escalates military action for attacking the DPRK, straining tension on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attitude of grinding sword of aggression against the DPRK behind the scene of \"dialogue\" shows that there is no change in its strategy for aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers spur the moves to provoke a new Korean war under the signboard of \"dialogue\" only to push the DPRK to bolstering its war deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should clearly understand the strength and will of the DPRK and give up the attempt to provoke a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary denounces the U.S. moves to bring the carrier to Japan, dismissing it as a revelation of sinister plot to invade the DPRK by force and put the Asian region under its military domination with Japan as the most important stronghold.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
