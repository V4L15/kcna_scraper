The prospect of the DPRK-U.S. relations will entirely depend on the U.S. attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Should the U.S. warmongers continue pushing the DPRK-U.S. stand-off to an extreme phase, instead of rolling back their hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, this will only result in creating a situation unfavorable for the U.S."

Por otra parte, sera ubicado pronto en la base aerea norteamericana en la isla Guam el avion no tripulado de exploracion a grandes alturas \"Global Hawk\". Y las fuerzas aereas de Estados Unidos se proponen a seguir colocando de modo rotativo en la misma isla los bombarderos estrategicos a larga distancia \"B-1\", \"B-2\" y \"B-52\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl plan del circulo militar norteamericano de emplazar concentradamente esos sofisticados medios estrategicos de ataque en sus bases militares en la region de Asia-Pacifico, que toman la Peninsula Coreana por teatro operacional, parte de su intencion de atacar preventiva y sorpresivamente a la RPDC y a los paises circunvecinos luego de consolidar en esa area las fuerzas aereas moviles de ataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien EE.UU. habla mucho de la desnuclearizacion en la Peninsula Coreana a traves del dialogo, persigue en realidad el referido modo ofensivo contra la RPDC y acelera para este fin el aumento armamentista detras de la cortina del dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales maniobras de EE.UU. resultan un acto criminal nunca perdonable que entenebrece las perspectivas de la solucion del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana, fomenta en ella la confrontacion y la tension militares y lleva la situacion al borde de la guerra. Ademas, resultan la prueba de que este imperio es el factor principal que impide la desnuclearizacion de dicha Peninsula y busca la segunda guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a las cada dia mas abiertas maniobras de las fuerzas belicistas de EE.UU. para agredir a la RPDC, el pueblo coreano consolidara su disuasivo de guerra de caracter autodefensivo bajo la bandera del Songun (priorizacion militar) y frustrara con fuertes contramedidas cualquier provocacion de los enemigos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas yanquis deben actuar con prudencia al meditar las catastroficas consecuencias que traera su imprudente aumento armamentista."
