It is to correctly settle the war crimes Japan committed in the past. Meaningless apart from it is its ballad of \"building a beautiful country.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crimes committed by Japan against Korea and other Asian countries in the past days are the most ferocious and inhumane war crimes which must in no case be repeated in history. They are a serious political and international issue that must be strictly redeemed to the peoples who fell victims to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's admission of, apology for and reflection on its past crimes should be done by it of its own record, not forced by others, to gain international confidence and make a new start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its apology for and reflection on its past crimes of war of aggression should be fully made through an appropriate compensation. Japan's \"prosperity\" and \"development\" can be said to have been achieved at the cost of blood and sweat of the Asian people. Japan should admit this and seek their forgiveness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is after \"building a beautiful country,\" it should give up its intention to repeat the history of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is massively beefing up its aggression forces under the pretext of \"coping with the situation in its surrounding region\" and \"security\" and openly revealing its reinvasion scheme, even crying for a preemptive attack. If Japan goes on like this, a new war may be ignited by it in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It does not stand to reason for Japan to blow hot and cold on theme of \"building a beautiful country\" away from the efforts for ensuring peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts Pro-U.S. Japanese Charlatans' Shameless Anti-DPRK Moves \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The new Cabinet of Japan is getting frantic in its hostile moves against the DPRK. \r\n It hastily organized a \"task force on the abduction issue\" the inaugural meeting of which adopted it as its policy to put \"pressure\" upon the DPRK. It is persisting in its actions to cancel the exemption of fixed property taxes on facilities of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon). Arsons against Chongryon-related facilities are considered to be commonplace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the present authorities of Japan come to power than they kicked up a noisy racket against the DPRK and Chongryon under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\" which had already found a solution. This is nothing but a sinister and base move of pro-U.S. charlatans to fish in troubled waters for a political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They succeeded in seizing power by dramatizing the \"abduction issue\" and stoking bitterness towards the DPRK among Japanese. They are now applying the same method to stay long in power, close the ranks of conservative forces within the country and strengthen alliance with the U.S. They use the \"abduction issue\" as the most effective political lever and stage the anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon racket over the issue as a means for reinforcing their rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are becoming more vociferous about the \"abduction issue,\" dancing to the tune of the U.S. keen to stifle the DPRK over the nuclear issue. It is not surprising for them to do so as they are copying everything from the U.S. ranging from policy-making to the political system and administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such pro-U.S. flunkeys under the masks of \"nationalists, \" who are no more than waiting maids of the U.S. are calling for the building of \"powerful Japan\" and \"beautiful country,\" claiming they shoulder upon themselves the future of Japan, They oft-repeat \"they are friendly to the U.S. but not subservient to it.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities' hostile moves against the DPRK and Chongryon are an expression of their narrow-minded and clumsy national chauvinism, to all intents and purposes. This is little short of repeating the crime-woven history in the 20th century in which Japan brought untold pain and damage to the people of Korea and the rest of Asia and adding to the crimes it has already committed. These are unjustifiable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned behaviors of Japan can never go with their hope for a \"beautiful country\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community including the Asian people is becoming vigilant against the Japanese ruling quarters set to step up the militarization of the country and launch reinvasion under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\" and \"threat\" from outside. They gave young reckless right-wing forces a chance to come to power as they have grown up, taking poisonous substance provided by imperialists after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The new Cabinet would be well advised to drop a bad habit and take a bold decision to make a clean break with the inglorious past if it truly wishes to build a beautiful country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In other words, it is designed to set up around the earth a system for destroying missiles to be fired by other countries by use of space weapons. What merits a more serious attention is that this move sparks off a fresh arms race worldwide. The U.S. reckless moves to militarize outer space are the root cause of a global arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deployment of sophisticated weapons in outer space may entail unpredictable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said U.S. moves are absolutely intolerable as they are grave criminal acts to turn the peaceful outer space into a theatre of dangerous arms race and war and bring the danger of a new Cold War, a thermal nuclear war and thus put the very existence and security of mankind at peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No specified country should be allowed to monopolize outer space. Mankind should never allow any country to use space as a military base and theatre for attacking other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to drop at once its criminal design to militarize outer space and use it for its purposes of aggression and war in violation of international law on the peaceful use of outer space.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Warmongers Flayed for Increasing Tension\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The military moves shown by the U.S. imperialists jointly with the south Korean bellicose forces under the pretext of the DPRK's recent self-defensive nuclear test are, in fact, allround preparations for a nuclear war against the DPRK. They are an unpardonable provocation pushing the situation of the Korean Peninsula to an uncontrollable worst phase by bringing it to a higher pitch of strain. \r\n So states Rodong Sinmun in a commentary Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is, from A to Z, an offspring of the U.S. nuclear policy against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is putting spurs to the introduction of latest types of nuclear war equipment while revising and supplementing its existing war scenarios against the DPRK on an overall scale. This is a highly dangerous move to justify their nuclear arms race under the pretext of coping with the DPRK and round off their preparations for a war of aggression against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the prevailing grave situation, the DPRK will never overlook the reckless nuclear war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean bellicose forces but decisively counter them with its self-defensive deterrent forces of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, it cannot tolerate in the least the foolish dream of the U.S. imperialists against its dignified political system. They should not commit rash acts but promptly abandon their provocative and harebrained plot of a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a mistake, if the south Korean authorities seek to obtain a \"nuclear umbrella\" in reward for pro-U.S. \"alliance\" and war cooperation, joining the U.S. imperialists in the sanctions against the DPRK for stifling it. The master's \"nuclear umbrella\" will not be able to protect south Korea and, worse still, it will be a source of disaster and trouble bringing the holocaust of nuclear war. The south Korean authorities should be well aware of this and give up at once such foolish act of self-destruction as joining outside forces in the war scheme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who are fond of fire are bound to be burned to death. If the U.S. and south Korean war maniacs persist in nuclear war adventures, they can never evade the lot of destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
