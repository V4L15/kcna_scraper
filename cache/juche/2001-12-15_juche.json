If not, they will meet a more miserable end than that Japan suffered in the past.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has not honored a \"promise\" concerning the return of the base. That reveals its sinister intention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. proposed to build apartment houses, which is an objective ground for the permanent presence, looking down upon the South Koreans, and the South Korean authorities consented to the proposal because of their flunkeyist policy and outlook on history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"ministry's\" approval of the program is a treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the people should turn out in a struggle to eliminate the pro-U.S. flunkeyist forces and foil the plot to seek the U.S. permanent military presence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to abrogate the \"ROK-U.S. mutual defence treaty\" little short of a slavery document, in order to force the U.S. forces out of South Korea and establish sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n"

Japan is dispatching military personnel and equipment to the Indian ocean to carry out the \"SDF\" overseas military operations and busy staging an unprecedented campaign against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) under the pretext of \"evasion of inspection\" by the Korean bank. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody can predict in what an adventurous military operation Japan will get embroiled under the pretext of internal and international security in a fit of anger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries try to use the DPRK in calming down the international concern and criticism of their new fascist tendency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has taken every opportunity to pull up the DPRK over the non-existent issue of \"kidnapped Japanese\" and \"nuclear\" issue in a bid to justify its hostile moves against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's consistent and principled stand to oppose all forms of terrorism and any assistance to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is recognized by the international community that the DPRK \"threatens\" nobody and it cannot have any baneful impact on other country's public security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before escalating its anti-DPRK campaign Japan is well advised to ponder over its consequences and stop acting rashly.    \r\n\r\n"

The Korean peninsula is made the first target of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has neither been taken in by any appeasement and deception nor has yielded to any military pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's victory in their struggle demonstrates leader Kim Jong Il's tested army-based leadership and the DPRK's politico-ideological and military might before the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It, at the same time, clearly proves that neither moves of the U.S. imperialists nor difficulties before the Korean people can ever destroy Korean-style socialism and hold in check their advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An important lesson drawn by the Korean people this year is that they should maintain the highest degree of vigilance toward the cunning double-dealing tactics of the Bush administration in handling the issue of the DPRK-U.S. relations and react to the U.S. imperialists' hard-line policy with the toughest stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any enemy comes in attack on the DPRK, its army will not allow him to go back alive.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
