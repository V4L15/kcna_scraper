Meanwhile, the conservative group is harshly suppressing Jongyojo on charges that it is the \"enemy inside south Korea\", \"the core of the forces following the north\" and \"arch criminal who turned campuses into confusion.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Monday says in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces' crackdown upon Jongyojo is a brutal repressive campaign to eliminate the progressive and democratic forces and turn the whole land of south Korea into a theater of fascist rowdyism where justice and democracy are wantonly violated and into a society dominated by the ultra-right conservative forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The union has so far conducted legitimate activities as evidenced by its actions opposing the revival of the \"yusin\" dictatorship and disclosing the crimes the ruling forces committed by selling off the nation's interests to outside forces in solidarity with trade union organizations and democratic forces of various circles that struggled for democratic rights and right to existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative forces, regarding this as a thorn in their flesh, have persistently threatened and blackmailed the union under unreasonable pretexts.

            "content": "South Korean Regime Urged to Draw Lesson from Preceding Dictator's Miserable Fate\r\n Pyongyang, November 4 (KCNA) -- Kyunghyang Daily News of south Korea carried an editorial on Nov. 2 urging the present regime to draw a lesson from the miserable fate of the Lee Myung Bak puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial quoted Lee Myung Bak as blustering at a meeting of Chongwadae for measures  \"Report to  me where the money came from for the candles and who spearheaded the rally\" when the candlelight rally was staged in south Korea in 2008 in protest against the import of American beef.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruling party and the conservative media hatched all sorts of plots and conducted a coloring operation, claiming that the rally was manipulated by some forces behind the scene and it was not unrelated to the north's propaganda and agitation, the editorial said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally the court gave an answer to the question of whether there were actually forces behind the scene five years later.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Seoul Central District Court ruled that the suit filed by the Lee regime against the leading members of the People's Measure Council against the Total Opening of south Korean Markets to American Beef, the Citizens Solidarity for Democratic Society, the Solidarity for Progress and relevant public organizations was lost. The regime \"claimed damages to the police\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial described the ruling as a right decision as the ruling itself amounted to admitting that the candlelight rally which  the previous regime decried and insulted as the one spearheaded by a certain specified force was a protest action taken by an overwhelming majority of citizens on their own will.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the security authorities indiscriminately suppressed even the mothers who took part in the rally with their babies on the baby carriages and this meant the beginning of the fall of the Lee regime, it added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The editorial held that its fate would have been otherwise, had the Lee regime responded to the people's will instead of resorting to the anachronistic repressive rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye regime should draw a lesson from the recent decision because the present ruling quarters started a witch hunt after labeling the opposition parties, trade unions and civic and public organizations critical of them as \"leftist forces following the north\", it charged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The future of the present authorities will be gloomy, too, if they persist in their acts of taking issue with the activities of the trade unions calling for clarifying the suspected election rigging and resorting to red herrings, warned the editorial."
