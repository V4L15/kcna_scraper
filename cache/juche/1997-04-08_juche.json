            "content": "Anti-social labour policy and suppression of labour movement in south Korea indicted\r\n  Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute on Monday published a white paper indicting the puppet Kim Young Sam clique for their anti-social labour policy and brutal suppression of labour movement.\r\n   The south Korean puppet clique's labour policy is the most anti-social in the world because it serves the colonial economy, puts the interests of the businessmen above anything else and forces working people into slavish submission, the white paper said.\r\n   According to the document, right after  Kim Young Sam took office, he brought forward a \"new labour policy\", the keynote of which is \"sharing of pains\". The \"sharing of pains\" means in essence enduring low wages, hard labour, no political right and hardships in life in order to restore the economy from crisis. South Korean publications said that \"the policy gives big profits to haves and pains to have-nots\".\r\n   The \"labour law\" which was retrogressively revised and railroaded through the \"national assembly\" in December last year reveals the anti-social labour policy more graphically. \r\nIt carries articles on the postponement of permission for multiple trade unions, ban on the right of teachers and civil servants to organise, ban on payment of wages to professional union leaders, prohibition of strike at worksites, hiring of replacement workers during strike, no pay during strike, introduction of the system of laying off workers, introduction of flexible working hours and deprivation of dismissed workers of union membership.\r\n   The businessmen can gain as much profit as above 29,150 billion won, 15.9 percent of the total wages of south Korean workers in a year through the introduction of these articles.\r\n   The south Korean workers denounce the revised \"labour law\" as the one of bleeding the workers white and negating their human rights. \r\n   The south Korean workers' life is worsening. Their wages do not reach 60 percent of the minimum living cost. They each are saddled with debt of 13,700,000 won on an average. \r\nThe majority of families can hardly eke out a living. \r\nIndustrial accidents leave seven workers dead and 400 crippled daily. The casualties by large industrial accidents, including those who should receive medical treatment for over six months, in south Korea are 2-3 times heavier than in Singapore and Hong Kong, 15 times than in Japan and 26 times than in Britain.\r\n   The unemployment rate in south Korea reaches 6-7 percent and the completely unemployed are is 600,000.\r\n   The suppression of the struggle of the south Korean workers became harsher after the appearance of the Kim Young Sam regime.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime set in motion more than 30,000 riot police to disperse the general strike of 150,000 members of 35 trade unions under the Hyundai Group in 1993. \r\nIt also drove 11,000 policemen to crack down upon the general strike of railway workers in June 1994.\r\n   The fascist clique have mobilized tens of thousands of policemen of hundreds of companies and repressive equipment to suppress the struggle of the workers and other people who were calling for the annulment of the retrogressively revised \"labour law\" and \"law on the Agency for National Security Planning\", probe into the truth behind the Hanbo financial scandal and the punishment of those involved in it since late December last year.\r\n   It is the trite method of the Kim Young Sam clique to crack down upon the labour movement, branding it as \"leftist, pro-communist and benefiting the enemy\".\r\n   All the fact shows that south Korea is a \"heaven\" for the rich and bureaucrats but a hell for the working people, the white paper said. \r\n\r\n"
