This is a treacherous act contrary to the implementation of the historic north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Contacts and visits between the north and the south are becoming frequent to help the people from all walks of life in South Korea know better about the reality of the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their suppression of patriotic students is aimed to bar the people from longing for the north, incite confrontation with the DPRK and put a brake on implementation of the joint declaration, much upset by these developments, the bulletin stressed, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should abolish the \"SL\", the anti-reunification law, and immediately release the arrested students to meet the need of the new era, if they wish to remain true to the historic north-south joint declaration. \r\n\r\n"

Therefore, it is imperative to give priority to solving the key problem, a obstacle in the way of improving the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the long-standing historic roots of the hostile relations between the two countries, the commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A key to putting an end to these relations is Japan's sincere redress for its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The preceding rounds of the talks came to failure as Japan evaded its fundamental responsibility and raised non-existent and nonsensical issues to make the talks complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should not repeat such practices at the soon-to-be-held talks, drawing lessons from the past talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   DPRK and Japan are to have such important talks in 2000  at the turn of century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's clear redress for its inglorious past in the century and ushering in a new era of peace, reconciliation and cooperation between the two countries will be decided by the results of the talks. \r\n\r\n"

But, some items of the framework have not been implemented in a desirable way. In other words, such commitments as the construction of light water reactors (LWRs) and shipment of heavy oil which the United States pledged itself to deliver to the DPRK have not been fulfilled smoothly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Therefore, the construction of two LWRs by the year 2003 as stipulated in the agreed framework has become absolutely impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In consequence, not only the work to ensure peace and stability on the Korean peninsula but the process for the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations are not making smooth progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the international community is much displeased with the U.S. attitude towards the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hence, U.S. conservative hard-liners are again peddling the fiction of \"nuclear suspicion\" in an attempt to shift the responsibility for their non-fulfillment of the agreed framework on to the DPRK and annul it, in the worst case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, their loudmouthed \"nuclear suspicion\" only reveals their absurdity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. can never evade its responsibility for the non-compliance with the implementation of the agreed framework and it should pay for the ensuing consequences. \r\n\r\n"
