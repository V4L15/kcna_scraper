            "content": "Kang Pan Sok, Pioneer of Korean Women's Movement \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- Seventy-four years have passed since Kang Pan Sok, an indomitable revolutionary fighter and outstanding leader of the Korean women's movement, passed away on July 31, 1932.\r\n The Korean people are looking back with deep emotion on the priceless exploits performed by Kang Pan Sok, who pioneered the Korean women's movement and devoted herself to the cause of women's social emancipation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was firmly convinced that the way indicated by President Kim Il Sung was the only right one for freeing the Korean women from every manner of exploitation, oppression, subordination and social inequalities. And she took the lead in conducting energetic activities and formed the Anti-Japanese Women's Association, the first revolutionary women's mass organization in Korea, in December Juche 15 (1926). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She was elected the chairperson in accordance with the unanimous will of the association members. Through the association activities, she educated a broad section of women in revolutionary ideas and led them in the struggle for national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She visited wherever Korean women lived though the roads to the places were far and rugged. She, through night schooling, seminars and short training courses, taught them Korean written language and imbued a high degree of revolutionary and class consciousness in their minds, thus knitting them around the women's association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to her correct guidance and energetic activities, the women's association rapidly expanded in the Mt. Paektu area centering around Fusong with a well-arranged organizational system. And it brought up women, who had regarded oppression and maltreatment as their destiny, as ardent patriots and revolutionaries. As a result, the Korean women's movement made a positive contribution to the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal exploits made by her in the struggle for women's emancipation are promoting the strengthening and development of the Korean women's movement in the present stage following the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle and the years for the building of a new society.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Castigating the war game as another grave military provocation against the DPRK and an intolerable challenge to all the Koreans desirous of peace and reunification, the analyst goes on:\r\n The plan of the U.S. to stage the war rehearsal clearly reveals its adventurous scheme to venture armed aggression on the DPRK and it is little short of a declaration of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for pushing the situation on the Korean Peninsula, which is getting worse owing to its provocative war maneuvers, to an unpredictable phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participation of south Korea in the U.S.-sponsored \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint war game is an unpardonable treacherous crime against the nation in fanning the ambition of the U.S. imperialists for invading the DPRK and driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the verge of war. Such act will only throw a grave obstacle in the way of peace and independent reunification of the country and result in bringing chaotic consequences to the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean authorities would be well advised to immediately drop the harebrained plan for joint military drills targeted against the DPRK, paying heed to the warning of the latter.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
