So it provided every convenience, keeping overland road leading to Kaesong and direct air route open. It also offered the conservative authorities an opportunity for condolatory visit and warned that the group of traitors' behavior of totally disallowing even the expression of condolences under the pretence of \"division of public opinion\", \"infringement upon principle\" and \"conflict inside the south\" would have a catastrophic impact on the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula have not been achieved not because of the lack of \"a window of opportunity\" but because of the Lee group of brutal gangsters. Therefore, the Lee group should be sternly punished in the name of the Korean nation for the peace and stability of the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a word, Lee Myung Bak revealed his true colors as a traitor to the nation through his \"special New Year address\". There is no way for Lee to get out of the deepening crisis and self-destruction as he violated ethics and moral laws. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world will witness how the Lee group will meet its ruin."

Por lo tanto, para realizar la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana hay que sentenciarla rotundamente en nombre de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una palabra, a traves del \" discurso especial para el Ano Nuevo\" el traidor Lee Myung Bak revelo por si mismo su naturaleza antinacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda que pisoteo la etica y la moralidad no puede liberare de la agravacion de la crisis y la desesperacion de la derrota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mundo vera claramente como se arruina la banda traidora surcoreana."
