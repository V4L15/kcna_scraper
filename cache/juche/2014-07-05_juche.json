He strongly warned that should the enemies repeat the wrong choice on the wrong day in the hotspot waters, he would make them regret bitterly for their action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, Army General Ri Yong Gil, chief of the KPA General Staff, and Army General Pyon In Son, first vice-chief of the KPA General Staff and director of its Operation Bureau."
