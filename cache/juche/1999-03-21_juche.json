Those chapters will also wage protest demonstrations and street propaganda activities in front of South Korean missions and continue the signature campaign, said the report.  \r\n\r\n"

Without Japan's repentance and apology for its past its militarist ghost cannot but revive, the committee said, urging the Japanese Prime Minister to make an official apology and sincere compensation to \"comfort women for the Japanese army\" prior to his visit to South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the end of the press conference, the members of the committee went to the Japanese embassy in Seoul and handed a protest letter to it.   On the same day, the General Student Council of Korea University held its executive committee meeting at which they once again vowed to foil the lecture to be given by the Japanese Prime Minister at the university.   In another development, a group of students were arrested by police when they attempted to hang at the south gate a placard bearing letters \"We oppose Japanese Prime Minister Obuchi's South Korea visit\". \r\n\r\n"

Asserting that \"security situation in Northeast Asia has been worsened\", he attributed this to \"the DPRK's missile launch\" and \"suspected nuclear facility.\"   He said the DPRK's launch of a satellite proves that North Korea is possessed of a vehicle capable of carrying mass destruction weapons and the \"launch has posed a direct threat to the security of Japan\", thus revealing its ulterior intention to stifle the DPRK.   This is a manifestation of the Japanese reactionary's invariable policy hostile to the DPRK and no more than a gimmick to justify their move to become a military power. \r\n\r\n"

The South Korean chief executive, kowtowing to the \"Emperor\" when the former was on a visit to Japan last year, shamelessly whitewashed the history of crimes committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past and even \"invited\" the latter to South Korea, thus revealing his pro-Japanese flunkeyist nature.   Such an anti-national crime has sparked bitter indignation of the South Korean people.      Nevertheless, the South Korean ruling quarters are working hard to make the \"Emperor's\" visit a reality. \r\n\r\n"

They laid it down as a principle governing economic development to place the people's interests above all and strengthen cooperation with various countries.

Rodong Sinmun says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  These criminals stirred up rebellion at home, supported U.S. blockade on Cuba and opposed foreign enterprises' investment in Cuba.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, however, is making a fuss,  saying the trial was indicative of Cuba's violation of human rights and suppression of dissidents. This tells the human rights issue has been abused as a lever for interference in internal affairs of other countries= it is a prelude to a new anti-Cuba move.   The United States seeks a sinister purpose in launching anti-Cuba campaign slandering the trial in Cuba as a \"violation of human rights\". By doing so it seeks to encourage the counterrevolutionary forces in Cuba in their destabilization activities under the cloak of \"human rights\" and thus strangulate the Cuban revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another aim of the U.S. is to pass a new anti-Cuba resolution through the forthcoming 55th meeting of the UN commission on human rights in Geneva in a bid to recover its past defeat. Such attempt of the U.S. is an anachronistic move going against the trend of the time.   No matter how desperately the United States may undertake anti-Cuba campaign over human rights, no one will lend an ear to it.   Minju Joson says only international shame and isolation will await the United States that is raising a hue and cry over \"human rights\". \r\n\r\n"

The South Korean authorities plan to bring it to the meeting of the UN commission on human rights to be held soon in Geneva. They went so far as to let the Red Cross send to international human rights organizations a \"letter\" requesting them to render cooperation in the \"repatriation\" of \"POWs and those kidnapped by the north\", asserting there are hundreds of them in the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun in a commentary titled \"Unjustifiable behaviour\" observes such behaviour of the South Korean rulers is a new intrigue and a far-fetched assertion intended to refuse the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners.   It continues:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are in the North Korea no \"POWs and no one kidnapped by the north\" loud-mouthed by the South Korean rulers. There are only those who supported the DPRK and voluntarily came over to it to become its citizens. None of them expressed their will to go back to South Korea. It is preposterous for the South Korean rulers to propose to \"exchange\" those who are willing to return to the north where their families live with those who do not wish to go back to South Korea as they enjoy a worthy life with their families in the socialist society.  This is unjustifiable both from the humanitarian point of view and in view of International Law.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Minju Joson in a commentary titled \"Sheer sophism to evade repatriation\" says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   The South Korean rulers pretend to be interested in the humanitarian issue, talking about \"exchange\", but no one will be taken in by it.   If they continue refusing the repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners with this unreasonable sophism, they will face a stern judgement of the nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
