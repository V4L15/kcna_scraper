It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t The resounding success in the second test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-14 conducted on July 28 is a great victory of the DPRK that demonstrated once again the independent prestige and dignity of Juche nuclear power, the world-level rocket power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire confirmed the DPRK's capability of making surprise launch of ICBM in any place and location any time, and clearly proved that the entire U.S. mainland is in the firing range of the DPRK's missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maximum range simulation test-fire of ICBM conducted by the DPRK this time is meant to send a stern warning to the U.S. making senseless remarks, being lost to reason in the frantic sanctions and pressure campaign against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy-makers of the U.S. who must have closely observed the successful second ICBM test-fire would now properly understand that the U.S., an aggression-minded state, would not go scot-free if it ever dared provoke the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. trumpeting about war and threat to impose extreme sanctions on the DPRK only emboldens the latter and provides further justification for its access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To the Korean people who experienced disastrous disturbances of war on this land by the U.S. imperialist brutes, the powerful war deterrence for defending the state is an inevitable strategic option and it is a precious strategic asset that cannot be discarded or bartered for anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Yankees, who have imposed pain and misfortune upon the Korean people for over half a century through their bloody war of aggression and heinous hostile policy against the DPRK, dares brandish the nuclear stick on this land again despite the DPRK's repeated warnings, the DPRK will clearly teach them manners with the nuclear strategic force which it had so far shown the U.S. one after another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly understand the strategic position of the DPRK which has become a world nuclear power and a rocket power and the resolve of its army and people for retaliation, and wake up from the foolish dream of doing any harm to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the U.S. fails to come to its own senses and continues to resort to military adventure and \"tough sanctions\", the DPRK will respond with its resolute act of justice as already declared."
