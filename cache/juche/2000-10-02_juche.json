As a result, the WPK has strengthened and developed to be an invincible party whose membership is armed with the monolithic idea of the leader and forms ideologically pure ranks acting as one under the unitary helmsmanship of the leader and which, deeply rooted among broad masses, leads them, shouldering upon itself the destiny of the country and the nation. All this is a precious fruition of indefatigable efforts made by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Referring to the validity and vitality of the work, the article says: They are fully demonstrated by the fact that the WPK has grown stronger to be a revolutionary party resolutely defending and thoroughly implementing the revolutionary ideas of the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They also find a vivid expression in the fact that the unity and cohesion of the WPK achieved by the President has grown stronger and the ties of kinship between the party and people have been strengthened thanks to the thorough embodiment of his idea of believing in the people as in heaven in the construction and activities of the party. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
