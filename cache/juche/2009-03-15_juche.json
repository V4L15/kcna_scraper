Korean Authorities' Moves for Misleading Public Opinion Slammed\r\nPyongyang, March 15 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Saturday issued its information bulletin No. 946 in denunciation of the south Korean puppet authorities who are resorting to base moves to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad, creating the impression that they are interested in improving inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the Lee Myung Bak group is these days working hard to build up public opinion on the issue of the inter-Korean dialogue, peddling it to other countries and international organization while talking nonsense that the group \"respects\" the inter-Korean agreements and calls for \"resumption of open-hearted dialogue\", the information bulletin said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"dialogue\" ballad touted by the puppets is nothing but a despicable deceptive trick to cover up their crimes of totally bedeviling the inter-Korean relations and driving them to a crisis of military conflict and evade the blame for it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The severance of dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south was entirely attributable to the Lee group which has denied the historic inter-Korean declarations and resorted to the moves for confrontation with the DPRK after it came to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present puppet authorities of south Korea, steeped in the conception of confrontation with the DPRK to the marrow of their bones, were not interested in dialogue and cooperation between the north and the south at all from the outset. They have persistently blocked the dialogue and cooperation, openly blustering that there is \"no need to have dialogue with the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Lee group which has been mad about malignantly slandering the dignified socialist system of the DPRK and kicking up a ridiculous \"human rights\" racket. It is also none other than the south Korean puppets who are taking the lead in the moves to revile the DPRK's preparations for legitimate satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous for the Lee group of traitors to dare talk about \"dialogue\" as it has asserted \"unification under the liberal democratic system\" and is now bringing the dark clouds of war to hang over this land by introducing the U.S. aggression armed forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are truly interested in the inter-Korean dialogue, they should apologize to the whole nation for their crimes of having bedeviled the inter-Korean relations and brought them to the brink of war through their moves for confrontation with the DPRK, drop their sinister anti-DPRK policy and stop all actions hostile towards the DPRK."
