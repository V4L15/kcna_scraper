            "content": "Dialogue and Sanctions Can Never Go together: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. Department of Treasury recently declared its decision to freeze the overseas properties of the trade companies of the DPRK having dealings with those maintaining economic ties with the U.S. and list the companies and individuals of the third countries dealing with the DPRK companies as objects of its sanctions on the suspicion of proliferating \"weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\" and their delivery means.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess that the U.S. Department of Treasury's decision on sanctions against the trade companies of the DPRK is not a simple issue related to economic relations but a link in the whole chain of the carefully prearranged provocative and hostile moves of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK.\r\n The U.S. armed invasion of other countries has always been accompanied by its persistent racket for sanctions against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. freezing of the properties of the DPRK companies did not come by chance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said decision is aimed at pressurizing the DPRK to scrap its nuclear program first. Herein lies the main reason why the U.S. is becoming so vociferous about the sanctions against the DPRK in the run-up to the fifth round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue and sanctions can never go together. Such U.S. behavior can not be construed otherwise than an act of backtracking from the spirit of the joint statement of the fourth round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. behavior is little short of hamstringing the sincere efforts made by the DPRK for the success of the fifth round of the six-party talks. The U.S. would be well advised to give up its futile sanctions against the DPRK.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, therefore, the main spirit of the declaration for them to independently resolve the issue of the country's reunification by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" fully represents the idea of independent reunification. The idea clarifies the idea of national self-determination which calls for settling the national issue by the efforts of the nation and consciousness, will and conviction that national reunification should and can be achieved by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"By our nation itself\" is a most transparent idea of independent reunification and a lifeline for achieving the reunification of Korea.  This spirit of \"By our nation itself\" is reflected in each paragraph and sentence of the joint declaration and runs through its whole content. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration truly serves as a grand programme and a landmark of independent reunification as it helped significantly increase the desire of the fellow countrymen for independent reunification and brought strong hope and conviction of reunification to the Koreans. \r\n The inter-Korean relations once characterized by antipathy and confrontation have turned into those of mutual reconciliation and cooperation, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is nothing impossible for the Koreans and independent reunification is sure to come true, should the Korean people join hands with each other and pool their efforts as indicated by the declaration.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
