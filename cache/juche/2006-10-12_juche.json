            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman on U.S. Moves Concerning Its Nuclear Test \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued the following statement Wednesday as regards the U.S. ill-boding moves in the wake of the nuclear test in the DPRK:\r\n As we have already declared the field of scientific research of the DPRK successfully conducted an underground nuclear test under secure conditions on Oct. 9 as a new measure for bolstering its war deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nuclear test was entirely attributable to the U.S. nuclear threat, sanctions and pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has exerted every possible effort to settle the nuclear issue through dialogue and negotiations, prompted by its sincere desire to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, however, responded to our patient and sincere efforts and magnanimity with the policy of sanctions and blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was compelled to substantially prove its possession of nukes to protect its sovereignty and right to existence from the daily increasing danger of war from the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the DPRK conducted the nuclear test due to the U.S., it still remains unchanged in its will to denuclearize the peninsula through dialogue and negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the entire peninsula was President Kim Il Sung's last instruction and an ultimate goal of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nuclear test does not contradict the September 19 joint statement under which it committed itself to dismantle nuclear weapons and abandon the existing nuclear program. On the contrary, it constitutes a positive measure for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified more than once that it would feel no need to possess even a single nuke when it is no longer exposed to the U.S. threat after it has dropped its hostile policy toward the DPRK and confidence has been built between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the DPRK, which had already pulled out of the NPT and, accordingly, is no longer bound to international law, declared that it conducted a nuclear test than the U.S. manipulated the UN Security Council to issue a resolution pressurizing Pyongyang, an indication of the disturbing moves to impose collective sanctions upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready for both dialogue and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. increases pressure upon the DPRK, persistently doing harm to it, it will continue to take physical countermeasures, considering it as a declaration of a war.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Ill-boding Military Moves under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are getting themselves busy with the arrangements to upgrade the Defence Agency into a ministry and set up a \"strategic planning office\" inside the agency. This is nothing but moves to convert Japan into a military power and round off the preparations for a war of aggression overseas. Minju Joson Wednesday observes this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is taking issue with the DPRK and China over what it called \"military threats.\" But this is no more than a subterfuge to cover up its sinister political and military purpose. Japan is keen to realize its old militarist ambition for overseas expansion by zealously backing the U.S. in its efforts to use Japan as a shock brigade in executing its strategy to dominate the Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now working hard to put strategic offensive weapons on a higher level. It is set to give the green light to reinvasion as its armed forces have been bolstered up qualitatively and fully ready to go into war action. Such development can never be tolerated but must be checked beforehand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is following Japan with watchful eyes as it is rushing headlong into militarist overseas aggression for hegemony, preoccupied by the outdated concept of confrontation and the ambition to conquer other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Militarism and overseas expansion will push Japan to a final ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better drop their militarist ambition for overseas aggression, a threat to regional peace and stability, at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Philosophy on Arms\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The successful advance of the Korean revolution is firmly guaranteed by the great Songun politics, the philosophy on arms.\r\n The arms philosophy is a unique one advanced by Kim Jong Il, Songun commander of Mt. Paektu, with the viewpoint on the arms that the arms are the permanent companion and comrade of the revolutionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The philosophy is based on the principle that the revolution for the independence of the popular masses is initiated, advanced and accomplished by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they want to make a revolution, the popular masses should not only be awakened to rise up but also firmly take rifles in their hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is because the reactionary exploiting classes, counter-revolutionary forces, violate and restrict the independence of the people in reliance upon the counter-revolutionary violence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The path for the revolution is explored by the people only when they make a breach in the counter-revolutionary violence by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms also play an important role in the whole period of progressing and carrying out the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a serious lesson of the history left by the former socialist countries. A party, with millions of party members, ceased to exist as it failed to seize the army and some countries had socialism collapsed as they weakened military strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms philosophy also includes the principle that the army is precisely the party, state and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The party, the general staff of the revolution and the guiding force, can ensure its leading position under the protection of the army and demonstrate its invincible might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A party with a long history and tradition met its tragic end in the consequence of \"depoliticizing\" the army and neglecting ideological work within it. But the Workers' Party of Korea has made a victorious advance of the revolution by seizing the army under difficult conditions. These instances contrastingly show that the party with powerful revolutionary armed forces is invincible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary army and the people's government share the destiny with each other proceeding from the commonness of their characters and basic mission. The independent and creative life of the people is unthinkable apart from a strong army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unique philosophy on arms of Korea testifies to its correctness and vitality in the revolution thanks to the Songun politics based on the philosophy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
