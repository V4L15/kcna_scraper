The aim sought by them in trying to make this sheer sophism intended to defame us sound as an established opinion is to tarnish the high authority and international prestige of our republic and isolate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities are talking about \"improved Japan-DPRK relations.\" \r\n   If these ties are to be improved, Japan should settle its past and rectify its hostile policy towards the DPRK. \r\nHowever, they still persist in their insolent anti-DPRK smear campaign, refusing to take any option to resolve these fundamental issues. \r\n   No improvement can be expected of the DPRK-Japan relations under this situation. \r\n  \r\n"
