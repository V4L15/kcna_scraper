At the  time of its creation, it had 28 letters.\r\n   The letters were the first phonetic alphabet (vowels and consonants) in the world as they were imitated from shapes of vocal organs.\r\n   With these letters one could pronounce Korean and other languages as well.\r\n   The basic letters of Hunmin Jongum were made by imitating shapes of the tip and root of tongue, teeth, lips and throat -- main vocal organs. Then, strokes were added or put together according to changes of their characters when pronounced. On the basis of this, Hunmin Jongum was perfected.\r\n   Its characteristics is that it has a small number of letters and it is simple in shape and easy to learn.\r\n   The national classic \"Hunmin Jongum\" (published in October, 1446) comprehensively introduces linguistic theories and knowledge gained by scholars as well as other theoretical and practical problems on new letters.\r\n   Today, this has been increased to 40 letters (21 vowels and 19 consonants).\r\n   The production of Hunmin Jongum brought about a new development of national culture as a whole including chronicle, press and print, literature and art and spoken and written language. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But in the  international arena its people do not read other's face, but proudly exercise national sovereignty with their own fixed principle and faith.\r\n   The Workers' Party of Korea has firmly ensured its political leadership over the whole society, resolutely rejecting \"political pluralism.\" and the DPRK government has consistently maintained socialist ownership and the principle of unified and planned economic management by the state, opposing \"reform\" and \"opening.\"  this is a result of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.\r\n   Though the enemies persistently slander the WPK's policy of attaching importance to military affairs as \"bellicose offensive\"  the marshal continues his journey on inspection mission to People's Army units, adhering to the great politics of giving priority to the army. Under this politics,  the People's Army has demonstrated its might as the pillar and main forces of revolution and an invincible army.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists are now resorting to a reckless military adventure, having failed to carry out the \"appeasement strategy\" aimed at inducing the DPRK to \"reform\" and \"opening.\" however, the Korean people are dynamically advancing  toward socialism, determinedly meeting the enemies' challenge together with the People's Army which has grown to be an invincible army.\r\n   Marshal Kim Jong Il's distinguished ability of politics is to work miracles and changes, cheerfully breaking through ordeals.\r\n   He unfolded the grand plan of building a powerful nation, instilling the Korean people with confidence in and optimism about the future and clearly indicated the best way for overcoming the present difficulties and bringing about a turn in socialist construction.\r\n   The realities eloquently show that his wise guidance enables the Korean nation to defend its sovereignty and fully demonstrate its dignity all over the world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
