The resolution peppered with stereo-typed lies and false stories does not deserve even a passing note as it is a politically-motivated one aimed at serving the purposes of the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Western forces are blindly following the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK out of inveterate repugnance toward its socialist system. Every year they resort to absurd political chicanery to play down the daily increasing international prestige of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and its allies are styling themselves a \"human rights judge\" whom no one recognize and resorting to despicable acts to slander independent nations and maintain the old international order of domination and subjugation. This, however, only touches off censure and derision of the world progressives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK flatly rejects and vehemently denounces the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" which the hostile forces adopted to bring down the Korean-style socialist system centered on the popular masses by abusing the noble idea of human rights, prompted by their sinister political purposes."

They \"encouraged\" south Korean soldiers and talked about \"sustained contribution to the defence of south Korea.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a vivid indication of the U.S. invariable hostile policy toward the DPRK and its intention for its permanent military presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has openly disclosed its hostile policy toward the DPRK in many aspects.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDuring the presidential campaign the U.S. chief executive found fault with the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence and blustered that the DPRK will have to pay a price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTimed to coincide with this, diplomatic and military authorities visited several countries and heated discussion on stepping up pressure on the DPRK while crying out for \"complete, verifiable and irreversible denuclearization\" and the implementation of the UN Security Council's resolution on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow under way in Washington and Seoul are confabs to reach an agreement on joint provocative counteractions to fight a war against the DPRK. It is against this backdrop that the top U.S. military officials came out to DMZ where huge troops are standing in acute showdown and revealed the design for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea under the pretext of \"defense\". This can never be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. forces in south Korea are aggression troops and means for provoking a war against the DPRK, containing big powers and establishing domination over the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey constitute a cancer-like entity which turned the Korean Peninsula into the world's biggest hotspot and has posed grave threats to peace and stability in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as the U.S. forces remain in south Korea, the U.S. has no justification to say that it has no hostile intent toward the DPRK and no one will believe in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts clearly prove that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged and has been stepped up instead.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. criminal intention is to keep its forces, leftover of the Cold War era, in south Korea and intensify military rule and domination over south Korea by relying on them and keep pursuing hostile policy toward the DPRK.

Kumgang though it suspended the tour under absurd pretext out of its stand of persistent opposition to the tour. Lurking behind this is its sinister intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are under way in south Korea strong actions to punish those chiefly responsible for the deteriorated north-south relations with the approach of \"presidential election.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSouth Koreans are becoming increasingly assertive in their voices calling for resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang on the occasion of the 14th anniversary of its start.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is why the puppet conservative group is pretending to be interested in the issue of the tour by taking issue with the DPRK in a bid to cover up its crimes of having plunged the inter-Korean relations into deadlock and calm down the south Koreans' demand for the resumption of the tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWith no rhetoric can the conservative group evade the legal responsibility for having suspended the tour of Mt.

            "content": "ACNC critica invariable politica conflictiva de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 28 de noviembre (ACNC) -- En la reciente recorrida junto con el comandante de tropas yanquis ocupantes del territorio surcoreano por la zona desmilitarizada, el jefe de la Junta de Jefes de Estado Mayor de Estados Unidos \"estimulo\" a los uniformados norteamericanos y surcoreanos hablando de la \"contribucion sostenible a la defensa del Sur de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\tTales palabras parten de la invariable politica conflictiva del imperio contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y de la intencion de ocupar perennemente al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, el imperio practica mas abiertamente su politica conflictiva anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en varios dominios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el periodo de la campana electoral, el gobernante estadounidense demando a la RPDC pagar el precio correspondiente acusandola del disuasivo nuclear autodefensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY otras autoridades de diplomacia y capa militar al visitar varios paises, se entregaron a la colaboracion para reprimir a la RPDC hablando de la \"CVID\" y de la ejecucion completa de resoluciones anti-RPDC del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, Washington y Seul conspiran y acuerdan el provocativo proyecto para tomar la contramedida conjunta tendente a realizar la guerra anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrecisamente en este momento, los caudillos agresivos del imperio volvieron a revelar su ambicion de perpetuar la ocupacion de tropas yanquis en el territorio surcoreano bajo el vistoso rotulo de la \"defensa del Sur de Corea\" acudiendo a la zona desmilitarizada donde se enfrentan cara a cara las inmensas fuerzas armadas de ambas partes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas tropas yanquis ocupantes del Sur de Corea sirven de efectivos agresivos y mecanismo de guerra para establecer la hegemonia en esta region al provocar la guerra agresiva anti-RPDC y controlar a las potencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon los tumores malignos que convirtieron la Peninsula Coreana en la zona mas candente del mundo y agravan seriamente la paz y la estabilidad del Noreste Asiatico y resto del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMientras existan las tropas yanquis en el territorio surcoreano, el imperio no tiene el derecho a hablar de que no tiene la voluntad de hostilizar a la RPDC y nadie agudizara su oido a tales palabrerias. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad muestra claramente que no se ha cambiado nada la politica hostil anti-RPDC del imperio y esta se torna mas aviesa que nunca.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNunca sera justificada con nada el intento criminal del imperio que sin retirar sus tropas ocupantes del territorio surcoreano, producto de guerra fria, y recurriendose a ellas intenta intensificar mas la ocupacion y dominacion del Sur de Corea y ejecutar forzoso e ininterrumpidamente su politica hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el imperio desea de veras la paz y estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana y tiene la voluntad de abolir su politica hostil anti-RPDC debe retirar sin demora sus tropas del territorio surcoreano."
