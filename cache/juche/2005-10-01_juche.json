What is most important is that he formulated Kim Il Sung's idea of attaching importance to military affairs and the Songun idea as a monolithic revolutionary idea. The WPK has been able to defend the national sovereignty and dignity and work such a miracle as paving a wide avenue for building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation, guided by the Songun idea.\r\n Latigo Oral, deputy director for Foreign Relations of the Secretariat of the National Movement of Uganda, said that the WPK which was founded by Kim Il Sung and won only victories under his wise leadership has grown stronger under the guidance of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He laid down a programme for modeling the whole party and society on the Juche Idea and has led the work to thoroughly implement it and pursued the Songun politics to cope with the extreme offensive of the imperialist allied forces, winning shining victories, he noted, stressing: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is sure to triumph in the future, too, under his leadership.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then speeches were made at the political forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ko Jong Dok said in his speech that since the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration the severed sea routes and road links in the north and the south were rejoined and brothers and sisters are now meeting with each other in Mt. Kumgang, a famous mountain of the nation, to pave the way for reunification.\r\n He called upon all the people to make tangible contributions to materializing the idea of \"By our nation itself\" to build a rich and powerful reunified country without fail.\r\n Kim Jin Son in his speech referred to the inter-Korean cooperation that has been under way in various fields for the last five years, underscoring the need for the north and the south to join hands and pool wisdom and energies to achieve reunification.\r\n Then followed speeches by delegates of the north and the south. \r\nThe political forum was followed by an art performance given by artistes of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The artistes of the north side put on the stage folk songs such as \"Blue Sky above My Country\" and \"Ballad of Mt.

It is wrong to think that the dignity and honour of a nation can be glorified by much money and wealth. If all people rise up as one with the consciousness that they are members of the nation, they can achieve national prosperity and glorify the dignity of the nation even under any difficult conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to frustrate the ideological and cultural poisoning moves of the U.S. imperialists is a struggle as serious as military showdown. The U.S. imperialists are now craftily scheming to obliterate the national character of other countries under the deceptive signboard of \"globalization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A struggle to preserve national character in all fields of social life is now being invigorated in the DPRK thanks to the wise leadership of the party. No U.S. imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning goes down with the Korean people.                \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is intolerable. \r\n What is serious is that the issue of reorganizing the special committee had been conceived by the GNP, a group of pro-U.S. and anti-reunification traitorous elements, and the NA is acting under its pulls and pressures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the special committee which will certainly play into the hands of the GNP will hamstring the progress of warming up the relations as this party is dead-set against the improved inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the NA is to truly contribute to the development of the inter-Korean relations, it should not meddle in the cooperation, talking about \"transparency\", but abolish the \"National Security Law\", the biggest stumbling block lying in the way of the above-said process, and show a practical action in support of the June 15 joint declaration. \r\n We will closely follow the future moves of the south Korean \"National Assembly\".    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
