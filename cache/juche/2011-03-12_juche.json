Korean Chief Executive's Talk about Dialogue Hypocritical \r\n Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of south Korea in a recent public appearance said \"We are fully ready to have a dialogue with the north with open-heartedness\".\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, his utterance cannot but arouse derision. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was none other than the present chief executive who brought the inter-Korean relations to the worst phase, far from seeking true dialogue. He, however, asserts that he wants to have dialogue whenever an opportunity presents itself. Who on earth will believe this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is known to everybody that he has talked a lot about dialogue since the very day of his seizure of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had he come to power than he let loose rhetoric that \"the door to dialogue is open anywhere and any time\". In the next year, he uttered \"we are ready to start dialogue and cooperation at any level any time as regards all matters between the south and the north.\" Last year he vociferated about dialogue and peace, saying \"we should set peaceful unification as a target to terminate the state of division\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK issued a joint statement of its government, political parties and organizations containing an important proposal for having wide-ranging dialogue and negotiations with political parties and organizations of south Korea including its authorities this year and  took positive steps one after another to realize it. But the south Korean authorities persistently sidestepped it and brought to rupture the preliminary talks for the opening of the north-south high-level military talks. They took issue with the DPRK, crying out for \"a change in attitude\" and the like.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known to the world, eye-opening events hardly imaginable in the past took place one after another between the north and the south after the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration the main idea of which is \"By our nation itself.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dialogues and contacts were brisk not only between the authorities of the north and the south but between non-governmental bodies, making a breach in the barrier which has kept the nation divided into two for more than half a century and bringing about big progress in the cooperation for the prosperity common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dialogues and contacts between the north and the south that brought all the Koreans great courage and hope for the country's reunification, peace and prosperity were suspended with the emergence of the present regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inter-Korean relations rapidly deteriorated and reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  From the outset the south Korean puppet forces had no true will for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They advocated dialogue as they could not turn their faces away from the unanimous wishes of the people at home and abroad for the development of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the south Korean people of various social standings are becoming vocal chiding the authorities' behavior. They said: \"Isn't the south-north dialogue a dead language to be formally used at commemorations only? Otherwise, dialogue would not be used to rhetorically finish addresses for the past three years, instead of using it for mending the strained inter-Korean relations.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"same nation\" and \"dialogue\" touted by the chief executive while the DPRK-targeted joint military exercises were under way together with outside forces are a serious mockery of the compatriots and hypocrisy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hypocritical talk about dialogue is too disgusting to hear."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun resalta caracter agresivo de ejercicios militares\r\nPyongyang, 12 de marzo (ATCC) -- El diario Rodong Sinmun publico este sabado un comentario individual cuyo texto resumido sigue abajo:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 10, quedaron concluidos parcialmente los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" iniciados el 28 de febrero en el suelo surcoreano.  Una parte de \"Foal Eagle\" se extendera hasta finales de abril. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se toma en cuenta el numero de efectivos y equipos belicos movilizados y el contenido de esas maniobras, resulta evidente que fueron peligrosos entrenamientos sin precedentes en la historia para la guerra de agresion a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos enganan a la opinion publica interna y externa mintiendo que \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" son \"ejercicios anuales de defensa\". Esto no pasa de ser un sofisma descarado para ocultar su ambicion criminal de agredir a la RPDC y su genio belicista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de hacer frente a la supuesta \"situacion de emergencia\", se ejercitaron en esas ocasiones el ataque sorpresivo y tridimensional contra la RPDC con todos los medios incluyendo armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una estupidez si EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas intentaran conseguir algo con la amenaza y presion militares a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos deben dejarse de locuras como meterse en el fuego con gasolina.?"
