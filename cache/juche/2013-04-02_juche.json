Lethal weapons and units that had already been brought to south Korea and those which the U.S. is mulling bringing for reinforcement this year are all latest means for mounting preemptive nuclear attacks from the ground and air and for carrying out a chemical warfare against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When they are put together with the war means it handed over to the south Korean puppet forces, that will be enough to fight a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fact proves that the DPRK's launch of satellite for peaceful purposes and its nuclear test for self-defence were not only the reasons why the U.S. is intensifying its provocations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. reinforcements in south Korea and its moves to provoke the DPRK are aimed to serve its strategy toward the DPRK which calls for seizing control of the whole Korean Peninsula, a strategic vantage point in Northeast Asia, and holding military hegemony in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation is attributable to the U.S. sinister scenario to aggravate the situation on the Korean Peninsula and ignite the second Korean war, a nuclear war, at any cost this year marking the 60th anniversary of the Korean Armistice Agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This has brought into bolder relief the truth that the U.S. and hostile forces' moves for harassing peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula over the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes and its nuclear test for self-defence are a brigandish act of turning white to black.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is why the DPRK has taken a series of toughest countermeasures while strongly rejecting the UN Security Council's \"resolutions on sanctions\" against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was aimed to defend the justice and truth of humankind, to say nothing of the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK from the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices and the UNSC's despicable act of kowtowing to the U.S., bereft of impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Truth is not proven by voting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An answer to it is the outcry of a scientist who laid down his life to defend truth, saying that still the earth moves despite religious persecution in the dark medieval age.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shining victory won by the then young DPRK in the last Korean war after repelling the invasion by the U.S. imperialists, which fabricated even UN \"resolution\" while boasting itself of being the \"strongest\" in the world, and their allied forces has become a model of invincibility of justice and truth in the modern times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the present highly civilized world, where independence has become the trend of the times, just a few countries possessed of nukes can not represent the ideologies, social systems, traditions and civilization of other countries, let alone decided their destinies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an act can no longer work on the DPRK that firmly defended itself in the past even though it had no nuclear weapons, and now has become a full-fledged nuclear weapons state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and its followers persist in the moves to stifle the DPRK, they will get thousand-fold merciless retaliatory blows from Songun Korea which rose up to defend justice and truth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the inevitability of history that justice and truth prevail over injustice and falsity."

This is the picture of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the disclosure made by a BBC correspondent in Tokyo, the explanation from 1931 to 1945 in a historic textbook of Japan is just 19 pages out of 357 pages in all. This textbook has just one sentence of explanation about each the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army and the Nanjing massacre called the worst tragedy in the 20th century as they killed 300 000 Chinese in 1937.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Abe government hopes to see curriculum amended so that youngsters may feel more proud of the country's history than now, the broadcasting service added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is so impudent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The past crimes can never change with distortion and denial of them. Resolutions on the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army were adopted at the Senate of the New York State Assembly in the wake of the House of Representatives of the U.S. and the California State Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resolutions branded the sexual slavery as crime against humanity and as one of the worst flesh traffic in the 20th century, revealing that the Japanese government forced more than 200 000 women into the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A lot of monuments disclosing the sexual slavery are being erected one after another in different parts of the U.S. including California and New York.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no sleight of hand can Japan ever escape a stern judgment of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless acts oblivious of lesson are bound to invite a fresh ruin."
