It directed great efforts to a struggle for the rights that overseas citizens of a sovereign state are entitled to exercise in all aspects of socio-political, economic and cultural life and to a mass movement for all democratic national rights in a responsible manner.\r\n   Great achievements have been gained in national culture and arts and athletics as well.\r\n   Chongryon has performed great feats for the prosperity and development of the socialist homeland and the reunification of the country. it has been fully supported by broad segments of the Japanese people and highly respected by the world people. This is the result of the external activities it conducted in the idea of independence, peace and friendship.\r\n   The most important task of the community of Koreans in Japan, who are making a new history, is to prevent the assimilation and naturalisation of the younger generation, preserve the national identity and keep and develop the community of Koreans in Japan.\r\n   Chongryon and Koreans in Japan will wage a more powerful struggle against the \"campaign for suffrage\" some bad elements of the South Korean Residents Association in Japan central committee are conducting in a bid to place the fates of Koreans in Japan under the politics of Japan and step up their assimilation and naturalisation. and they will more firmly defend the national independence of compatriots.\r\n   Chongryon is vigorously advancing along the straight road of Juche under the  wise guidance of the great leader secretary Kim Jong Il in firm unity around him, holding President Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal sun of Juche. its patriotic cause will always win, along with the advance of the socialist homeland. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
