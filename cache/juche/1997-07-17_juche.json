            "content": "Japanese-Korean women to visit home\r\n Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued a statement today.\r\n   The statement says:\r\n   There live in Korea Japanese women who married Koreans.\r\n   Some of them are those who married in Korea during the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule. Most of them, however, married Koreans who had been drafted for forced labor in Japan or gone to Japan to make a living. \r\nThese women followed their husbands repatriating to the DPRK in 1959 and later.\r\n   Under the magnanimous policy of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and the DPRK Government, the Japanese women have acquired DPRK citizenship and become dignified citizens of the DPRK.\r\n   They are enjoying socialist democracy and freely taking part in socio-political life as full-fledged members of the man-centred socialist society of Korea.\r\n   They have received high education according to their hope, aptitude and ability, have stable jobs, enjoy material and cultural benefits from the state and society and lead a worthy and happy life. The case is the same with their children.\r\n   They regard the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as their motherland that guarantees their present happiness and bright future.\r\n   However, there are some people in Japan who raise a hue and cry over issue of Japanese women in Korea.\r\n   Any issue related to these women belongs to the sovereignty of the DPRK, which looks after their destinies in a responsible manner. No one else is supposed to poke his nose into this issue.\r\n   Ever since the issue of Japanese-Korean women's visit to home was put on the order of the day, the WPK and the DPRK Government have consistently paid deep attention to it, regarding it as a humanitarian issue.\r\n   This humanitarian issue has not been solved because of the abnormal relations between the DPRK and Japan.\r\n   The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee has decided to take steps for Japanese-Korean women in advanced years to visit their hometowns in Japan in accordance with the humanitarian measure of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK Government, taking into account the women's wish to meet with their families and relatives and the requests made by Japanese politicians and authorities recently through various channels.\r\n   A competent organ of the DPRK plans to have contact with its Japanese counterpart to discuss technical matters.\r\n   We express hope that the Japanese side will take a sincere attitude toward the humanitarian measure of the WPK and the DPRK Government. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean newsmen urged to refrain from complying with ANSP's criminal demand\r\n Pyongyang, July 17 (KCNA) -- Since the south Korean newspaper Chosun Ilbo carried an anti-communist, anti-north editorial some time ago, anti-communist organizations and such human dregs as Pak Hong under the baton of the Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) have got frenzied with false propaganda against the north, sympathizing with Chosun Ilbo.\r\n   In this regard, the journalists of the Korean Central News Agency and the DPRK Radio and Television Broadcasting Committee sent letters to the newsmen of the Yonhap News Agency and the broadcasting system of south Korea on Wednesday.\r\n   Saying that Chosun Ilbo's editorial is something like a declaration of war, the most grave provocation against the north, the letters say:\r\n   The Journalists of the News Agency and the Broadcasting Committee of the north consider that the editorial full of malicious abuses of our dignified political system is not a casual incident but a deliberate and premeditated crime against the north, a coproduction of the rulers, the ANSP and Chosun Ilbo.\r\n   Chosun Ilbo, which has engaged in hackwork, defended by Chongwadae and the ANSP, has even called for overthrow of the system of the north.\r\n   It is natural that Chosun Ilbo is branded as a group of criminals who have fueled confrontation within the nation, not as press organ. And it deserves severe retaliation. \r\n   The south Korean pressmen should categorically reject such acts as fostering antagonism and confrontation, going against national reunification and reconciliation.\r\n   We hope that you and other south Korean pressmen will neither comply with the ANSP's criminal manipulation and demand nor take the choice of making suicide together with the despicable mountebanks of the anti-national, anti-reunification civilian regime in its waning days.\r\n   We express the belief that you will make efforts for the historic cause of national reunification, deeply aware of your mission for the time and history. \r\n\r\n"
