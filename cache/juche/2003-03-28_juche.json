Korea-U.S. war exercises demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- 8 peace and religious organizations including the People Opening the Door of Peace and Reunification, the Council for National Reconciliation and Independent Reunification and the Korean Catholic Priests' Council for Justice reportedly held a rally in front of the U.S. 8th army command in Ryongsan on March 22 demanding a stop to South Korea-U.S. joint military exercises and the return of all U.S. military bases.\r\n Dismissing the largest-ever joint military exercises now going on under the pretext of coping with \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula as an extension of Team Spirit war exercise and moves to provoke a war against the north under \"Operation Plan 5027,\" the organizations strongly demanded a halt to the sabre-rattling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bitterly accusing the U.S. 8th army command of pressurizing the South Korean authorities in February to pay 12.9 billion won for the project of road construction and cover 50 percent of the expenses for building apartments in the U.S. embassy compound and other places, they urged the authorities never to yield to the pressure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stated that the authorities should lend an ear to the voices of citizens and urge the U.S. Forces side to return its bases.     \r\n\r\n"

It plays music composed by Yun I Sang and national and world classical music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 300 regular concerts, joint concerts with foreign artistes and recitals have been held since the hall was opened.  \r\n\r\n"

And he urged the legislature to accept the anti-war protest made by 81 percent of the population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be helpful to everyone, after all, that the \"National Assembly\" rejects the authorities' request for the dispatch of troops to the Iraqi war, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another \"assemblyman\" Ri Hae Chan said the current Iraqi war is bitter shame in human history as it has no justification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Je, member of the \"National Assembly\", declared that they would submit an amendment carrying their stand since the dispatch of engineers group or medical group is little different from actual involvement in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, 17 \"National Assemblymen\" from the ruling and opposition parties reportedly called a \"meeting of parliamentarians for peace against war\" on March 25 and agreed to check the passage of the motion through the \"National Assembly\".    \r\n\r\n"

It set up an \"emergency measure headquarters\" and held meetings to take precautions, the commentary says, and continues:\r\n A meeting was held to discuss the issue of supporting the U.S. war against Iraq and the issue of strengthening \"alert and watch on North Korea.\" It was agreed there to increase the flight of airborne warning and control plane of the Japanese air \"self-defence force\" in the air over the East Sea of Korea to monitor moves of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take a serious note of the fact that the Japanese reactionaries have kicked up a racket against it following outbreak of the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary said that the strengthened Japan-U.S. alliance is effective for deterring the threat from North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But such moves of Japan pose a threat to the DPRK as they are targeted against it. Though the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to justify their U.S.-toeing policy, talking about the \"threat from North Korea\" and \"deterrent force\", it is quite impossible to hide their black-hearted design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a serious miscalculation for Japan to think it will go safe when the situation on the Korean Peninsula goes beyond control and a war breaks out there. If the Japanese reactionaries try to get something by escalating the tensions there, taking advantage of the second nuclear crisis sparked by the U.S., they will only dig their own graves.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes Tokyo governor's anti-DPRK outbursts\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 27 (KCNA) -- Tokyo metropolitan governor Ishihara, ultra-right reactionary element in Japan, reportedly let loose a string of anti-DPRK outbursts when interviewed by the Washington Post on March 24.\r\n He said that Japan should take revenge upon North Korea as regards the issue of kidnapping while calling for Japan's rearmament. He went to the lengths of talking nonsense that North Korea will meet the same fate as Iraq's. This can be heard only from such a psycho as Ishihara. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His demeanour is shame to Japan and an intolerable infringement and an open challenge to the DPRK, an inviolable independent and sovereign state. This has, therefore, touched off the Koreans' bitter wrath. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the international community strongly asserts, the U.S. attack on Iraq is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of Iraq and it can never be justified under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to stifle the DPRK by force by mounting a preemptive attack on its nuclear facilities and escalating Washington's nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara's support to the U.S. attack on Iraq and anti-DPRK outbursts that it will meet the same fate as Iraq's lay bare Japan's sinister intention to stage comeback to Korea and destroy the DPRK, taking advantage of the U.S. moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by his vociferous call for Japan's rearmament. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, the DPRK is the first target of Japan's moves to rearm itself and emerge as a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has built up self-defensive capability strong enough to beat back any formidable enemies at a single stroke under the banner of the army-based policy. Ishihara, ignorant of this fact, is comparing the DPRK with Iraq and calling for Japan's rearmament. This is a political cartoon which reminds one of a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that he talked about taking revenge upon North Korea over the issue of kidnapping. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan committed the biggest aggression in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDuring its colonial rule over Korea Japan forcibly drafted more than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans and hurled them into a war of aggression and drove them into hard labor and forced over 200,000 Korean women to provide sex for the imperial Japanese army. It can not but be a schizophrenic paroxysm for a mere politician of such a war criminal state to talk about the abduction issue, an issue which had already been solved, and any revenge upon North Korea while keeping mum about the past crimes of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should feel deep regret at the fact that such a schizophrenic as Ishihara is debasing Japan's political morality and mentality.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
