It plays music composed by Yun I Sang and national and world classical music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 300 regular concerts, joint concerts with foreign artistes and recitals have been held since the hall was opened.  \r\n\r\n"

And he urged the legislature to accept the anti-war protest made by 81 percent of the population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be helpful to everyone, after all, that the \"National Assembly\" rejects the authorities' request for the dispatch of troops to the Iraqi war, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another \"assemblyman\" Ri Hae Chan said the current Iraqi war is bitter shame in human history as it has no justification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Je, member of the \"National Assembly\", declared that they would submit an amendment carrying their stand since the dispatch of engineers group or medical group is little different from actual involvement in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, 17 \"National Assemblymen\" from the ruling and opposition parties reportedly called a \"meeting of parliamentarians for peace against war\" on March 25 and agreed to check the passage of the motion through the \"National Assembly\".    \r\n\r\n"

It set up an \"emergency measure headquarters\" and held meetings to take precautions, the commentary says, and continues:\r\n A meeting was held to discuss the issue of supporting the U.S. war against Iraq and the issue of strengthening \"alert and watch on North Korea.\" It was agreed there to increase the flight of airborne warning and control plane of the Japanese air \"self-defence force\" in the air over the East Sea of Korea to monitor moves of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take a serious note of the fact that the Japanese reactionaries have kicked up a racket against it following outbreak of the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, the Japanese chief cabinet secretary said that the strengthened Japan-U.S. alliance is effective for deterring the threat from North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But such moves of Japan pose a threat to the DPRK as they are targeted against it. Though the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to justify their U.S.-toeing policy, talking about the \"threat from North Korea\" and \"deterrent force\", it is quite impossible to hide their black-hearted design. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a serious miscalculation for Japan to think it will go safe when the situation on the Korean Peninsula goes beyond control and a war breaks out there. If the Japanese reactionaries try to get something by escalating the tensions there, taking advantage of the second nuclear crisis sparked by the U.S., they will only dig their own graves.    \r\n\r\n"
