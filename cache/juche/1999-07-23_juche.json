It was the main source of miracles unprecedented in the war history.   As the war broke out, all the Korean people turned out in the wartime production and in support of the front.   The people in the frontline area not only ensured production but transported ammunition and food, took wounded soldiers to field hospitals and reconstructed destroyed roads under the shower of shells and bullets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThroughout the war the women in Namgang village, Kosong county, and the people in Soksari, Kumgang county, Kangwon Province, shared sweets and bitters with the soldiers on Mt. Wolbi, Hill 351 and Height 1211. The massive self-sacrificing spirit and heroism performed by them are still stirring up the hearts of all the people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever the boom of guns stopped, they covered 28 km to climb up a height with ammunition cases on their heads even at dead of night and whenever a bridge was destroyed by an enemy air raid  they threw themselves into  a deep river to reconstruct it.   People sincerely helped the fighting soldiers by forming stretcher-parties, front art groups and cooking teams.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe peasants across the country donated over 3,000 tons of rice to support the front by the end of April, 1953, in hearty response to the patriotic initiative taken by the peasants who reaped a bumper harvest in Phyongwon county, South Phyongan Province, in November, 1952. This is just one example of a high degree of enthusiasm of the people to assist the army at that time.   This patriotic  movement also involved businessmen, merchants and even pupils.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Thanks to this invincible might of the army-people unity the Korean people were the first in history to defeat the U.S. imperialists and emerged a victor in the war.\r\n   The army-people unity the tradition of which was achieved in the anti-Japanese bloody war and consolidated to be invincible in the flames of the Fatherland Liberation War still serves as a bottom line of our society and a sure guarantee for victory. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
