Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\tAt that time Britain and the provisional government of Iraq were in the position of the \"friendliest countries\" in the \"anti-terror war\" launched by the United States. The U.S., however, put even these countries under the strict surveillance, an indication that this American-style \"anti-terror war\" poses considerable problems in its moral aspect.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe fact that the U.S. stretched its tentacles of surveillance even to leaders of its allies suggests that the whole world has, in reality, become the target of the American-style \"anti-terror war\" and all countries and people have fallen victim to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is now violating the sovereignty of sovereign states in various parts of the world and killing innocent civilians there, while perpetrating human rights abuses as it pleases, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a violation of international law and the UN Charter, but the U.S. is justifying it as an \"anti-terror war\". It asserts that its military actions do not pose any problem as they are part of the \"anti-terror war\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrecisely on the basis of this gangster-like logic the U.S. invaded Iraq and Afghanistan and made air-raids on Pakistan, a sovereign state, shortly ago, massacring peaceable inhabitants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe American-style \"anti-terror war\" causes more losses than gains and it is used as a lever for perpetrating military invasion against other countries and infringing upon their sovereignty. Therefore, the international community is unanimous in asserting that there is no need to allow this crime to go on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"anti-terror war\" waged by the U.S. is nothing but leverage to execute its foreign policy for hegemony. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. would be well advised to stop at once the farce of making a mockery of the international community under the hypocritical slogan of \"anti-terror war\"."

This has exposed the right of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan to exist to grave threat. The Japanese reactionaries are, indeed, a group of hooligans and rogues bereft of an iota of conscience, humanity and morality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is all the more mean and wicked for the Japanese reactionaries to frantically kick up the racket of suppressing the Koreans who live in Japan in sorrow and mental agony far away from the homeland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese reactionaries will certainly be forced to pay for the crimes they have committed by persistently cracking down upon Chongryon, pursuant to the hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson says that their anti-Chongryon campaign is a product of their anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.
