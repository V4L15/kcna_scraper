And the U.S. Forces' side has already admitted that the incident was not caused by the communication jamming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling these facts, the organization urged the chief of the branch office and the prosecutor in charge of the case to apologize for their mishandling of the case and step down at once.     \r\n\r\n"

Kim Jin Su.\r\n This method helps remove pus in pleurae through just one operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A series of cleansing after the operation would lead to complete cure of inflammation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This new method of treatment can shorten the period of treatment to one fourth or one fifth, while drastically cutting down the expenses for treatment as compared with an internal treatment method. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those treated by this therapy are free from the atrophy of chest, a symptom normally observed from among long-term pleuritic cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As early as in the 1990s the researchers introduced the thoracoscope in treating many patients who suffered from excessive sweating, strong body odor, traumatic lung rupture, sporadic pneumothorax and other chest troubles.     \r\n"
