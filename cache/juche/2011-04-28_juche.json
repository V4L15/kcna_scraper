Cesium-137 of 380,000 Bq per one kg of earth was detected in Yamata, Futaba chon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As high concentration of radioactive substance is still detected in Futaba chon near the power plant, the Jiji Press reported that radioactive substance is believed to have ceaselessly leaked from the power plant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chief Cabinet secretary announced a ban on cultivating rice in the evacuation area within the radius of 20 km centering around the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An assistant to the prime minister said that no one predicted that there might occur a hydrogen explosion at reactors of the power plant right after the massive earthquake on March 11, thus officially admitting that there are no countermeasures against the possible hydrogen explosion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The rising level of contaminated water and radiation at Reactors Nos. 3 and 4 of the power plant is creating difficulties in the work to tide over the crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to NHK, the level of the contaminated water in the pool of Reactor No. 3 rose 2 cm in 23 hours till 6 p.m. on April 25 and that of underground water near the building that houses the turbine rose 10 cm as compared with that before three days. Radioactive substance 1,000 times that of Reactor No. 4 was detected in the underground water near Reactor No. 3.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The results of measurement of concentration of radioactive materials in the underground water near the building which houses turbine of Reactor No. 4 on April 21 led to confirming that the level of  cesium-134 and 137 and iodine-131 was 250 times and 12 times respectively as compared with that one month ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The level of underground water in Reactor No. 4 is 115 cm as of April 25, 20 cm higher than that ten days ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  NHK reported that the failure to solve the problem of contaminated water would make it impossible for the power plant to launch a full-dress work. It said that the Tokyo Electrical Power Co. would face bigger difficulties in the transfer and disposal of contaminated water in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japan National Police Agency announced that the death toll caused by quake and the ensuing tsunami increased to 14 508 as of 10:00 on April 27. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Researchers of the Earthquake Institute of Tokyo University analyzed that quakes are likely to occur in those areas influenced by the movement of the earth's crust caused by the massive earthquake as the ground of Tokyo and areas around it is affected by the movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is reported that the probability that a magnitude of 7 earthquake will jolt Minami-Kanto area in three decades to come is 70 percent at present."

The dissolution of the former Soviet Union reduced the act to a dead paper. But the U.S. keeps applying the act against the republics of the former Soviet Union including Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This affects to a certain extent the positive efforts of those countries to develop economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the forum the U.S. declared that it would repeal the act when Russia settles its \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This goes to prove that the act is nothing but a lever for domination and interference to hinder the independent development of those countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the demise of the Cold War the U.S. prattled that it would help Russia, claiming that it is not the enemy of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Visiting Russia in July 2009, the U.S. president said that the U.S. would boost economic cooperation and investment in Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the recent forum once again brought to light that the promise made by the U.S. to Russia is a sheer lie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration is seeking to lay a military siege to Russia by expanding NATO and establishing its MD in Europe, etc. and working hard to make an effective use of the act to this end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The application of the act is a vivid expression of the U.S. hegemonic policy to contain and weaken Russia, displeased with Russia's growing position in the international arena.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is keen to contain not only Russia but various countries of the world aspiring after independent development by invoking such draconic acts as the above-said act. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. is seriously mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No force on earth can stem the trend of the times toward independence."
