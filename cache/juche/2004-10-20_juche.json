            "content": "S. Korean Uri Party-Proposed \"Amendment to Criminal Law\" Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- The ruling Uri Party of south Korea proposed an \"amendment to the criminal law\" as a bill related to the issue of abolishing the \"Security Law\" on October 17.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary terms this bill the second SL and an evil law against reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bill, in fact, calls for keeping the core of the SL, its main poisonous articles as they are because this bill includes the clause on the \"organization aimed at internal disturbance\" little different from the provisions on the \"anti-state organization,\" \"enemy-benefiting organization.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bill is, in the final analysis, a version of the SL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the Uri Party to propose such a bill is an unpardonable crime against democracy and reunification as it goes against the trend of the reunification era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration, defying the mind-set of the south Korean people towards democracy, human rights and independent reunification and currying favor with the Grand National Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Uri Party has so far talked a lot about \"political reforms\" and the abolition of the \"SL\" but, in fact, played tricks contrary to the expectation of the nation, pursuing quite different aims. The party adopted the abolition of the \"SL\" as its policy and pushed forward the move for legislation on it. This was done not prompted by any political creed but by opportunist self-protectionism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any new law in south Korea contains even a single clause of the SL, this will make it impossible to improve the inter-Korean relations and achieve the genuine democratization of the society and human rights, the desires of the south Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun�@Tuesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: In his recent several interviews he blustered that north�@Korea's sincere approach towards the \"issue of abduction\" is a precondition�@for entering  into negotiations for the normalization of the relations. In a�@recent meeting with \"family members of abductees\" in particular, he went the�@lengths of making provocative remarks that Japan might impose sanctions upon�@north Korea depending on the results of DPRK-Japan inter-governmental�@working contacts slated for mid-November, threatening that even a treasured�@sword is useless if it is unsheathed and that Japan would strongly react if�@necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks have something in common with the rackets kicked up by the�@Japanese right-wing conservative forces for sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThese remarks are quite contrary to the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIntolerable is what he is doing in breach of the Pyongyang declaration,�@unbecoming for the diplomatic boss of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If his remarks mean an official stand of the Japanese government at a time�@when the DPRK-Japan inter-government working contacts are expected to be�@held in November, this compels the DPRK to think otherwise as it is making�@sincere efforts for their success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities would be well advised to properly understand the�@mindset of the public at home and abroad and stop hamstringing the efforts�@to implement the Pyongyang declaration and working to bedevil the DPRK-Japan�@relations. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
