And, on December 10 that year, they forged \"Performance Regulations of the Corporeal Punishment Ordinance\" stipulating shocking methods of the performance of the ordinance. Promulgated in those days were also such fascist evil laws as \"Korean Civil Ordinance\" and \"Korean Criminal Ordinance.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun in an analysis Monday says that all the fascist laws based on the doctrine of colonial domination that the Koreans should either be obedient to the Japanese law, or die were products of the Japanese imperialists' policy of colonial enslavement and policy of national obliteration against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the cases of imprisonment and suppression of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists on the strength of various evil laws rose to 142,000 in 1918 from over 13,500 in 1912, the analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having turned the whole land of Korea into a large prison, the Japanese imperialist robbers inflicted immeasurable losses, human and material, upon the Korean nation. And they perpetrated all manner of shuddering barbarities to totally destroy even the soul of the Korean nation. They were the culmination of the most ferocious crimes against humanity previously unknown in history in brutality and cruelty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet apologized and compensated for the extra-large state-sponsored crimes unprecedented in history that were committed in the period of its occupation of Korea. On the contrary, it is trying to cover up its shocking past crimes including the crimes in the forced recruitment of sexual slaves for the imperial Japanese army and running about with blood-shot eyes in their moves for reinvasion and confrontation against the DPRK, even beautifying its history of aggression and whipping up militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the shameless and brutal nature of the Japanese reactionaries remains unchanged and they are obsessed with ambition of aggression to enslave the Korean nation again and freely commit murder and looting against the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

For the Korean nation to struggle for peace at present is a just patriotic struggle to defend the land for its existence and achieve the reunification of the country and prosperity common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of Korea is a matter to reunite the Korean nation artificially divided by the outside forces and, accordingly, national reconciliation should be achieved before anything else, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace, the most universal idea common to humankind, is a prerequisite for the national unity and reunification in Korea divided into two. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula, its disasters will be inflicted mainly upon the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There will be neither reunification nor prosperity without nation and territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality have already proved that the reunification of the country and the co-prosperity of the nation cannot be guaranteed without peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has kept its aggression forces in south Korea and staged war gambles against the DPRK almost everyday, destabilizing the situation of the Korean Peninsula and posing a constant danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality in the June 15 era of reunification, the first of its kind in the history of the Korean nation's struggle for reunification, more clearly shows that the reunification of the country and the prosperity common to the Korean nation can not be realized unless peace is achieved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration adopted at the historic Pyongyang summit presupposes peace as it is aimed at achieving the independent reunification and common prosperity of the Korean nation through its reconciliation and cooperation. It has been clearly evidenced by the process of implementing the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outside forces and the south Korean bellicose forces servile to them have been hell-bent on the moves to provoke a new war against the DPRK, going against the aspiration of the Korean nation and the trend of the times, and thus put a brake on the development of inter-Korean relations and laid artificial obstacles to the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand and line of the Workers' Party of Korea for peace and peaceful reunification are very just and patriotic. Holding high the banner of peace is just the way for glorifying the June 15 era of reunification and achieving the reunification and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A spokesman for the Korean Democratic Lawyers Association warned this in a statement Monday, 95 years since the Japanese imperialists enacted \"Korean Corporeal Punishment Ordinance\", a colonial fascist law, to intensify the medieval suppression of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After their illegal occupation of Korea by force of arms early in the last century the Japanese imperialists promulgated the \"Korean Corporeal Punishment Ordinance\" on March 18, 1912 as No. 41 \"Order of Governor-General of Korea\". And on December 10 of the same year, they promulgated \"Regulations for the Enforcement of the Corporeal Punishment Ordinance\" stipulating harsh methods to carry out the ordinance as official order No. 40. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such fascist laws as \"Korean Civil Ordinance\" and \"Korean Criminal Ordinance\" were also promulgated in those days to establish a colonial oppressive system in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of cases of imprisonment of Koreans by the Japanese imperialists on the strength of various evil laws including \"Korean Corporeal Punishment Ordinance\" and \"Korean Criminal Ordinance\" increased to more than 142,000 in 1918 from over 52,000 in 1912. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world does not know such ferocious imperialists as the Japanese imperialists who enforced a harsh colonial rule even by using methods of corporeal punishment dating back to the period of feudalism in a bid to dominate and enslave other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet made an apology and compensation for the unprecedented hideous state-sponsored crimes committed by it during its occupation of Korea although more than six decades have passed since its defeat in the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As disclosed by Japanese Prime Minister Abe's reckless remarks, Japan is leaving no means untried to cover up the sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army and other hideous crimes committed by Japan in the past. Moreover, it is now working with bloodshot eyes to stage a comeback to Korea and escalate its moves for confrontation with the DPRK, whitewashing its history of aggression and inciting militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never forget those crimes but certainly force Japan to pay for them.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Ademas, embellecen su historia de agresion, inculcan el militarismo y se aferran a las maquinaciones de nueva agresion y de confrontacion con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La realidad demuestra que no ha cambiado en lo minimo la naturaleza descarada y barbara de los reaccionarios japoneses y que estos abrigan como antes la ambicion agresiva de esclavizar de nuevo a los coreanos y de matarlos y saquearlos a su antojo.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
