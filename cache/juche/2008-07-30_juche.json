It has also exercised the dominion over the islet through generations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historical materials proving this fact have been recently unearthed in different places one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, the Japanese authorities have become desperate in insisting on their far-fetched assertion that Tok Islet belongs to territory of Japan. Not content with this, they are working hard to convince even the pupils of the primary and middle schools of this claim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is historically known to have looted a lot of things from other countries, while telling the lie that they belong to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by Japan in tampering with history and persistently spreading the lie that other's territory belongs to it is to grab Tok Islet at present and the whole of Korea in the future and, furthermore, reinvade the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities had better stop at once their brigandish act to grab Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will never allow Japan to realize its anachronistic ambition for overseas aggression but mete out a resolute and merciless punishment to it in case it violates the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK even a bit.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Bellicose Forces Denounced for Falsifying Facts \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific let loose a spate of balderdash in a bid to hold the DPRK chiefly accountable for the military tension, thus falsifying facts. Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. that is chiefly to blame for having escalated the military tension on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has massively deployed modern military hardware in south Korea and in its vicinity and staged various forms of military maneuvers, getting on the nerves of the DPRK, its dialogue partner, and vitiating the atmosphere of dialogue and negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is totally depending upon its military forces in the execution of its foreign policy, thereby seriously disturbing or threatening the world peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. are now facing an important political task to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and put a definite end to the hostile relations that have lasted for several decades. The key to fulfilling this task is for the U.S. to completely roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now involved in the talks with the DPRK due to the principled and just demand of the DPRK and the international community but it is still keen to threaten and blackmail the DPRK militarily and increase the pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear armed forces of the DPRK serve as means for self-defence as they are aimed at protecting the security of the country and nation from the moves of the hostile forces to stifle it. The U.S. ever-escalating military threat and moves for aggression would only compel the DPRK to go on with bolstering its powerful deterrent forces for self-defence and it is its right to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to make a right decision, cogitating about the serious consequences to be entailed by its high-handed military policy. The settlement of the problem depends on the attitude of the U.S.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is an effective way for defending peace on the peninsula to struggle for peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both the north and the south are required to struggle for peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main target of the struggle is the U.S. anachronistic hostile policy of aggression toward the DPRK and its moves to start a war against the latter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said policy diametrically runs counter to the present trend of the times towards dialogue and peace and the desire and demand of the Korean nation as it is aimed at stifling the sovereign DPRK and dominating the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without putting an end to the above-said U.S. policy and its war moves it is impossible to achieve durable peace on the peninsula nor it is possible to think of national security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the main task of the struggle for peace against war to frustrate the campaign of the south Korean puppets in league with foreign forces to launch a war of aggression against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said struggle represents an acute confrontation between the forces of war of aggression and the forces defending peace. The key to winning victory in the confrontation is for all Koreans to wage an uninterrupted dynamic struggle for peace against war in firm unity, convinced of the victory in their cause, concludes the article.\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
