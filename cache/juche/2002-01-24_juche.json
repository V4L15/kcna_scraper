It clarifies the historic five-point policy of the great national unity that serves as a highly important guideline in achieving the great unity of the Korean nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The five-point policy calls for sticking to the principle of national independence, uniting under the banner of patriotism, the banner of national reunification, improving the inter-Korean relations, struggling against foreign forces' domination and interference and anti-reunification forces and strengthening mutual contacts, dialogue and solidarity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The booklet in its preface says: we hope that the plan of Kim Jong Il and the cherished desire of all the Korean people would be achieved, and wish Juche-based socialism progress and prosperity.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Japan's military expansion policy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 24 (KCNA) -- Japan reportedly worked out a basic policy as regards an \"emergency legislation\" on January 21.\r\n The basic policy was worked out under the pretext that it is the responsibility and duty of the state to adjust the system of coping with an armed attack in peace time under the constitution. It is a war document designed to legalise Japan's policy of military overseas expansion. It is as clear as noonday that the document has a very baneful impact on regional peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's clamour about the non-existent \"armed attack from other country\" is a pretext to justify the \"emergency legislation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has finished the working out of the basic policy as regards the \"law on emergency\" the shaping of which has long been stepped up despite the opposition of the people at home and abroad. This means that Japan has seized the opportunity to pursue the policy of military overseas expansion in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of the \"September 11 incident\" Japan's \"self-defence forces\" have intensified overseas military actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has military muscle strong enough to realise the aggressive ambition of the Japanese militarists and ultra-nationalist forces to recover from their past defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What remains to be done by Japan is to perfect a legal and institutional mechanism so as to emerge a military power and carry out overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan tries to act as the leader of the Asia-Pacific region, not bound by any law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, oblivious of the lesson from the defeat, tries to take the road of reconquest in a bid to realise its wild ambition for the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" in reliance upon its military and economic potentials. This will only precipitate Japan's self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should be vigilant against Japan's efforts to become a military power and moves to turn its society into a right-wing conservative one.    \r\n\r\n"

In another development, it announced a plan for establishing a missile defense system and is drawing the South Korean authorities to its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately stop such political intervention and take a sincere approach to the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations on the basis of the agreement reached between them before, squarely seeing the will of the Korean nation for reconciliation and reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

The developments are reminiscent of the tour of Dulles on the eve of the June 25 Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula in the far east is getting so tense that the same war of aggression as that in Afghanistan is about to break out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot remain a passive on-looker to the serious developments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the fixed will and determination of the Korean people to preserve the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, a programme for independent reunification common to the nation, and, through its implementation, put an end to the tragedy of national division in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should have a proper understanding of the Korean people's unshakable will for independent reunification against the U.S. and act with discretion. It also should put an immediate halt to the anachronistic war preparations against the north and moves to turn South Korea into a permanent colony and pull lethal weapons and aggressor troops out of South Korea at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present authorities of South Korea should draw a lesson from the miserable end of the flunkeyist traitors who were sternly tried by the nation, immediately stop cooperating with the U.S. in war moves and sincerely implement the joint declaration in cooperation with the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement calls upon all the people to turn out in an anti-U.S. struggle to frustrate the war tour of Bush and Rumsfeld. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then Pak Kwang Gi answered questions put by reporters.\r\n\r\n\r\n"
