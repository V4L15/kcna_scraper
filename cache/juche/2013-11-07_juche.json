It is also a very dangerous war scheme revealing the attempt at a war of aggression based on the triangular military alliance among the U.S., Japan and south Korea, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only Koreans but all other people of the world censure the U.S. recognition of \"Japan's exercise of the right to collective self-defense\" as \"the second Katsura-Taft Treaty\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a dangerous conspiracy for aggression aimed to revive Japan's old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By siding with Japan's move for the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\", the south Korean puppet forces committed a shameful crime of joining the U.S. and Japan in their scheme for a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Absolutely intolerable is the traitorous act of the puppet forces unhesitatingly taking part in the war moves against the fellow countrymen while conniving at Japan's thrice-cursed past history of aggression and its moves for grabbing territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces are setting preconditions, saying that \"agreement\" is needed as regards \"items related to the sovereignty of the Korean Peninsula\" in a bid to cover up their crimes. But it is just a deceptive trick to evade the denunciation of the public at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attempt at reinvasion of the Korean Peninsula is becoming a reality and the peace and security of Northeast Asia have been further endangered with the puppet forces' act of colluding with Japan in exercising the \"right to collective self-defense\"."

The U.S. forward-deployed this interceptor system on Guam in a bid to put military pressure on the DPRK and China in April last. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t THAAD is aimed at mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on not only the DPRK but the whole of the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the puppet group's introduction of THAAD means acquiring the capability for posing threat to the whole of Asia beyond the peninsula. THAAD will be operated at the instruction of the U.S., its master, as the puppet army has realized the sharing of intelligence with the U.S. forces in the field of ballistic missile tracking and the right to command wartime operations is in the hands of the master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the puppet regime opened to public its plan to set up a ballistic guided-missile operation control station by next year to interlock it with the U.S. theater missile defense operation control station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Facts go to clearly prove that the Park Geun Hye group is fully involved in the U.S. moves to resort to a nuclear threat and blackmail against the region after becoming a shock brigade in carrying out its Asia-Pacific strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group is making eyes at its neighboring countries, talking about \"exchange\" and \"cooperation\" and, at the same time, is seriously threatening the security of big powers in the Asia-Pacific region in league with its master behind the scene.

Korean Spy Arrested in DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, November 7 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Ministry of State Security of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Thursday in connection with an agent of the Intelligence Service of south Korea arrested in the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t A relevant institution recently intercepted an unidentified person in the capital city of Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At first he insisted that he was Chinese residing in the DPRK and then a citizen of a third country. As investigation progressed, he confessed he is a south Korean who intruded into Pyongyang after illegally entering the DPRK from a third country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An initial investigation indicates that he was engaged in anti-DPRK espionage and plot-breeding activities in a third country bordering the DPRK for nearly six years, while disguising himself as a religionist. He entered the DPRK to rally dishonest elements within the boundary of the DPRK and use them for undermining the stability of the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fully proves to what extent the puppet group of conservatives has reached in its anti-DPRK moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An institution for state security is now intensifying investigation."
