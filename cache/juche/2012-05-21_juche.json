This sends a clear message to Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly reflects the international community's opinion and judgment of the Japanese imperialists' indelible crimes against humanity in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One can still hear the voices of grudge-bearing victims of the monstrous crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists during their military occupation of Korea in the last century and international community's growing voices demanding Japan make reparation for its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As proven by the reality, Japan is still in the dock as far as the human rights abuses are concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for Japan to draw a due lesson from its past crimes and take a proper attitude and stand on the issues of apology and reparation for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, Japan has become so crazy about denying the sexual slavery that even the Japanese prime minister let loose a spate of balderdash that \"the claim 'comfort women' were sexual slaves for the Imperial Japanese Army is quite different from the correct expression.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is refusing to admit historic facts, far from making apology and reparation for the thrice-cursed crimes by the Japanese imperialists against humanity, just waiting for the days all the direct victims of the sexual slavery and eyewitnesses will die.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a proverb says one makes a matter worse, brazen-faced and wicked attitude of the Japanese authorities concerned only adds to Japan's crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how hard Japan may try, it can never write off its history. The Korean nation will live on as a victim and eyewitness of the Japanese imperialists' crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan calculates that it can write off its crime-woven history with its petty tricks.

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- The U.S. right-wing warlike forces seek to redeploy tactical nuclear weapons in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t The Armed Services Committee of the House of Representatives of the U.S. passed an amendment to the 2013 national defense authorization act calling for this redeployment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable action taken by the above-said forces to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension and thus ignite a nuclear war at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of the withdrawal of U.S. tactical nuclear weapons, the leftover of the Cold War, is now under hot debate in various countries and regions including Europe, and this atmosphere prevails in the U.S., too. This being a hard reality, the warlike forces are getting frantic with the redeployment of those weapons contrary to the trend of the situation. This cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate move to make the situation on the peninsula unstable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the U.S. has stockpiled more than 1 000 nukes in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is now considered as the most threatening nuclear arsenal in the world and the peninsula is fraught with the greatest danger of a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If their plan to redeploy those weapons in south Korea is implemented, it will further escalate the tension on the peninsula and the rest of East Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to bolster up the tactical nuclear forces against the DPRK will compel it to take stronger counter-measures against them as it is exposed to constant nuclear threat. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will, at the same time, create nuclear imbalance in all regions of East Asia and spark off a vicious cycle of arms race.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be hard to imagine the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the deployment of tactical nuclear weapons on the peninsula where the situation remains tense. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is foolish, indeed, for the right-wing warlike forces to call for the above-said deployment at a time when far-sighted people in the world are urging the U.S. to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK and boldly make a switchover in its strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. warmongers' reckless actions to gain something by sticking to their hostile policy towards the DPRK can never escape rebuff and condemnation."
