            "content": "U.S. anti-DPRK international pressure campaign assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave today the following answer to the question raised by KCNA as regards the atmosphere of international pressure created by the United States over the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activity:\r\n The DPRK is now putting the operation of its nuclear facilities for the production of electricity on a normal footing after their restart. The U.S. is now describing this as \"one more act of threatening and blackmailing the international community.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTimed to coincide with this, some forces of the IAEA, at the instigation of the U.S., will reportedly hold a meeting of its board of governors on Feb. 12 to discuss the issue of referring the issue of the DPRK to the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government has already solemnly declared that its nuclear activity would be limited to the peaceful purposes including the production of electricity at the present stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is trying hard to paint the DPRK's nuclear activity as one of different nature, prompted by a sinister political intention to invent a pretext for bringing its issue to the UN and internationalize it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care about whether the UN Security Council discusses the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula or not. But if it wants to handle this issue, it should fairly call into question the responsibility of the U.S. which is chiefly to blame for the outbreak of this issue and for the strained situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dared to slander the dignified members of the UN as members of an \"axis of evil\" and \"lawless regimes.\" it, therefore, cannot shirk its responsibility for having wantonly violated the principle and spirit of the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the U.S. can never flee from the blame for having grossly breached the fundamental principle of the NPT which bans nuclear threat to the non-nuclear states by listing signatories to the treaty which are non-nuclear countries as targets of its preemptive nuclear attacks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to call the U.S. to task for unilaterally refusing to implement the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and the DPRK-U.S. joint statement and ditching them in the long-run, thus posing a grave threat to the peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA is not in a position to say anything about the issue of the DPRK which is no longer its member and has already quit the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is persistently trying to use the IAEA again to bring up the issue of the DPRK for discussion at the un despite the fact that the DPRK Government officially notified the UN Security Council of its withdrawal from the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only proves that there is no justification to internationalize the issue and the IAEA has been completely reduced to a political tool of the U.S., bereft of the principle of impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the UN Security Council responsible for the issue of world peace and security does not call the U.S. wrong Korean policy to task, this organization will turn out to be partial and the DPRK will, accordingly, not recognize it.    \r\n"

For this deployment, about 2,000 troops, mostly air force personnel, were ordered to be ready to move. Several fighter bombers and \"U-2\" reconnaissance aircraft could be added to U.S. Forces in South Korea and Japan, press reports said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. also ordered thousands of soldiers in South Korea to extend their stay even after the expiry of their service term there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the war hysteria of the U.S. imperialists keen to isolate and stifle the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue has reached a more reckless phase. \r\n\r\n"

The U.S.-proposed \"multilateral talks\" are meant to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has never thought of other form of talks than the DPRK-U.S. direct talks to seek a solution to the nuclear issue and will never participate in such talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should bear in mind that its persistent efforts to stymie the solution of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula with such a wrong assertion would only make the situation more complicated and bring about unpredictable consequences.    \r\n\r\n"

They designated it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of preemptive nuclear attacks. Recently they clamoured for \"tailored containment\" and \"military sanctions\" upon the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is a big miscalculation to think that the DPRK may be frightened by some military threat or pressure, \"blockade\" or \"sanctions.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should not run amuck, mindful of who is their opponent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government's decision to withdraw from the NPT is revelation of the firm faith and will of its army and people to smash the U.S. imperialists' anti-DPRK campaign with the toughest stance and safeguard the sovereignty and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have invincible might enough to defeat any formidable enemy who encroaches upon our sovereignty and security.    \r\n\r\n"

In a true sense, national defence industry is said to represent heavy industry and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary party and people should have a firm viewpoint that heavy industry precisely means national defence industry and place it above anything else in the socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is more pertinent to the reality of our country in which national defence industry holds an important part of the economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's economic structure is based on its own heavy industry and military industry makes up the important part of it, which is the characteristics and advantage of the local economy which has embodied the independent line of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the WPK's consistent line of building self-supporting national economy that the Korean-style economic foundations with the heavy industry as fundamentals have been laid and it is thanks to its self-defensive military line that a firm national defence industry base has been built up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the solid foundations of the self-supporting national economy with powerful national defence industry as its hardcore we could defend socialism in the decisive battle with the imperialist allied forces in the 1990s and work a historical miracle of laying a springboard for building a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National defence industry is the root of the local economy and a lifeline for defending socialism and building a powerful nation. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
