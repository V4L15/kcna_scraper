In August the fate of a Japanese woman teacher, who had been supposed to be \"abducted by north Korea\", was confirmed when one of the killers testified to the fact that she was murdered by Japanese gangsters 26 years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries are truly interested in destinies and rights of inhabitants, they should pay much more attention to how to prevent such human rights abuses in their own country. In particular, they should apologize and compensate for the forcible drafting of Koreans, the worst crimes committed by Japan against humanity in the past, and pay attention to the prevention of reoccurrence of similar abuses of people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are ill-famed for their crafty nature. No cunning burlesque staged by them to hurt someone can draw anyone's attention.
