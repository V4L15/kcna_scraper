Refers to Issue of Participation in 5th Six-Party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry Monday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards the issue of participating in the 5th six-party talks:\r\n It is our consistent and invariable stand to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will, therefore, go to the 5th six-party talks at the date to be agreed upon early in November as the six parties had committed themselves to do so.\r\n This reflects our sincere stand to respect and faithfully abide by the principles agreed upon in the Beijing Joint Statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, however, has been careless in its words and deeds quiet contrary to the spirit of the statement in a little over one month since the publication of the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This makes us doubt the U.S. will to implement the statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., in violation of the principle of simultaneous action agreed upon among the six parties, is again demanding the DPRK abandon its nuclear program first on the basis of CVID. It is staging a noisy campaign to pressurize the DPRK, bringing utterly groundless charges such as \"human rights issue\" and \"illegal deal\" against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of the U.S. are rendering the joint statement, a co-product of the six parties, invalid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will hold the U.S. accountable for this situation much more deplorable than what was before the publication of the statement and keep tabs on this at the forthcoming talks.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the meantime, it is busying itself to carry out its nuclear war strategy with ease, while supporting and conniving at the production of nuclear weapons by its allies. The recent disclosure of an illicit deal between the U.S. and south Korea in nuclear substance clearly reveals the U.S. deceptive nature behind its loud call for \"nuclear non-proliferation\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It recognizes some countries' right to have access to nukes and promises transfer of nuclear technology to them as it pleases while preventing other countries incurring its displeasure from exercising even the right to peaceful nuclear activities and incriminating them under the pretext of \"non-proliferation\".  Such nuclear war strategy of the U.S.  only results in weakening the binding force of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and putting the world into a nuclear turmoil. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. cover up its true colors as chief violator of the nuclear disarmament convention and its regime and evade its responsibility for having sparked off a fresh nuclear arms race.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such UN reform would make it possible to prevent the major international issues from being decided or unfairly settled by specified countries and provide conditions for fairly and reasonably settling the issues in the interests of an absolute majority of UN member nations. The UN Security Council should be reformed on the principle of ensuring the full representation of the non-aligned countries and other developing countries which account for an absolute majority of UN member nations.\r\n A permanent seat on the UNSC, one of the important bodies of the UN, should not be given to any country carelessly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has a crime-woven past as it ignited wars of aggression against other countries and enforced the harshest policy of colonial rule in history. Though 60 years have passed since the defeat of Japan, it has distorted its history of aggression and driven the regional situation to a brink of confrontation, far from honestly repenting of its past crimes and settling them. Japan is, therefore, should not be allowed to seat on the UNSC under any circumstances.\r\n In order to increase the role of the UN it is important to overhaul the UN Human Rights Organization on the principle of guaranteeing the member nations full representation in the same direction of reforming the UNSC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being a member nation of the UN, the DPRK has made every effort to preserve global peace and security and establish fair international relations in conformity with the objective and principles of the UN Charter since it joined the UN on Sept. 17, 1991. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK remains unchanged in its assertion and stand to carry out a fair and democratic reform of the UN and increase its role and function and thus preserve global peace and security and soundly develop the international relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It even asserted that it would do its utmost to prevent the abolition of the SL. This clearly proves that its anti-democratic and anti-reunification fascist nature remains unchanged.\r\n The GNP is working with bloodshot eyes to punish a university professor, raising a hue and cry over his academic assertion. This is prompted by its criminal intention to check the abolition of the \"NSL\" and the movement for independence and reunification in south Korea and thus revive fascist dictatorship by coming to power again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe NSL is a leftover of the dictatorship in the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is, therefore, no justification to keep the NSL in the present era after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration when the north and the south are pursuing reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should not allow the repetition of the disgraceful history in which the truculent fascist dictators in south Korea stamped out independence and democracy in society and committed indelible crimes against the fellow countrymen through confrontation with fellow countrymen and acts against reunification.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Brilliant Feats Everlasting with Korea-China Friendship\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- Fifty-five years have passed since the Chinese People's Volunteers entered the Korean War (1950-1953) on October 25, 1950.\r\n The Party and the government of China dispatched their fine sons and daughters to the Korean front under the banner of resisting America and aiding Korea, safeguarding the home and defending the motherland though the People's Republic of China was one year old. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese comrades-in-arms fought shoulder to shoulder with the Korean People's Army in the same trench, displaying a mass heroism and unparalleled devotion to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mountains and heights of Korea are dyed in the blood shed by brave Chinese People's Volunteers and associated with their feats.\r\n A Chinese hero, when he ran out of explosives and grenades in a charge of a height, covered the enemy's gun muzzle with his breast, shouting \"Forwards for Korea, brother country!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Three volunteers of Sanggam Pass fought enemy's company and battalion for three days and defended the height even under the hail of 250,000-300,000 shells and bombs a day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Huang Qiguang, 21, who had his arms and shoulder seriously wounded, silenced the enemy's pillbox with his body, and his platoon leader, who was a member of the Communist Party of China, plunged himself into the enemy's position with a bunch of hand-grenades, thus ensuring the victory of their unit in the battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the spring of 1951, two volunteers died after rescuing Koreans in a village of Pongchon County engulfed in flames by an enemy's bombing raid. And on the bank of the River Rimjin in April 1951, two volunteers allured an enemy's aircraft to them to get serious wounds and thus protected the lives of more than 100 people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During two years and nine months of the participation in the war, the Chinese People's Volunteers produced more than 661,740 recipients of medals and orders including 12 heroes of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The feats performed by the volunteers in the years of the war will shine long along with the unbreakable Korea-China friendship.\r\n The people of the DPRK are sincerely grateful to the brotherly Chinese people for having helped them with blood during the hard-fought war, rendered mental and material support in difficult periods including the postwar rehabilitation and construction and built gratis the modern Taean Friendship Glass Factory, a symbol of the friendship between the two countries in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditional Korea-China friendship provided by the great leaders of the Korean and Chinese peoples in the anti-Japanese struggle continues to grow stronger under the deep care of the leaders of the two countries today.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
