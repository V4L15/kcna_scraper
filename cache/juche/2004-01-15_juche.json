It, therefore, has no right to talk about the \"general election.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior intention of the party to win back power, revive the fascist dictatorship, keep south Korea as a permanent dependency of the U.S., block the country's reunification and wallow in luxury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the party is a den of human trash as it leaves no means untried to go back to the past, insisting on everything outdated. It is impossible to open up a new era of independence, democracy and reunification as long as the GNP is allowed to go back to subordination, fascism and division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The far-sighted people are now bolting the party. The desperate efforts on the part of the GNP clan under this situation are futile as they are nothing but frenzy of those on the deathbed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP had better stop imprudently talking about the general election but apologize to the nation for its crimes and dismantle the party as demanded by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
