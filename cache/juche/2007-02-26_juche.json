            "content": "Letter to Japanese Diet \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The European Regional Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification and the Society for Cooperation among Koreans in Germany sent a joint letter to the Japanese Diet on Feb. 13 denouncing the Japanese government's unwarranted suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans in Japan which have become all the more undisguised recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unpardonable crime against humanity to brutally abuse the rights of Koreans in Japan and suppress them for the mere reason that they have different nationality and ideology, the letter pointed out, stressing that this act self-exposes before the world that Japan is a country of barbarians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter urged the Diet to properly discharge its duty and exercise its right at a time when the security authorities of Japan which styles itself a \"law-governed state\" are openly perpetrating the politically-motivated suppression of Chongryon over its just political, social, cultural and educational activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese Diet, keeping mum about the unethical suppression of Koreans in Japan, continues to connive at and support it, we will solidarize with the world forces of justice and conscience and stage legitimate actions to denounce the Japanese government's suppression in front of the Japanese embassies in various parts of the world, the letter warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It expressed conviction that the progressive civil organizations and conscientious figures of Japan would launch actions in solidarity with Chongryon and Koreans in Japan in their struggle.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Tambien resulta ridicula la intencion de amedrentar o probar la voluntad y las fuerzas de nuestro pais con el aumento armamentista y los misiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Son incompatibles el dialogo y la amenaza militar. EE.UU. debe dejar en claro su posicion ante esta disyuntiva: el dialogo o la via militar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@La RPDC observa con alta vigilancia las maniobras de provocacion de una nueva guerra de EE.UU.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
