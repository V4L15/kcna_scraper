Korea Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- The 63-year-long presence of the U.S. in south Korea marked the history of crimes during which it has infringed upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation and harassed peace, obstructing the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea is a product of their strategy for aggression of Asia, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. presence in south Korea is a wanton violation of the unanimous desire of the Korean nation for the independent development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has trampled down upon the freedom and rights of the people and even infringed upon their vital rights after putting the political, economic, cultural, military and other fields of south Korea under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has also violently suppressed the just patriotic struggle of the south Koreans for independence and democratization of the society and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its presence in south Korean is a criminal act of threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the danger of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It raised a hue and cry over \"axis of evil\" revealing its hostility toward the DPRK, mapped out \"a report on nuclear posture\" which made the nuclear preemptive attack on the DPRK an established fact, massively beefed up its imperialist aggression forces in south Korea under the signboard of \"strategic flexibility\", introduced ultra-modern military hardware into south Korea and staged joint military exercises against the DPRK getting ever more adventurous as the days go by. These go to clearly prove that the U.S. is a chieftain harassing peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. presence in south Korea is a stumbling block lying in the way of achieving the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has worked hard to calm down Koreans' desire for reunification while intensifying its political and military domination over south Korea and interference in its internal affairs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. anti-reunification moves have become ever more undisguised after the adoption of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation have to put an end to the U.S. imperialists' presence in south Korea without fail in order to retake the national sovereignty which has been violated by foreign forces and achieve the historic cause of national reunification.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
