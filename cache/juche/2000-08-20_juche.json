The Korean people are now upholding his leadership, firmly united around him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Swiss Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification extends full support and firm solidarity to the Korean people in their dauntless struggle for socialist construction and national reunification even under the persistent threats of the imperialists. \r\n\r\n"

This serious criminal deed was brought to light recently by testimonies of South Korean inhabitants and the technical survey of the scene and its surrounding areas conducted by the \"investigation team for probing the truth behind massacres in Rogun-ri\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard people at home and abroad strongly condemn it as a deed intended to bury into oblivion the case of mass killings forever, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States has not yet uttered a word of apology to the families of the victims of the Rogun-ri case demanding apology and compensation, but attempted to wipe out the evidences of those massacres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, the monstrous crimes committed by the U.S. aggressors against the Korean nation during the Korean War can never be covered up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The north headquarters of the nationwide special committee strongly demands that the U.S. not attempt to evade its responsibility for such crimes by erasing evidences but frankly admit them, punish their organizers and executors and make an apology and compensation to the Korean nation. \r\n\r\n"

If the South Korean authorities truly want the improved north-south relations and peace on the Korean peninsula, they should take a step to cancel the large-scale joint military drill against the north as unanimously demanded by people at home and abroad, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The planned military exercise is evidently betrayal to the north-south agreement and an open provocation against the north, partner of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The CPRF strongly condemns such reckless military provocative moves of the U.S. and the South Korean authorities, in the name of the 70 million fellow countrymen and the peace-loving people of the world aspiring after peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should be clearly mindful that if they persistently stage the drill, disregarding the present north-south relations developing toward reconciliation, unity and reunification in conformity with the expectation of the whole nation it will turn back the present situation to that before the publication of the June 15 north-south joint declaration, bringing all contacts, dialogue, visits and cooperation between the north and the south to stagnation at a bound. \r\n\r\n"
