Korean Authorities' Deceptive \"Peace\" Rhetoric Flailed\r\n Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- Dr. Ri Jong Gwon, researcher of the National Reunification Institute, issued an article titled \"Deceptive 'peace' rhetoric will invite horrible disaster of war and self-destruction\".\n\t\t\t\t\t The article enumerated thoughtless acts of the south Korean chief executive who trumpets about \"peace\" every day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the present south Korean chief executive is letting out the rhetoric as if he is an \"apostle of peace\" but in fact he is aboard the nuclear war chariot for aggression of the north driven by the U.S., the article noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the present situation, the \"peace\" rhetoric touted by the south Korean authorities is no more than a smokescreen to cover up the U.S. war hysteria, and a veil to conceal their sinister intention to bring down the DPRK with the backing of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that their deceptive \"peace\" rhetoric is a foolish act of inviting self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they truly stand for peace, it should think what genuine peace on the Korean peninsula has to be and where lies the way of settling it from the stand of prioritizing the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not try to deceive the public at home and abroad with the sugar-coated \"peace\" rhetoric but find a way-out in getting themselves rid of the U.S. yoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"strategy for existence\" to avert a horrible war also lies in implementing the north-south joint declaration with sincere attitude and stand, by pooling efforts in the idea of By Our Nation Itself, away from sycophancy and submission to the U.S., not in \"tightening south Korea-U.S. alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The way of ensuring \"the supreme national interests\" lies in discerning who is the partner with whom they can join hands and bring about  independent reunification and peace and prosperity, and in solving all issues in the line of the people's requirements and nation's interests, not in staying under the U.S. master's \"nuclear umbrella\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation on the Korean peninsula where the danger of war is created demands the south Korean authorities make a proper policy decision at the crossroads of peace or war."
