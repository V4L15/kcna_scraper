This is a serious lesson drawn from the collapse of former East European socialist countries.\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea has consistently adhered to and implemented the principles of Juche in ideology, independence in politics, self-support in the economy and self-reliance in national defence in the whole period from the struggle for national liberation to the struggle for building a new country after the liberation, the Fatherland Liberation War, the postwar rehabilitation and construction and the socialist revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the consistent and steadfast independent politics of the WPK, the DPRK could straightly advance along the road of socialism chosen by it, without the slightest vacillation in the rapidly changing situation of the world. The Songun politics of the WPK is the most vivid expression of independent politics. This politics has immensely increased the national power of the DPRK and its influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists and dominationists are working hard to block the peoples from advancing toward the road of independence but in vain. The 21st century will be a century in which the humankind's idea of independence is carried into practice in all aspects and independent politics becomes the basic political mode of the world.\r\n The Korean people will invariably uphold the idea of independence, the banner of Songun to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche and more dynamically struggle to realize the cause of global independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Korean people will always remember the feats of the officers and men of the former Red Army who shed their blood in battles to defeat the Japanese imperialist aggressor troops in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the liberation of the country the Korean people put a period to the nearly half a century-long colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists and retook the sovereignty of the nation and a broad avenue for building an independent and prosperous, new Korea was opened ahead of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to the President's idea and leadership that after the liberation Korea witnessed a man-centred socialist country where the people enjoy an independent and creative life as genuine masters of the state and society, a big harmonious and happy socialist family where all the members of the society help and lead each other forward and bring the common idea into full bloom, firmly united as one in mind and purpose around the Party and the leader, and socialism has become the life and soul of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A century ago, Korea had to be disgraced as a ruined nation owing to the exhausted national power. But, it is now shining as a politically, ideologically and militarily strong country in the world. The credit for this goes to leader Kim Jong Il who is glorifying the President's revolutionary idea and exploits down through generations.\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and the people should protect the headquarters of the revolution headed by  Kim Jong Il politically and ideologically and at the cost of their lives and build up the politico-ideological and socialist working class positions as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need to channel big sustained efforts into the strengthening of the People's Army and solve all the problems arising in the revolution and construction on the principle of attaching importance to military affairs and putting military affairs above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At present we are faced with an important task to mobilize the entire strength increased under the great Songun politics for building an economic power of the 21st century at an early date, the reporter said, calling upon all the Party members and other working people to give full play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance in every worksite and bring about a revolutionary surge of Songun on all fronts of socialist economic construction with a high degree of consciousness of citizens to contribute to the prosperity of the country of Juche and burning patriotic zeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will hold fast to the three charters for national reunification laid down by the President and realize the three forms of cooperation--national independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism--under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration to achieve the independent reunification of the country without fail, the reporter stated. \r\n We are now in acute showdown with the imperialist reactionaries, he noted, adding: The army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly smash the moves of the enemies to isolate and stifle the DPRK any time and finally conclude the stand-off with the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We constantly maintain the stand on the peaceful negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue and will continue to work hard for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter expressed the resolution to strive to decisively foil the U.S. imperialists' ambition for world supremacy and their brigandish state terrorism in firm solidarity with the world people advocating independence, protect peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world, boost the friendly and cooperative relations with all the countries that respect the sovereignty of the DPRK and build an independent, peaceful and friendly, new world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Militarist Japan Has No Future\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- Japan has a record of most hideous war crimes as it provoked many bloody wars against other countries in the past.\r\n Its history is woven with wars and plunder of other countries, as evidenced by the Imjin war it started against Korea in 1592 under the absurd pretext of \"opening the way to Ming Dynasty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to invade sovereign states Japan fabricated \"treaties\" with no legal validity by brigandish methods and indiscriminately killed and abducted innocent civilians in the occupied areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period it savagely looted natural resources and cultural treasures in the regions under its occupation. After the Second World War it was severely punished by the international community and registered in the UN Charter as an enemy state.\r\n Japan is the only country that has neither apologized nor repented of its past crimes though it is 60 years since its defeat, far from compensating for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is ridiculous enough to readvocate its plan for the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which it had used as a political basis for igniting the \"Pacific War\". It is explaining this as the main reason why it has denied its acts of aggression. It has gone the lengths of painting its war of aggression as a \"war for liberation\".\r\n It has long beautified its war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after its defeat Japan refused to admit that it was a defeated nation and a criminal state and refrained from using the word \"surrender\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of its defeat Japan worked hard to conceal its past crimes. It was aimed to instill into all members of the Japanese society the extreme national egoist view on history that they should not feel guilty of war crimes at all and help Japan remain in the international area a normal state, not a war criminal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is, however, an abnormal country whose ugly image remains unimproved.\r\n The present political system in Japan is of Rightist nature, extremely militarist nature reminiscent of the era of Empire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rightist conservative forces whose goal is to militarize Japan form the main forces of its political circle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These militarist forces are directly exercising increasing influence on shaping policies.\r\n Japan's political circle which identifies militarism with its mental mainstay is focusing all its efforts on infusing it into all members of the society. It is the main job of the political, public, cultural, academic and press and other circles of Japan to arm the Japanese with the militarist idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, high-ranking officials of the Japanese government and its conservative forces unhesitatingly visit the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" under the pretext of \"paying homage to the war dead.\" Burning incense there, they call back the departed soul of militarists and urge Japanese to learn from their \"spirit.\" All the provocative moves of Japan such as distorting history and beautifying it which arouse concern and vigilance among Asian countries are prompted by the wild ambition of its Rightist forces to realize militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the supreme policy goal of Japan to wind up its militarization for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since its defeat Japan has consistently pursued militarization. After the demise of the Cold War it adopted a military strategy for preemptive attack. \r\n Japan began reorganizing the military machine in violation of the present constitution banning the possession of the army after the war. It is now working in the direction of centralizing the military structure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the adoption of a series of war laws, Japan regained the right to participate in a war and the right to belligerency, paving the way for overseas aggression.\r\n The \"Self-Defense Forces\"(SDF) have grown strong both in quality and in numerical strength. The ground, marine and air SDF have been built into mobile strike forces for offensive equipped with latest military hardware. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The SDF war preparations have been, in fact, wound up as huge potentials are already in place for meeting the wartime demands for war equipment and military materiel.\r\n Japan completely lost the criteria of independent politics long ago.\r\n Japan's politics is characterized by its submission and flattery towards the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's foreign policy is focused on garnering support from the superpower. No wonder, there are comments even inside Japan that its government does not have its own policy and independent diplomacy except its practice of toeing the U.S. line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has long pursued its diplomatic policy of toeing the U.S. line, going under the U.S. security \"umbrella\", away from Asia. Japan has neither reason nor principle.\r\n The international community, therefore, views Japan as an untrustworthy country. It acts without any faith, grossly reneging on the commitments made by it before other countries as if nothing had happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was clearly illustrated by Japan's stand and viewpoint on the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has never moved to fulfill its commitments since the publication of the declaration. It has persistently peddled the \"abduction issue\" which had been already settled while talking about \"people's sentiment\". Furthermore, it brought the \"abduction issue\" to the six-party talks aimed to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, creating complexity in the way of discussion. Its behavior was only criticized and derided by the participants in the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such outcries as \"Japan may start a war against north Korea\" and \"Japan should make a preemptive strike against the missile bases in north Korea\" are now heard from Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for Japan to be called a \"political dwarf\" and \"politically minor country\" which does not know where it stands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n August 15 marks the 60th anniversary of the defeat of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a crucial occasion for Japan in the light of the historical review and from a future-oriented viewpoint. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan remains unchanged in its state appearance and political nature. If there be any, it still remains the only shameless state which has not redressed its past crimes for the last six decades and it has militarized all the fields of the state, thus emerging a \"country capable of igniting a war\" from a \"country incapable of waging any war\" and, furthermore, a fascist state in the East gravely threatening once again peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world in the 21st century. \r\n Militarist Japan has no future as it is rushing headlong into aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is one more precious fruition gained in implementing the June 15 joint declaration, a landmark for national reunification and a great programme for great national unity, stressed the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side said that there were some problems from which to draw lessons in the process of removing the propaganda means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side noted that the south side proposed to discuss schedule concerning the third general-level military talks to be held at Mt.

It is in wanton violation of the preamble and the Paragraph 13 c and d of the Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The planned joint war maneuver assumes increasingly grave nature as it is scheduled to take place at a time when the U.S. has carried out the relocation of its forces in south Korea after working out a new operation plan for preemptive attack on the DPRK and a vast \"arms buildup plan\" that called for spending 13 billion US dollars is being implemented at its final phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Multi-faceted dialogue is making brisk headway between the north and the south and the enthusiasm of all Koreans to wipe out the long-standing misunderstanding and distrust and promote the process of reconciliation and cooperation through it is running high on the Korean Peninsula in hearty response to the slogan of \"By our nation itself,\" guided by the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the six-party talks for a peaceful solution of the nuclear issue are in high gear. This large-scale saber rattling to be staged against the DPRK against this backdrop is nothing but a gross violation of peace as it stuns the world and infuriates its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess what the U.S. side seeks through this war drill. \r\n Its brigandish aim is to wind up its preparations for preemptive attack on the DPRK and drive the situation on the peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension in a bid to block the positive process of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south and force the DPRK to accept the unjust demands raised by the U.S. at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite unjustifiable for the U.S. side to stage a provocative war exercise under the simulated conditions of an all-out war against the DPRK with huge forces and the latest war hardware involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. side's arrogant action only bars the KPA from expecting anything from the dialogue with the U.S. and reinforces its correct judgment that it is the only way of defending the country and its sovereignty and system to build up deterrence for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA side is fully ready to respond to a war in kind any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will closely follow the U.S. side's war exercise with a high degree of vigilance and take a prompt decisive countermeasure, once deemed necessary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Keynote Report at World Conference for Support to Korea's Reunification\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The World Conference in Support of the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea was opened here Saturday.\r\n Secretary General of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea (CILRECO) Guy Dupre delivered a keynote report at the conference.\r\n Elaborating on the struggle waged by the Korean people for the country's reunification, he suggested measures to be taken to fully support the Korean people's cause of reunification by pooling efforts of the anti-imperialist independent forces of the world desiring peace and progress. \r\n He noted that the U.S. military occupation of south Korea after the Japanese imperialists' defeat at the Second World War divided Korea into the north and the south, thus protracting the national division suffered by the Korean people up to now.\r\n President Kim Il Sung put forward the most reasonable and fair proposals for the national reunification from time to time and devoted all his life to realize this patriotic cause, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean people are struggling more vigorously to achieve the independent reunification of the country under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il and the reunification movement is entering a new phase in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a bold patriotic decision, he took the initiative to arrange the meeting between leaders of the north and the south in 2000 for the fist time after Korea was divided, making possible the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, in which three principles for national reunification are applied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe publication of the joint declaration is an event of special importance in the history of the movement for Korea's independent and peaceful reunification.\r\n After the publication of the joint declaration, hundreds of joint functions took place between the north and south, and talks, contacts and exchanges of various levels have further expanded, making the era of reconciliation and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula irreversible, and the reunification movement is developing into a nationwide one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such historic change in the reunification movement of Korea is a proud result brought about by the firm attitude and consistent policy of the DPRK which strives to reunify Korea, free from the intervention of the outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing that it is none other than the United States that is obstructing peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula, the reporter further said:\r\n In 1948 the U.S. instigated its followers to fabricate a separate \"government\" in south Korea. Since that time on, it has pursued anti-reunification maneuvers to perpetuate Korea's division until now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After various high-level talks between the north and the south of Korea in early 1990s which resulted in the adoption of the \"Agreement on Reconciliation and Non-Aggression, Cooperation and Exchange between the North and South\" and the \"Joint declaration on Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula\", the U.S. laid hindrance in every possible way and fabricated the \"nuclear issue\" of the Korean Peninsula, raising frantic anti-DPRK rackets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Even now, the Bush administration intensifies political, economic and military pressure on the DPRK and instigates the separatist forces of south Korea to obstruct the reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south, therefore attempting to prevent the Korean people from advancing along the road to reunification under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n The responsibility of the \"nuclear crisis\" on the Korean Peninsula claimed by the U.S. totally lies on the U.S. side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the CILRECO and regional organizations for supporting Korea's reunification have launched various campaigns on a wide scale to frustrate maneuvers of the U.S. and anti-reunification forces in Korea for the last 30 years, the reporter referred to tasks for conducting the international solidarity movement on a higher stage in keeping pace with the favorable atmosphere created on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important here is to launch a campaign for supporting the struggle of the Korean people to reunify the country true to the spirit of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, in which the unanimous desire of the entire Korean nation is reflected.\r\n All the solidarity organizations should extend support to and solidarity with the Korean people in their struggle to achieve Korea's reunification by the Korean nation itself free from the interference of outside forces and to realize the national unity and cooperation, the basic guarantee for reunification, and reveal and frustrate the maneuvers of the conservative forces including the United States to obstruct the independent reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should join in the struggle to get the American troops withdrawn from south Korea and to put an end to the U.S. hostile policy against the DPRK.\r\n They should conduct more brisk activities to give a clear understanding to the international community that converting the armistice mechanism into peace mechanism is the primary issue for securing peace on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n The reporter underlined the need to vigorously launch campaigns to put pressure on the U.S. government so that it normalizes relationship with the DPRK and comes to the negotiation table with the DPRK for settling the \"nuclear issue\" on the Korean Peninsula in a peaceful way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All solidarity organizations must expand their ranks and intensify their activities in every respective country, thus enabling the movement for supporting the Korean people's struggle to take place on a worldwide scale, he stressed.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
