Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Il Sung, who regarded it as his motto to believe in the people as in heaven, deeply considerate of the long-cherished desire of the Korean people, took an untrodden path for building socialism of Juche. The socialist power independent in politics, self-supporting in economy and self-reliant in defence characterized with the people-first principle was built on this land thanks to the wise leadership of Kim Il Sung who advanced the revolution by believing in the people and rousing them to action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il had made an arduous forced march, holding aloft the banner of Songun, and thus reliably defended Korean-style socialism, the greatest patriotic legacy of Kim Il Sung, and successfully led it to prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t High mountains and steep passes on this land are associated with the devoted footsteps of Kim Jong Il who visited every nook and corner of the country to defend the destiny of the people and bring the people's happiness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century of Juche, Korean-style socialism is demonstrating the ever-victorious might while powerfully displaying its advantages under the leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls upon everyone to keep great pride and self-esteem of having the Kim Il Sung-Kim Jong Il Constitution and thoroughly apply it to all aspects of social life and thus build the best power and thriving socialist nation of Juche on this land as soon as possible."
