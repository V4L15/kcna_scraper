            "content": "Japan urged to renounce ill-intentioned plan \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- Vice Minister Sato of the Japan Defense Agency at a press conference said that the recent U.S. failure in the third anti-ballistic missile test-fire has no direct effects on joint researches of Japan and the U.S. now under way for \"Theatre Missile Defense\" system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today describes his remarks as a sophism that as the U.S. \"National Missile Defense\" program and the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" program promoted by Japan and the U.S. are diametrically different from each other the \"Theatre Missile Defense\" program should be continuously promoted irrespective of the recent failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"NMD\" and \"TMD\" are promoted to allegedly cope with non-existent \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are prompted by the U.S. strategic aim to gain unchallenged military upper hand over Russia, China and other big countries in Asia and, furthermore, establish domination over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. intends to let Japan bear heavy financial and hi-tech burden  for \"TMD.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. sustained efforts for \"missile defense\" already touched off a wave of new arms race worldwide, posing threat to peace and security in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even after the end of the cold war the Japanese reactionaries are trying to push ahead with the \"TMD\" program with the backing of the U.S. and gain the position of a military power so as to realise their design for overseas expansion. The world takes a precaution against their reckless design of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries had better have a good understanding of the world public opinion and give up ill-intentioned design. \r\n\r\n"
