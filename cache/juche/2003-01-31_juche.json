It calls for mobilizing sophisticated military hardware and information system in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean Peninsula to neutralize the DPRK's \"offensive forces,\" indiscriminately strike its strategic vantages and thus seize the military initiative and put it under the U.S. control in the shortest possible time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the planned U.S. military actions presuppose preemptive attacks upon the DPRK. pursuant to this scenario, the U.S. Forces in South Korea are busy with the reorganization of their units to increase their capability to invade the north. The U.S. is hell-bent on developing tactical nuclear weapons to be used in the second Korean War, while pushing ahead with the formation of a \"joint stealth operation unit\" whose mission is to carry out a preemptive nuclear assault operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove the U.S. talk that it has \"no intention to invade North Korea\" and stands for \"dialogue\" is nothing but sheer sophism to fool the public opinion and a trick to buy time to round off the deployment of its aggressor forces according to its war scenario.

            "content": "Bush hit for slandering DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement accusing U.S. President Bush of committing such a very grave provocation as malignantly slandering the DPRK in a \"state of union address\" at congress on January 29. \r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush said an oppressive regime rules a people. He further said we now know that the regime was deceiving the world, and developing those weapons all along, and today the North Korean regime is using its nuclear program to incite fear and seek concessions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush has so far earned an ill-fame as an emotional backbiter, but his recent address clearly proves that he is a shameless charlatan reversing black and white under the eyes of the world and the incarnation of misanthropy as he rejects the people out of his favor for no reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had he come to power than he, prompted by the deep-rooted hostility toward the socialist system in the DPRK, described the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" only to invite worldwide criticism and condemnation and retract his remarks in less than one year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the international community expressed deep apprehensions in the wake of his remarks listing the DPRK as a target of preemptive nuclear attacks, Bush, commander-in-chief, said in great haste that the U.S. had no intention to invade North Korea. But, in actuality, he sent an aircraft carrier to the East Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people is a peace-loving people who never had their eyes on other country, a nation whose history began thousands of years ago when the U.S. did not exist in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The demands of the DPRK still remain simple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not seek to gain concessions from the U.S. by threatening it as Bush claimed, but urges the U.S. to stop its intervention and threat so that the Korean people may live in peace for themselves as they did when such a country as the U.S. did not exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this purport the DPRK proposed the U.S. to legally assure each other of non-aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has deployed nuclear weapons in one part of Korea which has nothing to do with it and posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK, causing the nuclear issue to surface on the Korean Peninsula. The U.S. was the first to have nuclear weapons and emerged as the world's largest possessor of weapons of mass destruction. Yet it is trying to mislead the public opinion by spreading the rumor that the DPRK is chiefly to blame for the nuclear issue. This is the height of shamelessness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless remarks made by Bush in his official speech dealing with the year's national policy cannot but reflect the stand and policy of the present U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy speech is, in essence, an undisguised declaration of aggression to topple the DPRK system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ulterior motive in having persistently dodged the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. has now been brought to daylight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks the DPRK will remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. reckless moves to dare topple the DPRK system which was chosen and built by the Korean people themselves and is considered by them as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will never allow the U.S. to wantonly encroach upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK and destroy its system. \r\n We will do our utmost to defend our system in view of the U.S. declaration of aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
