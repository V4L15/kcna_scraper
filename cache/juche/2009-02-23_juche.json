Even under such severe political tempest, the DPRK uplifted the red flag of socialism, adhering to the fundamental interests and principles of revolution without any concession and the slightest deviation. And it decisively frustrated the anti-DPRK moves of the imperialist allied forces getting evermore pronounced in the new century and remarkably enhanced the prestige of the country and the dignity of the nation. This striking reality would have been unthinkable without General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the illustrious commander who clarified the philosophy on army that the revolution is pioneered, advanced and accomplished with arms and built up the invincible revolutionary armed forces by attaching importance to the arms and military affairs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMilitary clashes have been prevented on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and another Korean war has not broken out so far. It is because socialism of the DPRK has been defended by Kim Jong Il's Songun leadership and Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people contained the U.S. imperialists' offensive against the DPRK, thus reducing the U.S. policy of aggression on it to collapse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe failure of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK is leading to the total bankruptcy of the international political order centered on the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe trend of the times is swimming towards the multi-polar world despite of the U.S. moves to build a unipolar world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A signal turn is being brought in accomplishing the global cause of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has made great changes in all fields of politics, military affairs, economy and culture in the crucible of struggle to defend socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Socialist Korea, which is demonstrating its might while winning victory by dint of Songun politics, has become the beacon of hope and the banner of victory for the world peoples aspiring after independence."
