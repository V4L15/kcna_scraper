They took a picture of the secretary general of the committee getting into a car with his Chinese wife to attend a function on an official invitation of the DPRK embassy and tailed after them driving for the embassy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They resorted to a petty trick to misrepresent the entry of the secretary general and his wife into the embassy as \"an abduction case\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is not the whole story. Fuji TV reporters who flew to Switzerland in December last year asked the chairman of the committee for an \"interview\" and behaved arrogantly like judicial officers treating criminals after displaying pictures they had taken. They tried to force him to admit that the committee had \"cooperated\" in the \"abduction\" of Asian women to north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lashed into fury by their impudent and robber-like act, the chairman demanded they get out promptly, but they persistently stuck to their gun and vanished in the end. Next day, they went to the chairman of the Pyongyang Cultural Interchange Centre in Lausanne, Switzerland, a Swiss organization for friendship with the DPRK, and copied there an invitation card to a function issued by the committee. That night they flocked to the secretary general of the committee and went berserk asking him questions to induce him to admit that he had \"abducted\" an Asian woman and handed her over to the DPRK mission. When the wife of the secretary general appeared before the Japanese reporters at that moment, they tucked their tails and ran away. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must be made clear that the acts of the reporters from the land of Japs were acts of hooligans not suited to journalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact shows that the reactionaries of the land of Japs are getting more hysteric in their dastardly moves to hurt the external authority of the DPRK and arrest the legitimate and just activities of the organizations for friendship with the DPRK formed in many countries worldwide.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

National independence is the essence of the joint declaration and lifeline for realizing the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is responsible for its own destiny and it is able to defend and shape its destiny. Any outside forces can not carry out the reunification movement directly related to the destiny of the Korean nation in its stead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the adoption of the joint declaration, it has been clearly proved through its implementation that there is nothing impossible to be done by the Korean nation when its members join their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any humiliating practice based on flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders should never be allowed as it goes against the trend of the present times and the idea of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should vigorously struggle to resolutely repulse any moves to eliminate the joint declaration regarding the principle of national independence as its basic spirit. In particular, they should strictly preserve the Juche character and national character with the pride of being members of the homogeneous nation with history of 5,000 years and decisively reject the U.S. interruption and interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint declaration is a declaration on national independence and great national unity, and it is urgent to strengthen the might of great national unity in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve the great unity of the nation, it is necessary to build up a nationwide alliance of pro-reunification patriotic forces irrespective of differences in ideology and ism, political view, religious belief, class and social strata. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to cement the solidarity and alliance among the reunification movement organizations in the north and the south of Korea and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the compatriots should turn out to implement the three-point task of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving the unity and thus usher in the heyday of the cause of independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
