This can never be overlooked as it is a dangerous attempt to ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. speaks volumes about \"ensuring peace and security\" on the Korean Peninsula. But this is nothing but rhetoric to cover up its true colors as a peace wrecker who escalates the tension and brings the dark clouds of a war to hang over the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the arch criminal posing a military threat to the DPRK and systematically straining the situation on the peninsula through its ceaseless war drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers pretend to be interested in the detente on the peninsula, but they can never cover up their sinister intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are concerned for the peace on the peninsula, they should stop the dangerous military actions contrary to it, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. is persisting in its dangerous saber-rattling together with the south Korean warmongers, asserting that it is the best way to go ahead with military pressure and economic sanctions simultaneously.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is the sinister intention of the warmongers to push the situation on the peninsula to an extreme pitch of tension and ratchet up international pressure upon the DPRK under the pretext of its countermeasures to cope with the situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" in public but more frantically intensifying its provocative anti-DPRK offensive drills behind the scene.

This is evidenced by the fact that he agreed with his master on establishing a \"combined field command\" to replace the U.S.-south Korea \"Combined Forces Command\" after the transfer of the right to command wartime operations in 2015. It is a scenario of the puppet group to keep south Korea as a colonial military base of the U.S. even after 2015 and continue pursuing confrontation with fellow countrymen, backed by the U.S. This found a vivid manifestation in the fact that Kim signed a joint statement on \"cooperating with Japan in deterring the north's provocation\" with the Japanese minister of Defense at a military confab targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that it is hard to defuse the tension and improve the inter-Korean relations under the situation where warmongers are keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen, holding important government posts. That is why Koreans at home and abroad are increasingly concerned over the prospect of dialogue though the south Korean authorities accepted the DPRK's proposal for dialogue recently.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities truly want detente and improved inter-Korean relations, they should prove their will by taking such practical steps as eliminating confrontation maniacs."
