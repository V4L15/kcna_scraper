We highly praise great successes made by the Workers' Party and people of Korea in their struggle to protect the sovereignty of the country, national dignity and the cause of socialism from the U.S. imperialists' moves for aggression and achieve national reunification, true to the Songun politics of leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Second. We express full support and militant solidarity with the fraternal Korean people, believing that the WPK and the Korean people will win a great victory in the struggle to check and frustrate the U.S. imperialists' nuclear racket and defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Third. Now the situation on the Korean peninsula has reached a dangerous phase due to the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We denounce the moves stepped up by the U.S. imperialists for aggression in a wild bid to suffocate the DPRK and demand them drop their hostile policy toward the DPRK and immediately withdraw their forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fourth. We support the widespread struggle waged by all the Koreans for the country's reunification along the road indicated by the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration adopted in 2000 and call on all the progressive parties of the world to stage a solidarity movement for voicing firm support to the WPK and the Korean people in their struggle to prevent the danger of war from the Korean peninsula, consolidate peace there and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A solidarity message to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were representatives of 65 progressive political parties from 28 countries including the WPK, the Communist Party of China, the Communist Party of Cuba and the Communist Party of Vietnam.    \r\n\r\n"

This is an unbearable insult to and a mockery of the victims of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists and their bereaved families as well as the Asian people. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n Accusing them of asserting that it was \"the sense of obligation and duty\" of the Japanese people to pray for the souls of those who were killed in the way of continental aggression and remember their \"exploits\", the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seek to regularize, traditionalize and popularize the visit to the shrine, describing it as a token of \"people's sentiment\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is aimed to implant militarism deep into the mind of the Japanese people and thus build an ideological foundation for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such arrogant and shameless moves of the Japanese reactionaries are triggering off bitter hatred for Japan among the Korean and other Asian peoples and hardening their determination to take revenge upon it as they suffered tremendous mental, human and material damage due to its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those keen to repeat their crime-woven history are bound to face punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should lend an ear to the call of the people at home and abroad for peace, away from the consciousness of militarist aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These military moves are dangerous ones aimed to provoke the second Korean war. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: The U.S. warmongers have described those war exercises as ones for \"rapid retaliation\". This is, however, nothing but a smokescreen to cover up the aggressive nature and danger of those military exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no threat on the Korean peninsula that compels the U.S. to rapidly cope with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that RSOI and Foal Eagle to be launched by the U.S. together with the south Korean army with huge armed forces and military equipment involved are comprehensive test military operations to be conducted under the simulated conditions of a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue is a trick to ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK by aggravating the situation behind the curtain of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' evermore undisguised moves to invade the DPRK are only further heightening the vigilance of its army and people against the U.S. and their anti-U.S. consciousness than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it thinks it can easily realize its plan to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army of the DPRK which attaches importance to military affairs is fully combat-ready and will deal merciless blows at the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The new species spreads its stalks and leaves more than four times as fast as other species of the golden turf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nodes shorter than other species by a half, the new species strikes so many roots to cover the soil and thus prevents soil from being washed away by rain. Its thick leaves keep the soil moist, so they remain green even in the dry season. And it comes back to life easily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The color of the turf and its seed is light green, which resembles a green carpet. The color remains unchanged by November. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The turf has been planted on Yanggak Islet and in different parts of Pyongyang.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This reality requires all the people to struggle with deep self-respect of the working class.\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in a signed article today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The self-respect of the working class serves as a powerful spiritual weapon in the struggle to realize independence of the popular masses.   The people with strong self-respect of the working class can emerge victorious in the present struggle against imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's self-respect of the working class represents the do-or-die spirit that no force on earth can defeat a people ready to die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The self-respect of the working class serves as a powerful driving force that enables one to advance faster to attain a higher goal, remaining neither pessimistic about backwardness nor self-complacent with victory. It also serves as an ideological and moral source of producing a strong pluck to do everything one's own way, loving and valuing one's own things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary slogan \"Let us live our own way!\" can be seen wherever one goes in the DPRK. The Korean people have decisively frustrated every move of imperialists and settled every issue arising in the revolution and construction their own way under this slogan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  All the servicemen  and people of the DPRK will as ever carry on their struggle with this self-respect and thus emerge victorious in the present anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle and bring earlier a bright prospect of a great prosperous powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
