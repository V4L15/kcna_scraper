The U.S. troops even used wood-cuter as a killing tool and skinned or dismembered them to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. raised A-bomb scare to carry people to south Korea but on the way killed over 4,000 in the makeshift bridge over ther River Taedong and on the frozen River Taedong and more than 30,000 in Sariwon-Haeju road.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When retreating from the northern areas which were under their temporary control from the end of 1950, the U.S. imperialist aggressors spread all kinds of infectious viruses including smallpox, making the areas plagued with infectious diseases. The number of cases who contracted infectious diseases rapidly increased to reach 3 500 in April 1951 10 percent out of whom ended up in death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From early January to March 1952, the U.S. dropped all kinds of germ bombs on 169 areas in the northern half of Korea including highlands, coastal areas and mountainous areas a total of 804 times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In May 1952, the U.S. flew hundreds of planes to sky over the DPRK every day and a quarter of them dropped germ bombs. The highest number of flights reached over 480 a day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The use of poisonous gas by the U.S. began with its indiscriminate bombing on Nampho on May 6, 1951.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1,379 people died due to the poisonous gas in Nampho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are other examples proving the atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialists in wanton violation of war legislation and custom during the Korean war.
