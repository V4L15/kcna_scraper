            "content": "Shameless challenge to justice and truth = KCNA commentary =\r\nPyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government decided to totally deny the ruling of the Yamaguchi district court that it should make state compensations to former \"Comfort Women for the Japanese Army\" and lodged an intermediate appeal with the Hiroshima high court on May 8, according to a news report.\r\n   Enraging people, this is a shameless challenge to justice and truth.\r\n   As already reported, the Yamaquchi district court in Japan recently made a comparatively fair decision that the Japanese government should compensate 300,000 yen to each of three \"comfort women\" of South Korean origin who brought lawsuits for compensation against it. Though belated and partial, it can be said to be fortunate for the conscience of humankind, who values justice, truth and human rights.\r\n   Nevertheless, the Japanese government lodged an intermediate appeal in defiance of elementary human ethics, morality and international law. This reveals that the moral inferiority and shamelessness of the present Japanese authorities have already reached the extremity of subhumanity.\r\n   The criminal \"comfort women\" case, which was recorded as an unprecedented disgrace in human history, is a monstrous rape committed by the Japanese imperialists with the connivance of the government. In those days, the Japanese imperialists established the unprecedented system of \"comfort women\" to supply women as war munitions, crying that it was necessary to gratify sexual demands of soldiers in order to retain their war zeal and combat capacity.\r\n   Women of Korea and other countries, more than 200,000, were \"hunted\" and enlisted as \"comfort women.\" the Japanese imperialists locked them in wooden brothels. A woman was raped by 20 to 40 Japanese beasts every day. In case \"comfort women\" refused to obey, they dismembered their limbs or gouged out their breasts, thus killing them. They regarded it as their pleasure.\r\n   It is not accidental that the entire humankind feels indignant at the crimes concerning the \"comfort women.\"\r\n   How to liquidate bestial crimes and disgraceful past of Japan today when the 21st century is coming is considered a touchstone for determining qualifications of the Japanese as human beings.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must clearly know that without the sincere liquidation of their past, they cannot clear themselves of such a dishonor as a \"filthy country\" and \"morally inferior country.\"\r\n   Human conscience is following the attitude of Japan.    \r\n  \r\n"

Korean chief executive's \"dialogue with people\"\r\n Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today, commenting on the South Korean authority's recent \"dialogue with people,\" says politics is not a waste of words.\r\n   Though the South Korean economic situation has become all the more serious, he embellished the situation, alleging that the serious economic crisis has been brought under control and the economy improved, the daily says, and continued:\r\n   In the \"dialogue\" he said the economic crisis can be straightened out and the unemployment problem solved only through the introduction of more foreign capital and the application of a lay-off system. His remark is really ludicrous. It is due to foreign capital that the South Korean economy has been ruined.\r\n   He paid no concern to the national reunification issue but cried for \"reciprocity\" which is necessary between countries.\r\n   His \"dialogue with people\" was aimed at pacifying public discontent, ensuring the \"stability of the regime\" and winning success in the forthcoming \"local self-government election.\"    \r\n        \r\n\r\n"

In expanding its ranks, it is imperative to appreciate and admit applicants with loyalty to its basic idea and principle as a criterion.\r\n   If the non-aligned countries develop South-South Cooperation, they can develop the economy without recourse to the developed countries.\r\n   Intensifying economic power is tantamount to the strengthening of resisting power  against the west.\r\n   The Workers' Party and people of Korea will in the future, too, remain loyal to the basic idea and principle of the NAM and vigorously advance shoulder to shoulder with the non-aligned countries in the struggle to oppose imperialism and build a new independent world.    \r\n\r\n"
