It is also designed to protect the rice, which keeps the Korean nation alive, and thus defend the food sovereignty by themselves, it noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The farmers will struggle to the last against the opening of rice market which would do harm to the health and life of the people and threaten their existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, members of the Emergency Committee for Measures for Blocking the Passage of Bill on Opening Rice Market through the \"National Assembly\", which groups major organizations of farmers including the National Federation of Peasants Associations, the Federation of Agricultural Managers of south Korea, the National Federation of Women Peasants Associations and the Association of Catholic Farmers, had a press conference in front of the building of Kukmin Bank in Youido, Seoul, before launching a hunger sit-in strike.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
