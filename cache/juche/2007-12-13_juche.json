            "content": "Inter-Korean General-Level Talks Open \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The 7th north-south general-level military talks opened in the portion of the south side in Panmunjom on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were a delegation of the north side led by Lieut. General of the Korean People's Army Kim Yong Chol and a delegation of the south side with Ri Hong Gi, chief for Policy Planning of the Ministry of National Defence, as chief delegate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks discussed matters related to taking measures for providing a military guarantee for the north-south cooperation and exchange projects in the \"special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea\" under an agreement reached at the second north-south defence minister-level talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Steadfast is the stand of the KPA to provide a firm military guarantee for the implementation of the historic October 4 declaration, the head of the north side delegation said, clarifying its stand to take measures in the direction of increasing the time of passage through the Kaesong Industrial Zone and the Mt. Kumgang tourist zone, ensuring speedy and smooth communications and cutting down the time of customs clearance in those zones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Touching on the issue of the West Sea next, he called the south side to account for deliberately creating a hurdle in the way of solving the issue while persisting in its old stand, a sharp contrast to the north side's fair proposal and sincere efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He proposed a draft agreement on fixing waters for joint fishing and peaceful waters in the West Sea reflecting the fair and aboveboard stand of the north side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The draft agreement deals with the issues of setting waters for joint fishing and peaceful waters in the West Sea on the principle of promoting interests and prosperity common to the nation and ensuring peace, taking measures for providing a military guarantee for cooperation in those waters and keeping naval forces of both sides now standing in confrontation in the West Sea away from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the expectation that the south side would seriously study the north side's proposal and positively respond to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief delegate of the south side delegation spoke next. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks continue.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Settle Its Past Crimes\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 12 (KCNA) -- The more desperately Japan works to evade the settlement of its past war crimes, the crimes related to \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese army, the bigger its crimes will become and, consequently, it will stand further isolated in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today warns this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army committed by Japan in the past is the most hideous crime against humanity as it was perpetrated in utter defiance and violation of the social ethics and morality to be observed in the human life, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists forcibly drafted, lured and abducted hundreds of thousands of women and took them to battle fields, leaving them gang-raped. Not satisfied with this, they killed them in the most brutal manner beyond human imagination. This barbarism committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past is the most monstrous crime which can neither be written off nor concealed no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being hard reality, Japan has not yet admitted the sexual slavery enforced by it in the past, far from repenting of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army was one of the grave crimes committed by Japan during its war for continental aggression. Japan's stand and attitude toward the issue is a touchstone showing whether Japan is willing to break with its past to turn over a new leaf or opt for another war of aggression. The Japanese reactionaries' total denial of the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army was prompted by their sympathy with the past war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese reactionaries are allowed to deny those war crimes any longer, Japan will bring again horrible war disaster to Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their behavior is quite contrary to the trend of history as it is an insult to justice and detrimental to social development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are sadly mistaken if they calculate that the passage of time and the change of generations would help keep aside the war crimes, the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army committed by Japan in the past, to be ignored and forgotten by people in history.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
