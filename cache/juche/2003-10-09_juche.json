He might know this well in view of his present status and his political career deeply involved in the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that he let loose a string of vituperation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When he was holding the post as the deputy chief Cabinet secretary, he, referring to the abduction issue, asserted that the early repatriation of all family members of the victims is a precondition for the normalization of the relations.\" Such stand of the government and the party will remain unchanged in the future too, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He even did not bother to utter such provocative remarks that even if eight members of the families of the abducted Japanese are allowed to visit Japan the curtain of the abduction issue should not be lowered and Japan should not meet any demand for compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the abduction issue, which Abe raises as a signboard to win his political popularity, is concerned, it is an issue that has already been solved with the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe visited Pyongyang at that time as an official member of the Japanese side's delegation. His act of snubbing this can not be construed otherwise than a deliberate act to hamstring the implementation of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts suffice to prove that Abe is a typical ultra-nationalist who is obsessed with the ambition for militarization and fascistization for reinvasion as he has persistently negated the innumerable crimes Japan committed against Korea, instead of admitting, apologizing and compensating for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe should clearly face up to Japan's past history and behave with discretion if he is interested in the political future of Japan and the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan even a bit.    \r\n\r\n"
