It will sufficiently provide irrigation and industrial water to the western part of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The project is being pushed ahead under the difficult conditions where its builders are hard pressed for everything including machines and equipment, fuel and various other materials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Particularly, the work of digging a 160-km-long waterway, building a barrage, dozens of tunnels and many structures and laying ducts under ground is almost done manually. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The project is unprecedented in terms of amount of work to be done. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The scale of the project is 5 times the Phyongnam  irrigation project which was undertaken to store water in Lake Yonphung and 4 times the Kiyang irrigation project aimed to draw water on the lower reaches of the river taedong up to Lake Thaesong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Hundreds of pumping stations have so far been operated to pump up water at low areas to store water at minor reservoirs. But water of the River Taedong will be diverted through a man-made waterway. When the project is completed,  water of the River Taedong will automatically flow to some 20 reservoirs located in areas much lower than the level of the waterway. Then there will be no need to operate any longer 530 odd water pumps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The completion of the project will make it possible to satisfactorily solve the problem of water in the granaries on the west coast and build minor power stations at the Taegak barrage and the waterway to generate electricity and develop fish farming. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A new \"river\" will appear between the Taedong and Chongchon rivers to add to the beauty of the country's landscape. \r\n\r\n"

Kumgang in June. Drawing a proper lesson from this they should have apologized for their wrongdoings and turned to a right way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, they are now behaving like a thief crying \"stop, thief.\"  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a recent meeting they adopted what they called \"resolution\" in which they asserted that the north was \"taming media\" and they would \"resolutely react to the north's threat to violate the freedom of the press.\" In that way they renewed an anti-DPRK diatribe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a virulent challenge to the north-south joint declaration and a premeditated provocation against the north, far from being an issue related to the \"freedom of the press\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Choson Ilbo were a genuine medium, it would reflect on its wrongdoings before decrying others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    At a time when the whole nation is heading for national unity and reunification, true to the north-south joint declaration, only the Choson Ilbo is busy slandering the north and inciting confrontation between the north and south, floating the fiction that \"the June 25 War broke out due to the north's invasion of the south\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This smear campaign launched by Choson Ilbo diametrically runs counter to spirit of the north-south joint declaration for reconciliation and cooperation between the north and south and peace and reunification and constitutes an anti-national and anti-reunification crime as it fans up distrust, antagonism, confrontation and division among fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This act detrimental to national unity and reunification should be sternly dealt with as a treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those maniacs of the Choson Ilbo going against the strong trend towards reunification should be severely judged in the name of the nation and thrown overboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We once again solemnly declare that the north will not allow anyone obstructing national unity and reunification, be it Choson Ilbo or anything else nor will permit anyone setting a dirty foot in the inviolable land of the north. \r\n\r\n"
