He was behind bars for many years in South Korea, refusing to be converted.\r\n   Over the past five years he has regained everything he lost in South Korea in 43 years and enjoyed happiness. \r\n   He was almost dead with serious functional disorders and malnutrition when he passed through the military demarcation line.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il paid deep attention to his recovery from illness and health.\r\n   The President visited the hospital on his birthday, April 15, 1993, learned about Ri's treatment and expressed the hope that he would recover his health as early as possible.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il said that he would feel at ease when Ri In Mo completely recovers his health with all sorts of best medicines and best doctors and made sure that Ri enjoyed medical treatment even in an enemy country which has no diplomatic relations with the DPRK.\r\n   The General gave him as gifts luxurious house and car and all other necessary things. And he arranged a dinner for Ri on his first birthday after he returned to the DPRK and gave a state banquet on his 80th birthday.\r\n   The General also put his political integrity on the highest peak.\r\n   Ri In Mo, who suffered behind bars in South Korea for 34 years, refusing to be converted, is well known as the incarnation of faith and will not only in Korea but also in the world.\r\n   He was awarded \"Order of Kim Il Sung\" and two medals of DPRK Hero. \r\n   He participated in several national functions such as the military parade celebrating the 40th anniversary of the war victory, the national meeting of war veterans and the 7th conference of the Korean Journalists Union.\r\n   Several parts of the multi-part feature film \"the Nation and Destiny\" and a documentary film \"Incarnation of Faith and Will\" are based on his life.\r\n   A primary school in his native place of Kim Hyong Gwon county, Ryanggang Province, was named after him.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
