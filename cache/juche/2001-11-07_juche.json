General Assembly on October 31, when the agenda item no. 49 \"the equal representation at the U.N. Security Council (SC) and the issue of increasing the number of its members and other related issues\" was under discussion.\r\n The issue of increasing the number of SC members and ensuring the equal representation of every region is the core of the SC reform now under discussion and a key to democratizing the U.N. as a whole, going beyond the bounds of the SC, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the SC reform is to be properly carried out all the issues should be settled by a consensus of views through sufficient consultation among all members of the U.N.   If it is hard to reach an agreement on all the issues at a time, they may begin solving agreeable ones one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And the issue of the SC reform should be considered in connection with the issue of raising the authority of the U.N. General Assembly as part of the overall U.N. reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main thing in increasing the membership of the SC is to expand the representation of developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegation is of the view that it is necessary, first of all, to sharply increase the number of non-permanent members of the SC and invite mainly developing countries to sit on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We think that it is possible to discuss the issue of increasing the number of non-permanent members of the SC and the issue of increasing that of permanent members separately and begin the discussion on the issue of increasing the number of non-permanent members on which an agreement can be easily reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to be more prudent in dealing with the issue of increasing the number of SC permanent members, he stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Priority should be given to developing countries when agreeing to increase the number of permanent members. It is not in line with the true objective of the reform to talk about the permanent membership for a country which has not yet redressed its crimes committed against humanity in the past.    \r\n\r\n"

There is nothing problematic among them and there is no ground for Japan to delay their return. The longer the Japanese authorities delay it under this or that pretext, the stronger protest and denunciation by the Juche idea adherents and progressive figures they will meet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are well advised to face up to the trend of the times and properly understand the thoughts of the progressives and behave according to reason.    \r\n\r\n"
