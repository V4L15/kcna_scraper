The commentary said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States that is possessed of most numerous nuclear weapons in the world and is plotting to put into practice its preemptive nuclear attack is trying to evade its provision of light water reactors, a substantial guarantee for the north's right to use nuclear energy for a peaceful purpose, recognized by international law. This is diametrically contrary to the spirit of the joint statement called \"the spirit of mutual respect and equality\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary strongly urged the U.S. to provide the north with light water reactors (LWRs), the just right and demand of the north as a sovereign state, on the principle of implementing the joint statement with \"commitments for commitments\" and \"action for action\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It stressed that the U.S. should stop its plan for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the north and expanding the role of the U.S. forces for their permanent presence in the south and implement the joint statement on making joint efforts to establish peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula and achieve peace and stability in Northeast Asia.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This situation requires the world progressive people to wage a dynamic anti-imperialist struggle against war under the banner of defending peace.  \r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. It goes on:\r\n The danger of war is increasing as the days go by in the world and grave obstacles are lying in the way of the people's struggle  for progress and peace in the new century due to the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A struggle against war precisely means an anti-imperialist struggle. \r\n Enshrined in the joint slogans issued by the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea are the idea and spirit that it is impossible to avert a war nor is it possible to achieve lasting peace without an anti-imperialist struggle. This is entirely just scientific truth. \r\n The joint slogans calling for defending peace and security in Asia and the rest of the world from the imperialists' moves for aggression and war are powerfully encouraging all the peace-loving progressives of the world in the struggle for defending peace as they consider the anti-imperialist struggle against war as fundamental conditions for protecting peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity precisely means strength and provides a sure guarantee for victory. Only when broad strata of peace-loving forces of the world struggle in unity, is it possible to frustrate the war moves of the imperialists and defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are now stepping up their policies of appeasement and deception and threat and blackmail against the anti-imperialist and independent countries. This is nothing but a crafty artifice to break the unity of the anti-imperialist independent forces and destroy them one by one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to achieve the unity among the world peace-loving forces it is necessary to abide by the principle of respect for independence. The anti-imperialist struggle against war is one for defending independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the target of the anti-imperialist struggle at present. It is committing brigandish armed invasion against small and weak countries and anti-imperialist independent countries without hesitation, counting on its upper hand of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people should properly see through the true colors of the U.S. imperialists, the foe of peace and chieftain of war, and courageously struggle to frustrate their moves for aggression and war from a steadfast anti-U.S. stand.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: \r\n The issue of Korea's reunification is, in essence, the issue of rejoining the blood ties of the Korean nation divided into the north and the south and achieving the national unity. This naturally requires great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can keep the Korean nation permanently divided into two as it has been solidly united throughout its ancient history since its appearance. The reunion of the Korean nation as a homogeneous one is an inevitable trend of the national history and the law of national development for the homogenous Korean nation to become one.\r\n It is the invariable stand and consistent policy of the Workers' Party of Korea to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea through the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The line and policy of the WPK for great national unity are a brilliant inheritance and embodiment of President Kim Il Sung's idea of great national unity.\r\n The WPK has fully embodied and successfully carried forward the Juche-oriented idea of great national unity for the victory of which the President worked heart and soul all his life. This consistent line and policy of the WPK for great national unity deeply moved all the fellow countrymen and thus brought about such great national events of historic significance as providing the historic Pyongyang summit and giving birth to the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great national unity at present should be achieved in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration.\r\n The June 15 joint declaration is a declaration for national independence and great national unity as it embodies the idea of \"By our nation itself\". Thanks to the June 15 joint declaration, a landmark of national reunification in the 21st century, the Korean nation has been able to more vigorously promote the cause of great national unity.\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should wage a vigorous patriotic struggle for great national unity to accomplish the cause of national reunification, the greatest desire of the Korean nation, as early as possible through their concerted efforts as required by the stirring realty in the June 15 era of reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
