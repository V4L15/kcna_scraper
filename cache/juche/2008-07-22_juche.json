It gives a vivid description of the history and culture of the River Taedong, the cradle of the Korean nation which holds a legitimate position in the cultivation of world human culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It presents the primitive scenes, relics and remains, features of Paleolithic and Neolithic men and various scenes of their life on the River Taedong and in its basin, proving that this region is one of the world's five cradles of culture which contributed to the development of human culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Along with the history and culture of Ancient Korea which existed for about 3,000 years from the early thirtieth century B.C. to 108 B.C., it deals with the development of the history and culture of Koguryo, a millenarian power in the East, Koryo and Ri Dynasty, the customs and folk games of their people and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It shows that the long history and brilliant culture of 5,000 years are throwing ever brighter rays under the guidance of the peerlessly great persons through the historical and cultural remains of the area of the River Taedong and monumental edifices which have sprung up in the Songun era. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Moves to Grab Tok Islet under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 21 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities and some media are now busy with very disturbing charades aimed at persistently insisting that Tok Islet, part of the inviolable territory of Korea, belongs to Japan. These are nothing but the moves to revive militarism as they are intended to imbue the Japanese people with the idea of seizing the islet and drive them out to territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as Tok Islet is concerned, it has remained part of the inviolable territory of Korea along with its ancient history as it has served the Koreans since it came under its jurisdiction. This hard fact has been also proved by the historical materials about the islet disclosed in recent years which Japan can never deny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The descendants of the Samurais have left no means untried to grab the islet, making their eyes at it from long ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are absurdly asserting that Tok Islet belongs to Japan and working hard to make the rising generation believe this. This is nothing but a ploy to hurl young Japanese into the operations to seize the islet and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their \"claim to Tok Islet\" is not aimed at simply grabbing the islet but at reinvading the whole of Korea and the rest of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they launch their operation for territorial expansion at any cost, they will only suffer destruction and disgrace, warns the commentary. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
