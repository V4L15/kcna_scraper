Needless to say, this is a direct product of the Lee group's anachronistic and traitorous conception of confrontation and wild ambition for aggression as it is going reckless to invade the north by force of arms, regarding its compatriots as the \"principal enemy\" while negating the historic north-south joint declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe history of the Korean nation's division which has lasted for more than half a century goes to prove that a conflict and a war may break out unless hostility, confrontational stand and attempt at aggression against fellow countrymen are dropped.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In reality the group of traitors is busy staging war exercises to invade the north with foreign forces in a bid to realize its pipe dream, vociferating about anyone's \"emergency.\" This is not a mere confrontational racket but an open declaration of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for the Lee group to dare to stand in military confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If someone commits provocations against the DPRK, it will not miss an opportunity but resolutely respond to confrontation with confrontation and war with war and mercilessly punish the aggressors and achieve national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation, without fail.

Assailing Japan for its despicable demeanor a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Saturday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous for Japan to claim that no progress is made due to the stance of the DPRK while vociferating about the settlement of the abduction issue whenever an opportunity presents itself. This is a mean and wicked act little short of turning white to black.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Japan is to raise the abduction issue it should frankly admit, repent of and settle the abduction of Koreans and the forcible drafting of them by the Japanese imperialists in the past as well as the abduction of citizens of the DPRK in recent years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is kicking up a racket calling for \"pressure\" and \"sanctions\" against someone, citing the abduction issue as a pretext. This is disgusting, indeed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the action taken by the Japanese reactionaries to extend the sanctions is a sinister intention. By persistently making fuss about the abduction issue Japan seeks to divert elsewhere the concern and vigilance of the international community triggered off by its moves to become a military giant and launch reinvasion. Such clumsy calculation reminding one of the country peddler is not all Japan seeks through the extended sanctions against the DPRK. It also seeks the purpose of evading the redemption of its past and justifying its human rights abuses against Koreans in Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are not a few countries in the world that committed crimes against humankind in the past but it is only Japan that adds crimes to those already committed by it and persistently resorts to sleight of hand to go without settling its past while shelving the issue of its redemption although the old century is replaced by the new one. Japan seeks to hush up the fulfillment of its commitment to redress its past through such clumsy trick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever it raises the abduction issue Japan talks about \"people's sentiment.\" But the Korean people's bitterness toward Japan is incomparably stronger than that of Japanese toward Koreans. Japan should properly understand the anti-Japanese sentiment of Koreans and their will to certainly force Japan to redeem its past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities would be well advised to drop their way of thinking and attitude as imposters, drawing a lesson from the miserable end of their predecessors who were politically ruined after being censured and condemned by the public at home and abroad for working hard to do harm to the DPRK through sanctions and pressure."

            "content": "Campana de confrontacion de Lee Myung Bak traera la guerra\r\nPyongyang, 25 de octubre (ATCC) -- A traves de un comentario individual difundido este sabado, el periodico Rodong Sinmun denuncia a la banda de Lee Myung Bak que por una parte lleva a la coyuntura catastrofica las relaciones Norte-Sur desafiando frontalmente a la corriente de la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de junio y se entrega por la otra al alboroto de provocacion militar contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t El comentario prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la aventurera campana de confrontacion militar de la banda de Lee, que se adhiere activamente a las maniobras agresivas a la RPDC de EE.UU., las relaciones Norte-Sur, que se desarrollaban positivamente despues del 15 de junio de 2000, cayeron en la crisis que dara paso en un instante a la guerra por cualquier contingencia o choque accidental.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es un producto directo de la anacronica y antinacional concepcion de confrontacion y la ambicion de agresion de la banda de Lee que actua imprudentemente para atacar militarmente a sus connacionales tomandolos por su \"enemigo principal\" y negando las historicas declaraciones conjuntas Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa historia de division nacional de mas de medio siglo demuestra que si ellos no dejan la hostilidad, la posicion de confrontacion y la ambicion agresiva a sus connacionales, seran inevitables el choque y la consiguiente guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPracticamente, los desenfrenados ejercicios belicos contra la RPDC, que hablando de la \"situacion emergente\" de alguien, libran los pandilleros de Lee con las fuerzas extranjeras para realizar su estupida ilusion, no se tratan de una simple campana de confrontacion sino abierta declaracion de guerra contra aquella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es tan ridicula la osadia de los compinches de Lee de enfrentarse militarmente con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi alguien provoca a la RPDC, esta no perdera esa oportunidad sino respondera rotundamente a la confrontacion con la confrontacion y a la guerra con la guerra para castigar implacablemente a los agresores y lograra sin falta la reunificacion de la patria que anhela tanto la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lo que ganaremos en esta guerra de vida o muerte es la reunificacion y lo que perderemos es la Linea de Demarcacion Militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no perdonara jamas las temerarias maniobras de confrontacion fratricida de la banda de Lee que busca la guerra contra el Norte."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun denuncia actitud astuta de reaccionarios japoneses\r\nPyongyang, 25 de octubre (ATCC) -- Bajo el pretexto del problema del secuestro que no tiene nada que ver con la mision y objetivo de las conversaciones a 6 bandas, Japon prolongo en ano medio sus medidas de sancion contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tEn cada ocasion que le ofrece, Japon aboga por el problema del secuestro diciendo que el estancamiento de los problemas pendientes se debe a la RPDC, lo cual es un acto absurdo y sucio tendente a convertir lo negro en lo blanco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Critica asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este sabado y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon quiere cuestionar el problema del secuestro, antes que nada, tiene que reconocer y solucionar con sinceridad sus crimenes de secuestro y arresto forzoso a los coreanos, cometidos en el pasado por los imperialistas nipones, y otros actos de secuestro a los ciudadanos de la RPDC perpetrados en los ultimos anos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy repugnante el proceder de Japon que habla de \"presion\" y \"sancion\" sobre alguien bajo el pretexto del problema del secuestro. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el trasero de tal maniobra esta ocultada la siniestra intencion de los reaccionarios japoneses. Ellos tratan de desviar, bajo el rotulo del problema del secuestro, la preocupacion y alerta de la sociedad internacional sobre la conversion de su pais en la potencia militar y sus maniobras de nueva agresion. Por otra parte, intentan evadir la liquidacion del pasado criminal y justificar sus violaciones de DDHH contra los coreanos residentes en su pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mundo no son pocos los paises que cometieron crimenes ante la humanidad. Pero, no hay tal pais como Japon que no liquida de siglo en siglo sus crimenes del pasado sobreponiendo otros nuevos sino se desespera por evadir la indemnizacion por el respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que recurre al problema del secuestro, Japon habla del \"sentimiento de la poblacion\", pero es mucho mas vehemente la hostilidad antijaponesa del pueblo coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japon debe saber bien el sentimiento antijapones y la voluntad del pueblo coreano de demandar la liquidacion del pasado criminal del pais isleno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las autoridades japonesas deben sacar lecciones del destino tragico de sus antecesores, que al cabo de actuar perversamente por derrocar el regimen coreano con la sancion y presion se fracasaron en lo politico sin cumplir sus mandatos al chocar con las protestas y criticas del interior y exterior del pais, y abandonar su actitud y modo de pensar de fraudulentos."
