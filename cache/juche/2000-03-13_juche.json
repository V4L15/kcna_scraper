Called as Hoeryong chestnut and listed as a national living monument, it grows in the cold latitudes far beyond its normal zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dating from 1920, it is 8.8m tall, 35cm across at the base of the trunk and 9.2m across the tree-top. The branches are gray and the boughs grayish brown, and the twinges are shorter and thinner than average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The first frost comes around September 29 and the last around April 30. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The buds sprout between May 25 and June 5 and the blossoms come out between June 10  and  22. The fruit ripens in late September through early October and the tree sheds leaves in late October. The cluster of chestnut is round-shaped and average-sized, and a fruit weighs some 10 grammers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Because of its location on the  northern off-limits of chestnut distribution, the tree is of academic interest in studying the occurrence of plants in relation to the ecosystem. \r\n\r\n"

In this regard Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was confirmed that he had been engaged in espionage aimed to gather information related to secrets of the party, state and military in the DPRK, relations between the DPRK and U.S., between the DPRK and Japan and other matters related to the DPRK's foreign policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though three months have passed since the disclosure of the case, the Japanese government has neither admitted nor apologized for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sugishima fully confessed and admitted that he committed espionage by use of a portable tape recorder and camera and other devices for his spying activities, the commentary notes, and goes on: this is only part of the undeniable convincing material and legal evidence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The results of the investigation clearly proves that his espionage was conducted under a carefully worked out plan of the relevant organ of Japan and the South Korean authorities and obviously what he did was anti-DPRK espionage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He deserves punishment under the relevant law of the DPRK as his espionage against the DPRK has been confirmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities' adamant insistence that his espionage has nothing to do with the government makes the case more complicated and will turn the situation more unfavorable to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is well advised to behave itself so that its regret may not come too late. \r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows what a dangerous phase they have reached in their moves to divert the trend for opening the diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan and to fan up revanchism and hysteric zeal for aggression in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese militarists occupied Korea by force of arms and enforced an unprecedentedly harsh colonial rule over it, inflicting unspeakable misfortune, pain, disaster and loss upon the Korean people for more than 40 years. Yet, the Japanese reactionaries are now watching for a chance of reinvasion instead of making a sincere apology and compensation for their past crimes. They should clearly know that the grudge and hatred of our people's army and people for militarist Japan have reached their zenith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ultra-nationalist reactionary forces like Ishihara are well advised to behave with discretion, mindful that if they run amuck like a puppy who knows no fear of the tiger, it will only hasten their miserable self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The committee seriously warns the Japanese reactionaries that if they ignite a war of aggression against the DPRK, the Korean people will never miss the chance to give vent to the century-old wrath of the nation against the Japanese on behalf of the whole nation. \r\n\r\n"
