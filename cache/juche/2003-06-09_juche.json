This clearly revealed the fact that the U.S., paying lip-service to \"dialogue\" and \"peaceful solution,\" is, in fact, opting for a military threat and pressure, the statement noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Branding the U.S. ceaseless arms buildup and military threat to the north as a grave provocation, the statement demanded an immediate halt to its reckless \"arms buildup\".    \r\n"

            "content": "U.S. and Japanese military nexus slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Bush and the Japanese chief executive at the press conference held at the end of the talks in Crawford of the U.S. asserted that they have reached a complete consensus of views on the threat resulting from the nuclear program of North Korea. They blustered they would never bow to any \"threat and blackmail of North Korea\" and if it deteriorates the nuclear crisis, they would take stronger measures.\r\n This comes under fire by papers here today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun in an article says that it is not the DPRK but the U.S. that is entirely to blame for the nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive U.S. regimes have posed nuclear blackmail and threat to the DPRK. The nuclear issue surfaced on the Korean Peninsula as the U.S. massively shipped nuclear weapons into South Korea and posed a nuclear threat to the DPRK after the war, enforcing a hostile policy towards it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are threatening and blackmailing the DPRK, talking about a \"preemptive attack on North Korea\" and a \"war against it\", taking advantage of the pressure put by the U.S. upon the DPRK over its nuclear issue. The remarks of Bush and the Japanese chief executive that they would take stronger measures to cope with any deterioration of the crisis are little short of declaring to the world that they would mount a military attack on the DPRK at any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Closely following the talks held between bush and the Japanese chief executive, we clearly realized how keen the U.S. and Japan are to realize their ambition to stifle the DPRK and once again renewed our determination to decisively foil it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will further increase the physical deterrent force powerful enough to react against any military option of enemies so as to defend our dignity, sovereignty and peace on this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a signed commentary says that the U.S. and Japan are well advised to discontinue their groundless smear campaign against someone and immediately stop working foolishly to realize their ambition for world hegemony and reinvasion, bearing in mind that they can never escape from the world's watchful eyes.    \r\n\r\n"

This is, in essence, aimed at justifying the blockade against independent countries such as the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already intensified the surveillance and control of goods shipment to and from the DPRK as never before on the strength of \"agreement on tanker safety\" by putting pressure on the countries where ships of the DPRK frequent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the U.S. blockade operation to project the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. as a global issue in a bid to build an \"international siege network\" has already entered a phase of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is dead set against the bilateral talks with the DPRK, persistently insisting on the multilateral talks. The U.S. ulterior intention is, in the final analysis, to get a pretext and time to intensify the international pressure and blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can lead the DPRK to collapse through international pressure and blockade. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK wants a peaceful negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula to avert a war and preserve peace in this land. But there is a limit to its sincere efforts and magnanimity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In case it judges that the sovereignty has been violated, the DPRK will take an immediate physical retaliatory measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has built up the independent national economy and strong national defence capability, pursuant to the Songun policy. Therefore, neither sanctions nor pressure can work on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The blockade against the DPRK will only bar the issue from being settled and aggravate the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely watch the U.S. moves for blockade.    \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA denounces U.S. arms buildup plan\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 7 (KCNA) -- On May 31 the U.S. forces command in South Korea released the so-called arms buildup plan of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces which calls for spending 11 billion U.S. dollars in three years to come.\r\n According to it, part of the rapid deployment brigade equipped with high performance light armored cars, electronic commanding system and other ultra modern weapons are expected to be transferred to South Korea from the U.S. mainland this summer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that the arms buildup plan includes more than 100 proposals calling for the deployment of unmanned aircraft designed to carry out spy and attack missions, and the latest type patriot missiles, the introduction of high precision guided bombs and the deployment of the latest type apache helicopters, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far systematically beefed up its aggression troops since their occupation of South Korea and is hell-bent on arms buildup for mass killings, which requires a huge amount of money. This is an unpardonable development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms buildup plan was announced by the U.S. at a time when it is calling for a military attack on the DPRK over its nuclear issue. This proves that \"further steps\" clarified in the \"joint statement\" South Korea made public with the U.S. recently have entered the phase of full implementation and the U.S. nuclear war against the DPRK is not just an option on the table but is becoming a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is arousing our indignation is the fact that the U.S. military bosses are openly disclosing their attempt at attacking the north by claiming that their arms buildup plan is to break through somebody's front in case of emergency on the Korean Peninsula and advance straight toward Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation goes to clearly prove that it was quite right for the DPRK to have declared in the message to all the Koreans its stand that its self-defensive war deterrent force provides a sure guarantee for peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KCNA vehemently denounces the U.S. dangerous arms buildup plan on behalf of all Koreans who value the dignity of the country and the peace of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Voices calling for the pullout of the U.S. forces are now ringing louder in South Korea in the run-up to the first anniversary of the murder of schoolgirls by a U.S. armored car. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the U.S. is massively beefing up its aggression forces there, which is an outright challenge to the desire and demand of our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has kept South Korea under its military rule for nearly 60 years, repressing its inhabitants at the point of bayonet and indiscriminately killing them. And it is now hell-bent on arms buildup, the largest-ever in the postwar period. Such moves are a prelude to the U.S. moves to dampen the South Korean people's desire for independence against the U.S. and war and ignite a war that may bring immeasurable disasters to the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that such reinforcements would make the bellicose GIs more brutal in killing and bring greater economic damage and disaster to South Korea and pose a more serious threat to peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that what the U.S. really seeks has become clear, the DPRK has the legitimate right to counter such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be seriously mistaken if it thinks its way of invading and controlling other nations as it pleases will work on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's physical deterrent force, an iron shield for the country and the nation, will serve as a merciless sledge-hammer to any aggressors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our army and people will answer the U.S. arms buildup with a corresponding powerful deterrent force and its preemptive attack with a prompt retaliation to destroy it at the initial stage of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should clearly know that the South Korean people holding high the torch of anti-U.S. struggle are no longer a powerless people in the past, who had meekly obeyed the U.S. military rule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life in South Korea should decisively reject the dangerous arms buildup of the U.S. imperialists intended to turn South Korea into the largest arsenal for a nuclear war and bring a nuclear disaster to the whole Korean nation. And they should wage a more vigorous struggle to force the U.S. forces, source of aggression and war, to withdraw from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KCNA expresses belief that the world people and solidarity organizations and international organizations desirous of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula will more dynamically conduct the international anti-war, anti-U.S. struggle to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves for a nuclear war on the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
