Korean Warships into DPEK Waters Demanded\r\n Pyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- The Navy Command of the Korean People's Army released the following report Wednesday in connection with the south Korean military warmongers' unceasing serious military provocations in the waters on the extension of the frontline in the West Sea of Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\t On Oct. 12 alone the warmongers infiltrated 16 warships into the territorial waters of the north side south of Kuwol Peak in Ssanggyo-ri, Kangryong County, South Hwanghae Province on 10 occasions, asserting that fishing boats of the north side \"intruded\" into their waters despite the fact that they were engaged in routine fishing operations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless military provocations by warships of the south Korean navy have created such a serious situation that naval clash may break out between the two sides in these waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such military provocations have escalated since mid-September, bringing the daily average of such cases to 3-4 in October.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side informed the south side over international ultra shortwave walkie-talkie of the fact that the fishing boats of the north side were engaged in routine fishing operations in its territorial waters for the purpose of settling the dangerous situation and ensuring security in the waters and strongly demanded the south side withdraw warships of its navy without delay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warships of the south Korean navy, however, threatened to take \"tough countermeasures\" unless the fishing boats sail northward, an act reminding one of a chief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the situation lies in that they are seeking an ulterior intention to defend the illegal \"northern limit line\" under the pretext of \"checking fishing boats.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA Navy will neither allow the south Korean military authorities' any slightest attempt to keep the bogus line of no legal validity as an extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the sea nor remain an on-looker to their attitude.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean military authorities' intrusion of warships into the territorial waters of the north side is part of their premeditated moves to deliberately escalate tension in the waters, a hotbed of conflict, and deteriorate the north-south relations once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear to everyone what consequences the third skirmish in the West Sea of Korea will entail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warmongers of the south Korean military should stop their rash acts and put an immediate halt to the intrusion of their warships into the territorial waters of the north side.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that warnings are bound to be followed by actions."
