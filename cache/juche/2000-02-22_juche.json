            "content": "Korean people's faith and will have grown stronger this winter \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- This winter has been a severe test for the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was not attributable to cold weather only, though the period from December to February belongs to the dead of winter in Korea. This hard winter witnessed the most serious shortage of electricity in the history of the DPRK that adversely affected all fields of the national economy and the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Despite all those difficulties, the Korean people have firmly defended socialism, their life and soul, and further hardened their faith and will to win its victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The annals of the arduous Korean revolution is recorded with the tradition in which a breakthrough was made towards victory in rigorous winter on which the destiny of the Korean revolution hinged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This tradition was established by President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the great leaders of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was in January 75 years ago when Kim Il Sung set out on a \"250-mile journey for national liberation\" with a noble aim to win it. And he carried out the arduous march to overcome the difficulties before the Korean revolution in the winter from Juche 27 to 28 (1938-1939) in the period of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He turned the adversity during the temporary strategic retreat of the Korean People's Army in the days of the Fatherland Liberation War into favourable conditions in the blizzards of winter of Juche 39 (1950), thus bringing in a final victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In December of Juche 45 (1956), when the political situation inside and outside the country was difficult, he called on the workers of the Kangson Steel Works to rouse them to the  grand Chollima advance, believing in their strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the firm will of Kim Jong Il to weather out manifold difficulties and ordeals, no matter how hard they may be to overcome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was in January three years ago when the area of Pyongyang was hit by the severest snowstorm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time he said he regarded that as the \"snowstorm of Mangyongdae\" which instilled the faith in sure victory into all of us and heralded a signal victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was again in winter when he visited Jagang Province to break through manifold difficulties and effect a fresh turn in the revolutionary development in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He gave on-site guidance to the land leveling and rezoning and economic fields in North Phyongan Province at the end of last January, the dead of winter, thus lighting a torch to be held aloft by the workers of the Rakwon Machine Factory. This torch is giving a strong impetus to the second grand Chollima advance like the Kanggye spirit and the torch lit at the Songjin Steel Complex. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people have a lot of work to do this year and the economic situation still remains difficult. But they are accelerating the building of a powerful nation with the faith and will which the great leaders instilled. \r\n\r\n"
