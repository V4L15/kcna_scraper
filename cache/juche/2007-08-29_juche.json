Millions of the young people, their hearts burning with the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, united close around the Party and the leader whenever the Korean revolution faced rigorous trials including the building of a new country, the Fatherland Liberation War and the postwar rehabilitation and reconstruction. The Korean youth have shared destiny with the President and Kim Jong Il to the last. This transparent faith and will remained unshaken in the least even when socialism collapsed in several countries of the world and the imperialists got more undisguised in their moves against the DPRK. The Korean youth put up the slogan which calls for becoming 5 million human bullets and bombs devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution in the difficult &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n period of the \"Arduous March.\" It was a clear manifestation of the single-minded unity of the Korean youth which formed a harmonious whole with the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's Songun revolutionary cause will always triumph as long as there are the proud history and tradition of devotedly defending the leader and a large contingent of the young vanguard, a reliable successor to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean youth will hold higher the banner of the anti-imperialist struggle as the revolution advances with the passage of time. They will remain unchanged in the future, too, in the steadfast spirit of anti-imperialist struggle which has been fully displayed since the start of anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The enthusiasm and spirit of the youth precisely mean the dynamism of the socialist construction and the surging spirit of the country. The DPRK's cause of building a great prosperous powerful nation is sure to be accomplished before long as it has such youth, powerful ranks for creation and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The country and the revolution have a rosy future and Korea-style socialism is sure to always triumph as the DPRK boasts such large unit of the young vanguard sound in thinking and morality, strong in faith and full of militant spirit and enthusiasm.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such behavior of the U.S. proves that it is not interested in the progress of dialogue and the settlement of any issue but only seeks to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This approach of the U.S. going against dialogue compels the DPRK to urgently take practical countermeasures. In this case the U.S. would be entirely to blame for the ensuing grave consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to be aware of the gravity of the situation and behave itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Ulji Focus Lens\" Joint Military Exercises under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 28 (KCNA) -- The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises now under way in south Korea are war maneuvers against peace in view of their nature, contents and purpose as they are designed to implement the U.S. military policy aimed to put the whole of Korea under its control and make a breakthrough towards carrying out its Asia strategy with Korea as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK that the two sides have been technically at war on the Korean Peninsula for more than five decades, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. continues rushing headlong into a war, staging military exercises against the DPRK, this will entail unpredictably catastrophic consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-party talks without the U.S. drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK would be meaningless. This is not worth even a passing note. The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can reap any fruit at the six-party talks without giving up its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The grave military threat posed by the U.S. to the DPRK by staging large-scale war drills in south Korea would only put the six-party talks at peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop its poor farce aimed at playing down or covering up the criminal nature of the DPRK-targeted war maneuvers with a veil of \"peace\". No sleight of hand seeking a sinister purpose can ever work on the DPRK which loves justice. The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" compels the DPRK to suspect the ulterior aim sought by the U.S. in its loudmouthed \"negotiated settlement of issues\" and \"confidence-building\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Talking only will not help build confidence. Only when the U.S. gives up its hostile policy toward the DPRK, its dialogue partner, is it possible to wipe out distrust and antagonism between the DPRK and the U.S. and build confidence. Now that the U.S. keeps pursuing its hostile policy toward its dialogue partner, frantically staging war drills against it, the DPRK is left with no option but to take strong countermeasures, different from the stand for dialogue it has maintained so far. This is a legitimate exercise of its sovereign right. It is the DPRK's mode of counteraction to be ready both for dialogue and confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
