He blustered he was of the view that the north was not capable of starting an all-out war, but it is poised to ignite a local war any time and so it is necessary to retaliate against it by all means by targeting bases of provocation and supporting and commanding forces when the north provokes. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His remarks are a clear proof of the reckless scenario of the south Korean puppet regime to get on the nerves of the DPRK and deliberately escalate the tension between the north and the south in a bid to ignite a war against the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military muscle of the DPRK including nuclear deterrent is so tremendous that the south Korean authorities can neither predict nor estimate as they are mere colonial puppets of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the ambiguous judgment made by the U.S. ruling quarters of the nuclear capability of the DPRK. It is quite natural for the puppet regime to be badly informed of the north as it depends on information provided by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that the reckless actions taken by such ignorant persons may push the situation into the outbreak of a nuclear war any time. The war drumbeat made by   Kim Jang Su is an open declaration that south Korea would ignite a nuclear war against the north through its practical action, not threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK would like to warn Kim once again that he had better stop gambling over the fate of the south Koreans. He should not forget that his reckless tongue lashing may bring a horrible disaster to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities had better bear in mind that the military actions of the DPRK are neither bluff nor threat but practical ones and what remains is to mercilessly punish the provocateurs."

Korean Regime's Hideous Provocation against North\r\n Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet forces committed such thrice-cursed crime as letting ultra-right conservative gangsters meet in downtown Seoul in broad daylight on the Day of the Sun to defame the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a bylined article terms this crime unpardonable hideous provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those gangsters are elders more dead than alive who live on a petty amount of money given by the puppet regime in return for their evil acts perpetrated against the north. Such worst hooliganism would be unthinkable without the patronage and connivance of the puppet authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present authorities are going reckless, far from drawing a lesson from the miserable end of their predecessors. The recent hooliganism self-exposed that they are just the same as the Lee Myung Bak group in their confrontation stance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a reaction to the ultimatum issued by the north to mercilessly punish those who hurt the supreme dignity of the nation, they let loose such sophism that \"it is hard to understand the action and what happened was an expression of freedom\". This was nothing but ridiculous rhetoric to justify their hideous crime. Great irony is that they are pointing an accusing finger at the DPRK, crying out for \"an end to threat\". This behavior is lashing the service personnel and people of the DPRK into great fury as it reminds one of a guilty party filing the suit first.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Resolute is the DPRK's stand toward the above-said crime. Under present situation where the inter-Korean relations have been driven into the state of a war, it is a legitimate exercise of the inviolable right for the DPRK to react to the hostile forces' provocation through a practical retaliatory action, not by talking."
