This is an arbitrary blackmail, declaration of a war and a nuclear war against the DPRK. Thus, the U.S. has unilaterally broken the nuclear agreement with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violation of the AF and its arrogant practices are leading the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the dangerous brink of armed conflict between them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the brigandish logic the U.S. can neither shun its responsibility as a violator and breaker of the AF nor justify its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to give up its unreasonable logic and sincerely accede to the DPRK's constructive proposal for a non-aggression treaty.    \r\n\r\n"
