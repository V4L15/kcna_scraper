The Korean nation has been known to be a nation strong in patriotism and the spirit of independence since the olden times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans' strong spirit of national self-esteem has served as one of the important factors that enabled them to firmly preserve their national character in any severe test of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now under way on the Korean Peninsula is a decisive final struggle between the fellow countrymen in the north and the south who work hard to defend the security and peace of the country and achieve national reunification by their concerted efforts and the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad who challenge their efforts. This precisely means the confrontation between the Koreans equipped with the spirit of self-esteem and the foreign forces keen to quell it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. evermore reckless efforts to dampen the Koreans' desire for reunification only reinforce their spirit of self-esteem to successfully carve out the future of the country and the nation by themselves, regarding national independence as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans' high pride and honor of holding leader Kim Jong Il, peerless great man, in high esteem as the sun of the nation and the resulting strong spirit of national self-esteem serve as an inexhaustible source of ardent patriotic zeal and fighting spirit to achieve reunification, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the Japanese government has never exercised its right to inspect U.S. warships entering Japanese ports whether they carry nuclear weapons or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the tacit connivance of the Japanese government and under its patronage U.S. warships and planes carrying nukes frequent Japan with a \"prior consultation\" as a subterfuge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hypocrisy of these \"principles\" also finds its expression in the fact that Japan worked out a plan for nuclear weaponization and has since pushed it forward as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ambition to go nuclear is clearly proved by the fact that the Japanese Foreign Ministry worked out a confidential document calling for acquiring the \"capability to manufacture nuclear weapons\" as early as in 1969. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had more than 50 nuclear power plants as of the end of 1998 churning out nuclear waste enough to produce a lot of plutonium every year. Not content with this, Japan has purchased a huge amount of plutonium from Britain and France for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's technology of manufacturing nukes and developing delivery means have reached the world's top level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are keen to make an effective use of nukes for realizing their wild ambition for overseas expansion, thinking that Japan suffered a defeat after invading other Asian countries because it was weak and had no nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to stop flouting the international community with those hypocritical \"principles.\"     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Foreign interference and obstructions are, therefore, a stumbling block lying in the way of accomplishing the cause of independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a by-lined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States keeps its aggression troops in south Korea even now when the June 15 era of reunification has been opened up, threatening peace on the Korean Peninsula and security of the nation and persistently hamstringing the efforts to achieve the cause of Korean reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. split the Korean nation into two parts by occupying south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the Japanese imperialists to meet its aggressive interests in the mid-twentieth century. The U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea was a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the Korean nation. It is bringing untold misfortune and pain to the Koreans even in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. interference and obstructive moves against the cause of the reunification of Korea are grave provocations as they infringe upon the sovereign rights of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of reunification of Korea is a matter to be settled by its people themselves as it is related to the sovereignty of the nation. It is, therefore, a matter pertaining to the nation's right to self-determination from A to Z because it does not allow any foreign forces to meddle in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has openly stood in the way of implementing the June 15 joint declaration, displeased with it, though it reflects the strong will of the Korean nation to independently carve out its destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. interference and obstructive moves against national reunification amount to deliberate moves for aggression as they are aimed at dividing and alienating Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. cunning separatist methods no longer work on the Korean nation. Precisely for this reason, the U.S. is driving the anti-reunification forces in south Korea to confrontation with fellow countrymen and a war against the north, while talking about \"dialogue\" and \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To depend on foreign forces instead of working hard to independently settle the issue of the country's reunification, the internal issue of the nation, in actuality, means opposing national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was in this course that miracles and innovations startling the world were wrought in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il represents the destiny of the country, the people and socialism in the DPRK and a symbol of all victories, the article notes, adding that his Songun politics serves as an all-powerful treasured sword and a banner of sure victory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
