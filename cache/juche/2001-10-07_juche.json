            "content": "Japan's \"three non-nuclear principles\" termed deceptive\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- Japan has laid a foundation to become a \"nuclear power\" under the signboard of \"three non-nuclear principles,\" says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article.\r\n The \"three non-nuclear principles,\" which former Japanese prime minister Sato set out in 1967 as a government policy, is, in fact, aimed to calm down the anti-nuclear sentiment of the Japanese people and cover up its moves to turn the country into a nuclear base and speed up its nuclear weaponization, the article notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the adverse consequences of Japan's misuse of the \"three non-nuclear principles,\" the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this signboard Japan has been legally converted into a U.S. nuclear base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. warships and planes carrying nuclear weapons frequent Japan without any restrictions at the tacit connivance of the Japanese government and under its patronage. And even when U.S. nuclear submarines enter Japanese ports without any prior notice, far from getting any inspection or permission, the Japanese government does not say a word in protest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is accelerating the nuclear weaponization after paving the way for it under the signboard of the principles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government mapped up a plan for nuclear weaponization and is pushing forward it as a state policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It plans to stockpile 100 tons of plutonium by 2010. This is enough to produce nuclear warheads more than what the U.S. and Russia possess today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan ranks itself among the world's most advanced countries in terms of technologies of making nuclear weapons and developing their carriers. It is unanimous comment of experts that Japan can become a nuclear power anytime, if it has a will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries aim to use nuclear weapons as a lever to achieve their ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Precisely for this reason Japan desperately takes the lead in opposing any resolution on prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons whenever it is discussed at the U.N. and other international organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are working hard to impose the same disaster as Hiroshima suffered upon the people of other countries, escalating the moves to become a nuclear power under the signboard of the deceptive \"three non-nuclear principles\" in a bid to realize their ambition for overseas expansion. But this will only bring even more horrible disaster to its whole territory.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
