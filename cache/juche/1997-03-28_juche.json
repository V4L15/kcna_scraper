Kim Young Sam at the time of his \"Candidate for President\" activated Kim Hyon Chol's private organizations to cook up the press for his \"election\". After taking power he fattened his son's private organizations so that his son might play \"a little President\".   \r\n   It is not surprising that the south Korean puppet Ministry of Information and its \"Minister\" have become a servant of the press counter-measure team and turned into a manipulator of the press.    \r\n   This practically proves that an official \"governmental organ\" of the \"civilian regime\" is a private one related to the fate of Kim Young Sam. \r\n\r\n"

Their utterances are a reversed logic. The U.S. troops present in Okinawa play a pivotal role in the execution of the U.S. policy towards the DPRK. They are a source of the escalating tensions and the increasing danger of war on the Korean Peninsula.\r\n   Immediate response to the \"contingency\" on the lips of the south Korean puppets means the entry of the U.S. troops present in Okinawa into a new Korean war.\r\n   The south Korean puppets prattled that the presence of 100,000 U.S. troops in east Asia is an \"international promise\". Who made the promise with whom?\r\n   The East Asia-based 100,000 U.S. troops are to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and, furthermore, dominate the whole Asia.\r\n   Minju Joson in a signed commentary warns that if the south Korean puppets unleash a new war against the northern half of Korea, taking advantage of the aggressive policy of outside forces, we will deliver decisive counterblows to them. \r\n\r\n"

Its evidence is the remains of ape-men found in caves at Huguri, Sangwon county. The remains are more than a million years old. Lots of remains of paleolithic and neolithic men and their dwelling sites have been discovered around the city.\r\n   King Tangun was born in Pyongyang, chose this ancient and beautiful city as the capital and worked heart and soul to build the nation.\r\n   Since then, Pyongyang was the capital of three dynasties of ancient Korea for nearly 3,000 years (third millenium B.C.-108 B.C.). After the collapse of ancient Korea, it remained a centre of politics, the economy and culture in northwest Korea as the capital of Raknangguk built by descendants of ancient Korea.\r\n   Its historic position and role were succeeded by the Koguryo dynasty, which lasted a thousand years as a strong nation.\r\n   Koguryo moved its capital to Pyongyang in 427, because it was the cradle of the Korean nation with a long history and culture.\r\n   The Koryo dynasty, the first unified state of Korea, attached importance to Pyongyang and rehabilitated it after Wang Kon founded Koryo in 918 with an ambition to restore Koguryo. This was mainly because Pyongyang was the cradle of the nation and the capital of King Tangun's Korea.\r\n   During the Ri dynasty, the city played an important role in the development of national history, remaining the largest centre in northwest Korea.\r\n   Preserved in Pyongyang are King Tangun's mausoleum and the mausoleum of King Tongmyong, the founder of the Koguryo dynasty, which have been reconstructed, as well as the fort on mt. Taesong, the walled city of Pyongyang and many other relics as witnesses of Korea's history of five thousand years.\r\n   Pyongyang today is the capital of Juche Korea and a holy land full of national identity. \r\n\r\n"
