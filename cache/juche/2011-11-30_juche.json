They also showed that not a single enemy can survive the unpredictable counterattack of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK which are carrying forward the shining traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the high-level exercises to which the Juche-oriented war tactics are applied, Kim Jong Il expressed great satisfaction with the fact that soldiers have been fully prepared to timely foil any surprise invasion by enemies and defend the socialist homeland as firm as a rock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly estimated their successful exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He repeatedly expressed satisfaction with the fact that the commanding officers of the large combined unit are rounding off their combat preparations with high innovative insight to handle manifold situations while keeping themselves abreast of modern military science and technologies and modes of combat actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the soldiers for stirring up the hot wind for intensive exercises, saying they are acquiring combat rules applicable to an actual war by conducting effective exercises away from formalism with the revolutionary determination and enthusiasm to unconditionally attain the remarkably high goal of the exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army is under obligation to defend the destiny of the country and the nation with arms, he said, calling for intensifying combat exercises and perfecting combat preparations, cherishing that nothing is more important than combat preparations for the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The socialist homeland is impregnable as dependable soldiers as those of the large combined unit stand guard over it, ready to creditably carry out any combat order given by the party and the country at a moment's notice, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is essential to continue channeling big efforts into strengthening the KPA in order to accomplish generation after generation the revolutionary cause of Juche, the Songun revolutionary cause that was started in the thick forests of Mt. Paektu, he said. He urged soldiers to put spurs to increasing the military capabilities which represent the sovereignty of the country and the nation and state power, and thus increase the combat capabilities in every way so that a soldier can match a hundred enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then went round a company under KPA Unit 169 honored with the title of the O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round a bedroom, education room, mess hall and other places, he learned about the military service of the soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Very pleased with the excellent conditions for military service provided to the soldiers by the unit, he called on the commanding officers to consider it as their noble moral obligation to take care of soldiers' life so that they can glorify their military service with feats without feeling any inconvenience.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo taken with soldiers of the large combined unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Holding hands of the commanding officers he asked them to do exercises well, saying that training is most important. He acknowledged enthusiastically cheering soldiers, wishing them success in the combat and political exercises for the new year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Vice-Chairman of the WPK Central Military Commission Kim Jong Un and the staff members of the KPA Supreme Command."

            "content": "Experimental LWR Construction: FM Spokesman\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, November 30 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK released the following statement Wednesday on the DPRK's just nuclear activities for peaceful purposes:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peaceful use of nuclear energy is the legitimate right of a sovereign state recognized by international law. It also serves as the only way for solving the acute electricity problem in the DPRK as it has vast nuclear energy resources. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK made up its mind to build its own light water reactor according to its economic development strategy given that there was no prospect for getting LWRs whose delivery was promised from outside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of experimental LWR and the low enriched uranium for the provision of raw materials are progressing apace in reliance on solid foundation of the self-supporting national economy and the country's latest science and technologies making leaping progress.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK announced at home and abroad the every phase of its nuclear activities for peaceful purposes geared to the production of electricity because it had nothing to afraid of nor hide. It also clarified its flexible stand that any concerns that may arise may be discussed at the six-party talks and it can convince the world of the peaceful nature of those activities through the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies, however, groundlessly took issue with the DPRK's just nuclear activities for peaceful purposes, deliberately laying a stumbling block in the way of settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They slandered the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities while spreading the false stories of \"suspicious enrichment in the past\" and \"nuclear spread\". They are even making far-fetched assertions that those activities are a \"violation\" of the September 19 joint statement and a \"stumbling block\" in the way of realizing denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The guarantee of the DPRK's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy had been recognized as the prerequisite preconditions for denuclearization from the outset of the negotiations for settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. That's why the U.S. committed to providing LWRs to the DPRK in the first article of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. It was also for the same reason that the respect for the DPRK's right to the peaceful use of the nuclear energy and the provision of LWRs were stipulated in the first article of the September 19 joint statement adopted in the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Countries outside the NPT are conducting nuclear activities for peaceful purposes. This is a stark reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the hostile forces are charging that the DPRK's independent construction of LWR and the uranium enrichment are contrary to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. This is aimed to render illegitimate the DPRK's right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy and deter it from exercising the right.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The right to the peaceful use of nuclear energy is an issue vital for the sovereignty and development of the DPRK and, therefore, neither concession nor compromise should be allowed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present international situation proves that the unwarranted acts of taking issue with the legitimate right of sovereign states as well as tolerating their violation while reading other's face would entail catastrophic consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The process for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is undergoing turns and twists. This is attributable to the U.S. which is preoccupied with encroaching upon the DPRK's sovereignty and deterring the DPRK from making peaceful development while defaulting on its commitments and duties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The September 19 joint statement stipulates the U.S. commitments to fundamentally ending the nuclear threat and hostile relations and building lasting peace mechanism on the whole Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prospect for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula can open only when all the countries concerned honor their commitments in the joint statement on the principle of simultaneous actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is ready to resume the six-party talks without preconditions and implement the joint statement in a phased manner on the principle of simultaneous actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pressing unilateral demand on others while not doing what they should do can never be tolerated and the attempt to render the DPRK's peaceful nuclear activities illegal or delay them for an indefinite period will prompt resolute and decisive countermeasures."

It may spark off a new arms race in the long run, it deplored. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the negotiations with the U.S. over establishment of the MD in Europe break down, Russia is set to review the possibility of deploying missile complex \"Iskander\" not only within its territory but in Belarus. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Russian military expert said intercontinental ballistic missile complexes in his country will be equipped with hardware capable of intercepting any missile defense system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world public concerns have grown that the U.S.'s reckless MD moves are sparking off another Cold War and a new arms race on the earth."

Es por eso que EE.UU. comprometio en el primer articulo del Acuerdo Basico RPDC-EE.UU. a ofrecernos reactores de agua ligera. Tambien en el primer articulo de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre estan anotados el problema de respetar el derecho al uso de energia nuclear con fines pacificos de la RPDC y el de ofrecimiento de reactor de agua ligera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad hasta los paises al margen del Tratado de No Proliferacion (TNP) realizan las actividades nucleares con fines pacificos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, las fuerzas hostiles pretenden impugnar la construccion independiente de reactor de agua ligera y las actividades de enriquecimiento de uranio de nuestro pais como las actividades que contravienen a la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana bajo la malsana intencion de invalidar y exterminar nuestro derecho al uso de energia nuclear con fines pacificos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que esto es un asunto vital relacionado con la soberania y el desarrollo de nuestro pais, no podemos conceder ni un paso atras en ese tema ni cambiarlo con nada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual situacion internacional muestra claramente que acarrearian una consecuencia tragica la tolerancia y la obediencia a las malsanas intenciones tendentes a cuestionar injustamente los derechos legitimos de Estado soberano y violarlos poco a poco. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl proceso de desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana sufre dificultades, porque EE.UU. se entrega a violar la soberania de la RPDC e impedirle el desarrollo pacifico, sin cumplir su compromiso y deber. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre estipula claramente el deber de EE.UU. de acabar fundamentalmente con la amenaza nuclear en toda la Peninsula Coreana, liquidar las relaciones hostiles y establecer el sistema de paz duradera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo cuando todos los paises interesados cumplan con toda sinceridad segun el principio de accion simultanea sus deberes comprometidos en la declaracion mencionada, se abrira la perspectiva de la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstamos listos a reanudar incondicionalmente las conversaciones a 6 bandas y ejecutar por cada etapa la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre segun el principio de accion simultanea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, no puede ser permitido imponer a otra parte su demanda unilateral incumpliendo el deber asumido a si mismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las intenciones de ilegalizar nuestras actividades nucleares con fines pacificos o prolongarlas indefinidamente nos haran tomar las contramedidas rotundas y decisivas."

            "content": "Minju Joson denuncia la produccion de bomba de nuevo tipo de EE.UU.\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 30 de noviembre (ACNC) -- Hace poco, Estados Unidos realizo la prueba de bomba aerea supersonica capaz de bombardear dentro de una hora cualquier lugar del mundo. Coincidiendo con esto, comenzo a ubicar en las unidades aereas las bombas \"Bunker Buster\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl periodico Minju Joson, en un comentario individual difundido este miercoles, senala que estas bombas desarrolladas o distribuidas por EE.UU. son para destruir los objetos militares de los Estados independientes antiimperialistas como la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea e Iran, y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl intento de EE.UU. es tomar la hegemonia militar en la region del Nordeste Asiatico aplastando en lo militar Corea y ofrecer una favorable condicion a la realizacion de ambicion de la hegemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara este fin, el imperio intenta llevar a cabo su estrategia de ataque preventivo a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a los imprudentes alborotos militares de EE.UU. de aplastarla con el ataque preventivo, la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana se torna cada dia mas grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que EE.UU. amenaza gravemente la RPDC, esta se ve obligada a tomar las contramedidas autodefensivas en el nivel merecido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechando esta ocasion, la RPDC advierte fehacientemente a EE.UU. que no surten efecto la presion y la amenaza militares contra esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC no teme la bomba de nuevo tipo y otros. La victoria o la derrota en el enfrentamiento no dependen de los equipos belicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se atreve a quebrantar con las armas de nuevo tipo la unidad monolitica, lo cual no pasa de ser una accion ridicula de quienes estan enriquecidos por la \"teoria de omnipotencia de armas\"."
