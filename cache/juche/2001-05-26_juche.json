            "content": "U.S. preparations for another Korean war assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. bellicose forces are scheming to create brigades as a task force to be hurled into the Korean front. \r\n Assailing this, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States will reportedly organize two combat brigades by next year to be promptly hurled into the Korean front in case of \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Equipped with new type armoured vehicles of high maneuverability and ultra modern commanding and control means, the brigades will perform the role of a task force in the Korean War. The force is to be hurled into the Korean front within four days in the event of the outbreak of a war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly proves that the U.S. is getting its aggression troops fully ready for the war after making the event a fait accompli. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main thrust of the U.S. imperialists' preparations for this war is to increase the maneuverability and fire power to maximize their forces' capability in the war.  That is why they have directed particular efforts to strengthening their troops around the Korean peninsula and their air and naval task forces, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of its calculation that a rapid deployment of reinforcements would exert a strong influence on the outcome of a war, the U.S. is keen to settle this issue. the projected creation of new combat brigades of high maneuverability and attack capability is to serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is left with no option but to take every military counter-measure, given the U.S. imperialists' persistent moves to provoke a new Korean war at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they provoke a Korean war, it will only drive them to an abyss of ruin. The U.S. is well-advised to behave with discretion, deeply mindful of the consequences to be entailed by the new Korean war of aggression. \r\n\r\n"
