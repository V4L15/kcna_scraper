Kim Hyok acted as a core member of the Down-with-Imperialism Union and the Young Communist League and member of the first party organization and chief editor of the revolutionary publication \"Bolshevik\" and commanding member of the Korean Revolutionary Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea, in a report said that Kim Hyok held the President as the sun of the nation and the leader of revolution in high esteem at the dawn of the revolutionary cause of Juche and considered him as the central figure of the unity and the leadership, thereby making an outstanding contribution to creating a new history of unity and cohesion of the revolutionary ranks centered on the leader for the first time in the history of the Korean revolutionary movement and ushering in a new era of the struggle victoriously advancing the revolution, achieving the perfect unity of the leader and the popular masses in thinking and faith based on comradeship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ardent reverence shown by Kim Hyok for the President, greatly attracted by his personality as a great man found a more vivid expression in creating and disseminating the revolutionary hymn \"Star of Korea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hyok's intense loyalty to the President displayed in resolutely upholding the idea and cause of the President at all times found a striking manifestation in that Kim Hyok faithfully implemented with fervent enthusiasm the tasks given by the President, regarding them as the most honorable and sacred revolutionary ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Hyok's noble and strong revolutionary faith and principles were strikingly expressed in his heroic self-sacrificing spirit in which he died a heroic death in the worst adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President considered Kim Hyok as an eternal revolutionary comrade with profound loving care all his life, remembering him as a revolutionary comrade-in-arms who left unforgettable impressions on him during his youth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leader Kim Jong Il highly praised Kim Hyok as a model of the genuine revolutionary fighters and called on all servicepersons and people to learn from his revolutionary spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Ki Nam underscored the need to invariably and firmly preserve and carry forward the noble ideological and moral assets gained by the revolutionary forerunners despite any changing situation and thus give steady continuity to the Juche-based traditions of the Korean revolution generation after generation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Hostile Policy towards DPRK Denounced\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- Japan recently decided to ask the countries concerned to help it in its efforts to have a resolution on the non-existent \"north Korea's human rights issue\" adopted at the United Nations in a bid to press for the solution of the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, it is begging the U.S. not to de-list north Korea as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" unless the \"abduction issue\" is solved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is shameless and ridiculous, indeed, for the Japanese reactionaries to take issue with somebody's \"human rights issue\" instead of honestly admitting, apologizing and compensating for their past human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the \"abduction issue\" is concerned, it had already found a solution thanks to the sincere and humanitarian efforts of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a far-fetched assertion for Japan to persistently raise a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue,\" demanding the DPRK bring the dead persons to life and send them back to Japan. It is nothing but a clumsy ploy to use the \"abduction issue\" as a card to achieve its sinister political purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese authorities would be well advised to draw a lesson from the miserable end of the preceding \"Cabinet\" which staked its political fate on the solution of the \"abduction issue.\"  Nevertheless, the present Japanese authorities are behaving quite contrary to this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, the chief Cabinet secretary of Japan said the regime was replaced by a new one but the basic stand on the policy towards the DPRK would remain unchanged. This goes to clearly prove the wrong intention of Japan. The present Japanese authorities are keen to use the \"abduction issue\" as a sort of lever. This only reveals their intention to follow in the footsteps of the preceding \"Cabinet\" which regarded it as its policy to have the \"abduction issue\" settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the six-party talks aimed at discussing the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are to make progress, it is important, above all, for the participating nations to earnestly approach the talks with a sincere attitude and stance on the main purport of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now persistently considering the \"abduction issue\" as part of the agenda of the six-party talks. This attitude and stand compel the DPRK to reconsider whether Japan is qualified to participate in the talks. Japan seems to be keen on deliberately throwing obstacles in the way of the six-party talks and thus bar the peninsula from being denuclearized in a bid to secure a justification for nuclear weaponization and realize its ambition to become a military power and launch overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such trite artifice will only invite derision and criticism from the world people and precipitate Japan's isolation and destruction.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Federation of University Student Councils reportedly released a statement on October 4 calling for the punishment of the Grand National Party, the pro-U.S. flunkeyist traitor party which stands against the nation, swimming against the flow of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that Ri Myong Bak, \"presidential candidate\" from the GNP, was spurned by his master while attempting to gratify his wild ambition to seize power with the backing of the United States, the statement said this was a deserving reward to the pro-U.S. flunkeyist traitor party which is selling off the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people will never pardon the group of flunkeyist traitors and will surely deal a setback to the GNP in the on-coming \"presidential election,\" said the statement.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
