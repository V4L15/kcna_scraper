            "content": "Japan Urged to Fulfill Its Legal and Moral Obligation and Responsibility for Its Past Crimes\r\nPyongyang, August 15 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee on Measures for the Sexual Slavery for Japanese Army and Drafting Victims in a statement on Friday accused Japan of refusing to settle the crimes it committed against Korea and its people though more than half a century has passed since its defeat. \n\t\t\t\t\t The statement noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities have worked hard to isolate and stifle the DPRK internationally, suppressed and persecuted the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and Koreans in Japan and persistently evaded their responsibility for the crimes committed by Japan in the past, pursuant to the hostile policy toward the DPRK, the biggest victim of the Japanese imperialists, for the past 69 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the duty of Japan under international law and its state responsibility to properly redress the history of the crimes it committed after illegally occupying Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People in various parts of the world are becoming increasingly vocal demanding the reaffirmation of Japan's crimes and the censure on its wrong historic viewpoint and dishonest stand to reflect on them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is because the Japanese authorities refuse to honestly reflect on the crimes against humanity including the sexual slavery, deny the truth about history and are keen to justify the criminal actions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when Japan fulfills its legal and moral obligation and responsibility to redress its past crimes, can it appear upright and a \"normal state\" before the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Next year it will be seven decades since the defeat of Japanese militarism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before the lapse of 70 years, Japan should honestly redeem the political, moral and historical debt it has to pay to the Korean people and the Asian people and thus contribute to promoting the genuine reconciliation with the international community and establishing more stable and durable international relations in the region."

This is an intolerable insult to the Korean women and a wanton encroachment upon the dignity of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities are conniving at the operation of many sex stations for the U.S. forces. They once claimed prostitution is an \"industry without chimney\" for money-making. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly reveals that the south Korean puppet forces are the group of the most mean and despicable traitors in history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We positively support the statement issued by the spokeswoman for the Central Committee of the DWUK which calls upon south Korean women and other people of all social standings and all other Koreans to actively turn out in the struggle to drive the U.S. aggression forces, the root cause of misfortune and pain, out of south Korea as early as possible and settle accounts with the U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy."
