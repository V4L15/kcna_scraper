It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for national reunification is a patriotic struggle to establish national sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is what keeps a nation alive. A nation unable to live independently can neither lead a dignified life nor have any future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for national reunification is a patriotic struggle to achieve national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national unity is an important requirement for carving out the destiny of a nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is required to go united in order to preserve its 5000 year-old identity as a homogenous nation, glorify its long history and strikingly demonstrate its wisdom and talents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are intensifying their anti-DPRK propaganda based on all sorts of sheer lies, keen to scrap the June 15 joint declaration the basic spirit of which is \"By our nation itself.\" They are busy meddling in the cooperation projects under way between the north and the south, finding fault with them. They are, at the same time, egging the ultra-right conservatives in south Korea onto confrontation with their compatriots, pushing the situation to the brink of war. All these disturbing moves are aimed to prevent the divided Korea from becoming one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for the reunification of the divided Korean nation represents a patriotic cause of achieving national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the country is reunified, Korea will shed its rays all over the world as an independent sovereign state with a population of 70 million, brilliant national culture and powerful economy. Precisely for this reason to struggle for national reunification means a manifestation of the most ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should devote themselves to the dynamic struggle for national reunification and make their life worthwhile and thus creditably fulfill their sacred duty they have assumed before the nation, the article urges.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
