            "content": "National Meeting Marks Anniversary of Start of Songun Revolutionary Leadership\r\nPyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place at the April 25 House of Culture here Monday to mark the 49th anniversary of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's start of Songun revolutionary leadership.  \n\t\t\t\t\tPresent at the meeting were senior party, army and state officials, the chairpersons of the friendly parties, officials of party, armed forces and power organs, social organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media and working people in the city. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGeneral of the KPA Ri Yong Ho, chief of the General Staff of the KPA, said in a report at the meeting:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il provided field guidance to the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army on August 25, Juche 49 (1960). This was a clear manifestation of his fixed faith and will to accomplish with arms the Korean revolution which was started and made progress with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il embarked upon the road of Songun revolutionary leadership, marking the beginning of the great history of successfully carrying forward President Kim Il Sung's Songun idea and leadership and bringing about a new turning point in developing the revolutionary armed forces and carrying out the revolutionary cause of Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHis nearly half a century-long history of Songun revolutionary leadership is not only a shining course in which he has developed the People's Army into invincible revolutionary armed forces but a brilliant history shining with victories and glory in which he has firmly protected the destiny of the country, the nation and socialism thanks to a powerful military guarantee and made a new great history of building a rich and powerful country.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUnder the outstanding leadership of Kim Jong Il a great advance has been made in the work to put all the people under arms and fortify the whole country and the army and people of the DPRK have made spectacular achievements glorifying the era of the Workers' Party in the crucible of the great revolutionary advance despite the repeated military provocations of the U.S. imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Il's extraordinary leadership sweep and distinguished political and military caliber were more clearly demonstrated in the facts that he ushered in the era of Songun, a new era of the Juche-oriented revolution, holding aloft the banner of Songun, thereby saving the destiny of the country and the nation when they stood at the crossroads of life or death and providing a solid guarantee for the victorious advance of the socialist cause and the building of a rich and powerful country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe has wisely led the People's Army to form a harmonious whole in which it shares the idea, will and destiny with its Supreme Commander and made sure that the army and people achieved perfect unity in thinking and fighting traits. This helped the whole army form a harmonious whole with the leader and turned the country into one big family in which the army and people are linked with blood ties. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThanks to the Songun politics pursued by Kim Jong Il, genuine patriotic politics and anti-imperialist independent politics, a historic turn has taken place in the struggle for achieving national reunification, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and international solidarity with the Korean revolution has grown stronger and the DPRK's international prestige and influence have risen remarkably.   \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reporter underscored the need for all the servicepersons and people to firmly defend Kim Jong Il politically and ideologically at the risk of their lives and consolidate as firm as a rock the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks with the headquarters of the revolution as the core. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSongun represents the dignity and sovereignty of the country and nation and it is the unshakable will of the Party to build a thriving nation with the might of Songun, the reporter noted, calling upon all the servicepersons and people to unite close around Kim Jong Il and wage a more dynamic struggle to build a great prosperous and powerful socialist nation, achieve the independent reunification of the country and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche through an intensified drive for effecting a new great revolutionary surge."

Esta masacre intencional fue la continuacion de la politica japonesa de exterminio a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 24 y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay muchos testimonios que revelan la intencion y caracter criminales de este incidente: todo el proceso del caso de \"Ukishima maru\" desde cuando se le dio orden de navegacion a Pusan, los testigos de las victimas sobrevivientes y los datos descubiertos hasta la fecha. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl caso del barco \"Ukishima maru\" lo inventaron los imperialistas japoneses segun su plan intencional, trazado detalladamente, con el fin de sepultar en el agua a los incontables coreanos junto con el barco. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los reaccionarios japoneses dicen que el \"Ukishima maru\"  fue  hundido \"por las minas\", lo que no pasa de ser una  artimana astuta para encubrir la esencia del caso y su crimen de exterminio masivo a los coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pueblo coreano no olvida ese dia en que los imperialistas japoneses sepultaron en el mar a los coreanos, sino guarda en la mente todos los crimenes que ese pais isleno cometio contra los coreanos practicando en Corea la politica de ocupacion militar colonial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaldar sin falta cuenta final de los crimenes de Japon cometidos en el pasado es la invariable decision y voluntad del pueblo coreano."
