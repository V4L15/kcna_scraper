Their faith in the idea and line is unbreakable as it is growing stronger with the passage of time. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in an editorial.\r\n Pointing out that the validity, scientific accuracy, truth and tremendous vitality of his idea and line including the policy of building the Party, the state and the army and the policy of building economy and culture have been clearly testified to during the scores of years-long arduous struggle, the editorial continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's firm faith in the idea and line of the Workers' Party of Korea serves as an ideological and moral dynamic enabling them to cast in their lot with the headquarters of the revolution to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The era of Songun is the times when Kim Jong Il's idea and line are fully embodied in every field. Only when one accepts his idea and line as an unshakable faith and devotes one's all to their victory can one glorify the era as a genuine revolutionary soldier and comrade of the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fixed faith enables the Korean people to highly display the revolutionary spirit of devotedly implementing the plans and intentions of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying the Korean people's heroic struggle to devotedly materialize the plans and intentions of their leader in the spirit of going through thick and thin is their unshakable faith in Kim Jong Il's idea and line. They have enshrined through their long life experience the faith that the way indicated by Kim Jong Il is entirely right and they can always emerge victorious when they do as taught by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people should continue advancing dynamically as guided by their faith and build without fail a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche on this land where everything will flourish and everybody will live with nothing to desire more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial calls on all the officials and working people to firmly arm themselves with the idea and line of the WPK and dedicate themselves to the struggle to materialize Kim Jong Il's Songun idea and Songun revolutionary line.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

No other social and political organization can hold the position and play the role of the Party, the general staff of the revolution, in its stead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun era is a new era of history in which the People's Army pushes forward the revolution and construction as the pillar and main force of the revolution. Now the position and role of the army in accomplishing the cause of socialism are exceptionally high. In response to the requirements of the developing revolution at this stage, the WPK is leading the Korean revolution to victory under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is firmly defending the sovereignty of the country and the nation by strengthening the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today when the anti-imperialist military front is the main front in deciding the rise and fall of the country, the nation and socialism, the WPK is setting forth the reinforcement of the arms as the most important state affair and channeling greatest efforts to strengthening the army into invincible revolutionary armed forces. It is solving all the issues on the principle of giving priority to the military affairs and firmly establishing the commanding system of the party in the army as demanded by the line of the Songun revolution, thereby training its officers and men into ones strong in idea and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is also solidifying the driving force of the revolution like bedrock with the People's Army as its main force and keeping socialist construction in constant upswing with the might of revolutionary soldier spirit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Cuban resistance fighters at last went over to an active attack on the pro-U.S. Batista fascist junta in August, 1958. They made an assault upon Havana on January 1, 1959, toppling the Batista dictatorial regime and winning a victory in the revolution. And a genuine people's government, the first of its kind in Cuba's history, was set up in February 1959. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the victory of the revolution the Cuban people have advanced along the road of building a free and new society and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have keenly felt that the army alone can firmly protect the sovereignty of the country, happiness and socialism and made great efforts to increase the military power as they have built socialism in face of the U.S. vicious moves against Cuba. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cuban party and government set 2004 as a year of winding up the military preparations. They have adopted the idea of giving importance to the military affairs as a basic policy and have channeled great efforts into increasing the national defense power while bolstering the combat capability of the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Communist Party of Cuba is further intensifying the ideological education among the servicepersons and people as never before as required by the prevailing situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mentality of the Cuban army and people is good and their military power is on a daily increase. Fidel Castro, supreme leader of the Cuban revolution, declared that Cuba has modern weapons and experience and armed forces prepared ideologically and in military technique strong enough to repel any aggression of the U.S., warning that if the U.S. dares attack Cuba it will suffer the most disastrous and disgraceful defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cuban people are highly proud of having the revolutionary armed forces loyal to the motherland and the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
