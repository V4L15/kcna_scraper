Asserting South Korea and the United States should consult about the situation under which this emergency countermeasure will be applied, he took as an example the anti-DPRK nuclear row kicked up by the U.S. when the DPRK resolutely announced its withdrawal from the International Atomic Energy Agency in 1994.   His remarks are indicative of the US's moves to stifle the DPRK in collusion with the South Korean authorities under the pretext of \"suspected underground nuclear facility\".\r\n    \r\n"

They were closeted over a \"plan for the building of joint information system, the reinforcement of joint operation capacity and arms and logistic support between command and control rooms of the two services\".   This shows that the South Korean authorities are getting overheated in their moves to round off their \"cooperation system\" by unifying the commanding system of the three services and setting up new \"commands\" as part of their preparations for a war against the north.  \r\n\r\n"

This is an undying feat performed by Kim Jong Il in the development of the revolutionary idea of the working class.\r\n   The role of working people's organisations to conduct ideological education should be further enhanced and the members of trade unions and the union of agricultural workers should greatly contribute to achieving the cause of modeling the whole of society on the Juche idea as the absolute worshippers, resolute defenders and faithful executors of Kim Jong Il's idea. \r\n \r\n"

The U.S. soldiers are  continuing brutal murders in South Korea because they inherited habits of aggression, murder and plunder against other nations  from their ancestors and they dyed in extreme misanthropy.   The South Korean authorities' release of the U.S. soldiers is the product of their deep-set flunkeyism and servility, which fully reveals the despicable nature of the colonial authorities who are prolonging their remaining days, currying favour with the aggression troops. \r\n  \r\n"
