            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Refutes Anti-DPRK \"Resolution on Human Rights Issue\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry issued a statement Monday in connection with the fact that a \"resolution on human rights performance\" in the DPRK was adopted in a coercive manner at the third committee of the UN General Assembly on Nov. 17.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution is peppered with sheer lies aimed to negate the advantages of the man-centered Korean style socialist system, tarnish its international image and attain the ridiculous purpose of \"regime change\" in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That's why the majority countries of the world have taken issue with the sinister purpose sought by the resolution from the outset, a document clearly indicating politicization, selectivity and double standards concerning the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was clearly evidenced by the results of the voting in which the majority countries voted against or abstained from voting or stayed away from it.\r\n We strongly denounce the U.S. and the EU for using the discussion on the human rights issue for attaining their sinister purposes of opposing developing countries, those anti-U.S. independent countries and categorically oppose and reject the resolution as an illegal document mocking at and violating the inviolable sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. was chiefly to blame for the adoption of such anti-DPRK resolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Finding it difficult to force the DPRK to scrap \"its nuclear program first\" and thus disarm itself, the present U.S. administration with inveterate enmity toward the DPRK has put spurs to its moves to realize the absurd attempt at a \"regime change\" under the signboard of \"human rights\".\r\n It has malignantly slandered the DPRK by staging such farce as publishing \"report on human rights performance\" every year. It has spent tens of millions of U.S. dollars for a smear campaign against the DPRK after adopting even the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" in 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It defined the act as a \"framework for pressurizing the system in the DPRK in two ways i.e. over the nuclear and human rights issues\" and worked out a strategy for bringing down its system under the pretext of protecting defectors from north Korea. This has already entered the phase of full-scale effectuation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What was mentioned in the resolution is no more than sheer fabrications deliberately made by undesirable NGOs on the basis of misinformation to get meager rewards from the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just before voting for the resolution the Bush administration launched a big anti-DPRK human rights campaign by setting in motion CNN and other media in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with this, the U.S. has worked hard to build up force for a \"regime change\" inside the DPRK, openly clamoring that the U.S. would stand by north Koreans when they rise up in demand of freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution is, therefore, no more than a politically-motivated document faked up by the U.S. to paint its human rights offensive as a \"unanimous message of the international community\" in a bid to realize a \"regime change\" in the DPRK .&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, however, gravely mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Neither slander nor calumny against the Korean-style socialist system can ever do any harm to it as it was chosen by the Korean people themselves and defended by them at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noisier racket of outside hostile forces against the DPRK over its \"human rights issue\" would only reinforce their faith and will for socialism.\r\n The Korean people have already keenly realized that human rights precisely represent the state power through their bitter past and life experience. So they are fully determined not to tolerate any attempt to bring down the socialist system, their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the biggest misfortune and shame for humankind today to see the world's biggest human rights abuser painting itself as a \"human rights judge.\"\r\n It is a stark fact recognized by itself and other countries that the U.S. is the world's worst human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that many Americans including high-ranking officials deplore the fact that their country tops the world's list of murder cases, saying that political rights and freedom and freedom of speech, thinking and expression are in the grip of a crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi crisis has clearly proved that the U.S. is a typical human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iraqi war is recorded with state-sponsored terrorism and hideous human rights abuses as it has seriously abused human rights with ultra-modern war means and medieval methods involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dropped depleted uranium shells and chemical weapons and other weapons of mass destruction upon the heads of civilians under the pretext of \"anti-terrorism\" in Iraq. GIs are torturing prisoners in a medieval manner at secret prisons it set up in different countries of the world at the instruction of the U.S. authorities. These crimes put even the Nazi junta into the shade &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., therefore, is not entitled to say anything about \"human rights performance\" in any other countries from the moral and legal points of view. \r\n Had the EU countries been interested in the human rights issue so much and so willing to handle it in the international arena, they should have taken issue with the U.S. hideous human rights abuse, to begin with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Britain and some other EU countries selected only the human rights performances in developing countries as targets of their accusations, while uttering not a word about the U.S. human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but question the true aim sought by them; whether they need this resolution, truly prompted by their will to promote human rights or they require this as a smokescreen to cover up their on-going and past human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What draws our attention is the fact that such countries as Britain and Japan that took the lead in sponsoring the anti-DPRK \"human rights resolution\" have become rich at the cost of the blood and sweat shed by the people of many countries which they invaded and colonized in the last century.\r\n It was none other than Britain which participated in the unjust Iraqi war, killing innocent civilians and reducing the sovereign state to debris even in this new century. It is again Britain that caused terrorist incidents to break out in the heart of its capital that killed citizens in cold blood.\r\n Violent racism, xenophobia, discrimination against minority nationalities and immigrants and police brutality arouse big apprehension even within Britain as well as among the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for Japan, it is a war criminal state unqualified to become a responsible member of the international community, to say nothing of its right to discuss human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has become the target of bitter resentment and denunciation of the international community because it has beautified its past history of aggression and justified visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" by its politicians including the chief executive, far from apologizing for the hideous crimes it has committed against humanity even today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, these countries, ignorant of how the world views them, have served the U.S. prompted by their inveterate servility towards America for years. This is a height of folly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They seem to regard themselves as suzerain states even in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are also compelled to point fingers at those countries that co-sponsored the resolution and supported it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries that got involved in the adoption of the resolution away from their principle at the U.S. instigation and under its pressure and manipulation should not expect any reward for such behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is by no means such honest country they deem to be. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries that have infringed upon the interests of other countries in the foolish hope of meeting their immediate interests will have to deeply regret their behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution helped us to clearly realize the nature of the humanitarian aid advertised by the U.S. and the EU and convinced us once again that the DPRK took the just and timely measure not to receive humanitarian aid any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and its allies in the resolution accused the DPRK of taking such measure. This made it clear that they behaved so not out of their concern about human rights but to use aid as leverage for spying on what's really going on in the DPRK and lay a springboard from which to realize a \"regime change\" in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently we have decided to conclude international humanitarian aid as the food situation in the country has markedly improved.\r\n We considered it to be beneficial for lessening the burden of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strange enough, such countries as the U.S. and Japan that had worked persistently to obstruct aid projects for the DPRK by raising political conditionalities when it was in the dire need of humanitarian aid are describing its measure as violation of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation compelled us to take action to bring the humanitarian aid to an end. The U.S., Britain and major EU forces that sponsored the resolution reduced even humanitarian aid organizations as well as the DPRK to victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent adoption of the resolution spearheaded by the U.S. and the EU convinced us once again that it is stark reality in the international arena dealing with human rights issues that any crime committed by the strong is considered as a good conduct but even a good conduct by the weak is regarded as an evil deed and that accordingly, if one is to protect human rights one should have state power among other things and powerful deterrent to defend its state power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We regard the recent human rights resolution no more than barking of a dog at the moon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will hold the banner of Songun higher to defend the precious socialist system and bolster up the deterrent for self-defense a thousand times under any circumstance and situation.     \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

This is deeply rooted in their racism and national chauvinism. Perhaps Japan is the only country in the world where the policy of bitterly hating and insulting other nations is being openly pursued and terrorism, violence and other vices against foreigners in Japan are being openly perpetrated at the tacit connivance of the authorities. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists invaded Asian countries including Korea, bringing unspeakable misfortune and pain to them in the past. The Asian people still cannot repress their resentment at these crimes of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of their military occupation of Korea that lasted for more than four decades from early in the 20th century the Japanese imperialists deprived the Koreans of their right to preserve their peculiar national culture and tradition and go by their own names and prohibited them from using their mother tongue. At least 8.4 million Koreans were forcibly taken and kidnapped by the Japanese imperialists for slave labor and more than one million of them were killed by them. At least 200,000 Korean women were forced to serve as shameful \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army. \r\n The Japanese reactionaries have maltreated the Koreans in Japan for many decades, imposing mental and physical pain upon them, instead of admitting the crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists and honestly apologizing and compensating for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The persecution, discrimination, murder and other crimes against Koreans in Japan can never be pardoned as they are the repetition of the criminal plots of the Japanese imperialists to exterminate the Korean nation in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan feels guilty of the Japanese imperialists' past harsh maltreatment, discrimination and murder of Koreans even a bit, they should stop rejecting and hating Koreans and other foreigners in Japan and imposing mental and physical pain upon them.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
