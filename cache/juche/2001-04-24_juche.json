All of them should remain true to the oath taken before the party and the leader no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls for becoming Kim Jong Il's true comrades who earnestly learn from his comradeship and wholeheartedly uphold his politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to consolidate all the social relations to be those of comradeship and firmly protect the revolutionary and true ties of comradeship that exist in our society, it concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The victories were a noteworthy military miracle in the world history of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to his far-sighted revolutionary army-first leadership that the people's army resolutely foiled the ferocious challenge of all sorts of the hostile forces and class enemies in those grim decades of revolution, creditably defended the security of the party, the revolution, the country and the people and firmly guaranteed the victorious advance of the socialist cause of Juche by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche cause of army building and revolutionary army-first leadership of the president are being successfully carried forward by supreme commander Kim Jong Il at a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth the army-building policy of modelling the whole army on the Juche idea and wisely led the struggle for its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was thanks to his unique army-first leadership, considering military affairs as the first one of state affairs and giving top priority to strengthening the revolutionary armed forces, that the defence lines of the country have been firmly consolidated as an impregnable socialist bulwark and the people's army could emerge victorious in sharp confrontation with the imperialists, demonstrating its invincible might. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Due to the reckless provocations and aggression moves of the new U.S. administration, the Korean peninsula is beset with the danger that its situation, which was developing in favour of detente and reunification, may go back to confrontation and tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the imperialists force a war upon us despite our serious warnings, our army and people will deal an annihilating blow of retaliation at the enemies with all potentials they have built up for decades and the enemies will face the most miserable end.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
