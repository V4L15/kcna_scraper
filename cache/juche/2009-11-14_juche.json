La extraordinaria importancia de esa campana esta en que ella se trata de la ofensiva para lograr un triunfo mas grande en el proximo ano, en que se cumplira el 65o aniversario de la fundacion del partido, y para preparar el trampolin que nos haga pasar en 2012 las puertas a la gran potencia prospera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t　Para llegar a toda costa este ano al punto de viraje en la construccion de una gran potencia prospera, no tenemos otro remedio que apoyarnos en las propias fuerzas. He aqui la victoria de la ofensiva general de hoy y el futuro de la gran potencia prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La fe independiente, el coraje incomparable y el inflexible espiritu de la marcha forzada del Dirigente Kim Jong Il sirven de la fuerza motriz que incrementa mil veces el espiritu revolucionario de autoconfianza y de lucha tenaz de nuestro ejercito y pueblo."
