Timed to coincide with this, ultra-right organizations and media of Japan are vying with each other to incite the idea of grabbing other's territory among Japanese people, young people in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves of Japan are a wanton infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that the islet is part of the inviolable territory of Korea had been clearly proved long ago by the historical facts and geographical and legal evidence. Historical materials proving this fact have been unearthed one after another recently. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, the Japanese authorities have persistently claimed \"dominion\" on Tok Islet, disregarding these historical facts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is leaving no means untried to convince the younger generation of the \"dominium over Tok Islet\". Herein lies the dangerous and serious nature of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is making desperate efforts to seize other countries' territories with an aim to reinvade not only Korea but other countries around it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves of the Japanese authorities are aimed to secure a pretext for reinvading Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the unchanged wild ambition of the Japanese militarists to reinvade Asia and dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They are working hard to deny, beautify and justify its history of aggression in a bid to imbue the younger generation with a militarist view on history and the revanchist spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The process of equipping the troops of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" with modern and long-distance war hardware has made rapid progress, making it possible for them to be hurled into any part of the world to conduct combat activities. What remains to be done is just to secure a pretext for overseas aggression and reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are set to secure such pretext through territorial disputes. The above-said moves of Japan are a revelation of the moves to turn Japan into a military giant and launch overseas expansion and a prelude to its operation for reinvasion, concludes the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

On July 24 and 25 the warmongers of the south Korean puppet army infiltrated \"commandoes\"  into the operational theatres simulating the strategic and tactical targets of the north to frantically conduct observation, reconnaissance, assault, destruction and disturbance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Between July 14 and 18 they conducted a war exercise codenamed Hwarang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean puppets are now taking even middle school students and public servants to the special units belonging to the \"Special Warfare Command\" of the puppet army to force them to undergo \"guerrilla\" and airlifting exercises and drills for night warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 16 the super-large nuclear-powered carrier \"Reagan\" of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces entered Pusan Port to be followed by the sailing of guided missile destroyers and cruisers to waters off south Korea one after another. They were busy with naval operation maneuvers in coordinated operations with the puppet forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 22 and 23 south Korea-U.S. joint naval war maneuvers were staged with the West Sea of Korea as an operational theatre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Oceanic observation ships of the U.S. Navy sailed into the waters of the East and West Seas of Korea on July 19 to confirm navigation routes and routes for submarines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean puppet navy conducted a landing operation exercise and an emergency mobile operation maneuver between July 14 and 20. The \"Special Warfare Command\" of the south Korean puppet army had been busy staging a naval infiltration operation exercise for more than ten days since mid-July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces staged exercises to strike targets in the land in combination with a long-distance navigation drill of formations of B-52H. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint air war exercises of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet army which started on July 21 reached a very reckless phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RC-135 was busy perpetrating aerial espionage against the DPRK. The number of cases of this espionage committed by the  U.S. imperialists against the DPRK in July reached more than 90 and those perpetrated by the south Korean puppet army at least 60, bringing the total number of the  cases to more than 150. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The madcap war exercises and aerial espionage being perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists and the warmongers of the south Korean puppet army against the DPRK in the sky, land and sea of south Korea almost everyday glaringly reveal their scenario for aggression to stifle the DPRK by force of arms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
