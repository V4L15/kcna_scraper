Hwanggye linked to the Pujonryong Ranges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This cave was created in the limestone layer formed by the accumulation action in the Second Palaeozoic Era. There are good many underground ponds presenting a peculiar view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ponds over two meters deep alone number more than 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cave consists of the main grotto, the upper grotto and the lower grotto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the cave, mysterious and beautiful views are unfolded by walls of graceful stalactites, stone flowers and stone pillars mingled together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When you cross three passes after going through the square 13 meters from the entrance of the main grotto, you reach a pond of clean water called \"Underground Sea Kumgang\". Its scenery is also spectacular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are also fascinating scenes presented by a rock wall with rows of white stone stalactites, a rock called \"glacier\" which has been formed by lime water and a grotto with big and small stalactites of potato shape. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a criminal move to bring back the past era of north-south confrontation, swimming against the trend of the era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves cannot be construed otherwise than dangerous rash acts to realize their ambition to invade the north in collusion with the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned \"triangular military alliance\" has actually emerged a strong entity due to the servile and mean pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese sycophantic policy of the Lee group and its ambition to invade fellow countrymen at any cost, backed by the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the south Korean authorities have expressed their will to participate in the PSI and the missile defence system which are nothing but the U.S.-led sieges to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already become an active player in the PSI and MD. It is as clear as a pikestaff that south Korea's involvement in them would result in further tightening the \"triangular military alliance,\" escalating the military tension on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase and bringing catastrophic consequences in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the south Korean puppets to knock into shape the \"triangular military alliance\" are a blatant challenge to the sincere efforts of the DPRK to defuse the military confrontation and tension on the peninsula, build a solid peace-keeping mechanism and create the nation's new history of reunification and prosperity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean people have firmly defended the banner of socialism despite of the worst adversity, the article said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the wise leadership of the WPK which has ceaselessly intensified the education in the Juche idea, the whole society has been replete with the spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution and the Korean people have grown to be genuine patriots in the era of Songun, persons with strong sense of national dignity and ardent patriotism, displaying their might as the revolutionary people with steadfast anti-imperialist class consciousness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Korean people have become resolute vanguard fighters and heroic people in the anti-imperialist class struggle as the WPK has educated the people in a revolutionary manner guided by the Juche idea, the Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the U.S. imperialists and other imperialists and class enemies are getting evermore vicious in the moves to dull the revolutionary consciousness and the class consciousness of the Korean army and people and undermine the Korean-style socialism from within. But they can never weaken the revolutionary spirit and the class consciousness of the Korean people regarding the Juche idea, the Songun idea as their faith. The Korean people clearly see through the reactionary nature and danger of the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning and psychological warfare while resolutely smashing any slight attempt for such campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will in the future, too, decisively frustrate the moves of the imperialists with steadfast anti-imperialist class consciousness and steadfastly adhere to the socialist principle in the revolution and construction.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
