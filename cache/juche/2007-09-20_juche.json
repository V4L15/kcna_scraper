Paektu, the historic root and eternal cornerstone of the Korean revolution, in all fields of the revolution and construction and thus accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This slogan has displayed its tremendous vitality in the socialist construction under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This land has greeted the best days in the era of the WPK and witnessed a revolutionary turn in the people's ideological viewpoint, fighting spirit and way of living. It is a shining success made in the course of putting the slogan into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible vitality of the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle was strikingly demonstrated during the \"Arduous March\" through which the DPRK achieved a great victory under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il wisely guided the army and people of the DPRK to weather out stern trials and difficulties in the past 1990s in the same spirit of making the \"Arduous March\" as that prevailed in the forests of Mt. Paektu during the anti-Japanese struggle. This served as a main source of strength which made it possible for the army and people of the DPRK to fully demonstrate the might of Korean-style socialism in the same spirit as displayed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary forerunners. This includes the spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of self-reliance, the spirit of overcoming difficulties and the spirit of revolutionary optimism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Socialism is the life and soul of the people of the DPRK. They are advancing vigorously along the road of socialism under the uplifted banner of the Juche idea and Songun idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the popular masses advance under the banner of socialism can they totally eradicate class and national oppression and subjugation, achieve the independent development and prosperity of the countries and nations and realize the desire and ideal of humankind to live in an independent world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
