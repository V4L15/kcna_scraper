Its players will take part in 14 events such as men's and women's football, swimming (synchronized swimming and diving), judo, rowing, shooting, weightlifting, gymnastics, archery, boxing, wrestling, table tennis, canoeing, marathon and karate, Son noted, adding: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are taking an active part in the works being under way according to the rules and practice of the Asian Games in the Olympic spirit. The DPRK delegation took part in the drawing for the 17th Asian Games and the international sports scientific symposium held in Inchon recently. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the issue of cheerleading squad, Son said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We had decided to send a large cheerleading squad in order to cheer our players participating in the Asian Games, improve the inter-Korean relations and promote national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the south side openly slandered the decision to send the cheerleading squad, asserting it is a \"group for political operation in the south\" and \"for creating discord in the south\". Not content with this, at the north-south working-level talks held in July the south side took issue with the scale of the cheerleading squad and the size of the flag of the DPRK and finally raised even the issue of expenses which the north side had never mentioned, bringing the talks to a rupture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the south side is displeased with the dispatch of our cheerleading squad, we decided not to send it to the 17th Asian Games. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK delegation notified those concerned of the Asian Games Organizing Committee and those concerned of the authorities of the south side of this decision when it was participating the drawing for the Asian Games and the international sports scientific symposium held in Inchon from Aug. 20."

            "content": "No hay que repetir ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC, insiste CRPP\r\nPyongyang, 29 de agosto (ACNC) -- Los Estados Unidos y las autoridades surcoreanas llevaron a la peor fase la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas desarrollando durante mas de 10 dias a partir del dia 18 los provocativos ejercicios belicos conjuntos Ulji Freedom Guardian. \n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria publico el dia 29 una declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota califica el presente simulacro de prueba de guerra nuclear mas aventurera en que fue aplicada por primera vez la \"estrategia del disuasivo de forma de ajuste\", cuya meta es asestar el ataque preventivo nuclear contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas hablan del dialogo, mientras se entregan a los ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC. De esta manera, fueron revelados que el \"dialogo\" y la \"confianza\" de que hablan ellas no pasan de ser una cortina de humo para desviar la atencion de la opinion publica y ocultar la naturaleza belicosa de si mismas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHablar del dialogo librando los fanaticos ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC en contubernio con los imperialistas norteamericanos resulta un insoportable insulto a la contraparte y un intolerable engano a la opinion publica interna y externa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La realidad evidencia mas claramente que la causa raigal que perturba la paz y la estabilidad de la Peninsula Coreana e impide la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y el dialogo Norte-Sur es precisamente el simulacro que se libra por los titeres surcoreanos junto con EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas surcoreanos no deben repetir mas la circulacion viciosa de llevar a la ruptura las relaciones intercoreanas librando con EE.UU los ejercicios belicos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben aclarar su posicion si quieren el dialogo o el enfrentamiento,  la paz o la guerra."
