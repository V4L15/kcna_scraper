It is, indeed, an intentional traitorous act aimed to throw a wet blanket over the hope of the Koreans and baffle the national feast for reunification by provoking the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never overlook the behavior of Ri who dares to provoke it and incites confrontation and war, making an issue of the north-south summit for no reason, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When provoking the DPRK, Ri pretended to be interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue, but this only laid bare his ignorance. The root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is the United States which has shipped nukes into south Korea and threatened the DPRK with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also expressed his will to attach importance to the relations with the U.S., unreasonably criticizing the forthcoming inter-Korean summit and slandering the fellow countrymen. It is a product of wicked scheme to curry favor with the U.S. in a bid to place himself in a \"presidential\" seat under the patronage of it, his master, in disregard of the destiny of the nation. This glaringly revealed his true colors as a philistine and a traitor who does not hesitate to misuse even the important event of the nation for a political purpose in order to gratify his covetous greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, it is as clear as noonday that if the GNP comes to power it would sell off the interests of the nation to the U.S. and run headlong towards confrontation, division and war. In order to prevent such aftermath it is necessary to drive all the gentries of the GNP, who are parasitic on the U.S. while turning against the nation, out of the political circles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans would sternly punish the traitors turning aside from the desire of the nation and trend of the times and agitating confrontation, war and division, mad for personal distinction and greed for power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Such being a hard fact, the Japanese ruling quarters regard it as the most urgent task to burnish its tarnished image and win favor of Asian countries through positive \"Asian diplomacy.\" This is evidenced by \"common strategic interests,\" \"co-existence and co-prosperity,\" \"establishment of peace\" and \"economic aid\" much touted by Abe and other Japanese high-ranking officials during their trips to Asian countries last month. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan launched hectic \"Asian diplomacy\" mainly in pursuit of its economic interests. It is an intrinsic economic and animal nature of Japan to sacrifice others for its own interests. Japan's talk that it is \"sincere in helping others in economic development\" is nothing but sophism which can convince no one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's oft-repeated \"Asian diplomacy\" is chiefly aimed at realizing its ambition for reinvasion of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe came out with \"broader Asia\" initiative during his visit to Asian countries. This was also prompted by Japan's attempt to escalate its infiltration into Asia on a full scale and realize the old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.\" By realizing \"broader Asia\" initiative Japan foolishly seeks to contain the DPRK and China and establish its military domination over Asia and, furthermore, become the \"leader\" of Asia. Japan's loudmouthed theory of \"broader Asia\" precisely means a slogan for reinvasion of Asia and a logic of domination over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is, however, grossly mistaken. It is an anachronistic dream to realize its design for dominating Asia through \"Asian diplomacy.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is also escalating Japan-U.S. joint military exercises while stepping up the development of Missile Defence System (MD) together with the U.S. This is a vivid manifestation of Japan's moves to emerge a military giant and launch overseas aggression, observes Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to rank itself among military powers by stepping up the moves to become a military giant and thereby establish military supremacy in various regions of the world under the signboard of \"making an international contribution to peace\", the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is precisely for this purpose that the Japanese reactionaries have persistently insisted on extending the term of validity of the law on special measures against terrorism which will expire on November 1 this year. By extending at any cost the term of the validity of the above-said law which allows by law the overseas dispatch of their \"Self-Defence Forces (SDF),\" the Japanese reactionaries seek to justify the long-term presence and activities of the SDF overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to convert Japan into a military power and launch overseas aggression in a bid to realize come what may the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" which they failed to do in the last century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is the primary target of Japan's overseas aggression. The Japanese Defence Ministry is set to conduct field study this month to cope with the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. These are war moves aimed to elaborate on its scenario to stage a comeback to Korea and examine and round off the preparedness for a preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the military measures and actions taken by Japan are orientated toward realizing its ambition to stage a comeback to Korea to begin with, increasing the danger of its aggression as the days go by.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the People for Achieving Peace and Reunification, the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration and other civic and social organizations held the 96th anti-U.S. solidarity meeting in front of the U.S. embassy in Seoul on September 11, according to a news report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speakers at the meeting said that the U.S. moves to increase the role of the \"UN Command\" are aimed at realizing its strategy for dominating the whole of Korea, urging the U.S. to give up its hypocritical \"transfer of the right to command wartime operations\" and dismantle the command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution read out at the meeting denounced the U.S. for its moves to reorganize the U.S. forces in south Korea into a \"rapid task force\" in a bid to boost its capability for military intervention in Northeast Asia and, at the same time, create a highly integrated \"military cooperation headquarters\" going beyond the existing capability for military command system under the pretext of \"transferring the right to command wartime operations\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution said that in order to establish a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula the U.S. should, first of all, give up its hostile policy toward the DPRK and withdraw its forces from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
