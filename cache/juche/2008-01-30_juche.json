            "content": "Kim Jong Il Provides Field Guidance to Mine \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-the-spot guidance to the March 5 Youth Mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked round the room devoted to the history of the mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He looked back with deep emotion on the glorious course of development covered by the mine which has advanced toward victory and prosperity under the care of President Kim Il Sung. Thanks to the wise guidance and meticulous care of the President, the mine has turned into a modern non-ferrous metal ore producer, he said, adding that his immortal revolutionary exploits will shine forever with the history of the mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he was briefed on the ore body in front of its model picture and went round stopes to acquaint himself with the technical modernization of production processes and mineral output. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at crushing and ore-dressing plants to learn in detail about the conditions of equipment and production and gave pep talks to workers speeding up the increased production for the prosperous development of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the proud achievements made by the workers at the mine are a manifestation of the indomitable will of the Korean working class, the dependable ranks of loyal subjects who have overcome the stern trials of revolution victoriously, following the Party wholeheartedly. They are also a striking demonstration of the might of the most revolutionary and militant, heroic Korean workers who advance along the road of progress without slightest vacillation or hesitation in any adversity, he stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he commanded a bird's-eye view of the mine reminiscent of a city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He set forth tasks for systematically increasing the production at the mine and developing it under a long-term plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to putting the non-ferrous metal production on a normal basis is to ensure the breaking and carriage of ore in a large quantity so as to keep concentrated ore production ahead of other works, he said, stressing the need to put in good order all the tunneling, carrying and dressing equipment and raise their operation rate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to utilize the bountiful underground resources at the mine economically in a prospective way, he said it is necessary to give priority to the prospecting for providing enough ore reserves and thoroughly take steps for deep tunneling based on up-to-date science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day he visited the Naedong Revolutionary Site in the seat of Jasong County. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The site is a historic place where Kim Hyong Jik, an indomitable revolutionary fighter, conducted his brisk activities for encouraging workers, peasants and other people of different strata in Jasong area to the anti-Japanese struggle in 1920 and autumn of 1921. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After being briefed on the site in front of the monument to it, he looked round the historic buildings preserved as they were to acquaint himself with management of the site and education in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that since there are many precious historic sites including the revolutionary sites associated with noble traces of the President, it is important to well preserve and manage them in their original state and intensify the education through them to more firmly arm party members and other working people, servicepersons and youth and children with the revolutionary idea of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met with leading officials of the county to learn about the economic activities including farming and urged them to steadily increase the agricultural production so as to further improve the standard of living of the inhabitants in the county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Chiefly to Blame for Increasing Danger of Nuclear War in Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 29 (KCNA) -- South Korea still remains a powder keg of the U.S. for a dangerous nuclear war and this is a product of its adventurous strategy for world domination and the aggressive hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article carried 50 years since the U.S. formally announced that it introduced nukes into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disclosing the criminal aim sought by the U.S. in having reduced south Korea to the most dangerous advance nuclear base in the world and brought the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean nation since the 1950s, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has long harbored the wild ambition to invade the DPRK with south Korea as a springboard and, furthermore, dominate the whole of Northeast Asia. The U.S. designated south Korea as a \"vital operation area\" as early as in the 1950s and has since stepped up the process of arming the U.S. forces in south Korea with nukes in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilaterally declared the abrogation of the provision (d) of the Paragraph 13 of the Armistice Agreement banning the introduction of modern weapons at the 75th meeting of the Military Armistice Commission held in June 1957. And in July, it declared the start of the work to arm the U.S. forces in south Korea with nuclear weapons. On Jan. 29, 1958, the U.S. formally disclosed its introduction of nukes into south Korea. Few days later the U.S. opened to the public a 280mm atomic gun and nuclear missile \"Honest John\" at the command of the First Army Corps of the U.S. forces in south Korea and in May it test-fired the atomic gun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy for turning south Korea into a nuclear base has been steadily supplemented and perfected and put into a concrete shape in the subsequent period. Various types of nukes including nuclear bombs, nuclear mines and nuclear missiles produced in the U.S. were massively introduced into south Korea, pursuant to this policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had deployed more than 1,720 various tactical nuclear weapons in south Korea till the year before 1991, turning south Korea into the world's biggest nuclear base in the density of nuclear weapons deployment. Not content with this, the U.S. bellicose forces made the deployment of not only tactical nukes but also strategic nukes in south Korea an established fact, presupposing \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula at the 38th meeting of the south Korea-U.S. \"annual security consultative council\" held in October 2006. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea has thus turned into a huge powder keg for a dangerous nuclear war which may go off any moment and the situation on the peninsula remains so tense that a nuclear war may break out any moment due to the reckless moves of the U.S. which regards nukes as a means for carrying out its strategy for world domination and an all-powerful weapon for aggression and hegemony.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. has reduced south Korea to a huge powder keg for a nuclear war which may go off any moment and systematically increased the danger of a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula, threatening the life and security of the Koreans and persistently standing in the way of their cause of peace and reunification. This is, indeed, a thrice-cursed crime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history and reality clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for having escalated the danger of a nuclear war by spawning the nuclear issue on the peninsula and disturbing peace there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the source of a nuclear war is to be removed from the peninsula, the U.S. should stop posing its nuclear threat to the DPRK and drop its hostile policy towards the latter and pull its forces for aggression out of south Korea, to begin with.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It clearly hints that the think tanks of the U.S. military singled out Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula as a theatre of confrontation and an operational theatre for establishing their military hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To stabilize the situation on the peninsula presents itself as a focus of world politics and a key issue at present.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this context the U.S. has an important and responsible part to play and once clarified its stand to seek a peaceful and negotiated settlement of the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard reality, U.S. negotiators say something before delegates of the DPRK but behave quite contrary to it after they are back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical experience proves that the U.S. military pressure and hard-line policy has been of no help to developing the DPRK-U.S. relations but have driven the situation in this area into an extreme phase.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The U.S. would be well advised to cogitate about the serious consequences to be entailed by its anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and take a right option.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a grave political terrorism which can never be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Japanese reactionaries are disgustingly justifying such action as a mere \"economic problem\", the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their decision to usurp the above-said building can never be a financial issue to be dealt with by any individual judicial body or company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries to destroy Chongryon by means of putting financial pressure upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n So, it is incontestable that the decision was made according to their deliberate scheme and direct instruction from beginning to the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With any tricks they can never cover up their sinister intention to stamp out Chongryon and activities of Japan-resident Koreans by physically eliminating the strongholds of Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries try to usurp the buildings and lands of Chongryon, not content with frantic suppression of it. Such actions fully reveal their brigandish nature, moral vulgarity and vileness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves are a direct outcome from Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK. Particularly, lurking behind them is their criminal scheme to interrupt the process of the six-party talks and establish the domination over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues its moves to stifle Chongryon and seek a \"cooperation mechanism for pressure\" on the DPRK, the latter will be compelled to take a tougher counteraction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

EE.UU. convirtio al Sur de Corea en un peligroso polvorin de guerra nuclear, amenazo la vida y la seguridad de la nacion incrementando sistematicamente el peligro de guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana e impidio siniestramente la causa de la paz y la reunificacion. Asi cometio un crimen nunca perdonable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La historia y la realidad demuestran claramente que EE.UU. es precisamente el fautor que engendro el problema nuclear e incremento el peligro de guerra nuclear perturbando la paz en la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para eliminar la fuente de la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana es preciso que EE.UU. renuncie su amenaza nuclear y la politica agresiva de hostilidad a la RPDC y retire sus tropas del Sur de Corea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
