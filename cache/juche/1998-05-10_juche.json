The policy will be supported and welcomed not only by the Korean people but also by the world progressive people as an immortal banner of Korea's reunification, he added.\r\n   First Secretary of the central committee of the Communist Party of Bulgaria Alexander Paunov said on the same occasion that the members of his party are convinced that Korea will be reunified certainly according to General Kim Jong Il's five-point policy under his guidance.\r\n   The Guyana-Korea Friendship Association and the Guyanese committee for supporting Korea's reunification in an appeal said that the idea on achieving great national unity is the fundamental condition to reunify Korea independently and peacefully. \r\n   The appeal called upon the world peaceloving people to unanimously support the struggle of the Korean people for great national unity and independent and peaceful reunification.\r\n   The Trinidad and Tobago-Korea Friendship and Solidarity Association in a statement strongly demanded that the South Korean authorities make a policy switchover in conformity with the five-point policy. It said that it will invariably support and encourage the Korean people's just struggle.\r\n   The Asian regional committee for supporting Korea's reunification, the Communist Party of India, the All-India Youth Federation and other political parties and organisations of India, 17 in all, in an appeal said that if the present South Korean authorities truly want reunification, they must accept the five-point policy unconditionally and approach dialogue with sincere attitude. \r\n   Rakotomandimby Selestine, national chairman of the Socialist Progressive Party of Madagascar, in a press statement said that all the political parties, public organisations and the people loving the nation as well as the rulers in South Korea should immediately accept the fair and aboveboard, patriotic program for great national unity, the program for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.     \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities should not take road of self-destruction\r\n Pyongyang, May 10 (KCNA) -- Recently the war-thirsty military of South Korea called a \"meeting of major commanding officers of the whole army\", one more anti-DPRK campaign.\r\n   At the meeting, the first of its kind after the appearance of the new \"government\" the warmaniacs said \"The system of North Korea has reached the limit of its maintenance\", that \"Unexpected action may be done\" and that they would show \"determined response to provocations\" by North Korea, inciting war fever.\r\n   This proves that the brasshats of the self-styled \"government for the people\" are bellicose elements who put their predecessors of the \"civilian-veiled government\" to shame and that \"reconciliation and cooperation\" and \"dialogue\" advertised by the incumbent \"government\" authorities are all a sheer lie.\r\n   The warmaniacs under the \"civilian\" veil stepped up war preparations against  North Korea, regarding the fellow countrymen as the enemy, bringing the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war. It was owing to our peace-loving and patient efforts that the frantic anti-DPRK campaign did not lead to a fratricidal war.\r\n   We, therefore, repeatedly urged the present \"government\" of South Korea to stop pursuing such a dangerous policy of war pursued by the \"civilian\"-veiled rulers and go to detente.\r\n   The present \"government\" authorities still refuse to stop anti-DPRK campaign that led their predecessors to a miserable end. In actuality, the most notorious die-hard anti-communists and warmaniacs of the present \"government\", including \"the Minister of National Defence,\" \"the Minister of National Unification,\" and \"the Director of the National Information Agency\" stage anti-DPRK military manoeuvres almost everyday. The frantic racket is surpassing that of the \"civilian\"-veiled \"government\" authorities in terms of size and viciousness.\r\n   All this eloquently proves that there is nothing to expect from the self-styled \"government for the people.\"\r\n   The present rulers of South Korea should know that for them to follow in the footsteps of the \"civilian\"-veiled warmaniacs leads to their self-destruction and that they will get nothing but a stern judgement by history and the nation.\r\n   They should be held responsible entirely for the grave consequences of the adventurous war racket and policy of confrontation against the fellow countrymen.    \r\n \r\n"

This reveals their aim to legitimate their active cooperation in U.S. military operations and launch military action in any part of Asia at any moment.\r\n   To this end, they also plan to define the Korean peninsula and other wide areas of Asia and open seas as zone under their \"protection\" and legitimate the operations of \"Self-Defence Forces\" in these areas for the sake of \"Japanese interests.\"\r\n   They intend to set out on overseas aggression overtly on the pretext of \"crisis near Japan.\" the first target is the Korean peninsula.\r\n   In the past, Japanese imperialism invaded Korea and other Asian countries and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes and disasters on people in those countries.\r\n   The aggressive, predatory and savage nature of Japanese militarists remains unchanged.\r\n   When Japan's move for reinvasion is tolerated, the Asian people will suffer greater misfortunes and calamities than they did in the past.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries continue taking the line of overseas aggression, they will get nothing but destruction.\r\n \r\n\r\n"
