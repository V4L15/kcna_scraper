It successfully launched satellite Kwangmyongsong-2 by rocket carrier Unha-2 into the space on April 5, 2009 after going through the procedures concerning international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies, by abusing the UN Security Council, took issue with the DPRK's peaceful satellite launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Members of the U.S. House of Representatives recently submitted a bill banning the DPRK, China and some other countries from launching satellites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is aimed to bar the sovereign countries from making legitimate advance into space, and monopolize it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has long spurred the scenario for converting the space into the theatre of a war for realizing its strategy for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It openly disclosed its ambition for monopolizing the space in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the September 11 incident, the U.S. announced a \"war on terrorism\" and began advocating new \"space military principle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On December 13, 2001 the then U.S. President Bush announced its unilateral withdrawal from the 1972 ABM treaty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since then it has opted for removing stumbling blocks in the way of developing space weapons and buckled down to putting its scenario for a space war into practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After officially formulating space monopolization as its national policy, the U.S. unhesitatingly put into practice its strategy for putting the world under its control with the use of space.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In October 2006 the U.S. made public \"national space policy\" to the effect that it rejects any international disarmament agreement that may deter it from making military advance into space and using it, and that it has the right to prevent those countries hurting the U.S. interests from advancing into space, if necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. actually used space technologies for fighting a \"war on terrorism\" and other aggression wars, revealing its moves for using the space for the purpose of military aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. attempt to use the space for military purposes geared to holding hegemony will harass global peace and jeopardize human existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can check the trend of the times toward the exploration of space for prosperity common to humankind and peaceful purposes."

Korea-US FTA\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\t Pyongyang, November 29 (KCNA) -- Economic experts of the DPRK are criticizing the free trade agreement (FTA) between south Korea and the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Sang Hak, a section chief of the Economic Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences, told KCNA that FTA is encountering a strong opposition from south Korean people as it is a humiliating and unequal agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea and the United States concluded FTA in June 2007.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The agreement stipulated that the United States should abolish tariffs step by step for autos imported from south Korea and the latter can limit auto imports from the former.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With U.S. auto makers disliking the agreement, it had failed to be approved by U.S. Congress. The United States demanded renegotiations and south Korea accepted the demand in December 3 last year. The two sides amended the auto trade part of FTA and signed it again in February.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The amended agreement stipulates that high tariffs should be kept in years for south Korean autos and even though the tariffs are eliminated, the United States can levy a custom duty on them again any time by invoking emergency import curbs.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, south Korea should halve customs for U.S.-made autos as soon as the agreement goes into effect and eliminate them after four years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Viewed from international law and practice, it is uncommon to amend what two sides agreed already. But the humiliating agreement came into being due to the U.S. arrogance and shamelessness and the south Korean pro-U.S. sycophantic and treacherous policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t FTA serves as an indication of the relationship between the metropolitan state and colony and between the master and servant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Generally speaking, a free trade agreement calls for abolishing all tariffs and nontariff barriers and ensuring free transfer of goods and capital. It is clear to everyone who will be the victim in case south Korea, much smaller than the United States in the economic scope and dependent on the latter in capital and technology, concludes such an agreement with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unequal agreement has seven mandatory articles for the U.S. but 55 mandatory articles for south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwang Nam, another section chief of the same institute, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The humiliating and unequal agreement was rattled through the south Korean \"National Assembly\" to become effective next year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the agreement comes into effect, the south Korean economy will be fully subordinate to the U.S. economy, inviting a serious result.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The biggest victim will be south Korea's agriculture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to south Korea's Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, Fisheries and Foodstuffs, south Korean agricultural and fishing domains will suffer a loss of more than 12 trillion won in 15 years. Of the figure, more than 7 trillion won loss will go to the stockbreeding domain. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people term FTA a \"coercive agreement maximizing the U.S. interests\" and \"second Ulsa five-point treaty\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the conclusion of FTA the Lee Myung Bak conservative regime has sold out the dignity and interests of the south Korean people to the United States."

            "content": "ACNC revela ambicion de EE.UU. de apoderarse del cosmos\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 29 de noviembre (ACNC) -- La Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea (ACNC) hizo publica el dia 28 la carta blanca intitulada \"El cosmos es la riqueza comun de la humanidad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota aclara la tendencia mundial al desarrollo cosmico y pone al desnudo la ambicion de Estados Unidos de apoderarse del universo para tomar la supremacia mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl cosmos es la riqueza comun de la humanidad, senala la nota y continua: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl avance al vasto espacio universal, que sirve de fuerza motriz del desarrollo de la ciencia, la tecnica y la economia del futuro, es la meta estrategica de varios paises y naciones del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tecnologia universal se desarrolla vertiginosamente en varios dominios incluso la comunicacion, la salud publica, el mejoramiento de variedades y la energia, cuyos exitos abren la perspectiva favorable a aprovechar eficientemente el cosmos para la civilizacion y el desarrollo de toda la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Alcanza un desarrollo rapido una nueva rama economica llamada la economia universal, que abarca los servicios y los productos de toda indole que se producen en las actividades espaciales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos se activa la competencia entre los paises para la explotacion del cosmos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo el ano pasado entraron 118 aparatos espaciales en la orbita de la Tierra gracias al lanzamiento de los cohetes transportadores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa competencia mundial de explotacion del cosmos se hace mas renida, porque hasta los paises en vias de desarrollo se incorporan activamente a las actividades para conquistar el cosmos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Republica Popular Democratica de Corea ingreso al Tratado Espacial y al Convenio sobre Registro de Objetos Lanzados en el Espacio Universal. Y al seguir el orden internacional, lanzo con exito el 5 de abril de 2009 el satelite artificial \"Kwangmyongsong no. 2\" mediante el cohete transportador \"Unha-2\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. y sus fuerzas satelites acusaron atrevidamente a la RPDC del lanzamiento de este satelite con fines pacificos abusando del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos miembros de la camara de representantes de EE.UU. sometieron a la consideracion de esta un proyecto de ley sobre la prohibicion del lanzamiento de satelites artificiales de algunos paises incluso a la RPDC y China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto parte de la ambicion de bloquear  el uso legitimo de los Estados soberanos al espacio universal y monopolizar el cosmos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde hace mucho tiempo, EE.UU. vino acelerando la militarizacion espacial para utilizar el espacio universal como un campo de guerra favorable a la realizacion de su estrategia de tomar la supremacia mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el nuevo siglo, EE.UU. revela mas abiertamente su ambicion monopolista sobre el cosmos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del incidente del 11 de septiembre, el imperio declaro la guerra \"antiterrorista\" y preconizo un nuevo \"principio militar universal\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 13 de diciembre de 2001, el presidente estadounidense de aquel entonces, Bush, declaro la retirada unilateral de su pais del Tratado sobre Misiles Antibalisticos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, EE.UU. elimino los aparatos que frenaban el desarrollo de armas espaciales e impulso activamente la realizacion del plan de guerra cosmica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. fijo oficialmente el uso monopolista del cosmos como su politica estatal y puso en practica la estrategia de supremacia mundial mediante el espacio universal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn octubre de 2006 EE.UU. hizo publica la \"politica estatal sobre el cosmos\", segun la cual EE.UU. se opone a todos los acuerdos de desarme internacionales que prohiban el avance militar y el uso del pais sobre el espacio universal y tiene el derecho a frenar la salida al universo de un pais hostil a intereses de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe veras, el imperio utiliza la tecnologia espacial a la guerra de agresion como la \"guerra antiterrorista\". De esta manera, revelo claramente su designio agresivo de militarizar el cosmos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa intencion de militarizar el cosmos y aprovecharlo al proposito dominacionista es un crimen que pone en peligro la paz del mundo y la subsistencia de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon nada puede detener la corriente de la epoca contra la militarizacion espacial y hacia el desarrollo pacifico del cosmos por la prosperidad comun de la humanidad."

Esto es la decision de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los enemigos se atreven a manchar nuestra dignidad y disparar, aunque sea una bala y una bomba, hacia el sagrado mar, el cielo y la tierra jurisdiccionales de nuestra parte, la isla Yonphyong sera convertida en un mar de fuego y sus llamas se extenderan a Chongwadae (casa azul) y hasta el nido de la banda de traidores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie en este mundo puede quebrantar la unidad monolitica del ejercito y el pueblo en torno a la Direccion de la Revolucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea deben registrar los asaltos en todos los campos de gran auge con el invencible coraje y el impetu de aniquilar a los enemigos, siguiendo el auge de produccion en la provincia de Hamgyong del Sur."
