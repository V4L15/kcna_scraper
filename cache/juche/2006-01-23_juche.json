The sovereignty of the nation and its reunification are guaranteed only when all the Koreans deeply cherish their national responsibility and their mission for the times and make the nation-first spirit of attaching importance to the nation and hot wind for reunification prevail throughout the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three-point patriotic movement is the motive force of the struggle to defend the peace of the country and the security of the nation.\r\n The most dangerous force harassing peace on the Korean Peninsula at present is the United States. The U.S. imperialists are violators of world peace as well as vicious harassers of peace of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even at this moment the U.S. is working hard to provoke a new war while engaging itself in the anti-DPRK campaign to hamper the independent reunification of the Korean nation and dominate the whole of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strength to foil their moves for aggression, defend peace and pave the way for reunification lies in the patriotic movement for peace against war.\r\n  The movement also puts great spurs to the drive for great national unity for the dignity and prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Only when the Koreans conduct a vigorous patriotic movement for great national unity in high spirit along the road indicated by the June 15 era of reunification, can they open up a bright future for reunification and prosperity along the track of the harmony and great unity of the nation.\r\n Great national unity constitutes a fundamental factor of wonderful successes made in the movement for national reunification and in the improvement of the inter-Korean relations in the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will surely make big achievements in the movement for national reunification when it advances holding high the torch of the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nobody can block the powerful advance of the movement for independent reunification by the ardent patriotic enthusiasm and positive struggle of the Korean nation aspiring after reunification. \r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the historic June 15 joint declaration, the strong idea of national independence based on the great principle of Juche, clearly indicates the correct way of hewing out the destiny of the Korean nation, remarkably increases its members' consciousness of independence and national character and correctly leads them to the struggle for independent reunification and national unity.\r\n The movement for independent reunification, the main trend of the June 15 era of reunification, is a patriotic cause of the Korean nation successfully advancing amidst the ardent patriotic zeal and positive struggle of all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The movement for reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification advancing in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and under its banner is evoking the positive support and sympathy of all Koreans and putting their patriotic zeal and strength into gear. If the Koreans join hands with each other and pool their strength and wisdom, they will have nothing impossible to do and no force can match them. Nothing can block the strong trend of national history in which all the Koreans go along the road of independent reunification, pooling their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the publication of the joint declaration the struggle of the Korean nation for independent reunification has vigorously advanced despite the vicious obstruction moves of the foreign forces and the anti-reunification forces. This reality vividly proves the invincibility and vitality of the cause of independent reunification which is advancing under the banner of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the anachronistic moves of the U.S. and its followers against the Korean nation and the trend of the times are getting more frantic, the Korean nation will vigorously advance along the road of independent reunification, meeting challenges of history with one desire and one will.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
