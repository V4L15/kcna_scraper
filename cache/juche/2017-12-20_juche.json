            "content": "U.S. Purpose in Pushing Forward \"Biological Weapons Development Program\" Disclosed\r\nPyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- The Director of Press of the Institute for American Studies (IFAS), Ministry of Foreign Affairs, DPRK made public the following statement on Wednesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Some U.S. media and experts are now groundlessly claiming that the DPRK is pushing forward with so-called \"biological weapons development program\" as a part of the \"wild ambition for developing the WMD\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Properly speaking, it is the U.S. stereotyped method to cook up untruths as truths, stubbornly insisting that black is white and fabricating anything for satisfying their aggressive greed. And the U.S. itself is an empire of evils full of plots, fabrications, lies and deceptions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. that conducts military aggressions and cruise missile attacks on sovereign states in broad daylight while faking up \"possession of WMD\" and \"use of chemical weapons\" of those countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the U.S., chattering on \"morality\" and \"civilization\", the criminal state that massacred the Korean people by bacteriological weapons during the Korean War and inflict sufferings upon the innocent people by continuing even now to openly use the internationally prohibited weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The barbarous bacteriological atrocities perpetrated by the U.S. imperialist beasts during the Korean War still stand in relief in our people's memories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And they are also the American politicians and the white supremacists making conceived attempts for state terrorism and racial extinction through overt research and development of the biological weapons in the worldwide-scattered U.S. laboratories.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the shameless deed that these criminals are finding fault with us while turning black into white by talking nonsense of the DPRK's \"biological weapons development program\". This is nothing but a manifestation of heinous intention to condemn our dignified state as a \"rogue one\" with the purpose to internationally isolate our highly dignified state and to justify the U.S. sanctions and pressure on the DPRK. This is also the manifestation of a pursuit for excuse to provoke nuclear war on the Korean peninsula at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, as a state party to the BWC, maintains its consistent stand to oppose development, manufacture, stockpiling and possession of biological weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more the U.S. clings to the anti-DPRK stifling move, in such a manner as a thief shouting to stop thief, by denouncing us as a state of \"developing the biological weapons\", the more hardened the determination of our entire military personnel and people to take revenge will be and the earlier the days of destruction of the U.S., an empire of evils will come."

Thereby violence serves as the basic mean and common life mode to maintain the army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation of servicewomen in the puppet army is more miserable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights issue of south Korea can never be solved as long as the U.S. colonial domination and occupation exist and the puppet authorities' pro-U.S. sycophancy and policy of confrontation with the compatriots and unpopular rule continue in south Korea."

            "content": "Japan's Reinvasion Ambition May Lead It to Ruin: KCNA Commentary\r\nPyongyang, December 20 (KCNA) -- Japan Prime Minister Abe at the recent budget committee of the House of Councilors voiced his opinion to refer the existence of \"Self-defence Forces\" to article 9 of constitution and tolerate the exercise of the right to \"collective self-defence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t This full-fledged revelation of the Japanese reactionaries to revive militarism constitutes a serious threat to the peace in the region and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The military fanatics' ambition for reinvasion has now reached the phase which can no longer be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe who set it as a goal to make Japan a \"country capable of fighting a war\" away from the postwar system which binds the country, has gone crafty enough to use such leverage as the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2013 Japan adopted \"state security strategy\" as the first thing in Japan's political history and called for making \"more active contribution\" to peace and stability of the international community based on positive pacifism, thereby shaping a legal framework for theoretically supporting the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In April 2015, it revised the \"U.S.-Japan defence cooperation guidelines\" which designated the distribution of cooperation and roles concerning the operation, information and logistic support for the U.S. forces and \"Self-defence Forces\" in case of emergency after the lapse of 18 years, thereby expanding the scope of overseas military operation of the SDF to all directions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In September 2015 Japan packaged eleven security bills for legally supporting the \"U.S.-Japan defence cooperation guidelines\" to adopt a \"law on security\" and put it into official effect from March 29, 2016.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly the SDF was invested with the right to conduct military operational duty in any area of the world under the pretext of the exercise of \"right to collective self-defence\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What left to be done by the Japanese reactionary ruling forces who are pursuing overseas aggression now is to retrogressively revise the \"pacifist constitution\" and secure \"validity\" and \"legitimacy\" of the moves for becoming a military giant and launching overseas aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A foreign media expressed concerns long ago that \"the issue of collective self-defence is just an appetizer for the main course of constitutional revision for Abe\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At an event marking the 70th anniversary of the enforcement of constitution of Japan Abe said \"the present constitution has to be modified as the security environment has undergone a change due to the north's nuclear and missile development\". It is clear that this was aimed to create a pretext for constitutional revision and create an excuse for overseas advance of the SDF.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The wild act of the Japanese right-wing forces led by Abe is leading the Japanese archipelago to the danger line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To look back on history, all Japan's aggression attempts at Korean peninsula and the Asian continent ended in bitter defeat and left wound that is hardly healable even to the Japanese people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has to draw a serious lesson from its past history of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the present ruling quarters of Japan follow in the footsteps of the predecessors, not waking up from the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\", they will only face final ruin."

En cuanto a la exigencia de liberar a los presos de conciencia, dijeron absurdamente que no pueden \"hacerlo para el congraciamiento\" y \"si lo hacen, los conservadores pueden exigir tambien la libertad de Park Geun-hye\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, continuan permaneciendo tras las rejas el parlamentario por el ex Partido Progresista Unido, encarcelado injustamente por el \"poder\" de Park Geun-hye, el presidente de la Confederacion de Sindicatos Surcoreanos (CSS) y otros presos de conciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa oleada de confrontacion fratricida, que azota el Sur de Corea, es acompanada de la violacion flagrante de derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando las autoridades fingian traer nuevo cambio en la mejora de relaciones intercoreanas, las entidades progresistas, incluso el Consejo del Movimiento de Familiares por la Democratizacion, exigieron a aquellas la devolucion inmediata de Kim Ryon Hui y las empleadas norcoreanas, victimas de la politica de confrontacion del \"poder\" conservador surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllas apuntaron que la devolucion es la tarea que debe resolver primero el actual \"gobierno\" para lograr la reconciliacion y unidad de la nacion y recuperar los DDHH y la democracia perdidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el Ministerio de Unificacion insulto a Kim Ryon Hui diciendo que ella \"demanda de mala gana el regreso por la preocupacion sobre sus familiares en el Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY en cuanto a las empleadas raptadas envio sin escrupulos a las entidades civiles y sociales la opinion escrita describiendo el secuestro como la \"fuga voluntaria del Norte\". E insatisfecho con esto, trazo el nuevo complot de \"boda\" para asentarlas en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, las autoridades surcoreanas pisotean despiadadamente la aspiracion de la poblacion surcoreana a la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales, la paz y la reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl pronosticar el fin tragico en la lucha masiva con velas encendidas, la banda conservadora reprimio, en virtud de la infame \"ley de seguridad\", a los habitantes de diferentes estratos que aspiraban a la justicia y demandaban la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas, tildandolos de \"izquierdistas pro-Norte y fuerzas subordinadas al Norte\" a fin de salir de la crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas indignante para la poblacion surcoreana es que tales crimenes fascistas se cometen ininterrumpidamente aun despues de la sustitucion del \"poder\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe puede decir que el ejercito surcoreano, el mercenario colonial de EE.UU., es el teatro de los casos de violacion de derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOcurren sucesivamente las perdidas humanas debido a los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC y se incrementan los oficiales y soldados que suplican el retiro del ejercito pretextando la enfermedad psiquica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el ejercito titere predomina la cultura de cuartel al estilo yanqui que considera la barbaridad como el mejor temperamento del militar. Por consiguiente, la violencia se hace el modo de vida ordinaria y el medio principal para mantener el ejercito.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs mas miserable la situacion de las muchachas en el servicio militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema de derechos humanos en el Sur de Corea no puede ser resuelto nunca, mientras persistan la dominacion y ocupacion coloniales por parte de EE.UU. y continuen el servilismo proyanqui y las politicas fratricidas y antipopulares de la banda titere."
