And the \"Minister of National Defence\" at a \"meeting of leading army officers\" whipped up war hysteria by calling for strengthened \"military posture.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the \"Ministry of National Unification\" supposed to specially handle the reunification issue in South Korea conducted an opinion poll in a foolish bid to build up public opinion critical of the DPRK's political system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the \"Unification and Foreign Affairs and Trade Committee of the South Korean National Assembly\" orchestrated such a provocative anti-north political drama as \"adoption of a resolution urging the repatriation of POWs of 'ROK' Army and those kidnapped by the north.\" And some right-wing conservative media including \"Chosun Ilbo\" are chiming in with its smear campaign to fan up inter-Korean confrontation. They floated sheer lies about \"political propaganda\" of the north and \"detention\" of a journalist of \"Chosun Ilbo\" in an attempt to pull up the north over the reunion of the second visiting group of separated families and relatives. All this is part of their moves to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad and agitate confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the happenings in South Korea are anti-national and anti-reunification moves to dampen the desire of the entire nation for reconciliation, cooperation and unity between the north and south and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Facts go to prove that all these anti-north rackets in South Korea are the deliberate and premeditated moves of those who are displeased with the improving inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities should feel responsible for driving the inter-Korean relations to the phase of confrontation and stop such behaviour detrimental to the implementation of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should resolutely eliminate such anti-national and anti-reunification elements who whip up confrontation and war hysteria and immediately withdraw the \"theory of the principal enemy,\" leftover of the old era of confrontation obstructive to the on-going process of improving the inter-Korean relations. \r\n\r\n"

This only betrays the war fever and shameless nature of the Japanese reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's undisguised moves to become a major military power and launch overseas military expansion are reminiscent of the Japanese imperialists' past frantic maneuvers for militarization and those moves are going beyond the danger line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to cogitate about the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its reckless moves for militarization and overseas aggression. \r\n\r\n"

He defined seeds, liquid manure and devotion as the basic way of doing potato farming. \r\n\r\n"
