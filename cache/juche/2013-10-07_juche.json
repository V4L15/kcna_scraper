Korea's Park Geun Hye Group \r\n Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- Now the hard-won circumstances for dialogue between the north and the south of Korea is taking reversed, due to Park Geun Hye group of south Korea keen on confrontation for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, her group announced the \"principal plan for the development of the south-north relations\", the keynote of which is to reduce the inter-Korean declarations, a milestone for Korea's reunification, into dead documents and openly advocate the confrontation of social systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They even went so far as to denounce the operation of the Kaesong Industrial Zone as someone's \"source of money making\", while checking the resumption of the tour of Mt. Kumgang. Worse still, they described the reunion of separated families and relatives from the north and the south as a fruition of their \"theory of principle\" to get on the nerve of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more surprising is that the south Korean puppet regime, together with the United States, officially confirmed and made public the \"tailored deterrence strategy\", which is aimed at preemptive nuclear strike at the north.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pak Yong Gol, a company commander of the Worker-Peasant Red Guards from Phyongchon District, Pyongyang, told KCNA:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Generosity does not work with Park Geun Hye and her group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt has been revealed that they have no will to have dialogues with the north from the start of their assumption of power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeadly punishment should be brought down upon such a kind of traitors.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Han Chol, a platoon leader of the guards, said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"It is evident that Park Geun Hye is the worst traitor to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNothing will come out from such a devil without the policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ryu Kil Nam, a Pyongyang citizen, said,\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"I feel hatred for the group of Park Geun Hye as they introduced a U.S. nuclear-powered carrier into south Korea to overpower the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is fully prepared both for dialogue and war.\""
