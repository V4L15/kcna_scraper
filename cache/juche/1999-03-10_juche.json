            "content": "Rajin Granite Quarry commissioned\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The Rajin Granite Quarry situated at the foot of Suchae Peak in Rajin in North Korea started operation in September last year. Its main products include gravel of various sizes and various kinds of flat stones needed in the construction of public buildings and dwellings.   The quarry is furnished with modern stone-processing facilities, crushers and is staffed with skilled workers.   It also produces high-quality flat stones with decorative patterns to be used in floors, steps, walls, and ground mark stones, and other processed stones of various purposes.   The processed stones for decorative use patterned with various animals and plants as tiger and magnolia find special favorites among the people for their elaborate designs.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The crushing and screening grounds with a production capacity of 150,000 cubic metres a year are in a position to mass-produce gravel to be used in construction work.   Within a few months since its inauguration, it produced 10,000 cubic metres of aggregates.   This year a new oxygen- or hydrogen-fueled drilling method instead of rock drill will be introduced and large-sized crushing and processing facilities applied to double the output.   As a long-term plan, a wharf will be built off the shore of the quarry to increase export.   \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Building of  self-supporting  powerful nation called for\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 10 (KCNA) -- The Korean people are building a powerful country by their own efforts, says Rodong Sinmun March 9 in a signed article.   A powerful country of the era should be built on the basis of self-reliance, the article says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Ours is a powerful socialist nation which is being built by the Korean people's high level of ideological consciousness and revolutionary faith that they should shape their own destiny by themselves.    The revolutionary faith is the motive power which turns adversity into favourable conditions, misfortune into a blessing.    It is an ideological source of astounding miracles.    It is the Korean people's fixed will to build a powerful socialist nation their own way, not turning to others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The Korean people have keenly realized in practice that they are sure to win only when they rely on their own efforts, guided by the spirit of independence.  Hence they turn out as one in the building of the powerful nation based on self-reliance, with faith and optimism.   Ours is a powerful nation  which is being built on the solid foundations laid by the Korean people at the cost of blood and sweat.    The might of monolithic unity, solid foundations of the independent national economy, fast developing science and technology and rich natural resources are all which make it possible to build a powerful nation in the spirit of self-reliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere is nothing foreign-made in economic aspects of Korea, including heavy and light industries, but its economy has inexhaustible potential to make anything once people are determined to do.    The building of a powerful nation is guaranteed by its own military strength.  The Korean People's Army is ready to be the first line guards in devotedly defending the leader. It is strong enough to defeat any aggressors at one stroke and drive them out of this planet.   The Korean people can build a powerful socialist nation entirely because they are under the ever-victorious leadership of the respected Kim Jong Il.  \r\n\r\n"

In the last one year, the self-proclaimed \"government for the people\" in South Korea pretended to do something for the workers with outcries about \"labor-management-government negotiating system\" and \"sharing of suffering,\" but it has only sacrificed the people's interests, gratified greedy ambitions of outside forces and  worked hard to maintain its power, the news analyst of the paper says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   Now the South Korean workers are suffering from massive unemployment, extreme destitution,  family breakup and reduced wage caused by the lay-off system and \"restructuring\" being pushed ahead with by the present chief executive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is quite natural that South Korean workers,  unable to endure their sufferings,  have turned out in the struggle against the \"government\" and for vital rights.   The South Korean people will certainly win in their struggle to build an independent and democratic society where popular masses enjoy  a worthy life as masters. \r\n \r\n"

The Italian magazine \"Biritti Umani\" says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean authority's inhumane treatment of the unconverted long-term prisoners runs counter to the Geneva convention and Hague convention on repatriation of POWs and international covenant on human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Arab People's Solidarity Committee for Supporting the Struggle of the National Democratic Front of South Korea and the South Korean people in a protest letter to the South Korean authorities noted that whether the present South Korean authorities return the unconverted long-term prisoners or not was a touchstone showing whether they have a will for national reconciliation and unity or not.   The Pan American Solidarity Committee for Supporting the Struggle of the National Democratic Front of South Korea and the South Korean people in a statement denounced the South Korean authorities for violating basic human rights and strongly called for early repatriation of those who had been taken prisoner in the last Korean War to the Democratic People's Republic  of Korea as required by international norms.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Guyana-Korea Friendship Association, the Guyana Labor Union and the Guyana Agricultural Workers Union in a joint letter sent to the U.S. President demanded that the U.S., a belligerent party in the Korean War, pay attention to the fact that the unconverted long-term prisoners have not yet been repatriated and press the South Korean authorities into solving the repatriation issue.    Martin Reucer, chairman of the Swiss Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, in a protest letter to the South Korean chief executive called for return of the unconverted long-term prisoners to the DPRK, repeal of the \"National Security Law\" and release of all political Prisoners.  \r\n\r\n"

The author of the article says in the North Korea all the people, rallied close around Marshal Kim Jong Il, devotedly work for the building of a powerful socialist nation, overwhelmed with joy and optimism, which he attributes to the politics of love for and trust in the people, benevolent politics, carried out by President Kim Il Sung and the Marshal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He further says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Marshal is a great statesman revered by humankind and a savior of the Korean nation, who regards the Juche idea as the political idea and carries out an independent politics.   What makes the earth turn round is the Juche idea, the Guiding idea of independent politics. The idea spreads quickly across the length and breadth of the world, dominates the age and leads the ideological and moral transformation of humanity and worldwide revolution now in progress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK won in nuclear confrontation with the United States and the U.S. President sent a message of assurances to the Marshal in the long run. The credit for it goes to the ever victorious independent politics.    Traitors to the nation swagger and Yankees lord it over in South Korea plagued with flunkeyism and treachery because there is no leader who can defend the sovereignty of the nation.    The independent politics demonstrates its increasing viability despite the continued economic blockade against the north by the western world and serious natural disasters. It arouses all the people to the building of an economically powerful country. It is a banner of victory leading Korea to a bright future.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The absolute worship for the Marshal of the people in the North Korea is a manifestation of trust in the independent politics. That is a source of signal successes in the revolution and construction.   Complete abolition of taxation, free health care, universal compulsory 11-year education, free education, stable jobs for the people are also attributable to the independent politics. Those measures adopted for the good of the people are inconceivable under the \"free democratic system.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The independent politics is just Kim Jong Il's ever-victorious politics that has proved its tremendous vitality. This politics which makes the people masters of politics and serves the people is, indeed, the life and soul of Korea and a model of independent politics. \r\n  \r\n"
