            "content": "S. Korean Puppets Accused of Working on \"Unification Constitution\"\r\n Pyongyang, February 17 (KCNA) -- The conservative ruling forces in south Korea are making arrangements to institute what they called \"unification constitution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative ruling forces are now peddling the theory of \"the unification of systems\" veiled with the words \"national community\" quite contrary to the trend of the June 15 era of reunification though it had been thrown into the dumping ground of history long ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Puppet Prime Minister Jong Un Chan asserted that after the country's unification the idea and form of the state should be based on liberal democracy and market economy, thus betraying his black-hearted intention to work hard for putting the north under \"liberal democracy\" of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"proposal for the unification of the national community\" is nothing but a scenario seeking confrontation of systems aimed to do harm to fellow countrymen and a war scenario. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is unpardonable act of treachery designed to impose confrontation of systems and a nuclear disaster upon the fellow countrymen aspiring after the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Just as a family on the verge of ruin is ridden with dispute, south Korea is torn with everyday scramble. The reckless acts of the conservative group to do harm to the DPRK's system cannot be interpreted otherwise than a hysteric fit. The above-said racket kicked up by the group will only bring the consequences of getting their stronghold blown up. Then it will be too late for the group to regret for it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative forces of south Korea had better awaken from the nightmare of achieving \"unification under liberal democracy\"."
