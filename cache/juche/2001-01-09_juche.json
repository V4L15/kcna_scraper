The Japanese reactionaries have been keen on the moves for reinvasion under the absurd pretexts of the DPRK's \"nuclear and missile threat\" and \"case of unidentified ship\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear that they are going to intensify their adventurous military maneuvers for overseas invasion in the new century, too, under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are getting more frantic in their moves to stifle the DPRK from the outset of the year, going against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, this is an anachronistic daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their intention to stifle the DPRK in collusion with others is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's overseas expansion will lead to destruction.    \r\n\r\n"

Railway workers are now successfully carrying out their tasks for urgent transport by well organizing the operation of trains and duties of crew. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Agricultural workers have also turned out as one to get ready for this year's farming in the same spirit as displayed by people of Taehongdan. They are now producing a large quantity of compost to raise the fertility of farmland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Innovations are also reported from Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway project and land realignment project in South Hwanghae Province.    \r\n\r\n"

This resolute decision can be made only by him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea's reality clearly proves the historic truth that a country shines and national dignity grows stronger only under a brilliant commander with great political mode and ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only a great man, who thinks of the country and the people and human cause of independence day and night, is able to create a miracle of history and changes of the century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In Korea the arable land of Kangwon and north Phyongan provinces was realigned into standardized fields, a large saltern made its appearance on the east coast and hydroelectric power stations, fish farms and a number of monumental edifices were built in different parts of the country in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world people were struck with admiration at the fact that after the Pyongyang summit arranged by the firm will and patriotic decision of Kim Jong Il for reunification the north-south joint declaration was adopted and is being implemented amid the great interest and support of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cheers in celebrations of the 55th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers' Party of Korea were those of victory and glory which solemnly and brilliantly decorated the prelude of the 21st century as well as the end of the 20th century.    \r\n\r\n"
