Its envoys told the north side that candidate Ri Hoe Chang was sure \"to be elected president,\" predicting his election as president an established fact. They also requested the north side to support candidate Ri Hoe Chang as the \"Ri's Government\" has a plan to \"aid the north in a big way\" without limit to items and scale, to say nothing of giving larger financial aid than the DJ \"Government\" does if the north side meets its request. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In mid-December last year, a crucial time when the \"presidential election\" was near at hand, the GNP sent another secret envoy to the north carrying with him a \"confidential message\" in which it requested the north to help the \"Ri's Government\" emerge as Roh Moo Hyun is radical and inexperienced in the state administration and the international relations and so it is the right way for the country and the nation to enable candidate Ri who has 5-odd-year-long political experience as president of the GNP to administer the country and serve the people. Ri said that he was sending his message of cooperation to the north side in the spirit of crossing himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri personally got in touch with foreign governments and parliaments on three occasions in July and October last year in the run-up to the \"presidential election\" and asked them to transmit to the north his words requesting it to cooperate with him without misunderstanding as his criticism of Kim Dae Jung's \"sunshine policy\" was aimed to win the election, not prompted by his bitterness towards the north. He requested them to convey to the north his intention to change his present stand once he takes office, saying he is not a dangerous and bad man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On every occasion the north side told the GNP that it should refrain from inciting the inter-Korean confrontation and driving the situation to the brink of war, and it would be well advised not to add to the crimes committed against the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should not act like an ostrich with its head in the sand but stop the futile anti-north racket and probe the truth by itself.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
