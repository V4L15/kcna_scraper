This map also marks the sea claimed by Japan as \"Korean Sea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a lot of old maps published in Japan and Europe show, the marking of the \"Sea of Japan\" denotes waters east of Honshu, Shikoku and Kyushu of Japan, in other words, waters towards the Pacific, east of Japanese archipelago only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marking the East Sea of Korea as the \"Sea of Japan\" was a product of the Japanese imperialists' policy of colonial rule over Korea in the last century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After occupying Korea by force of arms, the Japanese imperialists registered Korean sea as the \"Sea of Japan\" in the IHO in 1929 by taking advantage of its position as a suzerain state, paving the way for unreasonably marking the sea in the international hydrographic chart.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists' aggression against Korea was illegal and all premises for brigandish designation of the \"Sea of Japan\" were removed along with their defeat. Therefore, the said designation should have been abrogated at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's above-said claim is no more than sheer sophism in the light of the present international practice and principles governing the marking of the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is international practice to mark a sea according to its geographical situation with a continent as a standard and designate a sea according to the names of the peninsula and the country on it in case of the sea between a peninsula and islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are persistently insisting on the designation of the \"Sea of Japan.\" This is prompted by their ulterior design to justify the hideous crimes perpetrated by the Japanese imperialists in Korea in the last century, stage a comeback to Korea and, for the present, grab the East Sea of Korea and Tok Islets in its territorial waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's pronounced assertion for the designation of the \"Sea of Japan\" and moves to seizure Tok Islets are calling back the departed soul of the Japanese imperialists, robbers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's bid to repeat the Japanese imperialists' blood-stained history of aggression which brought so horrible disasters and misfortune to the peoples in Korea and other Asian countries is bound to go bust in face of bitterer rebuff and denunciation by all Koreans and the international community."

            "content": "ACNC comenta frustrado intento de Japon en cuanto al Mar Este de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 7 de mayo (ACNC) -- En la reciente asamblea general de la Organizacion Internacional Hidrografica, quedaron frustradas las tentativas de Japon de anotar exclusivamente el Mar Este de Corea como \"Mar de Japon\".\n\t\t\t\t\tHa sido desaprobada tambien su iniciativa de elaborar un proyecto de enmienda en base al atlas de rutas maritimas internacionales en que el Mar Este de Corea aparece con el unico nombre de \"Mar de Japon\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal insistencia de Japon viola el principio historicista y tergiversa cinicamente los hechos historicos demostrando su cada dia mas abierta ambicion militarista de retomar el camino de agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que en el pasado, el Mar Este de Corea sigue siendo el sagrado de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos antecesores coreanos, forjadores de su larga historia de 5 milenios, descubrieron el Mar Este de Corea ya en la edad antigua, o sea, mucho antes de que se fundara Japon en el archipielago japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos fueron precursores tambien en denominarlo como \"Mar de Corea\" y \"Mar Este de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta verdad esta registrada clara y patentemente en los libros historicos de Corea, inclusive \"Historia de los Tres Reinos\", y en la lapida del Mausoleo del rey Kwanggaetho construido en el ano 414.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien en los libros y mapas antiguos publicados por los expedicionarios y geografos de otros paises el mar en cuestion es anotado como \"Mar de Corea\" y \"Mar Este de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSucede lo mismo en el mapa dibujado en 1646 por un expedicionario y cartografo europeo, el cual ha sido descubierto nuevamente en Japon en visperas de la reunion arriba mencionada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo se ve en numerosos mapas antiguos hechos en Japon y Europa, la denominacion de \"Mar de Japon\" indica solo el mar al este de Honshu, Shikoku y Kyushu, es decir, la parte del Mar Pacifico al este del archipielago japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa denominacion es producto de la politica colonial y de ocupacion de Corea que practicaron los imperialistas japoneses en el siglo pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTras ocupar militarmente a Corea, ellos registraron el polemico mar como \"Mar de Japon\" en la Organizacion Internacional Hidrografica  aprovechando su posicion de metropoli.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde entonces, comenzo la historia de esa anotacion injusta en el atlas de rutas maritimas internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa misma agresion de Japon a Corea fue ilegal y esa anotacion debio ser cancelada ya al momento de la derrota del pais isleno en la segunda guerra mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opinion de Japon es injusta tambien si se tiene en cuenta las costumbres internacionales, segun las cuales el nombre de un mar se fija a base del nombre de la tierra firme cercana a su posicion geografica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, en el caso de un mar entre una peninsula y una isla, su nombre se anota con el nombre del pais que tenga soberania sobre esa peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, los reaccionarios japoneses insisten obstinadamente en su anotacion partiendo de su siniestro intento de justificar sus tremendos crimenes cometidos en Corea en el siglo pasado, realizar la ambicion de reagredirla y por inmediato, arrebatar el Mar Este de Corea y el islote Tok.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que hacen ellos esta resucitando el fantasma del imperialismo japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa reproduccion de la historia de agresiones del imperialismo japones, que impuso enormes desgracias y sufrimientos a los pueblos de Corea y Asia, sera repudiada y condenada cada vez mas fuerte por toda la nacion coreana y la sociedad internacional."
