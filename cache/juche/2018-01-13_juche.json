Tambien resulta un desafio a la unanime aspiracion y demanda de los nacionales y extranjeros sobre el alivio de tension y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hasta ahora, cada vez que se realizaban los dialogos y contactos entre ambas partes coreanas y se veian los indicios de mejoramiento de relaciones bilaterales, EE.UU. hizo todo lo posible para estropearlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Cuando toda Corea estaba llena del afan por la reunificacion con motivo de publicacion de la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 4 de Julio, EE.UU. instigo a las autoridades surcoreanas a \"crear dos Coreas\". Tambien es EE.UU. el que puso obstaculos cuando se mejoraban las relaciones intercoreanas despues de publicadas la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tanto ayer como hoy, no se cambia la voluntad de EE.UU. de oponerse a la reunificacion de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Esta vez tambien, EE.UU. dice que apoya el dialogo intercoreano, pero en realidad, intenta impedir la mejora de relaciones N-S introduciendo en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno sus enormes fuerzas armadas agresivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los medios de prensa y los especialistas del Sur de Corea evaluan que si se toma en cuenta la velocidad de navegacion de Carl Vinson, este portaaviones llegara a la Peninsula Coreana a finales de enero o a principios de febrero, o sea, en visperas de la apertura de Juegos Olimpicos Invernales de Phyongchang. Agregan que si se suma hasta Ronald Reagan ubicado actualmente en Japon, se concentraran de una vez 3 portaaviones nucleares en los alrededores de la Peninsula Coreana, lo cual deviene hecho muy excepcional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las fuerzas armadas de EE.UU., que se concentran cerca de la Peninsula Coreana, seran buenos blancos de caza para los artilleros \"Hwasong\" del Ejercito Popular de Corea que mantienen a su alcance de fuego la isla Guam y hasta el territorio principal de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al ver correctamente la naturaleza agresiva de EE.UU., todos los coreanos deberan luchar tenazmente contra el aumento de fuerzas armadas del imperio y su intento de desatar la guerra de agresion anti-Norte."
