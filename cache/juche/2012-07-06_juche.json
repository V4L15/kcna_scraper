This can never be a crime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the worst Lee Myung Bak group of traitors that deserves punishment because it leveled guns at the fellow countrymen mourning over the big loss to the nation and barred south Koreans of many political parties and organizations and individuals from visiting Pyongyang to express condolences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group was so disgusting as to ask the U.S. aggression forces in south Korea to let those concerned of the \"UN Command\" issue over a loudspeaker from the morning a warning to Ro Su Hui to go back from Panmunjom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group's brutal suppression of Ro admits of no excuse because it already knew that south Korean people of different circles including members of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon were awaiting Ro to welcome his return through Panmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group will never escape destruction for its thrice-cursed crimes committed against the nation."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Slams Lee Myung Bak for Seeking Military Agreement with Japan\r\nPyongyang, July 6 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Lee Myung Bak regime originally intended to handle the issue of concluding a military agreement with Japan in a flash behind closed doors. This treachery was brought to light, sparking off big pubic furor in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis has touched off prompt rebuff from political and social circles as well as media which called the push given for the conclusion a behind-the-door deal and a mockery of the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGrowing stronger are voices condemning the move as it is a military bargaining with Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe ruling party, Chongwadae (presidential office) and the \"government\" are now locked in fierce exchange of rhetoric to shuffle the blame off upon others. There broke out free-for-all among relevant departments, offices and persons even inside the prime minister's office, Defence Ministry and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe public attention is now focused on the prime mover.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is against this backdrop that the south Korean newspaper Hangyore on July 2 hit home in an editorial titled \"Public furor rises over information agreement, the President should apologize and own responsibility\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe paper said that the prime movers of the incident are Chongwadae and Lee Myung Bak, quoting a relevant official of the \"government\" as saying \"behind-the-door handling of the issue was the intention of Chongwadae.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe paper commented with irony that Lee became as dumb as an oyster even though he often minded other's business, talking about \"forces following the north\" in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Kyunghyang Daily News carried on the same day an editorial titled \"Who is responsible for absurd racket of concluding military information agreement?\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDisclosing the essence of the developments, the paper said bigger problem than the agreement itself is the Lee Myung Bak \"government's\" way of thinking of mulling assigning the defence of the peninsula to outsiders to serve the U.S. and Japan's strategic interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S., Japan and south Korea cite \"threats from the north\" as pretexts whenever an opportunity presents itself but the military cooperation among the three parties constitutes, in essence, the infrastructure of the U.S. world strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe foreign ministers and defence ministers of south Korea and the U.S. agreed on building a missile defence system in 2+2 talks in June and the idea of the Japan Maritime \"Self-Defence Force's\" Aegis deployment was examined.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prime mover who was mulling the quick passage of the agreement should own due responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs was disclosed by the south Korean media, the arch criminal of the incident is traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat matters here is what encouraged the traitor to opt to sign the military agreement which even the successive rulers of south Korea hesitated to do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCommenting on this, a National Assemblyman from the Unified Progressive Party in article titled \"Scrap military agreement meant to become stooge of \"Self-Defence Forces\" wrote that the push given for the agreement hints at the Lee regime's intention to work as a stooge for Japan's arms buildup and military moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee regime's earnest moves to tighten relations with the U.S. and Japan despite people's harsh criticism are attributable to its mistaken idea concerning the south-north relations and diplomacy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe regime does not hesitate to bedevil the south-north relations as it thinks that the theory of \"unification by absorption\" through the \"collapse of the north\" is possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean people's criticism is quite natural.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group is made up of matchless traitors steeped in sycophancy to the U.S. and Japan so much as to put the five traitors of 1905 into the shade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe issue of concluding the military agreement with Japan was taken up for discussion due to Lee's sycophancy to the U.S. and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the event of signing the agreement, the advance of Japan's \"SDF\" to the Korean Peninsula will become legal and the \"SDF\" can become a main force of aggression in and around the Korean Peninsula together with the U.S. forces in case of contingency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the very reason that the south Korean public is branding the developments as \"a reckless act of fixing wings to Japan's ambitions for reinvasion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the U.S. which egged the traitor on to conclude the agreement with Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is the very one who was behind the case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe military agreement between south Korea and Japan is, in fact, aimed to round off the U.S.-led triangular military alliance among the U.S., Japan and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe formation of the triangular military alliance would mean the establishment of NATO of Asian version serving the U.S. Asia strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is a dangerous military adventure of bringing about fresh Cold War, the dark clouds of a new world war in Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. intends to promptly knock into shape the war alliance and realize its strategy to dominate Asia at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the signing of the military agreement was postponed, a spokesman for the State Department said on July 2 that the U.S. is looking forward to the establishment of

No sooner had he crossed the demarcation line than south Korean agents pounced upon him like brutes and resorted to violence before taking him away in handcuffs. They snatched a bouquet and a Korean Peninsula flag and strangled his neck and tightly gripped his limbs like an animal before walking him away.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis barbarism stunned everybody. At the sight of this unspeakable brutality not only Koreans but also the world people shake with rage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause they know very well how warmly compatriots in the north saw off Ro Su Hui, a pro-reunification patriot. He crossed the demarcation line via Panmunjom wrapped in a hearty farewell from compatriots. But what awaited in the south was fascist rowdyism of immoral hooligans. Merciless agents of the Ministry of Unification and the Intelligence Service of south Korea bound Ro with a rope and handcuffed him before dragging him away like an animal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis monstrous atrocity was a premeditated and deliberate provocation, another indication of the Lee group's intention to stand in confrontation with the north to the last, rejecting national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRo's Pyongyang visit was a token of due courtesy prompted by the desire to share sorrow over the great loss to the nation and an entirely righteous action in view of the traditional beautiful manners and customs of the Korean nation and the spirit of national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the greatest loss to the Korean nation and bitterest sorrow that leader Kim Jong Il, father of the nation who provided the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration by realizing inter-Korean summit, the first of its kind in the history of the country's division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the South Headquarters of Pomminryon presented an application for Pyongyang visit for expressing condolences on the demise of Kim Jong Il to the Ministry of Unification of south Korea, it turned it down. This action compelled him to come to Pyongyang via a third country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the Lee Myung Bak group that deserves punishment because it leveled guns at the fellow countrymen mourning over the big loss to the nation and barred south Koreans from visiting Pyongyang to express condolences. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world knows no such worst confrontation maniacs as the Lee group which barred south Koreans from visiting the north because of their differing ideas, political views and isms and disallowed them to go back home via Panmunjom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEveryday witnesses treachery punishes patriotism and injustice wields sword at justice in south Korea owing to the Lee group's fascist rampage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet forces sentenced Rev. Han Sang Ryol to penalties after putting him to all sorts of political persecution and physical pain behind bars for nearly one year for his Pyongyang visit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey drove Rev. Kang Hui Nam, honorary chairman of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon, to a suicide. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are doing the same evils against Ro at present. What pro-reunification patriots have done, dedicating themselves to the cause of national reunification, can never be incriminated but deserves praise from all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group is the heinous and sworn enemy of the nation, with which the nation cannot live under the same sky. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group will be forced to pay a thousand-fold price for its monstrous crimes."

El presidente debe pedir disculpas y responsabilizarse del caso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCitando el testimonio de un funcionario del \"gobierno\" de que \"fue intencion de Chongwadae firmar el convenio militar con Japon a puertas cerradas\", el rotativo revelo que \"Chongwadae y Lee Myung Bak son piezas claves del caso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe burlo de Lee Myung Bak diciendo que este se mantiene callado cuando si hace falta hablar, en contra de su habito de pronunciar palabras vanas como \"fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtro rotativo surcoreano Kyunghyang Daily divulgo el mismo dia un editorial intitulado \"Escandalo del absurdo convenio de informaciones militares. ?Quien es el responsable?\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema mas grave no es el convenio sino el modo de pensar del \"gobierno\" de Lee Myung Bak de confiar a las fuerzas extranjeras la defensa de la Peninsula Coreana dejandose llevar por los intereses estrategicos de EE.UU. y Japon, opino el editorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que necesitan, Estados Unidos, Japon y el Sur de Corea presentan como pretexto la \"amenaza del Norte de Corea\", pero, la cooperacion militar tripartita constituye la infraestructura de la estrategia norteamericana sobre el mundo, revelo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mes pasado, los ministros de RR.EE. y de defensa nacional del Sur de Corea y Estados Unidos acordaron estructurar el sistema de defensa antimisiles en las conversaciones 2+2 y en el mismo contexto, se examino la ubicacion del buque Aegis de las \"fuerzas maritimas de autodefensa\" de Japon en el Mar Oeste. El autor, que intentaba aprobar apresuradamente el convenio, debe asumir la responsabilidad, insistio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo revelan los medios de prensa del Sur de Corea, el traidor Lee es el autor principal del presente incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntonces, ?por que Lee se atreve a firmar ese convenio militar con Japon, de lo que no tuvieron coraje ni sus antecesores?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, un parlamentario del Partido Progresista Unido publico su articulo \"Que anule el convenio militar que significa ofrecerse como lacayo de las 'fuerzas de autodefensa'\" que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa firma del presente convenio quiere decir que el \"gobierno\" de Lee Myung Bak esta dispuesto a servir con fidelidad para el incremento de las fuerzas armadas y las acciones militares de Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor su ideal erroneo sobre relaciones intercoreanas y la diplomacia, el \"gobierno\" de Lee procede al fortalecimiento de relaciones con EE.UU. y Japon a riesgo de las denuncias de los habitantes. Ademas, no hace caso de la quiebra de relaciones intercoreanas pensando que es posible su teoria de \"lograr la reunificacion de absorcion\" basada en el \"derrumbe del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon muy justas tales opiniones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe veras, los compinches de Lee son traidores sin precedentes en la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl planteamiento de la concertacion del convenio militar Sur de Corea-Japon es producto inevitable del servilismo proyanqui y projapones de Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn caso de que se firme el convenio, se legalizara el avance de las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" de Japon a la Peninsula Coreana. En el tiempo de emergencia, ellas devendran junto con las tropas norteamericanas el grueso de la agresion contra la Peninsula Coreana y el contorno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, los habitantes surcoreanos de diferentes sectores condenan el caso como una \"locura que alienta la ambicion de Japon de lanzar la nueva agresion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstados Unidos es el que incito al traidor Lee a concertar el convenio militar con Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto persigue la meta de perfeccionar la alianza militar tripartita entre Estados Unidos, Japon y el Sur de Corea bajo el protagonismo del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa perfeccion de la mencionada alianza sera el nacimiento de la \"OTAN\" de version asiatica segun la estrategia del imperio sobre Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa aventura militar acarrea la era de nueva guerra fria y la nueva guerra mundial a la Peninsula Coreana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando se aplazo la suscripcion del convenio militar, un vocero del Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. forzo la firma temprana declarando el dia 2 que \"espera que se establezcan las relaciones solidas en todo lo posible entre los paises aliados mas fuertes de EE.UU. en el Nordeste Asiatico\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos muestran que el presente caso es producto de la confabulacion entre prostituto politico Lee Myung Bak y sus amos norteamericano y japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee es vendepatria no. 1 capaz de convertir sin vacilacion alguna la Peninsula Coreana en el campo de pugna de las potencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tImaginense todo el territorio surcoreano convertido en chivo expiatorio de la estrategia norteamericana sobre Asia y en la mesa de juego de las potencias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Como la nacion coreana puede olvidar su pasado martirizado en que estuvo colonizada por el imperialismo japones?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nacion coreana ya sentencio a ese traidor a la pena capital politica por su crimen de tratar de reproducir esa historia de afrentas y humillacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar no perdonaran jamas a la banda de Lee."
