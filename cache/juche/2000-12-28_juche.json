            "content": "Japan's moves to draw up war constitution under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 28 (KCNA) -- Shortly ago, the greatest faction within the Japanese ruling liberal democratic party worked out a draft report calling for the revision of the present constitution to enable Japan to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence.\"\r\n The report calls for stipulating in the constitution such articles as allowing Japan to exercise the \"right to collective self-defence\" and keep troops for \"self-defence\" and designating \"emperor\" as \"head of state\" and permitting Japan to dispatch armed forces overseas to take part in joint military operations with U.S. forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today dismisses this move as a very dangerous and serious one as it laid bare the aggressive nature and ambition of Japanese militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a serious point at issue in Japan's moves to delete article 9 of its constitution whereby it painted itself as a \"pacifist state\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its \"peace constitution\" has become a cumbersome and unnecessary thing for the Japanese reactionaries now that they have become a military power through militarization and rounded off preparations for overseas aggression in a bid to realise their old dream of \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\" at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Political figures of Japan have long advocated the revision of the constitution but there has never been such a strong call for the revision of the constitution as what was made by the greatest faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party backed by the minister in charge of administrative reform of the present government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that the Japanese reactionaries' projected retrogressive revision of the constitution has become a fait accompli and they can draw up a war constitution anytime, the commentary notes, adding that the Japanese reactionaries should clearly know that the repetition of their past will lead them to self-destruction. \r\n\r\n"
