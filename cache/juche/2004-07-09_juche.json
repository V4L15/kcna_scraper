This was possible thanks to the firm military guarantee provided by the President and the invincible Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons of the KPA are now firmly determined to hold Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il in higher esteem and remain single-heartedly united around him to complete with arms the Korean revolution started by the President with arms in order to honor the pledge made before his bier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicepersons will increase the combat capability and step up the combat preparations in every way under the uplifted slogan of a-match-for-a hundred to defend as firm as an iron wall the socialist motherland of Juche, a legacy bequeathed by the President to the people, and fully prepare themselves as the army of the Party and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, robbers, are frantically stepping up the preparations for a war of aggression behind the curtain of the six-party talks in a bid to stifle the DPRK by a preemptive nuclear strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is closely watching every move of the enemy, fully prepared to fight a final death-defying battle with him, confident of sure victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists start a war in the end, the KPA will mobilize the military deterrent force built up for years and thus conclude the confrontation with the U.S. with merciless crushing blows and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Representing the unanimous resolution of all the servicepersons to hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem for all ages, Kim Il Chol solemnly declared that the KPA would invariably hold high the red flag associated with the whole life of the President and firmly guarantee the completion of the revolutionary cause of Juche with arms true to the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kyong Ho, first secretary of the Central Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, addressing the meeting on behalf of the youth, said that all the young people of the country, looking back on the proud path of victory and glory covered by the Korean youth movement under the wise leadership of Kim Il Sung, are always determined to uphold and further glorify his idea of the youth movement and his leadership exploits under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He declared that the officials of the league and the entire youth would become five million powerful bullets and bombs as they had pledged themselves before the bier of the President and stand like an invulnerable fortress and an indestructible shield around the headquarters of the revolution and protect Kim Jong Il at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The youth will become young heroes in the era of Songun who always breathe and dynamically advance in the spirit of the army at the posts defending the country and at the factories and in the rural villages, at the construction sites and in the field of scientific research and thus fully display their stamina and enthusiasm in all fields building a great prosperous powerful country, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He evinced the determination of the youth to decisively frustrate the vicious moves of the imperialist reactionaries to isolate and stifle the DPRK with the transparent working class consciousness and in the anti-imperialist fighting spirit and mercilessly wipe out the enemies to protect the dignity of Juche Korea if an order comes from Kim Jong Il.    \r\n    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Memorial Address at National Memorial Meeting \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- Kim Yong Nam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, upon the authorization of leader Kim Jong Il, made a memorial address at the national memorial meeting held at the Pyongyang Indoor Stadium Thursday, the 10th anniversary of the demise of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last ten years were historic days in which the Korean people have keenly felt in the depth of their hearts the national fortune in having done the revolution, holding Kim Il Sung as the leader, and the invincibility of his revolutionary idea and a sacred course in which they have successfully carried forward and developed the cause of the President by achieving miraculous victories in the battle to defend socialism and in the building of a great prosperous powerful country under the leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Il Sung, who devoted his whole life to the people's cause of independence for 70 years from the time when he embarked upon the road of revolution in the first half of his teenage, was a peerlessly great man who created a history of a hard-fought and glorious struggle for sovereignty, independence and socialism and victories in it with his profound revolutionary idea and gigantic revolutionary practice and opened up to the people a road to a bright future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the early 20th century, he wisely saw through the law of the development of the history and the trend of the revolutionary movement with his clairvoyant intelligence and discovered the principle of independence and, on this basis, founded the immortal Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, basing himself on the Juche idea, set forth the guiding theory, strategy and tactics at each stage and in each field of the revolution for the independence of the popular masses and propounded the unique methodology of revolution whereby to solve all the problems arising in the revolution and construction by enhancing the position and role of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is the father of socialist Korea who was the first in the long Korean history spanning five thousand years to build a people-centered socialist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He built people-centered socialism displaying its grand looks with independence, self-support and self-reliance in national defense in this land under the banner of the Juche idea, thus carrying into brilliant reality the age-old desire of the people to live and develop as the true master of the state and society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was a legendary hero who saved the destiny of the country and the people with the arms of revolution and an ever-victorious iron-willed commander who ushered in a new era of the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In each period and at each stage of the revolution he always paid primary attention to the military affairs and steadily strengthened the revolutionary armed forces so as to firmly guarantee the triumphant advance of the revolution and construction with arms. He won one victory after another in acute military confrontation with the imperialists under the banner of independence against imperialism and thereby defended the country, the revolution and socialism and gave a strong impetus to the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the progressive people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victorious history made by our army and people in the grim confrontation with the imperialists is a history of the victory of his brilliant military idea and superb stratagem and, at the same time, a history of the shining victory of his unique idea and line of attaching importance to arms and military affairs. This glorious tradition serves as the lifeline of the Songun revolution today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His revolutionary life was the life of a true leader of the people run through with the warmest love for and deepest trust in the people and the noblest devotion to them based on his idea of \"believing in people as in Heaven\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is, indeed, a peerless patriot, father of the nation and great sage of revolution who devoted his whole life to the freedom and happiness of the people and independent development of the country and the nation, going through multitude of trials with his loftiest love of the people and noblest sense of responsibility for the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His idea and cause that glorified the 20th century are being fully carried forward and are making a long drive in the advance of socialism in the 21st century thanks to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last decade of leadership of Kim Jong Il bears great marks illustrating that he, guided by noble moral sense of obligation, has most creditably accomplished the cause of perpetuating the memory of the President, making sure that the President will always live in the hearts of the people and the idea and revolutionary feats of the President will shine through centuries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is shining most brightly in the undying history of leadership of Kim Jong Il in faithfully carrying forward the idea and cause of Kim Il Sung is that he, with a scientific insight into the urgent demand of the times and the acute situation, put forward the unique political mode of Songun to usher in the era of Songun that wins and advances with the might of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indomitable stamina of Kim Il Sung's Korea has been displayed to a greater extent, historical changes have taken place in the struggle for national reunification, the international environment of the Korean revolution has made a favorable turn and the international prestige of the country has risen remarkably at a time when manifold, most rigorous ordeals lay in the way of the revolution.. All these victories and achievements are the precious fruition of the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK, the army and the people of the DPRK are faced with heavy yet honorable tasks to glorify the idea and cause of Kim Il Sung through all ages and bring a heyday of the prosperity of the country in this land, upholding the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To remain loyal to the last instructions of Kim Il Sung to the end and carry to brilliant accomplishment the cause of Juche under the red flag associated with his whole life is a noble mission and moral obligation of all the Korean people who have grown under his care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will hold Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the eternal leader through all ages, work hard for the greater prosperity of the country and thus fulfill their duty as his soldiers and disciples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il, the revolutionary idea of Kim Il Sung will lead the WPK and the Korean revolution to victory and glory in the new century, too, and he will always be with the Korean people and progressive humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
