These are nothing but ridiculous remarks which can be let loose only by those who do not know where they stand, obsessed with the hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is standing further isolated in the international arena as it has not yet opted for implementing the agreement adopted at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Reuters recently said that Japan is lagging behind in hosting international conferences because of its cool relations with Asian countries. It explicitly pointed out that this is a clear indication of Japan's international isolation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a saying \"Dogs bark as they are bred.\" The anti-DPRK smear campaign serves as a ruling physiology of the present Japanese authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community ridicules Japan for clinging to the \"abduction\" issue only and urges it to face up to the trend of the times and behave itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to lend an ear to the voices of the international community, though belatedly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He, when addressing representatives of anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations in Japan, went the lengths of crying out for building up opinion among Congressmen and others that the DPRK should not be de-listed as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a sign of echoing this voice at U.S. Congress, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an unpardonable challenge to the unanimous desire of the international community for peace and stability in Northeast Asia as it is a manifestation of extreme hostility toward the DPRK and Cold War-minded view on confrontation which call for isolating and stifling the DPRK, invariably considering it as an enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, the DPRK's access to nukes despite manifold difficulties was to cope with the U.S. continued hostile policy toward the DPRK and threat posed by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, an absolute pre-condition for the DPRK's abandonment of its nuclear program for the U.S. to drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The DPRK can never abandon its nuclear program unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. conservative hard-liners might know well how the DPRK reacted to the Bush administration's unilateral demand for the abandonment of the nuclear program. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, they are clinging to a trite method to maintain Cold War on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What they seek is to rattle the DPRK's nerves without let-up in a bid to make it pull out of the denuclearization process and shift the responsibility for it on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their calculation is that this would provide favorable conditions for justifying its neo Cold War strategy aimed at escalating international tension under the pretext of \"preventing the spread of WMD\" and for such guys as Bolton to return to the administration. No wonder, U.S. media reported that the conservative hard-liners led by Cheney within the Bush administration are watching for a chance to rise again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We don't care whether the U.S. conservative hard-liners support the pragmatic policy towards the DPRK or stoke hysteria of confrontation and whether they put the U.S.-Japan alliance above denuclearization or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are not serious about the U.S. improving its relations with the DPRK because even its move to bring those relations back to what was before would do the latter nothing bad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The popular masses can realize this ideal, enjoying genuine freedom and rights in the socialist society only, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is the most progressive idea reflecting man's intrinsic demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe socialist idea is that of the working class but it does not represent the interests of the working class only. It is a universal idea of humankind reflecting social nature and the interests of man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist idea is an idea not only for the working class emancipation but for the liberation of nations and mankind as it reflects the desire of all the nations and mankind for independence. It is an inexorable law governing the development of history for human society to develop from capitalism to socialism. Mankind's desire to live independently and peacefully can be achieved only when they take the road of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Only when they take the road of socialism where people are masters of everything and everything serves them, will it be possible for all of them to enjoy free, equal and dignified life to suit the independent nature of man and for all countries and nations to achieve independent development free from all forms of domination and subjugation. Socialism alone can ensure lasting peace and security of the world guaranteeing the existence and development of mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist idea is precisely the lifeline of socialism.
