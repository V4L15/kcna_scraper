            "content": "Signal success in study of paleozoic fossils \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 9 (KCNA) -- Korean archaeologists are registering signal successes in paleontological study.\r\n Recent excavation of 620 million-year-old paleozoic fossils sparked a great sensation among world archaeologists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 1,000 pieces of fossils unearthed on the upper layer belonging to the proterozoic era distributed in Junghwa county and Sangwon county, Pyongyang, and Hwangju county and Yonthan county, North Hwanghae Province, were proved to be multi-cellular primitive jelly-fishes and primitive seaweeds. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fossil of primitive jelly-fish, 0.6-2.0 cm in diameter, looks like crepe and the fossil of primitive seaweeds, 0.1-0.3 cm in width and 1-15 cm in length, consists of a narrow leaf, stem and root. These fossils are believed to have grown in calm and shallow sea under very favourable ecological conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    \r\n This proves that those areas provided favourable conditions for the evolution of bio-organisms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The excavation of those fossils clearly testified to the fact that Korea is one of the countries with long history of biological evolution and the development of lithosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earlier excavation of fossils of footstep of dinosaur and the \"Korean ancestral bird\" are precious relics which proved the emergence and the process of evolution of paleozoic bio-organisms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fossil of footstep of dinosaur, which lived 100-80 million years ago, was unearthed in Ryonggung-ri, Phyongsan county, North Hwanghae Province and this is much larger than that of an elephant considered to be the largest animal on earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fossil of the \"Korean ancestral bird\" which lived 150 million years ago is drawing a keen attention of archaeologists. It is listed as a relic of national value which clearly proved the emergence and the systematic evolution of high-grade vertebrate animals in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many more paleozoic fossils were unearthed in different parts of Korea including the fossil of pterosaur  which greatly contributed to the study of geology in the mesozoic era.    \r\n\r\n"
