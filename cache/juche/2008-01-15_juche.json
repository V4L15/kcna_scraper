This provided strong historic roots of revolutionary publications in Korea, he noted, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President published various Juche-oriented publications including Bolshevik, Nongu, Samil Wolgan, Sogwang, Cholhyol and Jongsori on the basis of a wealth of experience gained in leading the Newspaper Saenal, dynamically promoting the historic cause of national liberation and establishing a brilliant tradition of publications of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The noble exploits the President performed by building media of Juche-type are successfully defended thanks to Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il saw to it that the lifeline of the first newspaper published in the crucible of the anti-Japanese revolution has been carried forward generation after generation. He thus made it possible for the media of the WPK to advance along the orbit of Juche with the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese struggle as a lifeline no matter how much water may flow under the bridge and how frequently generations may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called on all mediapersons to produce more articles and programs stirring the reality and encouraging the people to create new things and perform exploits and thus contribute to promoting the general offensive for building an economic power.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

(Chollima means a legendary winged horse that runs 400 kilometers a day.) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the unanimous sentiments of the Korean people who have vigorously turned out in a general offensive this year for carrying into practice the grand plan of the Workers' Party of Korea to fling open in 2012 the gate to a great, prosperous and powerful nation without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The glow over Kangson, the vital power of which is the harmonious whole formed between the leader and the people, opened up the Chollima era in which epoch-making miracles were wrought in socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung visited the then Kangson Steel Plant in December Juche 45 (1956), when conditions were so harsh at home and abroad. He earnestly told the workers there: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  We believe only in the working class, the main force of the revolution. If you produce 10,000 tons more of steel next year, it will greatly help the country.  The President's warm love of and deep trust in the working class spread the red glow of creation and innovation over the sky of Kangson. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The workers of Kangson Steel Plant rushed ahead at the speed of Chollima, shattering conservatism and passivism, thus working the miracle of producing 120,000 tons of steel at a bloom rolling mill with a capacity of 60,000 tons. The spark of innovation that flew up in Kangson sent a leaping flame of the grand general march of Chollima spreading all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the days of the great revolutionary upswing, the furnacemen of the then Kim Chaek Iron Works turned out 270,000 tons of pig iron at a furnace which had been said to produce no more than 190,000 tons and truck producers built the first trial product in a matter of 40 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, builders in Pyongyang erected apartment houses for 20,000 families with materials, fund and manpower for 7,000 families and railway builders laid in two months and a half the railway line between Haeju and Hasong which had been expected to take three or four years. Similar world-startling successes were reported from all the fields of socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great power of the harmonious whole in which the leader believed in his people, and vice versa turned the DPRK, which the U.S. imperialists said would not rise up even in 100 years, into a socialist power independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in national defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will glorify this year as a year of historical turn to be chronicled in the history of the country by making the glow over Kangson spread all over the country.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the time-honored history, brilliant cultural tradition and noble soul of the nation which have been handed down for five thousand years are cherished by the Koreans as this fact serves as a mainstay of strong mental power for carving out the independent destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is a dignified nation as it has ushered in a new era of independent reunification despite challenges and vicious obstructions on the part of outside forces. The historic June 15 joint declaration is a banner of independent reunification as it provides the Korean nation with a milestone of national reunification and encourages all the countrymen in the north and the south and abroad to unite as one under the banner of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the October 4 Declaration for Development of the North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity, an action program for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, last year marked an event of special mention as it brought about a bright prospect of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality in which Koreans witness a rosy prospect of the movement for national reunification has provided them with an environment favorable for increasing the role as a driving force for settling national issues. It proves that they can surely make a new history of independent reunification and peace and prosperity by themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of unity represents that of the driving force and the unity of all Koreans provides a sure guarantee for achieving independent reunification and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans, whether they live in the north and the south or abroad, have a noble national mission to unite close, putting overriding importance to their great cause irrespective of classes and social strata, in order to accomplish the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all Koreans struggle in unity in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" can they settle without difficulty any problem arising in achieving national reunification.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the revelation of Japan's criminal scenario to realize its wild ambition for military reinvasion of Korea and Asia in close cooperation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are bringing to light their reinvasion scenario, raising a hue and cry over someone's \"missile threat\" from the outset of the new year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Aegis destroyer \"Kongo\" of the Maritime \"Self-Defence Force\" is now deployed at Sasebo base after conducting the first test of intercepting a ballistic missile in waters off Hawaii on Jan. 4. Timing to coincide with this, the ministry announced a plan to increase the number of Aegis destroyers capable of intercepting missiles to four in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese military's deployment of the above-said warship in Sasebo base close to the Korean Peninsula is a very disturbing military measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said military move is part of the preparations to carry out a military operation for preemptive attack on the DPRK in every sense. This dangerous military move can never be overlooked as the above-said warship has been deployed in the military base for aggression against the DPRK under the pretext of \"missile interception\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have gone beyond the tolerance limit in their moves for reinvasion. Japan is now escalating its moves for reinvasion in a premeditated manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The frantic moves of Japan to start a war are as foolish an act as precipitating its own destruction as they gravely threaten and disturb peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the above-said reckless moves of the Japanese reactionaries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Al mismo tiempo, se publico el plan del Ministerio de Defensa de aumentar a cuatro en lo adelante el numero de las naves tipo Aegis dotadas de misiles interceptores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Resulta una medida militar muy sospechosa el emplazamiento de dicho buque en la base de Sasebo, desde donde se divisa la Peninsula Coreana, bajo el pretexto de la \"interceptacion de misiles\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Especificamente, forma parte de los preparativos de la operacion militar para atacar preventivamente a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Las maniobras para la nueva agresion de los reaccionarios japoneses ya sobrepasan su limite y se impulsan premeditadamente con tendencia a la intensificacion gradual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esa locura militar de Japon que acarrea el nubarron de guerra es un acto criminal que amenaza y perturba gravemente la paz y seguridad del Nordeste Asiatico y el resto del mundo, siendo una estupidez que busca su autodestruccion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La RPDC nunca estara con brazos cruzados ante esas frivolas acciones de los reaccionarios japoneses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

La historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio marco un jalon de reunificacion de la patria para la nacion coreana y es la bandera de la reunificacion independiente que aglutino en un haz a los coreanos del Norte, el Sur y en ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En el ano pasado se aprobo la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre para el Desarrollo de las Relaciones Norte-Sur, la Paz y la Prosperidad que es el programa practico para materializar la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio. Esto es un evento de particular importancia que hace mas halaguena la perspectiva de la reunificacion de la patria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La realidad de hoy en que se abre el vasto horizonte del movimiento por la reunificacion de la patria ofrece la circunstancia favorable para que la nacion coreana cumpla con mas satisfaccion el papel de sujeto de la solucion del problema nacional y da prueba de que la nacion coreana puede crear con toda seguridad y por cuenta propia la nueva historia de la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El poderio del sujeto es el poderio de la unidad, y en la unidad de toda la nacion reside la firme garantia para lograr la reunificacion independiente, la paz y la prosperidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los coreanos, no importa donde residen en el Norte o el Sur de Corea o ultramar y a que clases o estratos pertenezcan, deben unirse compactamente a favor de la gran obra nacional para cumplir el noble deber de la reunificacion de la patria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Cuando toda la nacion luche unida segun el espiritu de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\", no habra problema insoluble ni obstaculo insuperable en la solucion del problema de la reunificacion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
