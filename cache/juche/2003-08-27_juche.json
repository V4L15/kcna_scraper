Lurking behind it is a sinister aim to infringe upon the right of Koreans in Japan to visit their motherland that had been underway on the basis of noble humanitarianism and endanger their safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities patronize and encourage the ultra-right reactionaries in such terrorism as throwing explosives and firing bullets to halt the operation of the ship Mangyongbong-92, the only humanitarian service between the DPRK and Japan. Their act can never be pardoned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is, indeed, a lawless rogue state with the poorest human rights record ignorant of international law, justice, human ethics and morality and humanitarianism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK values sovereignty and dignity more than its life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately stop all forms of political terrorism harassing and threatening Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, probe the truth behind the recent incidents at an early date and take responsible measures to prevent the recurrence of such incidents.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

This group of traitors lost in confrontation has no room to stay in the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be better for the party to stop such traitorous acts as blocking national reconciliation, unity and reunification and dissolve itself before being punished by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Right-wing Conservatives' Rowdyism \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 26 (KCNA) -- Anti-DPRK rowdyism was kicked up in Taegu where the 22nd Universiad is underway.\r\n At least 100 members of the ultra right reactionary conservative organizations of south Korea including the south Korean Netizen Solidarity for Democracy and the Youth Committee for Solidarity with Citizens for Freedom on August 24 staged such rowdyism as defiling the dignity and system of the DPRK and assaulting reporters from the north in front of the press centre in Taegu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This rash act was kicked up again in south Korea in the wake of the frantic racket reported on the August 15 liberation day when the spirit of national reconciliation and unity and peaceful reunification for the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration is running high across Korea and the inter-Korean cooperation and exchange are brisk as evidenced by the joint march of the groups of the north and the south at an international sports function with the Korean peninsula flag in the van. This is an open challenge to the will of the fellow countrymen for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north bitterly denounces the anti-north racket staged by some ultra right reactionary forces of south Korea as an unpardonable challenge to the aspiration and desire of the Korean nation in the north and the south for national reconciliation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south allowed this rash act against fellow countrymen to happen after inviting them to the international sports meet that draws the attention of the international community. This is shame on the nation and a rude act devoid of elementary morality and ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The right-wing conservatives in south Korea are staging anti-north rallies in different parts of south Korea, branding the democratic forces as \"pro-north enemy-benefiting\" forces. And they are going reckless to block the improvement of the inter-Korean relations and the movement for peace and reunification of the country, crying out for the \"eradication of Red virus\" and \"a turn-out of all right-wing forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north can not but demand the south Korean authorities own due responsibility for the outbreak of more anti-DPRK rowdyism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The August 15 anti-DPRK rowdyism and the anti-DPRK provocation in Taegu were perpetrated under the protection of the south Korean police. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undisguised anti-DPRK moves of the ultra right conservatives in south Korea have, in fact, reached an extremely reckless and dangerous phase under the manipulation of the U.S. and at the tacit connivance of the south Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should apologize for the anti-DPRK provocation and severely punish the criminals.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Landmark events have taken place one after another as the inter-Korean relations of distrust and confrontation have turned into those of trust and reconciliation since the publication of the joint declaration. The court action of demanding heavy penalties against those who contributed to this work is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the Grand National Party has long committed acts of treachery to be cursed by the people, the commentary says that heavy penalties should be inflicted upon such criminals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean judicial authorities have revealed through the trial that they are supporting the GNP in its treacherous acts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that serious consequences will be entailed by the disturbing situation where those who have desperately worked to downplay the significance of the June 15 joint declaration are allowed to strut and those who contributed to the improvement of the inter-Korean relations are subject to suppression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are well advised to ponder over the consequences, revoke the heavy penalties demanded against those who were pacesetters in inter-Korean cooperation and take strong measures against the GNP which is driving the inter-Korean relations to confrontation while slandering the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether one stands for the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration or not and works to improve the inter-Korean relations or not can be clearly proved by action, not by words.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
