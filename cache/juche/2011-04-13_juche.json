The issue of vertical and transverse nuclear non-proliferation hard to solve\" said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The nuclear issue of the DPRK, in essence, reflects a difficult issue in normalizing the relations between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the gambling of the DPRK and the U.S. over the nuclear issue, the DPRK has guaranteed its existence with nuclear weapons and pursued development, proceeding from its security need and, at the same time, handled it in a tactical manner, consistently maintaining a clear thread of connection.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The guarantee of the existence was the main motive of the DPRK in seeking access to nuclear weapons. The DPRK and the U.S. are the sworn enemies each other and the former is exposed to constant threat from the latter. The U.S. threatened more than once to use nukes against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. listed the DPRK as part of an \"axis of evil\" at the end of the Cold War and had already worked out an operational plan against the DPRK. The joint military exercises of the U.S. and south Korea targeted against the DPRK have never ceased. Their number has noticeably increased in recent years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such poor security environment required the DPRK to guarantee its existence as a sovereign state with nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world nuclear non-proliferation regime has faced an increasing blatant challenge since the demise of the Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world nuclear proliferation has witnessed the steady emergence of two tendencies: obvious transverse and vertical proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the number of new nuclear weapons states or countries and anti-government entities which acquired nuclear capability is on the steady increase besides the five nuclear weapons states allowed to possess nukes under the NPT. And the nuclear race is ceaselessly escalating among the universally recognized nuclear weapons states.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical of the vertical nuclear proliferation is the nuclear race escalating between the U.S. and Russia, the two nuclear superpowers, in a sustainable manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty concluded between them which can serve as the only means for making substantial progress in the building of a world without nukes is no more than a drop in the ocean.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They still have an absolute majority of nuclear weapons while steadily increasing the investment in improving them. Nuclear weapons are regarded as something indispensable in the national security strategy and the said nuclear powers remain basically unchanged in their confrontational nuclear posture based on the Cold War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against this backdrop that it is not hard to understand that the DPRK is by no means the country to which the above-said non-proliferation regime should pay attention. The proliferation getting evermore distinct in Israel, Iran, India, Pakistan, south Korea, Japan and other countries proves that nuclear proliferation is not confined to the existing nuclear issue and complicated political and security interests are lurking behind it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A proof of this is that the lune field of world transverse nuclear proliferation clashes with the instable lune zone of world security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community, nuclear powers, in particular, should make substantial efforts to successfully handle the issue of vertical nuclear proliferation and, at the same time, properly solve the issue of transverse nuclear proliferation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the key to preserving the world nuclear non-proliferation regime and attaining the noble goal to build a world without nukes."

It had a meeting of the \"extended deterrence policy committee\" with the south Korean puppet forces at which they agreed to intensify the research for military cooperation against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t This cannot be interpreted otherwise than a serious development as it proves that the U.S. remains unchanged in its scenario for preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is against the backdrop of such moves of the U.S. that forces hostile to the DPRK are becoming increasingly assertive for working out extended deterrence strategy in the East Asian region including the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At a recent symposium sponsored by the Carnegie International Peace Foundation of the U.S., a professor of Keio University of Japan said that extended deterrence is part of the U.S nuclear strategy, adding that the redrafting of the plan for extended deterrence by the U.S and south Korea would play an important role in coping with someone's \"provocation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true colors of a robber can never change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and other warlike forces are playing camouflaged peace tactics.

According to it, the ministry decided to describe Tok Islets as \"part of Japan's territory\" in 12 kinds of sociology textbooks for middle schools of Japan. Meanwhile, Japanese Foreign Minister Matsumoto blustered that the government has a consistent stand that Tok Islets are \"part of Japan's territory\". He went the lengths of talking nonsense that Japan would consider a missile attack on Tok Islets from outside as one on its own territory, describing them as part of its territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Wednesday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard: The Japanese reactionaries' bid to grab Tok Islets is an unpardonable grave provocation as it is a wanton violation of the sovereignty of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tok Islets are part of the inviolable territory of Korea as they do not allow anyone to eye or invade, the commentary says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's moves to seize Tok Islets were prompted not by any ignorance of international law or geographical conception or misunderstanding of historical facts but they proceeded from its wild ambition for grabbing them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries seek to make the islets a dispute, insisting that they are part of Japan's \"territory,\" and occupy them in a bid to use them as a springboard from which to realize their scenario for reinvading Korea and the rest of Asia and, at the same time, establish a monopoly over the economic concessions including rich marine and seabed resources around the islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By teaching the Japanese youngsters and other people distorted history they seek to implant the militarist idea into their minds and use them as a shock brigade for grabbing Tok Islets and reinvading Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that all these actions are being openly and systematically staged under the direct wire-pulling of the Japanese government. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is busy seeking territorial aggrandizement instead of minding its own business though it is now under an emergency situation. The Japanese authorities would be well advised to bear in mind that this would only bring to light their inveterate aggressive nature and invite rebuff and criticism from the international community."
