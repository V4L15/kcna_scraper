It is fortunate, indeed, for me to meet with chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission Kim Jong Il to discuss the future of the fellow countrymen, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that our future should be carved out by ourselves, he sincerely hoped that the current visit would help switch relations of distrust and confrontation that have lasted for more than half a century to those of reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is nothing out of our reach if the nation pools its strength, he said, calling on the nation to work together so that the era of division may be recalled as a thing of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History will obviously bring honor to our nation that has chosen reconciliation and cooperation, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He prayed that today will be a day for the nation to make a new start toward reconciliation and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The banquet proceeded in a warm atmosphere overflowing with compatriotic feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   An art performance was given there by Pyongyang artistes. \r\n\r\n"

Then, who on earth believes the false story that there might be soldiers of the people's army among the refugees? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among the innocent peaceable civilians killed by GIs were aged people, mothers with babies, children and pregnant women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to the U.S. assertion, all of them appeared as soldiers of the people's army. Is there any more sheer whooping lie than this? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Clear is the true aim sought by the warmongers of the united states in letting reptile media and riff-raffs spread this lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    They seek to justify GIs' brutal massacres, evade the state responsibility, to tone down the anti-U.S. sentiment mounting among the South Korean people these days and incite confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The United States should clearly know that the day is sure to come when it will be forced to pay for the crimes committed against the Korean people and history. \r\n\r\n"

Its intention is to realize its military &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nDomination over the peninsula under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK and contain countries surrounding it, taking it as a strategic stronghold and thus establish its military and political domination over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Struggle against the U.S. strategy for world supremacy is the only way for ensuring global peace and security and building a free and prosperous, new world, the paper stresses. \r\n\r\n"

Considering this situation as the best chance to realize their design for overseas invasion the Japanese reactionaries have allowed \"SDF's\" dispatch overseas and its use of weapons and expanded the sphere of their military actions beyond its boundary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan can launch overseas invasion anytime.

The number of cases of the \"ROK\" Army's intrusions into areas of the north in 1949 alone reached as many as 2,617. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.'s initial plan for \"northward expedition\" was to provoke a war against the north in 1949. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut repeated setbacks in their armed intrusions compelled the U.S. to postpone the start of the war until 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. thus orchestrated in 1949 a prelude to the Korean War. \r\n\r\n"
