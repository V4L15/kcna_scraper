            "content": "U.S. Can Never Evade Blame for Pushing Korean Peninsula to Constant Danger of War\r\n Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) --  The Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army on Wednesday released a detailed report condemning the U.S. for pushing the Korean peninsula to constant danger of a war and imposing unspeakable misfortune and pain on the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has deliberately aggravated the situation on the peninsula by violating the Armistice Agreement, the legal mechanism to prevent the recurrence of a war, the report said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. signed the \"mutual defense treaty\" with the south Korean puppet forces on August 8, 1953, thus legitimizing the permanent presence of the U.S. imperialist aggressors in south Korea. This was a blatant violation of Paragraph 60 of Article 4 of the AA which calls for withdrawing all foreign forces from Korea and peacefully settling the Korean issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It systematically breached Paragraph 13 d which bans the introduction into Korea of all arms and equipment, Paragraph 23 of Article 2 related to activities of the mechanism for monitoring and controlling military hostilities and the relevant paragraphs of the AA which call for ceasing all hostilities against the other party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to totally scrap the AA reached an extreme phase when it let a \"general\" of the south Korean puppet army having neither reason nor qualifications hold the post of a senior member of the \"Military Armistice Commission\" in 1991.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The mechanisms to supervise the implementation of the AA which were formed according to the AA ceased to exist due to the U.S. undisguised challenge and obstructive moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After getting AA buried in history, the U.S. began to direct all its efforts to committing vicious military provocations to invade the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After diverting the basic orientation of its strategy for world domination to the Asia-Pacific region in the 1990s, the U.S. set the DPRK as the primary target of its \"East Asia strategy.\" It steadily revised and supplemented all scenarios for a war against the DPRK including OPLAN 5027 and OPLAN 5030 and finally round them off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. massively reinforced latest destructive weapons targeting the DPRK, perpetrated reckless military provocations and steadily intensified large-sale war maneuvers. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has staged a total of at least 18 000 war maneuvers for invading the DPRK and joint military exercises in and around south Korea since the ceasefire, counting only those opened to public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula is so gravest that a nuclear war may break out any moment, the report said, and continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the period of the last Korean war that the Korean nation was exposed to the nuclear threat and blackmail for the first time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then war boss Truman made several attempts to drop A-bomb on the DPRK to recover from the repeated heavy setbacks in the Korean war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. blackmailed the DPRK with nuclear bombs, threatening to reduce it to debris. This left towering grudge in the minds of Koreans. Since the end of the 1950s, the U.S. began to massively introducing nuclear weapons into south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As early as in the 1970s the U.S. turned south Korea into the area with the biggest density in the deployment of nuclear weapons in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Early in the 1980s it brought even neutron bombs to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After turning south Korea into the world's biggest outpost for nuclear attack and nuclear arsenal, the U.S. worked desperately to use those nuclear weapons with various missions in fighting a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Focus Retina, Freedom Bolt, Team Spirit, RSOI, Key Resolve, Foal Eagle, Ulji Freedom Guardian and all other joint military exercises which it has staged so far since the 1960s were all aimed to bolster the actual nuclear war capabilities in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the U.S. attempted the direct use of nuclear weapons, while openly designating the DPRK, the non-nuclear state, as a target of a preemptive nuclear attack on several occasions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the \"quadrennial defense strategy review report\" the U.S. defined the DPRK as \"state posing direct threat\" and the \"biggest rival\" and blustered that in case its \"deterrence strategy\" fails, it will contain the DPRK by use of nuclear force. This revealed to what reckless phase its ambition to stifle the DPRK with nukes has reached.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama in a recent public appearance did not utter even a word about the moves of the U.S. as the arch criminal who spawned the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula and posed  the nuclear threat and blackmail but let loose a whole string of provocative outbursts that he would continue to pressurize the north to denuclearize, while groundlessly taking issue with the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK. This once again revealed its attempt to persist in the moves to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the armistice mechanism became defunct, there took place hundreds of big and small talks and contacts including 16 rounds of general-level talks and more than 200 rounds of colonel-level working talks between the DPRK and the U.S. But no progress was made in the discussions on matters of establishing a new peace-keeping mechanism due to the deliberate and unjustifiable behavior of the U.S. forces side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only merciless punishment and fist, not word, will work on the U.S. as it regards aggression and war as the mode of its existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are waiting for the moment to settle accounts with the U.S. which posed constant nuclear war threat to the Korean peninsula and imposed untold misfortune and sufferings on it."

Finally, they were compelled to sign the document of surrender before the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists have worked more desperately to ignite a new war in order to realize their scenario of aggression against the DPRK, far from drawing a lesson from the shameful defeat they sustained in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and their lackeys south Korean military gangsters are staging farces of extolling to the sky their war crimes, describing the last Korean war as \"the war which checked the north's southward invasion.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north and the south should courageously turn out in a sacred battle to deal sledge hammer blows at those enemies keen to bring the dark clouds of a nuclear war to the land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The UN and other international organizations and the world peace-loving people should clearly understand who the arch criminal harassing peace on the Korean peninsula is and resolutely shatter the warmongers' reckless attempt to ignite a war of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet forces should not run amuck, clearly mindful of the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the second Korean war."

It has recently sent the puppet army units to the U.S. mainland for war maneuvers for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has gone so reckless as to tighten conspiratorial nexus with foreign forces to invade the north under the pretext of the non-existent \"nuclear threat from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, military hooligans of south Korea, the U.S. and Japan were closeted with each other in Singapore under the pretext of \"coping with the north's nukes\" at which they talked about \"close cooperation\" and \"sharing of information about nuclear threat\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had the high-level tripartite military talks ended than the puppet group invited U.S. military warmongers to south Korea to have a confab to extend again the transfer of the right to command the wartime operation, clamoring about \"nuclear and missile threat from the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shelving its own moves for confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north, the Park group is claiming that the prospect for peace on the Korean peninsula is becoming gloomy due to the \"nuclear development and provocation of the north\". This is a height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the DPRK's measure of bolstering nuclear deterrence is a very justifiable step for self-defence to protect the sovereignty of the country and nation from the U.S. nuclear war threat and achieve the prosperity of all generations to come.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. keeps its forces in the south of the Korean peninsula and is posing a nuclear threat to the DPRK, and the south Korean puppet forces, the war servants of the U.S., are pushing the situation to the brink of war, while kowtowing to it, the DPRK will further bolster up its deterrence for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what others may say, the DPRK will counter the sword of the enemy with long sword and rifle with gun. This mode of counteraction for self-defence will never change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group would be well advised not to talk about the DPRK's nuclear development and \"threat\" but to remove the threat of a nuclear war against the north posed by foreign forces."

Mun Chang Guk who was designated to succeed him also dropped out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a deserved punishment meted out by the times and the public mindset to the Cabinet reshuffle which Park Geun Hye staged, talking about \"state reform\" and \"personnel reshuffle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the recent Cabinet reshuffle Park sought to revive all the fascist ruling mechanisms including the puppet government, National Assembly and military and consolidate the fascist dictatorial ruling foundation with ultra-right confrontation elements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin, boss of military gangsters whom Park appointed to the post of the chief of the security office of Chongwadae, and Han Min Gu, puppet minister of National Defense, a belligerent element who inherited the blood of pro-Japanese lackey, are all ultra-right conservative figures, a clear indication of the reactionary nature of the \"personnel reshuffle\" of Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park designated Mun Chang Guk as the candidate for \"prime minister\". This drove the political situation in south Korea into a bottomless abyss of ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mun described the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and the national division as the \"providence of God\" and denied the June 15 joint declaration.

publica el dia 25 una informacion detallada para revelar a plena luz y denunciar las maniobras criminales de Estados Unidos que llevo la Peninsula Coreana a la crisis perenne de guerra e impuso a la nacion coreana incontables desgracias y penalidades.\n\t\t\t\t\t La nota recuerda primero el hecho de que EE.UU. destruyo el sistema de armisticio, aparato legal para prevenir el otro desencadenamiento de guerra, empeorando asi intencionalmente la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El pais norteamericano firmo el 8 de agosto de 1953 con los titeres surcoreanos el \"Pacto de defensa mutua\", de manera que legalizo el estacionamiento perpetuo de las tropas agresoras estadounidenses en el Sur de Corea, subraya la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esto es la destruccion abierta de la clausula 60 del articulo cuarto del acuerdo de armisticio que estipula retirar de Corea a todos los ejercitos extranjeros y solucionar de manera pacifica el problema de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. violo de modo sistematico el parrafo Ch de la clausula 13 que estipula la prohibicion de la introduccion de todos los armamentos de la fuera de Corea, la clausula 23 de articulo segundo relacionada con las actividades del organismo que inspecciona y controla los actos hostiles militares y otros articulos correspondientes del acuerdo de armisticio que estipulan prohibir todas las hostilidades a su contraparte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A fin de eliminar totalmente el Acuerdo de Armisticio, en 1991 EE.UU. nombro a un \"general\" del ejercito titere del Sur de Corea, carente de obligacion y calificacion, como jefe de la Comision del Acuerdo de Armisticio Militar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los organismos de inspeccion de armisticio, organizados segun el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea, terminaron su existencia debido al desafio abierto y el impedimento de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tras destruir el Acuerdo de Armisticio, EE.UU. comenzo a concentrar sus fuerzas para cometer la provocacion militar de agresion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la decada de 1990, al dar su direccion de ataque principal de la estrategia de dominio mundial hacia la region de Asia-Pacifico, EE.UU. definio la RPDC como primer blanco de la realizacion de la \"estrategia de Asia Oriental\" y modifico y completo de modo incesante y perfecciono los guiones de guerra contra la RPDC, entre otras \"plan operacional 5027\" y \"plan operacion 5030\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Para llevarlos a la practica, aumento los modernos armamentos mortiferos que apuntaron a la RPDC, y desarrollo sin cesar las aventureras provocaciones militares y los ejercicios militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El numero publicado de los ejercicios de guerra de agresion a la RPDC y los otros conjuntos militares desarrollados por EE.UU. en el Sur de Corea y sus contornos desde el cese de fuego hasta la fecha, llega a mas de 18 mil ocasiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy la Peninsula Coreana esta en la situacion mas peligrosa en que pueda desencadenarse en cualquier tiempo la guerra nuclear, insiste la nota y sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por primera vez, la nacion coreana fue amenazada y chantajeada por las armas nucleares durante la pasada guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Truman, cabecillo de guerra de aquel entonces, intento en varias ocasiones lanzar la bomba atomica contra la RPDC a fin de evitar las grandes derrotas reiteradas en la guerra coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al cabo de amenazar y chantajear con las bombas atomicas a la nacion coreana, EE.UU. introdujo a fines de la decada de 1950 gran cantidad de armas nucleares al Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ya en la decada de 1970, convirtio la tierra surcoreana en una zona mas elevada en el mundo en la densidad de la ubicacion de las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A principios de la decada de 1980 EE.UU. introdujo en el Sur de Corea hasta las bombas de neutrones (bomba N), reconocidas como \"arma de diablo del siglo XX\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tras convertir el territorio surcoreano en la mas avanzada base de ataque nuclear y en el arsenal nuclear, el imperio yanqui pretendio usar las armas nucleares de diversos tipos en la guerra agresiva contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Todos los simulacros militares conjuntos librados desde la decada de 1960 hasta la hecha tales como \"Focus Retina\", \"Freedom Bolt\", \"Team Spirit\", \"RSOI\", \"Key Resolve\", \"Foal Eagle\" \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" se desarrollaron para elevar la capacidad de guerra real nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Efectivamente, en varias oportunidades EE.UU. declaro sin vacilacion alguna que la RPDC, que antes no tenia armas nucleares, como objeto de ataque preventivo nuclear y ha venido tratando de usar las armas nucleares contra ella.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hace poco, el imperio hizo publico el llamado \"informe de revision sobre la estrategia de defensa de 4 anos\" y definio  la RPDC como \"pais directamente amenazador\" y \"enemigo mas peligroso\". Y trata de \"aplastar la RPDC con las fuerzas armadas nucleares\" en el caso de que fracase la supuesta \"estrategia del disuasivo\". Asi demostro por si mismo a que etapa imprudente llego su ambicion de aplastamiento a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hace unos dias, Obama cuestiono sin fundamento el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC sin decir ni una palabra de sus maniobras criminales como autor del surgimiento del problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana y del chantaje nuclear contra la RPDC. Y pronuncio las palabras provocativas como \"seguira apretando al Norte (de Corea) por la desnuclearizacion\", lo cual muestra otra vez la pretension del imperio de continuar la provocacion de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de que se quedo invalida la organizacion de armisticio tuvieron lugar centenares de dialogos y contactos grandes y pequenos entre la capa militar RPDC-EE.UU., inclusive 16 dialogos a nivel del general y mas de 200 conversaciones de trabajo a nivel de primer coronel, pero debido a la actitud artificial e injusta de la parte norteamericana, la discusion del problema sobre el establecimiento de un nuevo sistema de garantia de paz no alcanzo ningun avance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No pasa con palabras sino con castigo duro con EE.UU., que toma la agresion y guerra como modo de su existencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t El ejercito y pueblo coreanos esperan solo el momento de liquidar todos los actos criminales de EE.UU. que pone la Peninsula Coreana en la crisis permanente de guerra nuclear e impone a la nacion coreana incontables desgracias y sufrimientos."
