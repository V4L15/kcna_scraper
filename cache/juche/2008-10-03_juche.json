            "content": "South Side's Violation of Inter-Korean Agreement Censured\r\n Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- North-south military working-level talks took place in the area of the south side in Panmunjom on Thursday in connection with the evermore undisguised violation of the north-south military agreement by the south Korean puppet military. \n\t\t\t\t\t The talks were attended by the north side's delegation headed by Senior Colonel of the Korean People's Army Pak Rim Su.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks the north side strongly accused the south Korean puppet military of desperately persisting in scattering leaflets into areas of the north in violation of the bilateral agreement. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Citing facts to prove that recently the puppet military has massively scattered leaflets into the areas along the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) including Kangwon and North and South Hwanghae provinces and even into the heart of Kaesong City and its nearby ris, to say nothing of the Kaesong Industrial Zone (KIZ) and Mt. Kumgang tourist area and areas around it, the north side stressed that these violations have assumed a more serious dimension than before. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Declaring that it is the height of folly for the south side to shake through the despicable act of scattering leaflets the faith and will of the army and people in the north who consider their leader and country as dearer than their own lives, the north side stated that such mean psychological warfare against the DPRK would only sharply heighten the hatred of the servicepersons and people in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The gravity of the scattering of leaflets by the puppet military lies in that it is a crude violation of the military agreement between both sides and a challenge to the north side and it is an act of further deteriorating the present strained inter-Korean relations and its danger lies in that it may spark off new military clashes, the north side stated. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the serious situation, the north side strongly urged the puppet military to immediately stop the above-said act, make an official apology for it and severely punish the main culprits and organizations responsible for it and take thorough responsible measures against the recurrence of such act as called for by the military agreement between both sides. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the talks the south side tried to evade the blame at any cost, talking about what it called \"internal situation\" and \"peculiarities of its system\" instead of admitting and apologizing for its anti-DPRK psychological warfare. But, finding it hard to seek a way out in face of the north's perfectly logical assertion and evidence, the south side had no option but to say it would look into the case and take relevant measures after going back. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north side strongly warned the south side as follows: If the puppet military persists in scattering leaflets in the future, too,  firstly it will seriously affect all the inter-Korean cooperation undertakings in the KIZ and tour of Kaesong now under way, secondly, it will make it impossible for the personnel of the south side to properly pass through the MDL and thirdly, it will make it impossible for the personnel of the south side now staying in the KIZ and Mt. Kumgang tourist area to remain there any longer."
