She had better drop such a pipe dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issues that should be settled are neither the issue of the DPRK's nukes, a treasured sword common to the nation, nor the \"human rights issue\" which can never exist in its popular masses-centred society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should be halted urgently is the U.S. nuclear blackmail and threat against the DPRK, human rights abuses in south Korea, a human rights tundra where fascist dictatorship is rampant, and all the political and military provocations being perpetrated every day by the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet military warmongers against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park once again self-exposed through her reckless remarks that she is no more than a hideous confrontation maniac rare to be found in the world.

Korean Regime of Suppressing Progressive and Democratic Forces\r\n Pyongyang, July 25 (KCNA) -- Recently the progressive and democratic forces are being mercilessly suppressed in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t A warrant of arrest was issued for the chairman of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions who opposed the misrule of the puppet regime and urged it ensure the people's right to existence. The police stormed and searched the office of the April 16 Solidarity which has taken the lead in the struggle for probing the truth behind the ferry Sewol disaster. At least 30 people related to the Teachers Union were indicted by the prosecution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun Saturday says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This suppression has started since Hwang Kyo An, a ferocious fascist, took office as \"prime minister.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was puppet chief executive Park Geun Hye who appointed Hwang as puppet prime minister as she knows well about his outrageous and cruel character as a fascist gangster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By manipulating him behind the scene, Park seeks to totally stamp out the progressive and democratic forces, tide over her ruling crisis and lay a foundation for long-term power of the \"Saenuri Party.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves that the terror-ridden atmosphere created in south Korea is an inevitable product of Park's dictatorial and tyrannical rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime should immediately stop its brutal suppression of progressive and democratic forces, bearing in mind that it is bound to meet stern punishment by history and the nation only for its fascist and repressive rule."
