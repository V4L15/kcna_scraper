            "content": "Entidad surcoreana presenta nueva sospecha sobre caso del \"Cheonan\"\r\nPyongyang, 23 de julio (ATCC) -- La Participacion Solidaria de Ciudadanos por la Sociedad Democratica del Sur de Corea, en su informe publicado el dia 19, presento una nueva sospecha sobre el incidente del hundimiento de la corbeta \"Cheonan\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" concedio el dia 15 un cenaculo de explicacion sobre el caso del \"Cheonan\" para las entidades civiles, pero esto produjo mucho mas dudas, senala la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA la pregunta sobre el tamano del supuesto submarino infiltrado en la zona maritima del hundimiento del \"Cheonan\", el \"Ministerio de Defensa Nacional\" respondio que tenia 2.75 metros de ancho y luego lo corrigio como 3.5 metros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, solto las palabras contradictorias en cuanto al nombre de ese submarino y a la ruta de navegacion en el dia del incidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun las autoridades militares y el \"grupo de investigacion conjunta\", el submarino que ataco el buque \"Cheonan\" era de nivel de \"yono\" construido en la RPDC. Pero, lo nego un anuario militar mundial prestigioso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades militares no comprobaron de manera cientifica las sustancias adsorbidas de restos del torpedo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi fuera absorbido el oxido de aluminio, tambien habrian sido absorbidos los elementos de la dinamita.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas sospechoso es la lampara fluorescente que se mantiene intacta en el interior del buque pese a la supuesta \"explosion del torpedo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, las autoridades militares insistieron en que el arqueo de la helice se debio a la inercia por la parada repentina. Pero, no se puede ocurrir este fenomeno porque en aquel entonces el buque navegaba a baja velocidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, no cabe duda de que la helice fue arqueada por la rotacion inversa, refuta la nota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, apunta que enviaria ese informe y las fotos al circulo de prensa y a la \"Asamblea Nacional\" para revisarlos."
