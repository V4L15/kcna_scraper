            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Rips into Japanese Right-wing Conservatives' Rash Act \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi, during his recent visit to Pyongyang, expressed his willingness to set store by the Japan-DPRK Pyongyang Declaration, turn the hostile relations into those of cooperation and put the bilateral relations on a normal track through the sincere implementation of the declaration.\r\n However, there are very unsavory developments in Japan which throw a dark shadow over the above-said efforts. Clear evidence of it was the passage of the reactionary \"bill banning the portcall of specified foreign ships\" through the House of Representatives of Japan in recent days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Tuesday dismisses this as rowdyism which can be committed only by those wicked guys displeased with the DPRK-Japan summit meeting and its outcome. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese conservative right-wingers' call for tightened sanctions against the DPRK and pressure on it is a product of their moves to carry out the U.S. hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the Japanese reactionaries who accepted the U.S. proposal for laying an international siege to the DPRK before anybody else and participated in the joint military exercises to intercept and seize its planes and ships. It is the purpose of the Japanese right-wing conservatives to get actively involved in the U.S. imperialists' moves and bring down the socialist system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing conservatives' adoption of a new law calling for sanctions against the DPRK was prompted by their sinister intention to deliberately hamstring the implementation of the declaration in violation of the spirit of the DPRK-Japan summit talks and disregard of the commitments made by the Japanese prime minister. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can they justify their rash acts of going against the spirit of the meeting and the Pyongyang declaration, reneging on the bilateral commitments and good faith. The people's mind-set will certainly make them pay for what they have done. They are well advised to stop such foolish and reckless acts, bearing in mind the proverb as you sow, so shall you reap.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its call for \"irreversible\" and \"verifiable\" nuclear dismantlement is to stifle the DPRK economically by destroying its peaceful nuclear power industry and round off war preparations for stifling it by searching its inside with a toothcomb under the cloak of inspection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If the U.S. truly wanted a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue, it should give up its robber-like demand and take a measure based on the principle of simultaneous action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. can be settled peacefully by the mode of \"word to word\" and \"action to action\" based on the principle of simultaneous action to suit its character and the present situation. The U.S. must take a concrete measure to carry into practice the proposal of the DPRK for \"compensation to freezing.\"  Should the U.S., shunning this proposal, try to force upon the DPRK its demand for \"complete, verifiable and irreversible nuclear dismantlement\" with \"written assurances of security,\" a mere sheet of paper, the DPRK will also demand a verifiable complete withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea and \"complete, verifiable and irreversible assurances of security\" which would be guaranteed by the signing of a peace agreement and normalization of relations between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Option is not a monopoly of the U.S. The DPRK also has it. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Particularly, over the last ten years when he has left immortal revolutionary records by leading the Korean army and people have been significant days when his political ability has been displayed to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of Kim Jong Il who has recorded an ever-victorious history of leadership over the revolution lies in creating a brilliant example of independent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is his political philosophy and the fundamental principle which runs through his politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has led the Korean revolution from the steadfast stand of thinking and acting always with one's own reason and solving all the matters arising in the revolutionary struggle and state building by the efforts of the people in the interests of the Korean revolution and in conformity with the specific conditions of the country according to one's own view and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to defend socialism in the past ten years in particular is a shining chronicle in which it has emerged victorious thanks to his independent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The greatness of Kim Jong Il who has recorded an ever-victorious history of leadership over revolution lies in his creation of a model of benevolent politics. Benevolence is the basis of his politics. It is his creed that revolution is immediately love for the people and politics is to love and take care of them, not to rule them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His greatness also lies in that he opened a new era of Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBasing himself on a scientific analysis of the characteristics of the socialist cause which is advancing in constant confrontation with the U.S. imperialists and the revolutionary role of the People's Army in the developing era, he set forth the original mode of Songun politics to advance the revolution with the People's Army as the main force and pillar of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying his distinguished political ability as a rare elder statesman is his personality as a great man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His high sense of responsibility and mission for the destiny of the country and the people is the main factor of his ever-victorious history of leadership over the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His extraordinary resources and far-sightedness are the basic guarantee for his ever-victorious history of leadership over the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His political faith and iron will are the decisive factors of his brilliant ever-victorious history of leadership over the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea over Issue of Its New Embassy Premises \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 8 (KCNA) -- The United States is increasing its pressure upon south Korea to meet its request for building its new embassy premises in the Ryongsan base.\r\n The U.S. had announced that its Ryongsan base would be transferred to Phyongthaek by the end of 2006, but it is now seeking to build its new embassy premises in that place instead of returning it to s. Korea without any condition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plan to expand its embassy premises has long been in the making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pressurized the south Korean authorities to offer the site of the Toksu Palace, a national cultural heritage, as a building lot for its embassy early in the1980s and has since pushed forward the plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On July 26, 2002, the U.S. ambassador to south Korea once again disclosed the U.S. intention to go ahead with its plan to build new embassy premises, asserting that it is desirable to have new embassy premises in the heart of Seoul and it is right to build new embassy premises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. said it would construct a 15-storeyed building of the embassy, an 8-storeyed apartment house for embassy officials and a 4-storeyed quarters for U.S. troops, their floor space totaling over 54,900 square meters, in the site of the Toksu Palace located in the area of Jongdong, Central District, Seoul. Then it urged the south Korean authorities to render active cooperation in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, failed to achieve this aim in face of the strong protest from different circles in south Korea. As the U.S. was compelled to transfer its base in Ryongsan to Phyongthaek, it came out with a plan to build its embassy premises covering 67,000 phyong in that place and has since zealously egged pro-American forces on to help in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If this thing is allowed to happen, the U.S. would still have at its disposal a total of 100,000 phyong of land including the areas to be used as embassy premises and a liaison office of its forces even after the return of its base in Ryongsan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are conducting activities to retake all the area of the U.S. base in Ryongsan and turn it into a national park, branding the U.S. moves as an unpardonable mockery of the Koreans' self-esteem.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article.\r\n It is the great result of the Pyongyang meeting and the June 15 joint declaration that the nation set forth independence as a common ideal and a militant banner for the north and the south, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is the core issue of solving national issues and a basic principle to be adhered to in the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Korean reunification is, in essence, one of establishing national sovereignty throughout Korea, rejoining the blood ties of the Koreans separated in the north and the south and achieving national unity. Korea should be, therefore, reunified by the concerted efforts of its people without allowing any foreign forces to interfere in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national reunification calls on all Koreans to independently solve all issues as a master in line with their will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is vital to national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf foreign forces are allowed to interfere in the issue of national reunification, the issue of retaking the usurped national sovereignty, it will complicate the issue and lead to nothing but a catastrophic situation after all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence serves as a sure guarantee for strengthening the driving force and increasing its role in carrying out the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though all the Koreans form a driving force of national reunification its might does not get strong by itself. It can prove strong only when all the members of the nation unite as one, highly aware of being responsible for the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The success made by the Korean nation in implementing the historic June 15 joint declaration for the last 4 years proves that the principle of independence serves as a banner of unity and a fundamental idea of accelerating the independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that it is the unanimous will of the Korean people desirous of independent reunification to hold aloft the banner of national independence, the article stresses that the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration serves as the only treasured sword enabling the Koreans to achieve national reunification as it calls for settling the issue of the country's reunification independently free from any foreign interference.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
