This proves that the U.S. loudmouthed \"dialogue\" is nothing but an artifice to mislead the public opinion and it only seeks to escalate the moves for confrontation and war and isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under what it called \"arms buildup plan\" the U.S. has recently brought into south Korea from overseas some of its first rapid deployment brigade of the U.S. army equipped with a new type of high performance and ultra-modern precision weapons for their drill of getting familiar with its local conditions. It announced even the extremely adventurous \"operation plan 5030\" aimed at invading the DPRK, driving the situation to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military drill brought the U.S. wild ambition to invade the DPRK into bold relief. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can vouch that the U.S.-launched dangerous war exercise will not lead to an actual war. If the U.S. keeps to the road of confrontation and war, refusing to give up its wild ambition to invade the DPRK, the latter will have no option but to take corresponding strong self-defense measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should bear in mind that if they go reckless, cooperating with the outside forces in their moves to exterminate the Korean nation, they would get nothing but the nation's curse and denunciation.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. switchover in its hostile policy towards the DPRK is, therefore, a precondition for solving the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ups and downs in the past dialogues and negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. were attributable to the U.S. wrong stance on dialogue and persistent hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the Beijing talks held in last April the DPRK put forward a new bold and comprehensive proposal which calls for simultaneous package settlement of the nuclear issue and the issue of concerns between the DPRK and the U.S. but Washington did not accept it, playing a trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not forget the lesson taught by the previous talks but drop its double-dealing tactics of \"dialogue and pressure,\" a product of its hostile policy towards the DPRK, before the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. continued pressure on the DPRK including \"economic blockade\" and military blackmail would only sour the atmosphere of the talks and cast dark shadow on the prospect of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-way talks are expected to open amid keen interest and expectation of the international community. If they are to prove trustworthy and fruitful it is important for the U.S. to make a bold decision to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will be able to judge that the U.S. has practically abandoned its hostile policy towards the DPRK only when the DPRK and the U.S. conclude a legally-binding non-aggression treaty and establish diplomatic relations and when it becomes clear that the U.S. does not hinder the economic cooperation between the DPRK and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. does not express its will to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK the DPRK will have no option but to declare that it can not dismantle its nuclear deterrent force at the talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, Japan is not entitled to poke its nose into the talks. The DPRK, however, allowed Japan to participate in the talks, taking its request and face into consideration out of broad mind and magnanimity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be a proper behavior for Japan to make sincere efforts to do what it should as a participant in the coming talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese right-wing conservative forces are misusing the magnanimity of the DPRK for serving its foul purpose to create a complication in the way of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-way talks are aimed to solve the nuclear issue and the other outstanding issues between the DPRK and the U.S. related to it both in the name and in reality in view of its cause, origin, purport and purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any attempt to bring the abduction issue for discussion at the six-way talks, whose main purpose is to settle the nuclear issue, may create an unnecessary complication in the issue of the agenda of the talks and thus throw the discussion into confusion and divert its focus. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is truly interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, it should refrain from doing such an improper thing as trying to include the abduction issue in the agenda items of the six-way talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
