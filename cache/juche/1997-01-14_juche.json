The daily notes:\r\n   The \"Labour laws\" of the traitorous Kim Young Sam clique \r\nare the fascist and murderous ones against the workers, \r\nwhich turn South Korean society into the worst hell on earth \r\nand subject the workers to political non-rights and slavery.\r\n   Today the south Korean workers are forced into slavery,\r\nbeing deprived of the elementary democratic rights and \r\nfreedom as well as the right to existence, by such fascist \r\nlaws. This is a disaster and disgrace to all workers around \r\nthe world as well.\r\n   The \"Labour laws\" are evil laws which gravely violate the \r\ninternational law. It is clearly stipulated in the rules \r\nof the international labour organisation that the three \r\nrights of labor including \"Freedom of association and right \r\nto unity\" should be allowed for workers.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group, however, revised the fascist \r\n\"Labour laws\" for the worse, mercilessly trampling underfoot \r\nthe spirit of the rules of the international labour \r\norganisation. Can there be a more flagrant challenge to \r\nthe international law, ilo and the workers of the world?\r\n   It is natural that the Kim Young Sam group has become the \r\ntarget of curse, denunciation and overthrow by the \r\ninternational agencies, public organisations and the people \r\nfrom all walks of life around the world.\r\n"
