Unilateral and extraterritorial high-handed economic measures to be taken by specified countries should be categorically rejected as they are in contravention of the principles and objective of international law and the United Nations Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to increase the roles of the development mechanisms under the UN system including the UN Economic and Social Council, which coordinates the problems related to the economic and social development, in order to effectively meet the challenges facing the world economy at present.  One should not allow any attempt to divert the development aid of the UN organizations including the UNDP from their original nature or use it as a lever for pressure in a bid to achieve any political aim.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And she resolutely fought against the Japanese imperialists, holding aloft President Kim Il Sung, her eldest grandson, as the sun of the nation and the lodestar for the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even though she needed the great help of her sons in poor living condition at that time, she saw her sons and grandsons off on the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She came to the grave of Kim Hyong Jik at Yangdicun in Fusong, China in the summer of 1926 and said to the President as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"You must pick up the cause where he left off and win back the country, come what may. You may have no chance to take care of me or your mother, as is your filial duty, but you must give yourself heart and soul to the cause of Korea's independence.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reminding of that time, the President wrote in his reminiscences \"With the Century\" that he was deeply moved and greatly inspired by her words, for the fact that she entrusted him with the great cause of national independence was a sign that she had complete confidence in him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She offered even the paternal right which can require the filial from her sons for the revolution. She regarded helping positively the President's revolutionary activities as her best happiness and pleasure in the period of anti-Japanese armed struggle and the foundation of revolutionary armed force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In that days the Japanese imperialists hauled her around the northern border area of Korea and the field and mountains of Manchuria in China for the \"surrender campaign\" of the anti-Japanese guerrilla army at the point of a bayonet, but she stroke terror into the minds of the enemies with her rough shout and did not submit to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The immortal feats of Ri Po Ik who devoted herself to the sacred cause for the independence of the country with the strong will and firm revolutionary spirit are still kept deep in the minds of the all Korean people.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
