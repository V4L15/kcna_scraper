This is fully evidenced by the recent situation prevailing in the hot spot of the West Sea of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The intrusion into the territorial waters of the DPRK side being perpetrated by warships of the puppet army under the pretext of intercepting fishing boats is escalating day by day and there continues day and night the mad-cap firing and shelling on Paekryong, Yonphyong, Taechong and other islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to cope with the prevailing situation, all the strike groups of the KPA in the southwestern sector of the front rounded off preparations for devastating strike after having a complete retaliatory posture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We clearly know that not only the puppet Ministry of Defense but also Chongwadae are behind the reckless clumsy firing perpetrated by the bellicose forces of the south Korean puppet military in the most sensitive waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye and her group finding themselves in the worst ruling crisis and being driven into a pitfall of destiny are working hard to seek a way out by desperately perpetrating provocations in the hotspot waters and pushing the situation to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service personnel of the KPA in the southwestern sector of the front are full of the strong will of retaliation to punish the provocateurs to the last one by giving vent to their pent-up grudge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What they are waiting for is only the order to be given by the Supreme Command to strike the provocateurs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The provocateurs will have to keenly realize what high price they will pay for the consequences to be entailed by their reckless clumsy firing."

            "content": "Some European Countries Accused of Finding Fault with DPRK over Issue of Armistice Supervisory Mechanism\r\n Pyongyang, June 26 (KCNA) -- Some countries toeing the U.S. line recently dared find fault with the DPRK over the issue of the long defunct Armistice supervisory mechanism.\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army gave the following answer to the question put by the newspaper Joson Inmingun on Thursday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some days ago, representatives of central European countries flew into Seoul to hold \"high-level meeting on political affairs\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We do not know by whose entreaty and for what reason they went so busy in such sweltering weather and we do not care at all. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, we cannot overlook their reckless behavior of groundlessly finding fault with the DPRK and letting loose invectives, unsuitable to the time and place and not befitting their positions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They styling themselves high-level politicians of the \"Four Nations Consultative Council\" of Europe held a press conference at which they started to talk about the \"Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission\" all of a sudden. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They claimed that this mechanism which was formed with the mission to supervise and control the introduction and reinforcement of military personnel and arms and equipment from outside Korea according to the Korean Armistice Agreement, seemed to disappear for form's sake but it still exists and is functioning. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also asserted in their own way that in the light of its existence it shows international community's concern over the Korean peninsula being \"a dangerous powder magazine.\" When the audience queried what is the need to talk about the \"Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission\" forgotten by the people long ago, they answered its \"symbolic meaning was very important\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to ask why they tried so hard to recognize the existence of the mechanism with keen interest. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They unhesitatingly revealed their ulterior intention to force the DPRK to \"dismantle\" nukes and show \"sincere will for changes\" if the constant tension is to be defused on the Korean peninsula. It was just the same as the U.S. assertion, though it sounded different outwardly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The politicians who pulled up the DPRK this time were guys of the former member nations of the \"Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They must know better than anyone else that the commission is forgotten in history because it was reduced to a servant of the U.S. in its moves for invading the DPRK and abandoned the principle of neutrality and fairness, different from its original mission. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They were to blame for rendering the mechanism defunct, subservient to the U.S. without any elementary principle. It is more than two decades since then but they are behaving so ridiculously not feeling any shame, passing the buck for the tension on the peninsula to the DPRK. They should pay without fail for their criminal acts of nullifying the Armistice Agreement and rendering the supervisory mechanism defunct, pursuant to the U.S. scenario of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People ridicule them for becoming poor trumpeters for the U.S. anti-DPRK campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They, at the same time, see through the petty trick of the U.S. to revive the supervisory mechanism by bringing together riff-raffs on the occasion of June 25. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one on earth can prevail over justice and truth. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to politely advise those poor trumpeters bribed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should regard their dignity as dear as their lives and always uphold justice against injustice if they have an iota of reason. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should not behave like a marionette. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No one can hurt the dignity of the DPRK racing against time full of dynamism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should face up to this stark reality and give up the stupid attempt to revive the supervisory mechanism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be well advised to seriously look back on what miserable fate the Korean war brought to the U.S. and what disastrous consequences were entailed by the moves for aggression against the DPRK pursued by the U.S. in the subsequent period. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the Korean People's Army that there will be no word \"ceasefire\" in the final standoff with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its allies should always remember this."

            "content": "Representacion de EPC en Phanmunjom denuncia paises satelites de EE.UU.\r\n Pyongyang, 26 de junio (ACNC) -- A la pregunta formulada por un periodista de Joson Inmingun en relacion con que unos paises satelites de Estados Unidos nos acusaron atrevidamente refiriendose a la existencia del aparato de supervision del armisticio, desaparecido hace mucho tiempo, el portavoz de la Representacion del Ejercito Popular de Corea en Phanmunjom dio el dia 26 la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\t Unos dias antes, los representantes de los paises de la Europa Media fueron a Seul para sostener una supuesta \"reunion de alto rango para los asuntos politicos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No tenemos ningun interes en quien les invito  y por que ellos andaban ajetreados en estos dias sofocantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pero, no podemos pasar por alto el hecho de que ellos lanzaron unas peroratas perversas acusandonos sin fundamento en el tiempo y lugar inadecuados y lejos de sus honores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En una entrevista, ellos que se autodenominan como politicos de alto rango del \"sistema de consulta de 4 naciones\" de Europa, comenzaron a discutir el problema de la \"Comision de Supervision de Naciones Neutrales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la ocasion, ellos insistieron en que aunque fue desaparecido formalmente el organismo de inspeccion de armisticio organizado segun el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea con la mision de inspeccionar y controlar la introduccion y el aumento de los efectivos y armamentos desde la fuera de Corea, pero efectivamente hay que reconocer que este aparato todavia existe y actua.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Agregaron a su albedrio que la existencia real de ese aparato demuestra la preocupacion de la sociedad internacional de que la Peninsula Coreana es un \"polvorin peligroso\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A la contrapregunta de la audiencia por que ponian sobre el tapete el problema de esa \"comision\" ya desaparecida en la mente de las personas, ellos contestaron que es muy importante la \"significacion simbolica\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No vale la pena preguntar a ellos por que trataron de reconocer la existencia del aparato de supervision de armisticio teniendo tanto apego al mismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es que ellos mismos expusieron su verdadera intencion al decir que para sacar la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana de la coyuntura de tension permanente, la RPDC debe \"renunciar\" las armas nucleares y mostrar la \"voluntad de cambiarse de verdad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tales palabras son identicas a lo que insiste EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Los politiqueros, que acusaron esta vez a la RPDC, son de los paises miembros de la susodicha \"comision\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ellos saben mas que nadie que ese aparato desaparecio en la historia porque enajenado de su mision original, se ha convertido en el ejecutor de las maniobras agresivas de EE.UU. contra la RPDC faltando a sus principios vitales; la neutralidad e imparcialidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Esos culpables, que causaron el colapso del aparato adulando a EE.UU. y actuando sin criterio propio, tratan de imputar a la RPDC hasta ahora a mas de 20 anos la responsabilidad de la situacion tirante de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hay que pasar sin falta las cuentas del acto criminal de ellos que invalidaron el Acuerdo de Armisticio sumandose al complot de agresion a Corea de EE.UU. y quebraron totalmente el aparato de supervision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Las personas se burlan de ellos convertidos en los propagandistas anti-RPDC que trabajan para EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Se percatan tambien de la artimana de EE.UU. para rehabilitar el aparato movilizando a los fulanos y menganos con motivo del 25 de junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nadie puede estar por encima de la justicia y la verdad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aprovechamos esta oportunidad para aconsejar a los que se portan como propagandistas pagados por EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Deben considerar su dignidad como vida y luchar por la justicia y contra la injusticia, si tienen un pedazo de conciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No deben actuar como espantapajaros que se deja mover de un lado a la otra segun la direccion del viento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nadie puede manchar la imagen impetuosa de la RPDC que marcha con el vigor de juventud acortando el tiempo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Al ver esa realidad, EE.UU. debe dejar su absurdo intento de rehabilitar el ya desaparecido aparato de supervision.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si tiene tiempo, debera recordar seriamente cuan tragico fue el destino de EE.UU. en la guerra del 25 de junio de 1950 y cuales consecuencias se emanaron sus maniobras de agresion a Corea cometidas despues de aquel dia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No habra ni el armisticio en la inminente batalla final de enfrentamiento con EE.UU., esto es la invariable posicion del Ejercito Popular de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. y sus satelites no deben inolvidarlo ni un momento."
