The Iraqi war fought to topple Saddam Hussein's regime, gave further momentum to the anti-U.S. sentiment in the Arab countries. The \"road map to Mideast peace\" announced by the United States against this background is nothing but a political leverage to provide the U.S. and Israel with concessions after the war. In other words, it is intended to let the Arabs forget the Iraqi war committed by the U.S. against Islam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If peace is to be achieved in the middle east the united states should stop its unilateral assistance to Israel and the Israeli aggression troops should pull out of the occupied land of Palestine, the article urged.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA refutes U.S. talk about quid pro quo \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. has worked hard to mislead the public opinion over the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula before and after the DPRK-U.S. talks held in Beijing recently to settle the nuclear issue.\r\n The U.S. is keen to create the impression that the renunciation of its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a master key to settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, is little short of \"rewarding bad behavior.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK clarified more than once that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is a major stumbling block standing in the way of solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and ensuring peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. deep-rooted hostile policy toward the DPRK is, in essence, aimed to destroy the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has threatened and blackmailed the DPRK by consistently pursuing the hostile policy toward the DPRK not only in the period of the cold war but after it came to an end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was, therefore, compelled to build up a deterrent force for self-defence to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is wholly accountable for the tense situation in East Asia, to say nothing of the Korean Peninsula, as it listed the DPRK as an \"enemy\" and threatened and pressurized Pyongyang, pursuant to its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an open secret that in doing so, the U.S. seeks to strengthen the shackling military \"tie-up\" with Japan and South Korea and invent a pretext to maintain its clout with them through continued military presence and arms buildup there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK has hamstrung the efforts to warm up the inter-Korean and the DPRK-Japan relations, to say nothing of the DPRK-U.S. relations, and escalated the tensions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. renunciation of this policy, therefore, meets the common interests of not only the north and the south of Korea but its neighboring countries as it is essential for ensuring security on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Viewing these facts with reason one can understand that the U.S. drop of its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK is not a \"reward\" to the DPRK but an action it should have taken long ago.  The Bush administration must be aware that the former administration officially clarified its political will to fundamentally improve the hostile relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK-U.S. joint statement issued on June 11, 1993, the U.S. agreed to refrain from posing a nuclear threat to the DPRK and interfering in its internal affairs and respect its sovereignty. The DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework published on October 21, 1994, and the DPRK-U.S. joint communique issued on October 12, 2000, reconfirmed the basic spirit and principle of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement that called for terminating the hostile relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has insisted on its old assertion that the DPRK should scrap its nuclear program first, saying that Washington's drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK would be a \"reward\". This only indicates that the U.S. has no political will to fairly settle the outstanding issues including the nuclear issue but seeks to fish in troubled waters by keeping the situation tense in defiance of the common interests of the countries in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is apt to threaten others, blustering that it keeps all options on the table. But the option is not a monopoly of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow the U.S. future stand, attitude and moves.    \r\n\r\n"

If it continues misbehaving itself while groundlessly pulling up the DPRK before doing what it should do, the DPRK will be compelled to take a tougher countermeasure against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should think twice over the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
