It is, therefore, brigandish sophism and preposterous assertion for the U.S. to talk about someone's \"nuclear threat\" and \"nuclear proliferation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S. development of new type nukes is touching off great concern and protest of the international community and the tendency of opposing this is growing stronger inside Congress and other political circles, thus becoming the focus of public attention, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. administration continues pushing ahead with a plan to develop new type nuclear warheads aimed at the modernization of nuclear weapons and the production of smaller nukes in order to achieve its criminal purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The administration was reported to have requested Congress to earmark 88 million U.S. dollars for the development of new type nuclear warheads, asserting that the capability of nuclear armed forces would markedly shrink within a decade unless its nukes are modernized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such move clearly shows the U.S. double-dealing attitude towards the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is so brazen-faced as to label the peaceful nuclear activities of those countries that incur its displeasure \"development of nuclear weapons\" and take issue with them. It is shutting eyes to the development of nukes of its satellite countries for the mere reason that they are its allies and stepping up the development and manufacture of new type nukes in a bid to update them and make them smaller. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is using all sorts of flowery words to conceal the criminal nature and danger of its moves. It claims that the above-said plan is aimed at \"ensuring the safety\" of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true intention of the U.S. is, however, to step up the production of modern and smaller nukes under the pretext of \"ensuring the safety\" of nuclear weapons in an effort to make an effective use of them in any war like conventional weapons. Herein lie the gravity and danger of the U.S. warlike forces' moves to develop new type nuclear warheads. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is to blame for the mounting nuclear threat and the steady increase of nukes in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its moves to develop those new type nukes and beef up nuclear forces and dismantle nuclear weapons and nuclear bases in different parts of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the faith they enshrined while weathering out stern trials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will hold higher the banner of Songun in the future, too, and eternally glorify Korean-style socialism where genuine human rights are fully guaranteed.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They prove that the crime was the most diabolical one against humanity of the 20th century committed in an organized way directly by or under the command of the government and the military of old Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A recent issue of Minju Joson carried the data collected by Dr. Jong Nam Yong, 70, who is a specialist in international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the data, as the crime was organized by the Japanese military, \"comfort stations\" for the army were set up in all areas occupied by the Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The minutes of the meeting of section chiefs of the Ministry of Army dated September 3, 1942 says that there were 400 stations in all, 100 in the northern part of China, 140 in the central part of China, 40 in the southern part of China, 100 in South Asia, 10 on islands in the Pacific Ocean and 10 in the southern part of Sakhalin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Order of the Japanese Ministry of Army No.74 titled \"Directive on employee recruitment of comfort station for the army\" was worked out by the justice section of the ministry and sealed by Chief of General Staff of the Army Hiroshi Imamura and Director of the Justice Department Mitsurou Umezu on March 4, 1938. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the order, the Japanese ministries of Army, Navy and Foreign Affairs held a joint meeting at the Japanese consulate in Nanjing, China on April 16, 1938. At the meeting, they agreed on each unit establishing comfort stations on the spot to suit the actual conditions, recruiting girls in the ages of 17 to 20 under the name of \"volunteers' corps\" and reducing them to \"comfort women\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even right before the outbreak of the Pacific War, the Ministry of Army issued the \"Directive on recruiting prostitutes of comfort stations for the army\" to all local units. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Furthermore, the Japanese imperialists concretized the way for delivery of \"comfort women\" for the imperial army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The then Japanese government had, at first, connived and encouraged covertly the crime of sexual slavery committed by the military in an organized and systematic way. And then it took a direct part in the sexual slavery and instituted a law on organizing it in a more positive way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It promulgated the \"Policy on enforcement of the system of women's voluntary labor corps (comfort women)\" in September 1943 and \"Ordinance of women's voluntary labor\" on August 23, 1944. The policy and ordinance were signed by the then prime minister, home affairs minister and welfare minister of Japan and were made public as royal order No. 159 after they were signed by the then Japanese King. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such secret documents and minutes showing the direct participation of the old Japanese government and military in the crime of sexual slavery during the Second World War had been found out and opened to the public one after another in the 1990s in various organs concerned in Japan. This eloquently proves that Japan cannot evade the responsibility for the crime of sexual slavery.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are human scum little different from the criminals who forced women into sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The day after the passage through the U.S. Congress of a resolution seeking apology from the Japanese government for the sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army, Abe uttered he felt regret at the adoption of the resolution and talked nonsense that the 20th century was the century when the human rights were violated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government was busy with lobbying operations to bar the above-said resolution from being adopted at Congress at any cost and Abe himself blustered he would never apologize for the crimes even in case the resolution was adopted at Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the preoccupation of the Abe group is to cover up or play down Japan's crimes by hook or by crook. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How impudent and mean the Abe group is! &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany, the same defeated nation as Japan, opted for winning back the trust of the international community by honestly admitting its crimes in the past and apologizing and compensating for them. Japan, however, behaved quite contrary to this, touching off the derision of the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder, the international community ridicules Japan as a political dwarf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attitude towards its past crimes alone suffices to guess the moral quality and level of its political camp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's bid to hold a leadership position and play a role as such in the international arena is nothing but a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abe group would be well advised to know that it can never do anything as long as it sticks to such political approach towards the issue of Japan's past wrongs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun califica a EE.UU. de criminal de proliferacion nuclear\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 17 de agosto (ATCC) -- Estados Unidos es el autor de la amenaza y proliferacion nuclear internacional y fautor que acarrea la carrera armamentista y el peligro de guerra nuclear, pero habla de la \"amenaza nuclear\" y \"proliferacion nuclear\" de alguien, lo cual es una sofisteria gangsteril y absurda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual del dia 17 y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El desarrollo de nuevas armas nucleares de EE.UU. ocasiona gran preocupacion y oposicion de la sociedad internacional y se amplia el movimiento de oposicion a dicho desarrollo en el circulo politico en particular en el congreso, lo que atrae la atencion de los organos de prensa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, la administracion norteamericana promueve sin cesar el plan de desarrollo de ojiva nuclear de nuevo tipo persiguiendo asi el proposito de hacer moderno y pequeno el artefacto nuclear a ser aplicado en la guerra contra otros paises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al considerar que de no hacer modernas las armas nucleares que poseen, dentro de los 10 anos proximos el nivel de sus fuerzas armadas nucleares caera grandemente, ella demando al congreso norteamericano destinar 88 millones de US$ para gastos de desarrollo de ojiva nuclear de nuevo tipo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tal maniobra de EE.UU. demuestra la actitud de doble rasero de este en el problema nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Descaradamente este imperio cuestiona con frecuencia las actividades nucleares con fines pacificos de los paises que no le son de agrado tildandolas de \"desarrollo de armas nucleares\". Pero en cuanto al desarrollo de armas nucleares de los paises satelites hace la vista gorda porque son sus aliados y sigue desarrollando y produciendo nuevas armas nucleares con el fin de hacer modernos y pequenos los artefactos nucleares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para ocultar el caracter criminal y la peligrosidad de sus maniobras EE.UU. sale con toda clase de pretextos. Pinta el plan de desarrollo de ojiva nuclear de nuevo tipo como si fuera para la \"seguridad\" de este artefacto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El verdadero proposito de EE.UU. es acelerar la modernizacion y minimizacion del arma nuclear so pretexto de la \"seguridad\" de este artefacto y utilizar eficazmente como arma convencional en la guerra. He aqui la gravedad y la peligrosidad de las maniobras de desarrollo de ojiva nuclear de nuevo tipo de los belicistas norteamericanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El incremento de amenaza y arma nuclear en el mundo se debe a EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El imperio debe poner fin a su desarrollo y aumento de artefactos nucleares y desmantelar las armas y bases nucleares ubicadas en varios lugares del mundo.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
