            "content": "White paper on deployment of DPRK-targeted strategic weapons\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute on Tuesday made public a white paper on the deployment of DPRK-targeted strategic weapons of the U.S. and their allied forces and its gravity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The white paper cited concrete facts to expose the deployment of the U.S. strategic weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to it, the United States has over 10,500 strategic nuclear missiles, including 2,050 odd inter-continental ballistic missiles, 3,500 submarine-based ballistic missiles, 350 sea-based cruise missiles, 1,500 air-based cruise missiles and 3,075 nuclear bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It has also 97 strategic nuclear-powered submarines and offensive submarines which are capable of launching nuclear missiles under water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Besides, there are 256 long-distance strategic bombers and thousands of fighter bombers capable of carrying nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Most of those strategic armed forces are concentrated on the Asia-pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are in Hawaii, Guam, Yokosuka of Japan and other parts of this region 560 military bases and facilities and hundreds of thousands of troops, more than 1,000 aircraft including strategic bombers, over 200 warships including six aircraft carriers, 14 cruisers and 34 nuclear-powered submarines and 6,500 odd nukes. The seventh U.S. fleet has more than 1,800 nuclear weapons and their delivery means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Deployed in South Korea, the forefront of the U.S. for aggression on the continent, are over 40,000 U.S. aggression troops, more than 2,000 tactical nuclear weapons and a huge quantity of depleted uranium bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fighter bombers such as \"F-16\" and \"F-15\" and over 130 warplanes of different types are deployed for the delivery of nuclear bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are more than 250 missiles including \"lance\" and \"patriot\" and a large number of nuclear artillery pieces and multiple rockets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This has turned South Korea into an area highest in the density of strategic weapons deployment in the world and its biggest arsenal which has put the Korean peninsula on a time bomb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The white paper explains reason why the U.S. is keeping such huge quantities of strategic weapons in South Korea despite the fact that the Cold War came to an end and the Soviet Union no longer exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It further says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those strategic weapons are targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is well illustrated by nuclear and missile rows kicked off by the U.S. against the DPRK in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In 1993 the U.S. mapped out and made public the \"operation plan 5027\", a new war scenario to invade the DPRK, in a bid to suffocate it militarily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAccording to the new war scenario, instead of the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises the \"RSOI\" joint military exercises started and the \"Ulji focus lens\" joint military exercises were staged on a larger scale in South Korea the main purpose of which was to move their aggression troops from overseas and the U.S. mainland and deploy them on the Korean peninsula and to mount a direct strike at the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nuclear powered carriers and submarines made more frequent visits to ports of South Korea and Japan and Guam-based strategic bomber \"B-52\" intensified their regular flight and long-distance bombing drills towards South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For instance, U.S. nuclear submarines came to South Korea 15-20 times a year under the pretexts of military exercises and tense situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. has made no scruple of carrying out exercises under the simulated conditions of an actual war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even according to an official announcement made by them  in 1995, the \"rapid deployment forces\" to be hurled into the Korean peninsula in case of \"emergency\" include 2 carriers, 1,000 planes including strategic bombers, over 200 warships including nuclear submarines, cruisers,  destroyers and 500,000-600,000 troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Computers installed in all strategic weapons and equipment of the U.S. is fed with programs  aimed at attacking the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not content with this, the U.S. has launched thousands of spy satellites into the space to watch and track the military objects in the DPRK round the clock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNowadays, they are going to develop and deploy the \"Theatre Missile Defence\" system on the plea of a \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These facts go to prove more eloquently that the U.S. strategic weapons are targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that the U.S. is employing double standards as regards the issue of development of nuclear weapons and missiles, the white paper goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the connivance of the U.S., Japan has in place all technologies, facilities and materials necessary for the manufacture of nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She has already stockpiled plutonium enough to manufacture more than 4,000 nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan continues shipping plutonium from abroad and it will be capable of manufacturing as many as 60,000 nukes in around the year 2010. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., however, have never raised suspicion of it. The U.S., who kicked up such a frantic row over the DPRK's peaceful launch of its first satellite, are turning a blind eye to Japan's satellite launch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese aggression forces' missiles are all targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is conniving at the missile development in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities are now working hard develop missiles with a range of 500 kilometers  which are capable of striking all parts of the North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are also keen on developing even medium and long-range missiles under the signboard of \"space program\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhile keeping silence over the development of missile and even nukes by their followers, the U.S. went the length of giving supplying them with up-to-date military equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, they are raising a hue and cry over the non-existent \"nuclear threat\" and \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and getting hectic in their moves to check the DPRK's possible purchase of missile or deal in a plane with other country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is clear evidence of double standards which can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All facts clearly prove that threats of strategic weapons, including nukes and missiles, do not come from the north but from the U.S. and their followers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, Japan and the South Korean authorities should immediately stop kicking up a groundless row over the DPRK's nuclear and missile development and unconditionally half the DPRK-targeted war drills if they do not want to meet a disgraceful destruction. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to show good faith\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, September 15 (KCNA) -- If the United States is truly interested in  peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, it should fundamentally rectify its policy to stifle the DPRK, withdraw from South Korea its forces, the main stumbling block in the way of peace and security on the peninsula, and root out all threats to the DPRK, including joint military exercises, before urging the DPRK to show an affirmative response. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry said this in a statement today denouncing the U.S. for its recent groundless provocation to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, Japan and South Korea held a \"tripartite summit meeting\" on Sept. 12 before the opening of the APEC summit, at which they issued a \"joint press statement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the statement the United States talked the nonsense that it hoped a comprehensive and integral stand jointly taken by the U.S., Japan and South Korea would provide a precious opportunity of ensuring peace and security on the Korean peninsula and that they were ready to take each admeasure to improve relations with the DPRK according to the latter's step for detente and a durable peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States produced such a statement at a time when high-level negotiations are under way over the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. underlying this move is an ill-intentioned attempt to avail itself of an international meeting which can easily draw world attention to make the DPRK feel a \"sense of psychological oppression\" once again through a \"concerted actions\"  in a bid to wrest a sort of  concession from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As for the \"opportunity\" which the United States claimed to be \"offered\" to the DPRK, the DPRK considers it wise to positively cope with the objective conditions and opportunity in its favour on its own initiative when carrying out its independent policy and line and defending its right and interest. The DPRK has neither thought of nor hoped for any \"opportunity\" to be provided by others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What merits a serious attention is the fact that the United States in the statement which it dreamed up by instigating its followers, described the DPRK as a \"wrecker\" of the stability on the Korean peninsula while painting itself as a \"peace champion.\" The statement asserted that if the DPRK shows a sign of good faith first, they will reciprocate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is no more than sheer sophism reversing black and white and completely falsifying the truth about who is the arch criminal harassing the peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and in northeast Asia and whence the actual threat to escalate the regional situation comes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. in the \"joint statement\" asserted that if the DPRK pays attention to their \"apprehension\" and takes a measure to relax tension and ensure a lasting peace, they will be willing to improve relations with it. This is, in essence, no more than a revelation of their intention to disarm us, the spokesman says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is clinging to such a double-dealing tactics saying this at the negotiations with us and saying another behind the scene. This behaviour of the U.S. deepens our mistrust in it and heightens our vigilance against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As we have already clarified more than once, when the U.S. shows good faith, we will reciprocate it. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
