This gives a great joy to the whole Korean nation and inspires all the fellow countrymen to the struggle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean nation's struggle for reunification is not smooth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Enemies of reunification are opposed to the historic joint declaration which calls for solving the issue of national reunification independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation and the development of inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They are intensifying their criminal hostile policy towards the DPRK and their anti-DPRK campaign while resorting to confrontation and war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Under this situation, if Korea remains divided into the north and the south and they stand in confrontation with each other the Korean nation can not be freed from the domination and subordination of the foreign forces and may be made their plaything again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  National reunification is a vital demand of the Korean nation and a supreme task related to its life and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The peace and reunification of Korea are also the unanimous demand of the world peace-loving people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No force on earth can perpetuate the division of the homogeneous Korean nation which has been formed and developed through thousands of years of history.\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Gift to Kim Jong Il from Mongolian delegation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- It happened on a summer day of Juche 44 (1955) when President Kim Il Sung called at his native home in Mangyongdae to inquire after his grandfather's health. That day, he was told by his relative that an institution sent the grandfather some wine several times as a medicine. He said there is no need to receive even wine as the state enforced a system of free medical care.\r\n The president said that he would send the grandfather medicinal wine in the future. in the subsequent period the president regularly sent it to his grandfather. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another anecdote about his doctor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president always listened to his doctor's advices and met his requests. One day his doctor told him not to enter any place where there was gas during his field guidance, as he was aged. On hearing this, he said that he should not avoid the places full of dust or gas but inspect those places to indicate ways of clearing them. At that time even his doctor was at a loss for words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It happened in July Juche 36 (1947) when Kim Il Sung visited Pyongyang primary school no.2 at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon entering the school, he slowly walked toward its corridor. A schoolgirl on duty asked him to register his name on the visitor's book, unaware who he was. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After writing about the person who he would like to meet and the purpose of his visit, etc. on the book, he put below that: \"Chairman Kim Il Sung of the People's Committee of North Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was not until that moment that the girl knew he was President Kim Il Sung. He praised her for her high sense of responsibility.    \r\n\r\n"
