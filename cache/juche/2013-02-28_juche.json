This is a clear indication that the U.S. old nuclear war policy towards the DPRK has finally reached the phase of its full-scale implementation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dark clouds of a nuclear war are hanging heavily over the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies tried to cover up the criminal nature of the projected war exercises through the farce of \"notifying\" the DPRK \"in advance\", describing them as \"annual and defensive\". But the DPRK will never be taken in by such rhetoric.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better properly know who its rival is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people are no longer what they used to be in the past when they grieved over being a stateless nation after being deprived of their beloved land due to the competition among big powers a century ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They defeated two imperialisms, U.S. and Japanese, in one generation, winning historic victories in the battle for the liberation of the country and the Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Fully equipped with the absolute trust in their ideology, social system and cause and the strong will to devotedly defend them, heroic Korea and its people solemnly declared that whoever provokes them would never be able to escape a final ruin no matter where he is in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK won victories only even without nukes in the past. The U.S. should give deep thought to provocations to the DPRK and their consequences, now that it has emerged a full-fledged nuclear weapons state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop dreaming of compromise or concession from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent nuclear test of the DPRK was no more than the primary counteraction taken by it, exercising its maximum self-restraint towards the U.S. hostile acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already proved in practice that its will and capability are by no means an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are now waiting for an order for final attack, keeping themselves highly alerted so that they may blow up the enemies' strongholds of aggression by giving full play to their tremendous combat capability if they provoke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have Korean-style strategy and tactics to humble the arrogance of the U.S. imperialists at a single blow.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. will have to pay dearly for any miscalculation of the DPRK's will and capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should pay heed to the above-said warning."

            "content": "Periodico sueco condena campana anti-RPDC del Occidente en torno a prueba nuclear\r\n Pyongyang, 28 de febrero (ACNC) -- El organo del Partido Comunista de Suecia Proretaren divulgo en su numero 7 un comentario intitulado \"Armas nucleares y amenaza\" que condena la campana del Occidente para aplastar a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea acusandola por la reciente prueba nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t El texto va como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Cuando la RPDC realizo la prueba nuclear, el Occidente expresa unanimemente su \"indignacion\" como si armas nucleares de ella fueran mas peligrosas que las de otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Entonces, ?quien es el que amenaza y quien es el amenazado?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t ?Donde estaban los comentaristas encolerizados de hoy cuando los buques de guerra norteamericanos, inclusive el submarino nuclear, entraron la semana pasada en la Peninsula Coreana con fin de participar en los ejercicios navales conjuntos con el Sur de Corea?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sigue fresca todavia en la memoria la reaccion histerica al lanzamiento del satelite artificial de la Tierra por parte de la RPDC en diciembre pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En la Peninsula Coreana no se ha firmado todavia un convenio de paz despues de la pasada guerra coreana. Es decir, se mantiene en el estado de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La responsabilidad recae enteramente sobre EE.UU. que rechaza la firma del convenio de paz desestimando los esfuerzos de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Partiendo del factor geopolitico, EE.UU. esta interesado en mantener tensiones en esa region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Durante la guerra coreana, EE.UU. tenia el plan de usar armas nucleares contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Terminada la guerra, el imperio desplego armas nucleares en el territorio surcoreano y alisto a la RPDC en sus blancos de ataque nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. es el unico pais que declaro la estrategia de guerra nuclear de caracter ofensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Habria que evaluar el programa de desarrollo de armas nucleares para la autodefensa de la RPDC tomando en cuenta los referidos antecedentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EE.UU. no se atreve a agredir a la RPDC porque ella posee artefactos nucleares."
