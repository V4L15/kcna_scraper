Through the visit to the shrine, the reactionaries intend to imbue the Japanese people with revanchism and create an ideological atmosphere of militarist reinvasion.\r\n   Overseas expansion is an invariable ambition of the Japanese reactionaries. They have accelerated arms buildup, making military preparations enough to launch any kind of aggression war. What has to be done now is to make ideological preparations for mobilizing the Japanese people in case of overseas aggression.\r\n   This is why they have regularized the visit to the shrine as a policy in defiance of home and foreign public protest.\r\n   Their visit to the shrine can never be justified. It is a foolish act which only precipitates their doom.\r\n   If Japan persistently refuses to break with the crime-woven past, drawing no lesson from its history, Japan can never win trust from the world community. \r\n\r\n"

Each nation is responsible for carrying out the revolution in its country as well as shaping its destiny.\r\n   The revolution and construction of each country can not be carried out with any previous theory and frame and mechanical imitation of foreign things.  Each country should do revolution by itself and at its will and should independently and creatively solve the problems arising in the revolution and construction in keeping with its people's demand and national qualities and its specific conditions.\r\n   Keeping the Juche character and national character is also an essential requirement of socialism that is advanced and accomplished by the masses themselves.\r\n   There are no people who do not love and value their country and nation and who like to see the dignity and soul of their nation trampled upon. So Juche character and national character of revolution and construction should be preserved if socialism is to be a true cause of realizing the masses' demand for independence and their interests and is to be pushed forward by themselves.\r\n   Only when doing so, is it possible for the masses to turn out as one in the struggle for socialism and continue their vigorous struggle for the victory of socialism under whatever conditions and circumstances. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
