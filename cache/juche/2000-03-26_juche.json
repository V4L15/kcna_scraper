It issued indictment no. 1 on Feb. 19 disclosing the truth about massacres committed by GIs from June 25 to early August, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment no. 2 said that the U.S. aggressors murdered over 3,590 peaceable civilians, destroyed or burnt 6,122 dwelling houses and reduced many cultural facilities and peaceful industrial establishments to ashes in the North Korea from early August to the middle of September 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Among the victims to the U.S. air raids were not only doctors and nurses but mothers at childbirth and patients and even nursery children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. aggressors also killed many rural women picking edible grass, peaceable civilians at work to rearrange and rehabilitate destroyed streets and houses, farmers on fields, civilians walking on roads and women washing clothes on the riverside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. aggressors indiscriminately bombed, bombarded and strafed not only defenseless major cities but farm and fishery villages and any dwelling house, totally destroying or burning them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment cited concrete data to prove that this barbarism resulted in completely destroying 401,498 Phyong (one Phyong equals six feet square) of farmland in South Hamgyong Province and 34,182 Phyong in South Phyongan Province just before harvest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the facts clearly prove once again that the U.S. aggressors are, indeed, beasts in human skin who are fond of man-hunting and the most shameless warmongers who regard aggression, plunder and destruction as their favorite amusement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean nation can never forget the U.S. brutes' crimes in drenching the land of Korea with the blood of fellow countrymen, burning and destroying their cradles and wealth and will force  them to pay for them a thousand times. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. forces' pullback from S. Korea called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA)-- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary assails the U.S. Defense Secretary and the commander of the U.S. forces in South Korea for their shameless outbursts reiterating the \"need\" for U.S. forces' presence in Asia under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   These outcries made by the U.S. warmongers are nothing but jargons intended to shift the responsibility for the increasing tensions on the Korean peninsula onto the DPRK and tone down the mounting anti-U.S. sentiment in South Korea, the commentary observes, and goes on:   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. forces in South Korea are neither \"deterrent force\" nor a factor of bringing \"peace\" or \"prosperity\" to it. They are the arch harasser of the peace and security on the peninsula and the very source of all sorts of misfortune and sufferings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During the Cold War era the United States justified  its forces' presence in South Korea under the pretext of \"threat from the Soviet Union\". But now it works hard to justify it under the pretext of non-existent \"threat from North Korea.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The United States is well advised to drop its bad habit of slandering others in a bid to conceal its despicable colors and pull its forces out of South Korea at once in keeping with the global trend. \r\n\r\n"
