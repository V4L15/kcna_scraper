            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Actual Maneuvers of KPA Large Combined Units\r\nPyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- Actual maneuvers for attack and defence between large combined units of the Korean People's Army (KPA) were staged in three directions at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t In the maneuvers a defence task was carried out by units of the KPA 91st Metropolitan Defense Corps and an attack task by units of the KPA 105th Tank Division and 425th and 815th Motorized Infantry Divisions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un, supreme commander of the KPA, guided the maneuvers at a three-direction forward command post, learning about them in other two directions through a display.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maneuvers were aimed to further round off the operational preparedness for reliably defending Pyongyang, the capital of the revolution, from any enemy attack by confirming the offensive and defensive operation capability through a drill for laying and overcoming obstacles between units and taking relevant steps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a report on the maneuvers plan at an observation post, the Supreme Commander guided the maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He referred to the merits and demerits of the maneuvers and advanced important tasks that would serve as guidelines in further strengthening the KPA into ever-victorious revolutionary armed forces by intensifying training the way the anti-Japanese guerrillas did in Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The maneuvers proved again that, in order to cope with a fierce, severe and cruel war, it is useless to conduct any drill unrelated to war and unfit for war environment, a drill of formalism, stereotyped pattern and stylish manner, he said, stressing: Commanding personnel and officers of the staff should turn all military trainings into practical and actual drills and practical brain drills with the unshakable Juche-based stand and attitude towards war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He indicated one by one such principled matters arising in rounding off the combat readiness as enhancing the initiative, independence and creativity of commanding personnel and officers of the staff so that they can skillfully command operations and combats in keeping with the demand and conditions of modern warfare and the characters for carrying out their units' combat duty, bringing the party political work close to war environment so as to arouse soldiers to victory in combats, enhancing the responsibility and role of training reviewers to ensure drills under battle conditions, giving the same strict review of drills as that of combats, and making preparations in advance to take up a strong defensive position in any lines by making an effective use of natural and geographical conditions of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed belief that all the men and officers of the KPA would perform great merits in defending the socialist country, deeply aware that they should ensure the security of the country and its people's happiness with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greeted at the drill ground by Army General Pak Yong Sik, minister of the People's Armed Forces, Army General Ri Myong Su, chief of the KPA General Staff, Army Lieut. Gen. Rim Kwang Il, first vice-chief of the KPA General Staff and director of its General Operation Bureau, Army Lieut. Gen. Jo Nam Jin, vice-director of the Organizational Department of the KPA General Political Bureau, Army Lieut. Gen. Pang Kwan Bok, vice-chief of the KPA General Staff and director of its Combat Drill Department, Lieut. Gen. Kim Myong Nam, commander of the KPA 91st Metropolitan Defense Corps, Maj. Gen. Kim To Un, its political commissar, Lieut. Gen. Ko Myong Su, commander of the KPA 815th Motorized Infantry Division, and Maj. Gen. Ju Song Nam, its political commissar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the drill were executive members of the KPA Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, engineer commanding officers and instructors of the military academies at all levels."
