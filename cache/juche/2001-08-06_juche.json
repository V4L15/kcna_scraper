This demand is intended to prevent the repetition of the disasters of last century by making the present Japanese government take responsibility and compensate for the war of aggression conducted by the Japanese imperialists in the past and for damage from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government did not give any humanitarian aid to Korean A-bomb victims in 56 years, though it has done to Japanese victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year it sent a fact-finding team to the DPRK to acquire the details, but has not yet taken any practical measure, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief executive of Japan has recently asserted that he would visit \"Yasukuni Shrine.\" Meanwhile, Japan is moving to replace its \"peaceful constitution\" with war constitution and refusing to accept the strong domestic and foreign demand for revision of junior middle schoolers' history textbooks in which its history of aggression is distorted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such moves are aimed to conceal its past crimes and evade apology and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should renounce this wrong attitude at once and promptly take humanitarian measures necessary for the Korean A-bomb victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it keeps dragging time on, abusing the humanitarian issue for any political purpose, it will come under stronger protest and condemnation not only from the victims but from the world community.    \r\n\r\n"

The \"abduction issue\" persistently peddled by Japan is a shameless pretext to evade the issue of liquidation of the past, the core issue of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan kidnapped and walked away millions of Koreans in the past. Yet, it is linking the issue of a few missing ordinary persons with the DPRK in a bid to build up public opinion. This is prompted by Japan's base aim to prevent the international community from criticizing it for evading the responsibility for its past crimes and shift the blame for it onto others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is beset with a lot of social issues such as murder and abduction at home.   It is, therefore, nonsense and an insult to the DPRK's dignity for Japan to describe the issue of missing persons in Japan as the \"abduction\" committed by the DPRK and pull it up over the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised not to act rashly, aware that it will be held wholly responsible for the consequences to be entailed by its reckless fuss to internationalize the fictitious \"abduction issue\".    \r\n\r\n"
