            "content": "MINREX rechaza \"informe anual de DDHH\" de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 15 de abril (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que Estados Unidos publico el \"informe anual de DDHH\" con el contenido de calumnia a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio el dia 15 siguiente respuesta a la ACNC:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el \"informe sobre la situacion de DDHH de cada pais en 2015\", publicado el dia 13, el Departamento de Estado norteamericano volvio a cuestionar la situacion de DDHH de la RPDC con los datos fraudulentos e intrigantes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"privacion de libertad\", \"gestion del campo de concentracion de presos politicos\", \"ejecucion a discrecion\", \"trafico de seres  humanos\", \"trabajo forzoso\" y otros fenomenos indicados en el \"informe de DDHH\" son pura mentira inexistente en la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. cuestiona cada ano el problema de DDHH de otros paises, pero el mismo es el violador de DDHH a sentarse en el banquillo de los acusados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sociedad estadounidense es el infierno de DDHH donde reinan la discriminacion racial, los crimenes de toda indole y los horribles casos de violacion de DDHH. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor doquier de nuestro planeta el imperio americano comete sin escrupulos las atrocidades de lesa humanidad recurriendo a la agresion y la intervencion y asesinando a sus caprichos a los civiles inocentes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el rotulo de la \"defensa de DDHH\", hizo la \"revolucion de color\" en el Medio Oriente causando el derrocamiento de Estado, el conflicto nacional, los desastres de guerra y el incidente de refugiados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, actua ilogicamente como \"juez de DDHH\" a fin de ocultar su naturaleza como archi-violador de DDHH. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. pronuncio disparates sobre la situacion de DDHH de 199 paises del mundo a pesar de que no tiene la calidad elemental de hablar sobre este tema, razon por la cual nadie le prestara atencion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria mejor que EE.UU. arregle primero sus asuntos internos dejando de recurrir al invento del \"informe de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa peligrosidad de la publicacion del presente informe reside en que EE.UU. lo usa como aparato de agresion para derribar el regimen de otros paises y realizar su objetivo dominacionista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. recurre persistentemente a la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC para realizar a toda costa su ambicion del \"derrumbe de regimen\" manchando nuestra imagen internacional y descomponiendo nuestro interior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que EE.UU. intensifica mas la presion sobre la RPDC cuestionando el supuesto \"problema de DDHH\" junto con la amenaza militar y las maniobras de sancion encaminadas al \"derribo de regimen\" de esta, tomaremos todas las contramedidas necesarias para que EE.UU. se arrepienta profundamente."

            "content": "USECC denuncia represion a SNE de banda de Park Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, 15 de abril (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que llega a la fase extremada la represion de la banda surcoreana de Park Geun-hye encaminada a exterminar el Sindicato Nacional de Ensenantes (SNE), el portavoz del Comite Central de la Union de Sindicatos de Educacion y Cultura de Corea hizo publica el dia 15 una declaracion.\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de tomar el poder, la camarilla de Park Geun-hye cometio la represion atroz al SNE, revela la nota y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn enero pasado, instigo a la Corte Suprema a arrebatar la posicion legitima de esta entidad y ahora impide sus transacciones bancarias y obliga a deponer incondicionalmente al presidente y otros cuadros del sindicato. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo denunciamos severamente calificandolo de abierta represalia politica y violencia antidemocratica para eliminar a los ensenantes que rechazan la politica de educacion antipopular de las autoridades surcoreanas y demandan la educacion correcta, la justicia y la verdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa campana anti-SNE de la banda de Park Geun-hye resulta una intolerable violencia fascista para exterminar completamente a las fuerzas progresistas y democraticas surcoreanas que apoyan la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y exigen la democracia y la independencia de la sociedad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, la defensa o no del SNE en el Sur de Corea se presenta como un grave problema que pierda o no la ultima esperanza en la democratizacion del circulo docente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSepultar lo mas pronto posible a la banda de Park Geun-hye que reprime a los educadores progresistas mediante la movilizacion de los aparatos de represion fascista es el atajo para defender la educacion justiciera y frenar el resurgimiento de la dominacion fascista de \"Yusin\" en el Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes de distintos estratos surcoreanos deben levantarse en la lucha por deponer del poder a la horda traidora fascista de Park Geun-hye y defender el SNE. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los educadores de la RPDC enviaran siempre el apoyo total y solidaridad a la indoblegable lucha del SNE contra la politica de educacion antipopular de la banda de Park Geun-hye y por la autentica educacion, la democratizacion de la sociedad y la reunificacion de la patria."
