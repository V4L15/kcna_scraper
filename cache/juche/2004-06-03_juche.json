Korea under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 2 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists have, since their military occupation of south Korea, pursued a policy of colonial occupation there in defiance of the Korean nation's will and desire to carry their hegemonic ambition into practice, notes Rodong Sinmun Wednesday.\r\n The author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over half a century has passed since the U.S. military occupation began. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSouth Korea, however, is still under the U.S. rule with the noose of subordination around its neck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. occupation of south Korea is a wanton violation of the Korean nation's sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cunning U.S. imperialists have talked glibly about \"alliance\" and \"friendly nation.\" But, in actuality, they have become the ruler and bound south Korea in bondage up to the hilt in all domains, political, economic, military and cultural. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Completely dependent on the U.S. in military affairs, too, south Korea still begs for its \"security umbrella\" and serves as the shock brigade for the U.S. policy of north-south confrontation and its maneuvers for a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For nearly 60 years the U.S. imperialist aggression troops have committed an unbroken chain of most brutal human rights abuses, killing a great many south Koreans right and left, assaulting them and raping women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An immediate end must be put to the occupation of south Korea by the U.S. imperialist aggression forces as it is the source of all crimes that inflict misfortunes and sufferings of all descriptions on the people and violate their dignity and human rights. It is an urgent demand of the nation and the times to terminate the U.S. imperialists' military occupation and colonial rule in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an intolerable national disgrace that the south Korean people are still robbed of sovereignty and have their dignity violated under the occupation of the U.S. troops when all the countries and nations are fighting for independence and dignity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should decisively clamp a lid on the U.S. occupation and rule in south Korea, if it is to defend peace and achieve independent reunification under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people of all social standings who value independence and dignity should turn out as one man in the righteous struggle to force the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops out of south Korea under the banner of national independence.    \r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"
