He had spent 34 years in prison since then. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He remained true to the revolutionary faith and principle as member of the WPK, not yielding to the enemy's brutal torture, appeasement and deception.

Nothing is more brazen-faced than misrepresenting this stark historical fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an unavoidable historical responsibility and legal and moral obligation of Japan to honestly admit the above-said crime and apologize and compensate for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better clearly know that its undisguised moves to tamper with history would only lead it to more thorough international isolation, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Out of the deserted land, the natural one takes only 13 percent and the rest has been made through human activities for nature development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The environmental influence estimation is to survey, analyze and estimate such planned activities as construction and technical updating in all sectors of the national economy for the purpose of ensuring sustainable development while keeping sound environment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, a key to minimizing the artificial factors that may have an influence on the global desertification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reporter: How is this undertaking done in our country? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Section chief: The government has long employed as an important policy to take environmental protection measures prior to all development activities and has laid down a legal foundation for the successful environmental influence estimation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"DPRK Law on Estimating Environmental Influence\" was adopted in November Juche 94 (2005) on the basis of the experience made in the work for dozens of years and regulations, detailed rules and directories were instituted to meet the requirements of the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The estimation has been kept ahead of large-scale land rezoning, water-way projects, developments of underground and hydraulic resources and others so as to prevent forest devastation, soil degeneration and decrease of water resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government is taking thorough measures to expand and specify the work objects further and to restrict the release of polluted materials in major industrial bodies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A unified guidance system over the environmental influence estimation institutions from the central bodies to provincial ones has been established and the methodological study for the undertaking has been intensified in depth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are strengthening the exchange and collaboration with international organizations, too.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind it is a sinister aim to calm down the public voices at home and abroad demanding the presentation of a timetable for the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from Iraq and realize its plan for additional dispatch of U.S. troops there and thus boost the morale of the U.S. troops in Iraq seized with uneasiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crafty and vicious nature of the Bush forces finds their clear manifestation in their attempt to disguise the U.S. troops in Iraq as \"UN forces\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is keen to retain its grip on Iraq come what may though it lost a great many U.S. soldiers in the war it started there. It is one of its main objectives to gratify the greed of not only the munitions monopolies in league with it but the oil monopolies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to use Iraq as a strategic stronghold, a military springboard from which to realize its domination over the world economy and invasion of the Mideast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is allowed to monopolize oil in the Mideast, the U.S. will have the possibility of putting the world oil market under its control. It is the U.S. calculation that it will be able to rein in world economy if it puts oil in Africa and Caspian Sea under its control by taking advantage of the above-said possibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Iraq is situated in a place of very weighty geographical and strategic importance. It is the view of the U.S. that retaining its grip on Iraq would be favorable for putting sustained pressure upon such anti-American countries as Iran and Syria and invading them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's scenario to operate the U.S. troops in Iraq the same way as done in south Korea is nothing but a cunning plot to retrieve the repeated setbacks in its \"anti-terrorism war\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In particular, the WPK has greeted the golden days of its development through its struggle to implement the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il in all fields and in this course it has grown to be an invincible party that steers the Songun cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is the most revolutionary party that solves everything guided by the Songun idea of Juche and it is the party all members of which are closely rallied in a single mind on the basis of the Songun idea and a party transparent in working-class stand and strong in revolutionary principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK is demonstrating its might as an invincible party that is steadily carrying forward the Songun cause because it is led by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is a great leader of the cause of party building in the Songun era and a great man born of Heaven as he has built an invincible party that carries the cause of socialism to completion under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il clarified the Songun revolutionary principle of Juche that the army precisely represents the party and the people for the first time in history and, on this basis, has paved a new road of building a party in the Songun era. He, at the same time, set a shining example in organically combining the military affairs and politics and turning the party and the army into a community linked with the same destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history in which Kim Jong Il has developed the WPK into a powerful party in the Songun era is a history in which he has successfully realized the cause of modeling the whole party on the Songun idea and ensured that the fighting spirit and traits of the People's Army prevailed throughout the party and led the people to work out epoch-making miracles and perform feats in the revolution and construction with the People's Army as a driving force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great feat performed by Kim Jong Il serves as an eternal boon of tremendous vitality in the efforts to develop the party and achieve the victory of the Songun cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "MINREX se refiere al problema de Sistema Antimisiles de EE.UU.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 16 de junio (ATCC) -- En relacion con que en estos dias, el intento de Estados Unidos de establecer el Sistema Antimisiles (DAM) llega a una fase tan grave inquietando al mundo, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 15 la siguiente declaracion: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En estos tiempos, produce una gran preocupacion y reaccion de numerosos paises del mundo el plan de EE.UU. de emplazar en Polonia y Checo de Europa Oriental las bases de cohetes interceptores y de radiolocalizacion que formaran parte de la red de la DAM y de involucrar en la region de Asia y el Pacifico a Australia, como lo hizo ya con Japon, en ese sistema. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El imperio pretexta puerilmente que el establecimiento de la DAM a escala mundial es para detener el posible ataque de misiles de nuestro pais e Iran.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pero, el sistema antimisiles no tiene nada que ver con nuestro pais desde en su concepcion original. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como es conocido por todos, la idea sobre esta empresa, que impulsa ahora la administracion Bush, se origina en el \"proyecto de defensa estrategica\" que planteo el ejecutivo de Reagan en el periodo de la guerra fria contra la ex Union Sovietica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por su dimension revelada hasta en la etapa actual resulta evidente que esta enorme red no apunta solo a un par de los paises pequenos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es ilogico que EE.UU. necesitara extender la red de defensa desde Alaska a Japon, la isla Guam y hasta la Oceania para prevenir el ataque de misiles coreanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Resulta lo mismo la ubicacion de las bases de misiles antibalisticos en Groenlandia, Inglaterra y hasta en Europa Oriental para interceptar los medios iranies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si EE.UU. se hubiera sentido amenazado de verdad de la capacidad de misiles de nuestro pais, habria aprovechado varias oportunidades de solucionarlo a traves de las negociaciones igualitarias sin tener que recurrir al malgasto de esos fabulosos fondos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya en el periodo de la administracion Clinton propusimos la negociacion de misiles a EE.UU. al tomar en consideracion la preocupacion de este y los paises europeos y a fin de lograr la confianza reciproca habiamos tomado esa medida de buena fe de interrumpir unilateral y provisionalmente el lanzamiento de misiles de largo alcance en los dias de conversaciones RPDC-EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, tan pronto como tomo la posesion, la administracion Bush desestimo tales chances y al contrario persiguio la politica exclusivamente hostil a la RPDC, lo cual nos obligo a consolidar mas las fuerzas disuasorias incluso la capacidad de misiles.\r\n  Este hecho demuestra que EE.UU. necesitaba buscar un pretexto para impulsar por la fuerza el establecimiento de la DAM. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ahora, la red de defensa antimisiles de EE.UU se alinea en direccion de apretar el continente euroasiatico desde el este y el oeste. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Prevenir la reaparicion de las fuerzas capaces de desafiar a EE.UU. estuvo en el centro de la estrategia de este pais para tomar la hegemonia mundial despues del fin de la guerra fria. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. piensa que en ese continente existen las potencias con tal capacidad y que en los ultimos anos el poderio de estas crece con mas rapidez que lo previsto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En fin de cuentas, la actual administracion norteamericana, muy inquietada por el respecto, decidio implantar precipitadamente ese escudo antimisil, aunque cuya eficiencia no fue constatada suficientemente en lo tecnologico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. calcula que si las potencias euroasiaticas se enredan en la carrera armamentista para hacer frente a la DAM, podria debilitarlas y que en el caso contrario, podria seguir completandola y ampliandola unilateralmente para hacer mas absoluta su supremacia militar al neutralizar la capacidad de represalia nuclear de las primeras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  Si se toleran estas maniobras, en el mundo se quebraran la corriente de multipolarizacion y la esperanza de la democracia y quedaran solo el chantaje y el despotismo militares de una sola potencia hegemonica. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque EE.UU. se justifica ahora pretextando la supuesta amenaza de los pequenos paises, en vista de su importancia estrategica, la DAM no es un asunto que se desvanecera cuando haya desaparecido este pretexto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al contrario, si EE.UU. sigue acusandonos persistentemente y se agudiza mas la carrera armamentista en el contorno de nuestro pais debido a las maniobras norteamericanas, no tendremos otra opcion que fortalecer mas nuestro disuasivo para la autodefensa.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
