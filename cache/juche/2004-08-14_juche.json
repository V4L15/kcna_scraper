            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Unique Idea and Theory in Socio-Class Relations \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- A major characteristic in socio-class relations at present is that a big change has taken place in the position and role played by social communities in the process of the development of the times and history, says Rodong Sinmun Friday in a signed article.\r\n This big change can be explained by the fact that the revolutionary army has emerged the driving force and the core force of the revolution, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The working class has played a role as the driving force of the revolution in the past. But the times have advanced and socio-historical conditions have changed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The working class today is fundamentally different from that in the period of industrial capitalism and proletarian revolution in view of the environment of the times, labor and social position of the working class and the actual situation of the working class movement today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary army has the highest revolutionary and militant spirit and the strongest sense of organization than any other group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army is the most revolutionary, militant and strongest revolutionary group in our society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality clearly proves that no force can replace the revolutionary army in its might as it takes the lead in foiling the imperialists' aggression and war policy and brings about social progress and the independent development and prosperity of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another major characteristic of the socio-class relations at present is that the confrontation and struggle between socialism and capitalism and between independent forces and dominationist forces have become fiercer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The class contradiction has not weakened but grown more acute in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have become keener on aggression overseas as the inflation of monopoly capital gets worse and their state political and socio-economic systems turn more reactionary and militaristic. They are, therefore, resorting to high-handed and arbitrary practices on the international arena and in every part of the world while viciously pursuing the policy of aggression and war in wanton violation of the sovereignty of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. arrogance and their policy of aggression find their vivid manifestation in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK which has unswervingly held aloft the banner of independence and socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Workers' Party of Korea, basing itself on a deep analysis of the development of the times and the changed socio-class relations, set out the idea of placing the army before the working class for the first time in the history of the revolutionary movement and has pursued the unique Songun policy which calls for advancing the overall socialist construction on the principle of giving priority to military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is precisely the reason why the WPK's Songun idea and politics display so tremendous attraction and vitality in the revolutionary practice with each passing day.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

Korean Government Lambasted for Tarnishing June 15 Joint Declaration \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 13 (KCNA) -- The Reunification Solidarity of south Korea reportedly sponsored a rally in front of Kwanghwamun in Seoul on August 7 to oppose the U.S. moves for a war in the Korean peninsula and denounce the government for tarnishing the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n At the rally Vice-Chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification Ri Kyu Jae, Permanent Co-representative of the Solidarity for Implementing the South-North Joint Declaration Kwon O Chang and other speakers said the June 15 spirit calls for settling the national issue independently by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. Noting that the government was turning its back on national cooperation and clinging to south Korea-U.S. cooperation, they said this was obviously perfidy to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They stated they would launch a campaign for the resignation of the present government, condemning the authorities' crackdown on the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification, the South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification, the south Korean Federation of University Student Councils and the south Korean Council of Youth Organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 'Flailing the U.S. policy of isolating and stifling the north, they stressed that all the people should come out in smashing the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war and achieving reunification by the efforts of the Korean nation itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution read out at the rally said the U.S. was entirely to blame for the war crisis on the Korean peninsula and the worsening south-north relations. It stated that the organization would wage a powerful struggle against the government's pro-American flunkeyist act in yielding to the U.S. pressure and dispatching troops and its anti-national behavior in impairing the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the rally, the protesters conducted information activities castigating the U.S. and the anti-reunification forces for intentionally worsening the south-north relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
