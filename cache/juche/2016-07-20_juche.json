Korea to Go Home\r\n Pyongyang, July 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army (KPA) issued a statement on Wednesday, sixty six years since the U.S. usurped the OPECON of the south Korean puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The so-called \"Taejon Agreement\" was concluded in July 1950 due to the U.S. wicked design for realizing its military domination over the whole of Korea and the Syngman Rhee traitorous clique's foolish dream about a \"north expedition\" with its master's backing.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The agreement was recorded in the history of national division as tragedy and shame in which the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' exercise of the south Korean puppet army's OPECON is guaranteed by \"law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One of the main reasons why the world points south Korea as the complete U.S. colony and its 51st state is that the former has been subject to humiliation of having transferred the elementary military right to the outsiders over sixty six years, century after century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today when power precisely means justice, nothing is more foolish and miserable to entrust one's destiny to others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the south Korean puppet army, subsidiary troops which can not act at will even a moment without the approval and permission of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea going under the mask of the \"UN Forces\", and the land of darkness is exactly south Korea as it can make no protest even if it is mercilessly trampled down under the boots and armored vehicles of the brigandish outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whenever the south Korean people turned out in an action against the U.S., the latter left no means untried to maintain the OPECON, main means for its permanent presence in south Korea, at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists made public without any hesitation their intention to postpone the period of transfer of the OPECON for an indefinite period until the puppet forces provide three conditions: \"creation of security climate\" on the Korean peninsula, its \"attainment of major military capacities\" and its \"attainment of ability for coping with the north's nuclear weapons and missiles\" by instigating the Park Geun Hye group of traitors to stop the controversial issue of transfer of the OPECON from being snow-balled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is mulling keeping control of the OPECON at any cost even by making a cock-and-bull and impudent excuses which can never work on anyone as it has a sinister scheme which it cannot abandon the OPECON.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the U.S. imperialists transfer the OPECON to the puppet forces, they will lose not only the pretext for staying in south Korea but also the excuse for interfering in the Korean issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are getting more and more dependent on the U.S. with their ambition to stand in confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north and realize their daydream about \"unification through absorption\" at any cost with the help of their master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dark curtain behind the OPECON is nothing but a clear indictment showing how persistent the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK and south Korean puppet forces' moves for confrontation with it are and how scandalous the sordid burlesque waged by the master and its stooge to meet their interests is.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet forces would be well advised to properly face up to the trend of the times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA already solemnly declared that the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are its first strike target and the puppet traitors following them would also meet the same fate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should go back home, abandoning its wicked intention for permanent stay in south Korea. This only would be a wise option for evading the coming final ruin even for a moment."

            "content": "Representacion del EPC en Phanmunjom urge a EE.UU. desistir de su intento de ocupacion perpetua del Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 20 de julio (ACNC) -- Con respecto a que se cumplen 66 anos desde cuando EE.UU. arrebato el mando de operaciones en el tiempo de guerra al ejercito titere surcoreano, el portavoz de la Representacion del Ejercito Popular de Corea en Phanmunjom hizo publica el dia 20 una declaracion. \n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el documento, en julio de 1950, quedo firmado el llamado \"convenio de Taejon\" como producto de la coincidencia de la astuta intencion de EE.UU. de tomar el control militar sobre toda Corea con la necia ambicion de la banda traidora surcoreana de Syngman Rhee de iniciar el \"avance hacia el Norte\" con la ayuda de su amo gringo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste \"convenio\" fue registrado en la historia de division de la nacion coreana como una tragedia y verguenza que garantizo \"legalmente\" el pase del mando de operaciones del ejercito surcoreano para el tiempo de guerra a las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea, critica el texto y prosigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, el mundo estima al Sur de Corea como colonia completa y 51o Estado de EE.UU. porque a lo largo de 66 anos, confia hasta la autoridad militar a las fuerzas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mundo actual donde la fuerza constituye la justicia, no habra otra cosa mas absurda y desgraciada que sujetar la vida a otros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito surcoreano es el mercenario que no puede moverse ni un momento sin la aprobacion o autorizacion de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea, disfrazadas de \"fuerzas de la ONU\". Y el Sur de Corea es la tierra obscura donde los habitantes no pueden decir ni una palabra de protesta aunque fueran atropellados por las botas militares de los gangsteres norteamericanos y las orugas de sus coches blindados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que la poblacion surcoreana libraba con vehemente indignacion la lucha antiyanqui, EE.UU. hizo todo lo posible para mantener a toda costa el mando de operaciones para el tiempo de guerra, medio principal para la ocupacion perpetua del suelo surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara hacer consumado este tema que sigue siendo polemica, EE.UU. instigo a la camarilla traidora surcoreana de Park Geun-hye a anunciar sin escrupulos que el periodo de traslado del mando se pospondra por tiempo indefinido hasta que se dieran estas tres condiciones: la creacion del ambiente de seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana, la disposicion de la capacidad militar medular del ejercito titere surcoreano y el aumento de capacidad de hacer frente a las armas nucleares y misiles norcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. esta empenado en mantener el mando presentando pretextos absurdos y descarados porque tiene un intento irrenunciable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el caso de trasladarlo a los titeres surcoreanos, perdera la justificacion de mantener su presencia militar en el Sur de Corea e intervenir en el problema coreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor su parte, los titeres surcoreanos obedecen con mas bajeza a EE.UU. con la vana ilusion de enfrentarse con la parte connacional y lograr la \"unificacion mediante la fusion de regimenes\" con la ayuda de su amo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que acontece en silencio en torno al mando de operaciones para el tiempo de guerra testimonia que son muy obstinadas la politica norteamericana de hostilidad a la RPDC y la campana de enfrentamiento fratricida de los titeres surcoreanos y es ridicula la farsa del amo y lacayo para satisfacer los intereses propios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos y los titeres surcoreanos deben ver correctamente la tendencia de la epoca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl EPC ya ha anunciado con seriedad que toma por su primer blanco de ataque a las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y tendran el mismo destino los traidores surcoreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe desistir de su siniestro intento de perpetuar la ocupacion del suelo surcoreano y retirar a casa a sus tropas ocupantes. Esto seria la opcion sensata para eludir el inminente arruinamiento final."
