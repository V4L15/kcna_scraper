This was a historic event that marked a new milestone in settling that issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the belief that the Korean people's desire for reunification would surely be achieved under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

It has also consistently adhered to the stand of developing good-neighborly and friendly relations with those capitalist countries that respect its sovereignty and are friendly to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this principle it has had multi-faceted contacts and dialogues to develop relations with countries of the EU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Normalizing relations between the DPRK and EU countries will not only give impetus to expanding and developing bilateral relations in various fields but make a positive contribution to guaranteeing peace and security in northeast Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to establish and develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries on the principle of mutual respect for sovereignty, non-interference in other's internal affairs, equality and reciprocity in the noble idea of the foreign policy. \r\n\r\n"
