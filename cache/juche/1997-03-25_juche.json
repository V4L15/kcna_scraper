It is apparent that their military moves are designed to carry out such war plans as \"new operation 5027\" they worked out with outsiders.\r\n   Kim Young Sam, who is already a dead body, bitterly condemned by the south Korean people for the crimes he has committed over the past four years since he came to power, is seeking a way out in war preparations against the north.\r\n   Our people and servicemen are now on the alert against the reckless war preparations by the U.S. and south Korean warmongers.\r\n   If the enemy provoke a war against the north, we will annihilate the provokers. \r\n\r\n"

The Kim Young Sam group are now seeking a way out of the crisis in the provocation of a war and escalating confrontation with the north allegedly for \"security\".\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries, for the purpose of hunting a pretext of reinvasion, have raised outcries over the situation of the Korean peninsula and \"contingency\".\r\n   They, in defiance of strong public demand for the withdrawal of U.S. military bases, are persistently opposing the elimination or reduction of U.S. bases on Okinawa and other areas of Japan and linking their raison d'etre with the situation of the Korean peninsula in a far-fetched way. \r\nThey are also increasing the tension in the peninsula by encouraging the south Korean puppets to war preparations.\r\n   In recent years they, for \"military exchange,\" dispatched warships and aggressive troops of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" to south Korea frequently to visit even frontline areas near the military demarcation line, while strengthening tieups with the south Korean puppet military.\r\n   The facts show how desperately Japan is trying to stage a comeback to Korea instead of apologizing for its indelible crimes against the Korean people.\r\n   Watanabe's south Korean trip, a sign of the Japanese reactionaries' hostile policy towards the DPRK, can never be tolerated.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must stop at once such criminal acts as encouraging the puppets to start a war in Korea, finding a pretext of reinvasion and seeking overseas aggression. \r\n\r\n"
