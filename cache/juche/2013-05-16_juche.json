            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects February 20 Factory of KPA\r\n Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), visited the February 20 Factory of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t This factory has a total floor space of 109,000 square meters. It is a comprehensive foodstuff processing base capable of producing varieties of foodstuff including soy, bean paste, seasoning, table oil, butter and confectionary and processing cereals at the same time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un was briefed on the monument to the on-the-spot instructions of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il standing at the entrance to the factory before looking round the room devoted to the education in revolutionary relics and the room dedicated to its history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said this factory was associated with a lot of immortal leadership feats of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly appreciated successes registered by the party members and workers of the factory in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learned in detail about production at the factory, making the rounds of its various places including seasoning shop, essential foodstuff shops No. 1 and No. 2, butter shop, instant rice shop, combined processing shop and products show room. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He asked about technical specifications and production capacity of equipment one by one, while being briefed on the shops before a map showing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He paid deep attention to the composition rate and fermentation process of raw materials for producing essential foodstuff, color of soy and bean paste and normal fineness of seasoning and packing process.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the butter shop he asked about what kind of ingredient is used. Walking between machines in the instant rice shop, he learned about how rice is cooked. He saw non-staple food to be contained in the instant rice to be eaten by soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Making the round of the combined processing shop, he tasted biscuit and learned in detail about the quantity of meat to be put into canned goods and the method of measuring them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Walking the compound of the factory, he saw it clad in thick verdure of tall dawn redwoods and trees of other species. He praised it as the factory where cultured practices are established in production and life as its compound looks like a park. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also dropped in at the canteen run by the factory to learn about service to the workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most important task facing the factory is to update its equipment and put the production processes on an automatic basis as required by the new century, he said, adding that by doing so it is possible to keep the production going at a high rate and fully ensure sanitary safety of foodstuff while saving manpower. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Underscoring the need for the officials of the factory to properly work out a business and management strategy and steadily improve the way of operation and management, he called for storing sufficient quantities of ingredients of foodstuff and steadily raising the technical skills and sense of responsibility of its employees so that quality of foodstuff may be improved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a picture taken with the employees of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and Jon Chang Bok, first vice-minister of the People's Armed Forces."

Y esta vez, al cabo de criticar mucho a la RPDC, planteo la \"internacionalizacion\", el \"aparato de seguridad\" y otras cosas absurdas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede pensar en la \"internacionalizacion\" de esa zona de desarrollo economico comun de la nacion, construida segun el espiritu del 15 de Junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, el \"aparato de seguridad\" y otros embustes significan dichos conflictivos que suponen el caso de \"rehen\" y \"retencion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl actual \"poder\" surcoreano recurre con frenesi a las maniobras de guerra nuclear de agresion a la RPDC introduciendo el portaaviones desde el territorio de Estados Unidos y expone mas abiertamente el intento de mellar y aplastar la RPDC en contubernio con su amo norteamericano. Por eso, la RPDC esta examinando si debe establecer relaciones con el actual \"poder\" surcoreano y puede resolver algo con el.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la parte surcoreana desea de veras la normalizacion de las labores de la ZIK, no debe hablar de los problemas no esenciales como comunicacion y salida de materiales sino solucionar los problemas principales y abstenerse de actos provocativos y palabras conflictivas contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAprovechamos esta oportunidad para recordarles una vez mas a las autoridades surcoreanas que el futuro de la ZIK y el posterior rumbo de las relaciones entre ambas partes coreanas dependen de la actitud de ellas."

            "content": "Es intolerable chantaje nuclear de EE.UU., apunta Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, 16 de mayo (ACNC) -- En el articulo de un comentarista militar publicado este jueves, el diario Rodong Sinmun critico a EE.UU. que se burla del ejercito y pueblo coreanos buscando el enfrentamiento con la RPDC mediante el chantaje nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Peninsula Coreana se ha convertido en el campo de ejercicio de tecnicas de guerra nuclear y el de prueba de sofisticadas armas de exterminio masivo de EE.UU. que intenta la agresion y el dominio, comienza el articulo y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, EE.UU. libro uno tras otro en las aguas maritimas de la Peninsula Coreana los ejercicios belicos incitando a las fuerzas militares surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, la prueba de fuego del portaaviones fue el movimiento militar dificil de ver hasta en la zona en visperas de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Key Resolve\" y \"Foal Eagle\" iniciados en marzo significaron el peor chantaje nuclear que persiguio la renuncia de armas nucleares por parte de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en dia, EE.UU. se concentra en la realizacion de la politica sobre la RPDC con el proposito final de agredirla y dominarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que el imperio intenta el ataque preventivo movilizando todas las fuerzas militares nucleares, la RPDC se vio obligada a enfrentarsele con las armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. se jacta de sus equipos nucleares incluyendo el portaaviones nuclear Nimitz. Pero, mientras sean mas grandes los blancos, sera mas facil atacarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC considera como parcial el debate sobre los datos de observacion satelital acerca del movimiento de misil \"Musudan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC, digna poseedora de armas nucleares, no elude la confrontacion nuclear con el imperio americano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay limites tambien en la paciencia de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ICBM de la RPDC toman por su primer blanco las bases de tropas agresoras yanquis y los uniformados de las fuerzas coheteriles estrategicas tienen sus manos sobre el boton de lanzamiento. Sera nuestra la victoria en el combate final con EE.UU. que vendra tarde o temprano."
