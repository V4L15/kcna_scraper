This is a \r\nfoolish dream, however.\r\n   If workers and people are to win the right to existence \r\nand labor liberation, they should hold high  a torchlight of \r\nthe struggle against the united states and dictatorship. \r\n   The NDFSK will vigorously fight to the end with workers \r\nand other people to overthrow the Kim Young Sam \"Government\" \r\nand surely bring about an independent, democratic new  \r\nsociety. \r\n\r\n"
