He said: The tomb of King Tongmyong was discovered and its nature scientifically proved in the 1970s thanks to the patriotic intention of the peerlessly great men and their wise guidance. It was successfully rebuilt into a mausoleum of the founder of powerful Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A work was energetically undertaken to unearth relics dating back to Koguryo in the vicinity of Pyongyang including Anhak Palace, Kwangbop Temple, the Walled City of Pyongyang, the Wall on Mt. Kobang, three tombs in Kangso, the tomb with mural paintings in Tokhung-ri, a wooden bridge across the River Taedong and restore them to their original state. This helped clarify a lot of historical and archeological problems on a scientific basis and hand national treasures down to posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dr. Ri Kwang Hui, a deputy dean of a faculty of Kim Il Sung University, in a speech made under the title \"Process of Koguryo's southward advance and historical background against which its capital was transferred to Pyongyang\" proved that Koguryo conducted strenuous activities to realize its cherished desire to unify the land where Koreans had lived as a homogenous nation for thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to explain the struggle waged by Koguryo at four stages for the unification of the three kingdoms in the period before early in the 5th century, he said that through its southward advance Koguryo made every preparation for transferring its capital to Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then the floor was taken by Assistant Professor and Master Han Yong Chan, a dean of a faculty of Kim Chol Ju University of Education, and Master Kang Se Gwon, room chief of the Academy of Social Sciences, and others. They in their papers said that the transfer of Koguryo's capital to Pyongyang raised the position and role of Pyongyang as a sacred land of the nation in the wake of the fall of Ancient Korea by carrying forward the tradition whereby importance was given to the transfer of the capital of Koguryo to Pyongyang for a long period and that after the transfer of its capital Koguryo augmented its national power and positively pursued the policy of southward advance, bringing the cause of territorial unification close to its completion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They cited facts to prove that the transfer of Koguryo's capital to Pyongyang marked an important event in giving continuity to the legitimacy of the national history and irrefutably proving the succession of kingdoms in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The symposium was attended by officials, teachers, researchers, journalists and editors in the fields of social science, education, the preservation of cultural relics and the press.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Policy of Double Standards Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, November 15 (KCNA) -- The unreasonable policy of double standards pursued by the U.S. over the nuclear issue is further increasing the danger of a nuclear war and gravely threatening global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of the double standards is evidenced by the fact that it has pushed ahead with the modernization of nuclear weapons, regarding it as a means for realizing its wild ambition to dominate the world, and revealed its undisguised scenario to mount preemptive nuclear attacks on other countries, it notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"nuclear non-proliferation\" is prompted by its impudent brigandish assertion that it has the right to threaten, blackmail and attack other countries with nukes but they should never be allowed to have access to nukes. It is wantonly violating the NPT by behaving as it pleases in utter disregard of the treaty. This application of double standards is hamstringing the process of nuclear disarmament and sparking off a global nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of the double standards over the nuclear issue finds a vivid manifestation in that it is putting pressure and sanctions upon those countries opposed to ideology and system of the U.S. under the pretext of \"nuclear issue\", while conniving at and even backing the development and production of nukes by its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. has a fair stance, it should blame Japan and Israel for their moves for nuclear weaponization and drop its partial policy of double standards, the policy of cooperating with some countries in the nuclear development while deterring those countries incurring its displeasure from conducting nuclear activities for peaceful purposes.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. nuclear strong arm policy is reducing the NPT to a dead document and egging non-nuclear states on to have access to nuclear means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. security can be guaranteed only by nuclear disarmament, not by nuclear arms buildup. If the U.S. truly stands for nuclear non-proliferation and peace, it should stop applying double standards, abide by the principle of impartiality and make a policy switchover towards the elimination of nukes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
