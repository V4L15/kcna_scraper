            "content": "KCNA blasts Japan's policy of national discrimination \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 18 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Asahi Shimbun recently conducted an opinion poll among the presidents of all universities in Japan over the issue of qualifications of graduates from foreign schools including Korean school to take university entrance exams in which 80 percent of the respondents of the state-run universities answered that they would like to offer qualifications to them, according to the paper.\r\n In this regard the authorities expressed their willingness to set out a \"policy\" to recognize the qualifications of graduates from the western international schools recognized by American and British civic institutions only to meet criticism from Korean and other schools. It is now under reexamination, the paper added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the Ministry of Education and Science of Japan in March last adopted a \"decision\" to grant only those graduates from foreign schools recognized by American or British estimation institutions qualifications to take entrance exams for state-run universities and disqualify graduates from Asian schools including Korean schools, under the pretext of carrying out the \"three-year plan for reform and ratification of regulations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This measure is an expression of Japan's hostile policy toward the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and, at the same time, a revelation of its policy of open national discrimination against the Asian people including the Korean residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan often professes \"democracy\", \"abidance by international law\" and \"international contribution.\" But the double-dealing tactics employed by Japan in this matter can not but be an anachronistic and provocative move that diametrically runs counter to the provisions of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"convention on opposing discrimination in education\" adopted at the 11th general assembly of the UNESCO in 1960 stipulates respect for diverse national educational systems, bans any form of discrimination in education and calls for giving equal opportunity and treatment to all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's action, therefore, diametrically runs counter to articles 1, 3, 4 and other basic articles of the convention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, greatly angered by the Japanese authorities' recent unreasonable behavior, are criticizing the policy of national discrimination in different parts of Japan and conducting vigorous signature campaigns demanding equal right to take university entrance exams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nProgressive Japanese and other figures are expressing support and sympathy with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly reflected in the results of the opinion poll conducted by Asahi Shimbun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is pursuing a policy of discrimination against Asians over the issue of education, taking recognition by western countries as standards. This is little short of insulting its own country and nation and betrays its political and moral vulgarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should withdraw their unreasonable policy of national discrimination and wrong \"decision\" if they value justice and conscience and respect the basic principles and requirements of international law and relations.    \r\n\r\n"

The demonstrators had protested the verdict of acquittal given to the GIs who killed two schoolgirls last year  rejecting this decision as an act of treachery that could be perpetrated only by traitors to the nation, Minju Joson today says in a commentary:\r\n As the murder of the schoolgirls was an unpardonable crime, the U.S. imperialists' verdict of acquittal was a mockery and insult to the South Korean people urging the punishment of the murderers, a probe into the truth behind the case and apology and compensation for the murder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That was why all the Koreans had condemned the U.S. for such verdict and those anti-U.S. demonstrators thronged into the U.S. military base to protest it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their action in the base was a patriotic and righteous deed intended to wreak vengeance of the slain girls and retake the dignity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Seoul district court had had a proper vision, it would have duly supported and protected those protesters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The interests and destiny of the people can never be protected and they can not live in peace even a day as long as there are those who fawn and depend on the U.S. imperialists in South Korea. The South Korean judicial authorities should refrain from going against the mind-set of the people.    \r\n\r\n"

And exchanges and cooperation are being promoted in scientific and technical fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have good feelings for the peoples of the North European countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a requirement of the trend of the times in the new century and the developing international relations to make closer the relations between the DPRK and those countries.

And it oddly invited the Korean People's Army side to this \"event\" to be attended by delegates of those countries which joined the U.S. side in the last Korean war.\r\n This move is, of course, intended to give an impression that the U.S. is working hard to remove the misunderstanding and distrust in the past and promote the reconciliation and trust in the Korean peninsula.
