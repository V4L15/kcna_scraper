He even talked nonsense that the naval skirmish in the West Sea in 2002 was orchestrated by the north to meet its strategic purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On June 29 the traitor pulled up the north, asserting that the \"Cheonan\" warship incident and the Yonphyong Island shelling incident were premeditated provocations of the north. During his recent foreign junkets, he bragged that \"should the north provoke, it will face stronger retaliation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a shriek of an old man on death-bed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is seized with extreme uneasiness and fear, taken aback by the resolution of the army and people of the DPRK to deal merciless retaliatory blows at it for its crimes against the nation and ethics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruling crisis of Lee has reached such pass where it is beyond control before the end of his tenure of office. He is finding himself in the ever more catastrophic situation due to the disclosure of hideous scandals of his families and relatives and confidants and his moves to conclude a military agreement with Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee's provocative remarks cannot be interpreted otherwise than a ridiculous behavior to soothe his clans suffering from persecution complex due to their crimes committed against the nation, improve his tattered image, divert elsewhere the attention of the angry public and thus weather the worst crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the reckless confrontation rackets kicked up by the Lee group under the patronage of the U.S. the tension on the Korean Peninsula is escalating with each passing day and the danger of a war has reached a serious phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation clearly proves that it is none other than the U.S. and the south Korean puppet group that are disturbing peace on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lee is kicking up hysteria with bluffing and ill-advised bravery, kowtowing to the U.S., but his American master would not help him escape the merciless punishment by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The lackeys' lot was always pitiful as only abandonment, doom and death awaited them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the traitor continues running recklessly like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, he will never be able to escape such miserable end as that of the erstwhile dictators including Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-Hee and the pro-U.S. lackeys of South Vietnam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Days are numbered when the traitor will meet his doom."

            "content": "Pomminryon North HQ Assails Lee Group's Renewed Confrontational Hysteria\r\n Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors of south Korea is getting frantic to crack down upon Ro Su Hui, vice-chairman of the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon) after his return to the south. He visited the DPRK to take part in an event to commemorate the 100th day since the demise of General Secretary Kim Jong Il carrying deep condolences of south Koreans of different social standings.\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group created a terror-ridden atmosphere by massively hurling puppet forces in full military gear into the south side's portion in Panmunjom and setting in motion gangster-like hangmen of the Intelligence Service (IS) and the Ministry of Unification specializing in oppressing the pro-reunification patriots. They did not hesitate to commit such a barbarous crime as taking away Ro like an animal with his neck, arms and legs tightly held just as he crossed the demarcation line. They carried Ro to the Phaju Police Station in Kyonggi Province to inquire him, not allowing him to go home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more intolerable is that the puppet group of traitors bribed such wicked and mean human scum as those of the \"alliance of the elders\" and the \"society of families of south Korean abductees\" to hold \"protest rallies\" at the entrance of the \"Unification Bridge\" in Phaju City of Kyonggi Province and made no scruple of perpetrating such hideous provocation as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with their provocative acts, ultra-right conservative media including Chosun Ilbo, Dong-A Ilbo and Daily NK have vied with each other to make invectives against Ro's visit to Pyongyang, claiming that he praised the DPRK and denounced the Lee Myung Bak \"government\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also forcibly searched Ro's house and the office room of the Pomminryon South Headquarters and arrested its secretary general without warrant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group of traitors did not hesitate to commit such thrice-cursed crimes as daring hurt the supreme leadership of the DPRK again with Ro's return as an occasion, bringing to bolder relief their true colors as confrontational maniacs. All these facts go to clearly prove once again that they are, indeed, fascist hooligans, brutes in human form and worst villains hell-bent on escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Pomminryon North Headquarters vehemently condemns the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors for their on-going vicious anti-DPRK confrontation and fascist crackdown on it, labeling them as another intolerable grave challenge to it and treacherous and anti-reunification criminal acts destroying the nation's reconciliation and unity and inciting confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro's Pyongyang visit was a token of due courtesy prompted by the desire to share sorrow over the great loss to the nation as a member of the Korean nation and achieve national unity and reunification and an entirely righteous and heroic action that deserve admiration by all Koreans in view of the traditional beautiful manners and customs of the Korean nation and the spirit of national reconciliation and unity. This can never be a crime. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Lee Myung Bak group of worst traitors that deserves punishment because it leveled guns at the fellow countrymen mourning over the big loss to the nation and barred south Koreans of many political parties and organizations and individuals from paying condolatory visits to Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification is a tripartite solidarity organization common to the nation recognized at home and abroad as it reflects the unanimous desire for reunification of Koreans in the north and the south and overseas. It has permitted its leading members to discuss the issues related to reunification, irrespective of their residing places, and done a lot of work for independence and peaceful reunification in the June 15 era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the Lee Myung Bak fascist dictatorial \"government\", an anti-reunification regime, has branded the Pomminryon South Headquarters as forces following the north, stamping out freedom of the movement for reunification and bringing its members to prisons and courts almost every day. Not content with this, the regime is imposing all sorts of inhuman molestation and suppression upon them, depriving them of even elementary human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rare to be found in the world are such despicable confrontation maniacs as the Lee Myung Bak group which barred Ro from going back to the south via Panmunjom. His Pyongyang visit was very just as he shared sorrow with fellow countrymen in the north over the great loss to the nation and took part in the events for reunification with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group was so disgusting as to ask the U.S. aggression forces in south Korea to let persons concerned of the \"UN Command\" issue through a loudspeaker from the morning a warning against Ro Su Hui's approach to Panmunjom. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's brutal suppression of Ro admits of no excuse because it already knew that south Korean people of different circles including members of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon were awaiting for Ro to welcome his return through Panmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now people in the north who gave Ro Su Hui warm hospitality and good send-off are hardly repressing their resentment at the barbarous crime committed by the puppet gangsters in Panmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are replete with the will to wipe out conservative group including the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors which perpetrated such a hideous provocation as daring hurt again the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group will never be able to escape a stern punishment as it committed an indelible treason before the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Organizations at all levels and people of south Korea should turn out as one in a nationwide struggle to get the notorious \"Security Law\" abolished, secure the release of pro-reunification patriotic champions including Ro Su Hui, make a clean sweep of the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors and open a fresh phase for independent reunification."

That is why, the U.S. has regarded the Korean Peninsula as a \"strategic vantage-point\" from which it may make a military strike at any part of Northeast Asia and \"bridgehead to the continent\" and \"advanced base in Northeast Asia\" through which it may invade China and Russia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before and after the end of World War II the U.S. attached great political importance to Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the U.S. claimed Korea was an advanced base in the East in which the U.S. was standing in confrontation with socialism and the point of political and military standoff between East and West. It was much afraid of the fact that democratic policies were implemented in the northern half of Korea and the great victory of the Korean people demonstrating the might of a new democratic state all over the world was exerting influence not only in Asia but the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From long ago, the U.S. set Korea as a theatre of political struggle on which hinged the victory in the confrontation between capitalism and socialism in Northeast Asia and regarded this confrontation as a key link decisive of the fate of American-style \"democracy\" and the fate of the entire capitalist world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once U.S. war merchant Dulles described Korea as \"a dagger\" to cut \"meat\" of Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His words meant that if the U.S. put Korea under its control, it might eat \"meat\" of Asia as it liked and, furthermore, \"land\" on the Eurasian continent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1950s the U.S. ignited the Korean War, regarding Korea as \"heart\" of Northeast Asia, advanced base in West Pacific and south Korea, in particular, as market for its surplus goods, colony and logistic base for invading the whole of Korea and a bridgehead for invasion of the Asian continent and strategic vantage point for implementing its scenario for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This scenario of the U.S. still remains unchanged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists have staged ceaseless anti-DPRK military maneuvers and stepped up arms buildup in the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity, straining the situation. This eloquently proves that the aggressive nature of the U.S. imperialists remains unchanged and it will never change."

Korean Regime's Crackdown on Pro-Reunification People Slammed\r\n Pyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The south Korean group of traitors is kicking up a wholesale crackdown after Ro Su Hui, vice-chairman of the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification (Pomminryon), went back to south Korea via Panmunjom on July 5.\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors hurled gangsters of the puppet army, the Ministry of Unification and the Intelligence Service (IS) into Panmunjom to brutally take Ro away like a baggage just as he crossed the demarcation line. They brought him to the Phaju Police Station in Kyonggi Province at which the joint investigation team made up of prosecution, police and IS are inquiring him. They also committed such fascist tyranny as forcibly searching Ro's house and the office of the Pomminryon South Headquarters and arresting its secretary general without warrant.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group set in motion such wicked and mean human scum as those of the \"alliance of the elders\" and the \"society of families of south Korean abductees\" to hold \"protest rallies\" in Panmunjom area and before the office of the Pomminryon South Headquarters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is intolerable is that the riff-raffs and human scum gathered in the southern gate of the \"Unification Bridge\" in Phaju City of Kyonggi Province at the instigation of the group of traitors to perpetrate such hideous and shuddering acts as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro praised the shining reality of the DPRK and denounced the Lee Myung Bak fascist dictatorial regime. Ultra-right conservative media including Chosun Ilbo, Dong-A Ilbo and Daily NK, as if they waited for the chance, are terming his deed crimes to mislead the public. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro visited Pyongyang to express condolences over the great loss to the nation. The Lee group kicked off a whirlwind of suppression of pro-reunification patriotic forces in south Korea and confrontation with the fellow countrymen, daring hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK with the return of Ro, a pro-reunification patriotic figure, to south Korea as a momentum. This was another hideous provocation against the DPRK and an unethical brutal act and a grave crime against reunification as it is blatant challenge to the aspiration and desire of all the Koreans for the unity of the nation and the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural for Ro to visit Pyongyang as a member of the Korean nation to express humblest tribute to the sun of the nation, the peerlessly great man who devoted all his life to the country, fellow countrymen, national unity and reunification, on behalf of all south Koreans' strong yearning for him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors labeled Ro's Pyongyang visit as \"an infiltration and escape\" and \"encouragement and appraisal of the social system in the north\" and the like. These are groundless charges and sheer sophism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How can it be a crime that he visited the land of the same nation to share bitter sorrow and called for reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Rare to be found in the world are such despicable confrontation maniacs as the Lee Myung Bak group which neither allows south Koreans to visit the north nor permits them to come back home for the mere reason that the north has differing ideology, political view and ism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group is a horde of pro-U.S. lackeys and immoral bandits who prohibit visits of south Koreans to the north where compatriots live and ban acts of praising compatriots, while allowing themselves to frequent the U.S. and please their American master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ro's Pyongyang visit was very just and patriotic deed to be admired by all Koreans in view of the traditional beautiful manners of Koreans who have shared grief with the neighbors and in the light of the present stirring reality which calls for paving a new way of achieving reconciliation and unity at an early date after defusing confrontation and distrust.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the traitors against reunification treated pro-reunification patriots like offenders, brutally cracking down upon them. This brought into bolder relief the true colors of outrageous confrontation maniacs and rogues without an equal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such behavior of the group is nothing but the last-ditch efforts to escalate the north-south confrontation in a bid to justify its bankrupt policy of confrontation with the DPRK, step up the fascist crackdown upon pro-reunification patriotic forces in south Korea through the racket for \"eliminating the forces following the north\" and thus realize its daydream of staying in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Witnessing the thrice-cursed atrocities the puppet gangsters committed against Ro which put even animals into the shade and their slandering of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, the people in the DPRK and all other compatriots and the whole world are increasing their voices critical of the group of traitors, hardly repressing their resentment against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has been keen on such unimaginable hideous crimes as leveling the gun at the people in the north who were grieving over the great loss to the nation, banning the south Koreans from paying condolatory visit to Pyongyang and dampening the ardent desire of all Koreans to praise General Secretary Kim Jong Il. It is unanimous will of all Koreans to settle accounts to the last with the Lee group no matter how frequently the sky and land may change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon the band of traitors who perpetrated such hideous crimes as gravely hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, their lifeline.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies with whom the Korean nation can never live under the same sky will never be able to escape the punishment of Heaven.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitors will have to experience what dear price they will have to pay for their crimes before they face their end."

Ademas, agrego que el combate naval en Mar Oeste de Corea en 2002 fue provocado por el Norte a base de la estrategia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 29 de junio, Lee acuso a la RPDC diciendo que los incidentes de la corbeta surcoreana \"Cheonan\" y de canonazos de la isla Yonphyong constituyen una provocacion premeditada del Norte, y hace poco durante su gira por los paises extranjeros, dijo en tono acalorado que \"si provoca el Norte, le haria recibir mayor castigo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es una desesperacion ultima de un cadaver vivo en visperas de su muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora la banda traidora se tiembla de inquietud y miedo extremados ante el coraje de venganza despiadada de los militares y civiles de la RPDC  frente a sus crimenes antinacionales y antieticos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa crisis de gobernacion del traidor Lee llego a un estado irreparable antes de terminar el periodo de su mandato y la camarilla traidora esta a punto de  arruinarse por los casos de corrupcion de tamano especial de sus parientes y colegas y las  maniobras para concertar el convenio militar con Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos disparates provocativos de Lee devienen una accion miserable destinada a animar a sus camarillas empapadas de delirio de persecucion por sus crimenes cometidos ante la nacion, rescatar ni en lo minimo su popularidad desgastada, desviar la opinion publica muy indignada, y asi salir de su peor crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a las locuras imprudentes de la banda de Lee bajo el amparo de su amo norteamericano, se ha hecho mas tensa la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y mas grave el peligro de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas circunstancias creadas comprueban evidentemente que el destructor de la paz en la Peninsula Coreana es precisamente EE.UU. y la banda titere surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque la banda de Lee actua con frenesi bajo el abrigo de EE.UU., este tampoco podra protegerla de nuestro despiadado fuego de castigo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs la ley que el final de un lacayo es tragico y le caen solo el desamparo, la destruccion y la muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el traidor sigue actuando con imprudencia, repetira los destinos tan tragicos de sus antecesores Syngman Rhee y Park Chung Hee y de los lacayos proyanquis del Sur de Vietnam."
