            "content": "KCNA Refutes U.S. Smear Campaign against DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. hard-line conservatives have become evermore undisguised in their campaign to label the DPRK a \"lawless state.\" \r\n They painted the DPRK as \"the only country in the world which is actively sponsoring crimes\", \"a criminal state linked with an organized criminal group\" and \"an abnormal state,\" asserting that it is linked with the \"group engaged in issuing counterfeit notes.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the most malignant mud-slinging at the dignified DPRK and its system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is neither surprising nor new to the DPRK that the U.S. is misleading the public opinion with sheer lies intended to give impression that the DPRK is sponsoring crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can not but take note of the fact that the U.S. hard-line conservatives have escalated the campaign to slander the DPRK as a \"lawless state\" in a phased manner after the publication of the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This campaign is part of the U.S. psychological operation to brand the DPRK as \"a lawless state\", tarnish its image and isolate and stifle its system at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By making the story about a \"lawless state\" an established fact the U.S. seeks to plug the countries participating in the six-party talks and many other countries into an offensive to pressurize the DPRK to \"scrap its nuclear program first.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A principle on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was agreed upon at the six-party talks and this laid groundwork for a substantial discussion for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, is staging ceaseless anti-DPRK psychological operations of all sorts aimed at realizing a \"regime change\" in it and forcing it to \"scrap its nuclear program first\" behind the scene of dialogue. This is spawning serious problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something unimaginable to discuss the issue of forcing the DPRK to \"scrap its nuclear program first\" given that the U.S. offensive to pressurize the DPRK has gained in an unprecedented dimension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. groundless smear campaign against the DPRK would only increase the skepticism about the former's expression of the willingness to implement the September 19 statement the keynote of which is peace, stability, respect for sovereignty and co-existence. It arouses apprehension as to the fact that the U.S. will escalate its offensive to stifle the DPRK although the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is realized in the future.\r\n The U.S. pressure campaign, therefore, throws a stumbling block in the way of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's laws assume most popular nature and serve as powerful weapons in providing genuine freedom and democracy to the Korean people.\r\n Neither slander nor calumny will ever make those laws to cease to exist as they are strictly observed thanks to the Koreans' conscious enthusiasm and sense of obligation as citizens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, the U.S. is terming the DPRK a \"criminal state\" and a \"lawless state\". This is a base political farce that can be orchestrated by the U.S. only, a country accustomed to fabricating lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and Korean-style socialism under which the entire party and all the servicepersons and people are united in single mind will remain unfazed in any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hard-line conservatives would be well advised to clearly understand this and behave themselves.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The survey group in the course of the excavation made on the basis of sufficient documents discovered a pedestal on a hill about 300 meters east of the Rimmyong-ri seat, a stone severely destroyed when the Japanese imperialists were looting it a century ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side has exerted every sincere effort to restore the monument to its former glory on the principle of historicism.\r\n It has repaved roads through which to safely transport the severely damaged monument and built broad steps leading to the monument site on the hill.\r\n A fence of modern architectural style was built in areas around the place where the monument will stand, a ground covering 100 square meters was paved for visitors and thick woodland created to add to the scenery of the surrounding areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Sok Hwan, chairman of the measure committee, when interviewed by KCNA, said that the monument was returned to Korea thanks to all Koreans' ardent patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The restoration of the monument to its former glory this year will greatly please the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad, he added.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a treacherous rash act of going against the trend of the era towards national reconciliation, independent reunification and progressive reforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves of the conservative forces are aimed at bringing back the era of confrontation and dictatorship.

And he made tireless efforts to strengthen and develop the trade unions as reliable political organization which remains true to the guidance of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his wise leadership the Korean working class stood in the van of building a new democratic Korea by intensifying the general ideological mobilization movement for nation building and emulation campaign for increased production right after the liberation of the country, defended the motherland with blood in the Fatherland Liberation War against allied forces of the imperialists to make a positive contribution to the victory in the war and played the role of vanguard in socialist construction by dashing forward under the slogan \"Charge at the speed of Chollima!\" in the post-war period.\r\n Attaching a great importance to the work of the trade unions, Kim Jong Il published a famous work \"On Further Improving the Work of the Trade Unions\". He, in the work, sets forth their goal for realizing the cause of modeling the whole society on the Juche idea and gives comprehensive answers to all the theoretical and practical problems arising in their work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has wisely led the efforts to firmly establish the system of leadership of the Party based on the revolutionary outlook on the leader within the trade unions, attain organizational unity of their ranks on a high level and make a positive contribution to carrying out the three revolutions and implementing the Party's policies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity of trade unions has been realized on a high standard, various kinds of economic agitation such as oral, visual and art agitation activities have been actively conducted in socialist construction sites and such mass campaigns as socialist emulation drive and \"the model machine movement of loyalty for emulating lathe No.26\" extensively launched. In this course, the trade unions have discharged their mission and duty as the core unit of the Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even in the difficult years of the \"Arduous March\" and forced march the trade unions were strengthened politically and ideologically and displayed to the full honor as the vanguard in the building of the great prosperous powerful nation holding high the torches of Songgang and Ranam.\r\n The GFTUK joined the World Federation of Trade Unions in May 1947. Since then, it has deepened solidarity with working people around the world. \r\n It publishes \"Rodongja Sinmun\" as an organ newspaper.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
