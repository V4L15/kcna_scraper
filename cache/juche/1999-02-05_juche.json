            "content": "Joson Sinbo on Mt. Kumgang tour of \"spokesman for Chongwadae\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- Joson Sinbo carried a signed article on the Mt. Kumgang tour of \"spokesman for Chongwadae\" of South Korea Pak Ji Won.\r\n   The author of the article said:   Pak Ji Won, together with tourists,  visited the north between January 31 and February 1 aboard the ship \"Kumgang\" of the Hyun Dai group to make a tour of Mt. Kumgang, according to a source.\r\n   Mt. Kumgang is so famous in the world that world people want to see it if only once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accordingly, it is illogical to attach \"significance\" to his Mt. Kumgang tour.\r\n   It was quite ridiculous among people that before he left for the north, the South Korean authorities ostentatiously advertised his tour as if it were a \"trip of a very important person\" and after he returned, they talked about \"particular care from the north side.\"\r\n   What astonished people is  that such deeds of the South Korean authorities and Pak Ji Won reflect their shamelessness as well as their imprudence.\r\n   As far as I know, owing to a resolute measure of the north side against the South Korean authorities' obstruction to the payment for tourism, the ship \"Kumgang\" boarded by Pak Ji Won had to stay all night in the east sea , south of the Military Demarcation Line and the tourists had to spend more than 10 hours in agony in the ship the next day. \r\nMoreover, the ship was kept under detention for two hours before returning home late at night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unluckily enough, the program of the tourists was cut short by one day and, consequently, the Hyun Dai Business Group had to pay even gratuity to the tourists.\r\n   This is a due punishment to the South Korean authorities who have obtrusively poked their noses into the Mt. Kumgang tourism pushed by the Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyun Dai group and have obstructed this non-governmental cooperation between the north and the south in every way from the beginning, crying that the Hyun Dai group failed to obtain the \"right to use Mt. Kumgang for 30 years\" from the north and that the \"timetable for the right to use must be specified.\"\r\n   It is out of common sense that the South Korean authorities have prevented the Hyun Dai Business Group from paying expenses for the tour which it is obliged to do. What is all the more astonishing are the remarks of Pak Ji Won that the painful tourism was a \"result of particular care from the north side\" and that he attained his dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No one knows what Pak Ji Won dreamed of while staying in the high sea for more than 10 hours. But, it is certain that his talk about \"dream\" is nothing but a product of his fantastic \"concept.\"\r\n   If he had a normal judgement as befits the \"spokesman of Chongwadae,\"  he should have apologized to the tourists for their painful trip caused by the South Korean authorities. \r\nNevertheless, he was busy with justifying his poor position instead of making an apology.\r\n   Indeed, he deserves the title of \"liar of Chongwadae.\"\r\n   It appears that the South Korean authorities are imitating the argument of AH-Q that to murmur is better than to keep mum when one loses his face.\r\n   In my opinion as a journalist, it is fortunate that Pak Ji Won avoided worse luck by using the psychology of AH-Q.\r\n   Pak's shame warns the South Korean authorities that if they continue to poke their nose into non-governmental cooperation, they will sustain greater misfortune. \r\n     \r\n"

That is why the joint meeting proposed to make this year a \"year of national independence and great unity\" and launch into a grand march of national reunification in reliance upon the efforts and resourcefulness of the entire nation.\r\n   The South Korean authorities' \"engagement policy towards the north\" is a policy of confrontation with the north, which runs counter to the spirit of the three principles of national reunification.\r\n   Opposition to the three principles of national reunification is as good as denying all the provisions of the inter-Korean agreement based on those principles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only when efforts are made to sustain the principles is it possible to implement the agreement with credit and achieve national reconciliation and reunification.\r\n   Drawing on a serious lesson from the previous inter-Korean dialogue, the joint meeting set forth a series of top priorities that should be done by South Korea  for a reunification-oriented dialogue. \r\n   No doubt, the fulfillment of the top priorities on the part of the South Korean authorities in the course of the first half of the year will lead to a wide-range dialogue, including inter-Korean high-level political talks, in the second half of the year, which will mark a turning-point in opening a new phase of national reunification.\r\n   Attitude toward the proposal of the DPRK for dramatic, reunification-oriented dialogue is a criterion distinguishing between stand on reunification and stand on division, between patriotic stand and traitorous stand.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not turn their faces away from the proposal or interpret it from a selfish view, but accept it with sincerity. \r\n  \r\n"
