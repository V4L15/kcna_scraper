This shows that the U.S. has no intent to hold dialogue with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. set brigandish demands unacceptable to the DPRK as preconditions for the six-party talks, a crafty trick to check the resumption of the talks and evade the responsibility.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true aim sought by the U.S. is to leave the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula unresolved and use it as a pretext for arms buildup pursuant to its return to the new Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consistent is the stand of the DPRK to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula but as the DPRK is exposed to the constant nuclear threat of the U.S. and the U.S. gets ever-more undisguised in its hostile moves against the DPRK, while reneging on its commitments, the DPRK will be left with no other option but to bolster its nuclear deterrence, unbound to anything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the DPRK has consistently insisted, the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula will be impossible unless the U.S. rolls back its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unless Washington proves in action its intent to withdraw the hostile policy, a root cause of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, the DPRK will never unilaterally move first for the resumption of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the old U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK leads to the escalation of tension, the U.S. will be held entirely accountable for it."

Korean Moves to Establish MD Slammed \r\n Pyongyang, October 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Peace Committee of Korea issued the following statement on Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the south Korean puppet group has zealously joined the U.S. in its moves to establish the missile defense system under the pretext of building the \"south Korean-style MD\", sparking off great concern and caution at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kwan Jin, puppet minister of Defense, at a recent state inspection at the \"National Assembly\" blustered that south Korea would establish multi interceptor system to cope with the missile attack of the DPRK. Kim Jang Su, chief of the security office of Chongwadae, during his tour of the U.S., asserted that it is natural that the \"south Korean-style MD\" is interlocked with the U.S. MD, hinting at the possible introduction of THAAD, the core interceptor system of the U.S. MD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the south Korean puppet group is contemplating purchasing more than a hundred Patriot missiles and relevant equipment and spare parts from the U.S. It is also blaring that south Korea will set up the ballistic guided-missile operation control station till the first half of the next year in a bid to interlock it with the U.S. theater missile defense operation control station.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an open secret that the group has joined the U.S. in its moves to build the MD while introducing AWACS, new-type radar, naval interceptor missile, ground interceptor missile, etc. under the signboard of building the \"south Korean-type MD\" since the years of Lee Myung Bak regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By introducing THAAD, the group is in the process of fully joining the U.S. in its moves to build the MD. This is a very dangerous act of rendering the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in Northeast Asia tense and sparking off missile arms race in this region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known to everybody, the U.S. MD has been strongly rebuffed from the outset as it is a product of the \"Star Wars\" initiative in the 1980s pursuant to the scenario of a nuclear war to realize the U.S. strategy for world domination.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. has desperately pushed ahead with the building of the missile shield for aggression under the pretext of \"defending\" its mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently it is keen on building MD by plugging in it even its satellite forces in a bid to attain its aggressive aims against the DPRK and other countries in the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet forces' zealously joining in the U.S. dangerous moves for a war of aggression brings into bolder relief their true colors as the U.S. war servants and special-class stooges.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the group adopted together with its U.S. master the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" calling for mounting a preemptive strike at the DPRK, a sinister ploy to join the U.S. in its moves for building MD for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When public at home and abroad is becoming increasingly critical of the group's move, it is insisting that south Korea is not joining the U.S. in its moves to build MD. But it is nothing but sophism to cover up its real intention.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To introduce core interceptor equipment of the U.S. MD and interlock them with it means a total involvement in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such move of the group will lead to spending more money collected from the south Korean people as taxes for the moves for a war of aggression, throwing their living into dire destitution and making south Korea increasingly dependent on the U.S. politically and militarily.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves stepped up by the U.S. to build a missile shield by drawing the group into it only render the situation on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity extremely tense and increase the danger of a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation clearly proves that the group is the arch criminal wrecking peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in the region and escalating tensions, pursuant to the U.S. policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's joining the U.S. in its moves to build MD is as foolish an act as inviting a nuclear disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the group does not want self-destruction, it should stop at once its reckless move.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people and other Koreans and the world peace-loving people should resolutely shatter the moves of the U.S. and the group to build MD."

She is now resorting to the theory of confrontation that there can be no dialogue and mending of relations with fellow countrymen armed with nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park declared that the confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula can be properly promoted only when the north dismantles its nukes, claiming that \"nukes of the north can never be tolerated\" and \"the line of pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force simultaneously is a sheer illusion\" whenever an opportunity presented itself. She is also begging for international cooperation, crying out for \"north's dismantlement of its nukes\" during her foreign junkets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bosses of Chongwadae, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Unification are asserting that the said process is aimed to denuclearize the north and regards north's denuclearization as a primary objective. This is what the U.S. seeks.  The said process is a product of the master and his servant's real intention to attain their aim for aggression by disarming the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of a nuclear war has reached its height on the Korean Peninsula since the emergence of the Park regime, which adopted the process as a policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and south Korea adopted the \"tailored deterrence strategy\" aimed to mount a preemptive strike at the DPRK even with nuclear armed forces in the U.S. mainland involved and the south Korean puppet forces are fully joining the U.S. in its moves to establish the missile defense system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Distrust between fellow countrymen is festering and tensions are running high due to the confrontation and war moves of the south Korean conservative group aligned with foreign forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" will bring nothing but a disaster to the nation."
