They even officially announced that \r\nthey would totally sever inter-Korean ties.\r\n   All the facts indicate that their call for \"Improvement \r\nof inter-Korean relations\", \"dialogue\" and \"peaceful \r\nunification\" is nothing but a trick to camouflage their \r\nbellicose nature as traitors and separatists.\r\n   With no trick, however, can they flee from the \r\nresponsibility for the situation of the peninsula, which has \r\nbeen driven to the brink of war. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But, \r\nit is a foolish attempt. \r\n   Now the people and the people's army in the northern half \r\nof Korea are sharpening revolutionary vigilance against the \r\npuppets' war moves. \r\n   If the south Korean warmaniacs, bereft of reason, unleash \r\na new war, we will annihilate them at a stroke. \r\n\r\n"
