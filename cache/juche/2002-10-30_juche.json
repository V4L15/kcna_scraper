Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- A South Korean society of bereaved families of those civilians killed before and after the Korean War reportedly held a memorial service in Seoul on October 26 demanding the authorities come out to make a thorough-going probe into the truth about the GIs' killings of civilians in different parts of South Korea and institute a special law for the solution to the problem.\r\n The participants recalled the fact that the Korean War crimes tribunal, which was held in New York in June last year, recommended the U.S. government to admit that the GIs' mass killings are the crimes in violation of international law and humanitarianism, open to the public all facts about atrocities and pay compensation to the victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the society made public a declaration to the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many civilians were ruthlessly killed by the U.S. forces before and after the war, the declaration said, stressing that it is our historic duty to probe the truth about the GIs' killings of civilians and reinstate them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called for striving to correctly probe the historical truth so as to straighten up the modern history.    \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Ri Hoe Chang's anti-reunification remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- Ri Hoe Chang, a presidential candidate on the ticket of the South Korean Grand National Party, is revealing more saliently his true colours as an anti-reunification element.\r\n He in a meet with mediapersons in Pusan area on October 26 adamantly opposed the inter-Korean exchange and cooperation when he said \"it is something wrong to push ahead with the relinking of the Seoul-Sinuiju and eastern coastal railways before the settlement of the nuclear issue of the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known to everybody, the relinking of the eastern and western coastal area rail and road links is now making brisk headway after the work was simultaneously kicked off in the designated areas of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not only the north and south of Korea but the whole world hailed this historic national project of relinking the main artery of the nation that has remained severed for over 50 years as it is a big stride towards Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south agreed to speed up the construction of the eastern and western coastal rail and road links at the recent 8th inter-Korean ministerial talks held in Pyongyang. It was a reflection of the common desire and efforts of all the compatriots to relink the artery of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Ri Hoe Chang and other anti-reunification elements have worked hard to hamstring the national reconciliation, exchange and cooperation, talking about the \"north wind\" and \"drain on resources\" since the very day of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. And they are becoming more desperate in their bid to torpedo the relinking of railways, even crying out for the \"north's renouncement of the nuclear development.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is intolerable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is a product of the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK. This surfaced as part of the hostile moves of the Bush administration to backpedal the positive developments in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is linking such an important matter of the nation as the relinking of railways to this issue in a bid to obstruct the project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis only goes to prove that he leaves no means untried to attain his political goal to win the presidential election with the U.S. backing by sacrificing the national interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The direct victim of the high-handed policy of foreign forces is none other than the Korean nation. \r\n Ri will not be able to escape the judgment of history for his anti-national and anti-reunification criminal acts in the service of outsiders.    \r\n\r\n"

If the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is to be settled, it is necessary to eliminate its root cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula can never be solved as long as the U.S. threatens the DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence with nuclear weapons stockpiled in South Korea and its vicinity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and the U.S. adopted the DPRK-U.S agreed framework to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula through dialogue and negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and security can be preserved on the Korean Peninsula only when a non-aggression treaty is concluded between the DPRK and the U.S. in the light of the origin of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and in view of the commitments to implement the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. seeks to stifle the DPRK by force, the people's army and people of Korea who value the sovereignty as their life and soul will counter it in a do-or-die spirit. In that case armed conflict between the DPRK and the U.S. would be unavoidable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to drop its daydream and adventure to swallow up the DPRK and accept the DPRK's just proposal for concluding the non-aggression treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the present situation where the danger of a nuclear war is increasing on the Korean Peninsula owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward the north, all those who truly love the country and the nation are called upon to actively cooperate with each other in the efforts to force the U.S. to conclude a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

But he said he was born in Mt. Paektu, grew up, hearing gun reports of the anti-Japanese war, hardened a revolutionary faith in the war fought by his parents and cultivated the will and grit in the Fatherland Liberation War against the U.S. aggression. He also said he was going and should go to any places where there were his faithful soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He left for Panmunjom early in the morning with a grand plan for national reunification and deep love for his soldiers. \r\n There is another story about his love for soldiers. Another day he was going to Panmunjom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the car almost reached Kaesong at dawn, Kim Jong Il, who woke up from a nap in the car, looked at his wristwatch and told the driver to stop the car. And he told the officials accompanying him that if they reached Panmunjom now, soldiers would be awakened from sweet sleep. He also said that for the soldiers safeguarding the frontline area, they should go to Panmunjom after two hours or so when soldiers waked up and finished their breakfast.    \r\n\r\n"

Paektu Czech-Korean Friendship Association in a protest letter to the U.S. President denounced the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, saying that the U.S. was the first to use a-bombs in the world and the very country which used biological and chemical weapons in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Russian newspaper Veteran in an article under the title \"who is to blame for dark clouds over Korean Peninsula?\" said what is certain is that unless the U.S. takes its hands off the Korean Peninsula and drops its DPRK strategy, the Korean issue can never be settled peacefully and military conflits are unavoidable. It warned that a new war on the Korean Peninsula can spill over into a disastrous global thermo-nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Workers' Party of Ireland in a statement said that if the Bush administration continues to interfere in the internal affairs of the DPRK, obsessed with the anachronistic conception of the cold war, the U.S. will stand more bitterly censured and rebuffed as it is responsible for the division of Korea and for harassing the hard-won peace process on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Bulgaria in a statement said that the evil country is none other than the U.S. the U.S. is well advised to do soul searching, well aware that the DPRK is possessed of both powerful defensive and offensive means, it urged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
