            "content": "Truth behind \"Impeachment\" in S. Korea Opened\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute issued an open letter on April 6 to inform the world of the whole story, background and the manipulation of the \"impeachment\" in south Korea.\r\n According to the open letter, such a dramatic development as the \"change of regime between the ruling and opposition parties\" took place in south Korea with the 15th \"presidential election\" in 1997 as a momentum. The ultra-rightist conservative forces including the Grand National Party was defeated once again at the 16th \"presidential election\" in 2002. As a result, they resorted to a brigandish method of seizing the regime with strength as gangsters did after being defeating in the twice consecutive \"presidential elections\".\r\n With bloodshot eyes on seizing the regime they began the \"impeachment against the president\" by taking it as a golden opportunity that the chief executive of south Korea made remarks supporting the Uri Party at a \"special invitational lecture\" on February 24 on the occasion of the first anniversary of his assumption of office as president. On March 9 they submitted to the \"National Assembly\" the \"motion on the impeachment against the president\" by adding the blame for \"scandals of his close associates\" and \"failure of economy\" to the \"breach of the law on election\".\r\n On March 11 they assembled the dissident law makers and even non-affiliated national assemblymen, secured the voting machine and thus used strength to railroad the \"motion on impeachment\" at the NA. At 11:30 a.m. of March 12 the opposition party gentries who totally \"put the NA building under their control\" declared the \"passage\" of the \"motion on impeachment against the president\" only in 27 minutes after voting started, with the result that unheard of \"impeachment\" development was caused in south Korea.\r\n This is the last-ditch efforts of those upset by the rapid growth of the patriotic forces for national independence and reunification in south Korea.\r\n The historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration opened a new era of the Korean nation itself. Road and railway links, sea and air routines are open between the north and the south through which people of all social standings come and go and dialogue,\r\ncontacts and cooperation are progressing apace between them. This made pro-U.S. sycophantic elements shudder.\r\n The \"impeachment\" development in south Korea shows an extremely anachronistic rebellion drama of the conservative forces to swim against the trend of the times toward independence, democracy and reunification and turn back the history to prolong their remaining days.\r\n The \"impeachment\" development in south Korea is the most despicable outcome produced by the old and corrupt socio-political system.\r\n The \"impeachment\" can be considered to be a fight between a big thief and a small thief in any sense. The ruling party said that as the total amount of money it swallowed up is less one tenth than what the GNP did, it would tender the \"president's\" resignation if it is surpassed. Meanwhile, the GNP, taking issue with the ruling party's \"remarks about one tenth\", blustered that the president should step down as promised because the limit passed. This is just like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\r\n The scramble for power was more shameful. By nature, it can be said that the Grand National Party and the Democratic Party are in hostile relations as they are contrary to each other in the light of their roots, compositions and isms. The two diagonally opposite parties led the \"impeachment\" in conspiracy.\r\n The \"impeachment\" is a most barbarous violence caused by the illegal and lawless darkness and mediaeval political backwardness.\r\n It was a bloodless political coup, which was manipulated by the United States behind the scene.\r\n The legitimate establishment of the \"government for the people\" supported by the anti-U.S. independent forces for the first time in south Korea made the U.S. feel deep apprehensions. The U.S. made the first-stage operation to torment and suffocate the \"government for the people\" and let it step down of its own accord and then the second-stage operation to circulate a rumor about \"impeachment\" and then push forward it.\r\n It made the third-stage operation of forcibly promoting it. Particularly, when the situation reached the climax with the \"motion on impeachment\" submitted to the NA and being approved of it, the U.S. State Department, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and others directly commanded the operations, receiving in detail reports about the \"impeachment\" through the U.S. embassy in Seoul and other local ruling machines and information network. On March 13, the next day when the \"motion on impeachment\" was passed through the NA, the U.S. rapidly dispatched the secretary of the Department of Inter-Security to south Korea to meet \"Prime Minister\" Ko Kon who is to assume the \"office of acting president\" before anyone else as a \"foreign envoy\" and thus orchestrated a burlesque of officially recognizing the \"impeachment\".\r\n  The U.S. \"March 12 impeachment\" was prompted by its strategic aim to refrain south Korea from conducting national cooperation with the DPRK, embroil the present south Korean regime more deeply into its anti-DPRK nuclear racket and its policy of stifling the DPRK and push ahead with the formation of a \"siege on north Korea and continent\" in Asia through the U.S.-Japan-south Korea tripartite cooperation.\r\n South Korea is in a political catastrophe and a state of anarchy owing to the \"impeachment\". The people are getting into rage. At least 1.6 million south Korean people have staged candlelight demonstrations against the \"impeachment\" since the \"railroad\" of the \"motion on impeachment\" through the NA. The number of organizations that participated in them is over 9,200. \"One million-people meetings for nullifying the impeachment and defending democracy\" were simultaneously held in Seoul and other areas of south Korea on\r\nMarch 20. A 10 million signature campaign against the \"impeachment\" is being conducted and a \"campaign for voting down national assemblymen who approved the motion on impeachment\" is gaining in momentum.\r\n The opposition parties including the GNP became a family in mourning. The rate of supporting them dramatically dropped and they are in a crisis of bankruptcy as curses, like chickens, come home to roost.\r\n As the \"impeachment\" development is not progressing as intended by it, the United States is giving impetus to war moves, irritated at this. Some days ago, it announced the plan to deploy an update destroyer Aegis in the East Sea of Korea which has been deployed only in the major dispute areas and strategic regions. When an opportunity presents itself, the U.S. can kick up a military coup under the pretext of the confused south Korean political situation and unleash a war against the DPRK through military provocations along the Military Demarcation Line. The proof of this is the recent incidents in Iraq, Haiti and Georgia. The historic lesson shows that the U.S. left no stone unturned to meet its strategic interests.\r\n If the U.S. and the south Korean conservative forces orchestrate other play under the pretext of the situation caused in the wake of the passage of the \"motion on impeachment\" through the NA and the political situation confused before the \"general election\", they will stir up greater resentment of the people and face all-people resistance stronger than the April 19 popular uprising and the May 18 Kwangju popular uprising. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The DPRK will answer this with a super-tough measure.\r\n Minju Joson declares this in a commentary today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While intensifying anti-DPRK moves on the Korean peninsula, the United States is setting afloat rumors that it is gaining military \"supremacy\" over the DPRK so that the latter may not take a tough stand. If we follow the U.S. logic, the responsibility for the strained situation on the Korean Peninsula rests with the DPRK taking a tough stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gangster logic of the United States can never go down with us, even if it might be acceptable to anyone else. What is clear is that the U.S. does not seek dialogue with the DPRK but is trying to disarm it and stifle it by military force at any cost. This invariable scheme of the U.S. compels the DPRK to take a counter measure for putting fresh muscles into its military deterrent force to defend its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's tough measure against the U.S. is an entirely just one allowed by the self-defensive option of a sovereign state. No one can take issue with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this occasion the DPRK advises the U.S. once again to behave with discretion, seeing who is its adversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. persist in its attempts to stifle the DPRK by military force, ignoring this warning, it would find itself fully to blame for all the unforeseeable consequences to be entailed by them. It would be too late, however bitterly it may repent of this then.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A typical example is the computer-aided U.S.-Japan mock joint war game code-named \"Yamasakura-45\" biggest ever in history which was staged recently in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. and Japan are planning to stage more than 10 joint military exercises of all arms of the three services and 3 to 5 large-scale joint military rehearsals of the three services this year. These are very ill-boding military steps aimed to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits special attention here is that Japan, instigated by the U.S., is working to carry into practice at any cost its wild designs to turn itself into a military power and stage a comeback to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is abusing the nuclear issue of the Korean peninsula as a lever for realizing its wild ambition to become a military power and stage a comeback to Korea, while creating an atmosphere of military pressure upon the DPRK and rendering the situation strained through joint war games with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      \r\n Now Japan is bursting into limelight as a dangerous aggressive force and a war-seeking state and fully assuming the aggressive, brigandish and bellicose nature of \"the Great Empire of Japan\" which ran mad in the conquest of Asia and the world in the past. If Japan's moves for militarization and overseas aggression are allowed, it will result in bringing back the hurricane of war of Japan which swept the Asia-Pacific region in the last century. Its war hurricane in the 21st century will bring more disastrous consequences than that in the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n War and disasters should be prevented. The people of the world aspiring after independence and peace should clearly see the aggressive colors of Japan and its danger and vigorously turn out in the joint action to halt and frustrate its moves of militarization and overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
