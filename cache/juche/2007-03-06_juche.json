Now they are putting spurs to the building of a military power in a bid to realize it in the new century at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are working to throw a spy satellite network in the space to commit espionage against the DPRK and other countries and round off preparations for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's madcap launching of spy satellites is a criminal act of gravely menacing peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and Asia as it is a link in the whole chain of its ever-more open moves for reinvasion of the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever growing is the danger of Japan's scheme to throw a network of spy satellites in the space under the excuse of advance detection of someone's \"threat\" and \"military action\" and use it in its overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the peace-loving progressives of the world to heighten vigilance against Japan's launching of spy satellites and moves to become a military giant, watching them on alert. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should face up to the watchful eyes of the world and give up its drive for building a military power and venturing overseas expansion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Wholesome moral traits and way of life based on revolutionary comradeship, sense of obligation and revolutionary conscience have become a social fashion.
