It is an unavoidable commitment of the United States under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. But, the United States has till now delayed the construction on one pretext or another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under such circumstances, the DPRK can not remain a passive onlooker to it and waste time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Since the U.S. considers the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, as drinking poison, there is no need for the DPRK to be bound to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has suffered a huge loss as a result of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMeasure it took to freeze its nuclear activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have no intention to suffer any more. The relevant institutions in the DPRK, including the military, are calling for taking urgent measures against the indefinite delay of the LWR construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States' persistent dilly-dallying with the construction compels the DPRK to do according to its own decision. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Smooth implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework is good for the DPRK, but it has nothing to fear when the framework agreement is broken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, the United States and the DPRK may go their own way. \r\n\r\n"

Saying the victory is in store with such devoted service made by them, he encouraged them to a fresh grand upsurge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When he visited the Songjin Steel Complex, he called upon the workers there who upheld the party with increased steel production whenever the situation was difficult, to take the lead in the grand advance in the spirit of Chollima once again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His guidance also went to Huichon, Tokchon, Manpho and other places, spreading the flames of the grand march all over the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    This year he provided ceaseless guidance to north and south Hamgyong provinces, Kangwon Province, North Phyongan Province, Jagang Province and other parts of the country so that signal achievements could be made in all parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The second grand Chollima march has displayed its great vitality from its start. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Signal achievements have been gained even under the difficult conditions in which the country is hard pressed for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A radical change was made in Kangwon Province by efforts of the whole country and the national economic plan for the first six months of this year was over-fulfilled in terms of gross industrial output value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people are filled with the firm determination to build a dignified powerful nation of Juche through this grand advance. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The \"Phunghaeru\" and \"Unwolru\" were typical \"comfort stations\" for the army, which were set up and operated by the Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A doctor of history, Kim Tok Ho, who has studied the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Japanese army, said the Japanese army installed \"comfort stations\" for its soldiers in the area they were stationed, including Pangjin, in order to manage and control them by allaying the complaints of servicemen -- that was to satisfy their sexual desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The discovery of the \"comfort stations\" for the Japanese army in Pangjin-dong was followed by the recent disclosure of a document of the \"command of the Japanese army in Korea\" which conveyed the story that the Japanese imperialists took 703 Korean women  as \"comfort women\" for the army and posted them in different Japanese army units deployed on fronts in southeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Historical facts go to prove that Japan committed never-to-be-condoned human rights abuses against the Korean people during their military occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now not only the victims and the bereaved families but the united nations, international organizations, human rights organizations and world public are holding Japan legally accountable for its wrongdoings and urging it to make state apology and compensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are still insulting the victims to sexual slavery for the Japanese army as the \"people who voluntarily provided sex to soldiers to earn money\" and are resorting to a trite trick to evade the responsibility for war crimes by giving some survivors a petty amount of \"comfort fund\" which they collected from civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people will never remain an onlooker to the unjust attempt of the Japanese government to bury into oblivion the history of grave crimes the old Japanese empire committed against the Korean people and turn to crimes against humanity again. \r\n\r\n"

The imperialists are frantically disseminating bourgeois culture by various methods by using up-to-date technological means, a colossal amount of funds and huge manpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If people take to bourgeois ideology and culture, they will naturally fall into an extremely loose, corrupt and fast life and will be reduced to vulgar ones devoid of any independent thinking and creative energy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those countries which were building socialism collapsed like a wet earthen wall overnight. This was because they neglected the work to check the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a decisive guarantee for defending the sovereignty of the nation and achieving the development of the country to block all channels through which bourgeois ideology and culture can penetrate into society while strengthening the ideological education. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Israel's decision to sell missiles to S. Korea\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today answered the question put by KCNA in connection with Israel's recent decision to sell missiles to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Israeli paper Ha'Aretz August 19 said the Israeli authorities signed with South Korea a contract on selling \"Popeye\" air-to-ground missiles worth 100 million dollars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What must not go unnoticed is the fact that a U.S. munitions monopoly is directly involved in the missile production and the U.S. Defense Department approved the deal. This clearly shows to what extent the U.S. and the South Korean authorities' moves for arms buildup and a new war have gone and what the hostile forces really seek in their anti-DPRK campaign with the far-fetched insistence that the DPRK's peaceful satellite launch was a \"missile launch\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is now massively introducing sophisticated military equipment into South Korea through its followers on the pretext of the DPRK's non-existent \"missile threat\" in a bid to escalate its pressure upon the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States and the South Korean authorities should no longer raise a hue and cry over the DPRK's \"missile issue\", but immediately stop introducing sophisticated military hardware which only renders the situation on the Korean peninsula extremely tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moreover, it is quite ridiculous of Israel to emerge a missile supplier to South Korea, after peddling the issue of halting the DPRK's  \"missile export to Middle East nations.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Israel is not qualified  to talk any more about the DPRK's  missile issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Israeli government is well advised to ponder over  who is its opponent. \r\n \r\n\r\n"
