This is little short of committing double crimes against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature, the Japanese government is under legal and moral obligations to ensure Chongryon its activities and protect the life of Koreans in Japan from a historical point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's harsh suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan is a wanton violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and a serious infringement upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese prime minister repeatedly expressed his stand not to allow any discrimination against the Koreans in Japan but treat them in a friendly manner at a time when the declaration was adopted and on several other occasions. The Japanese government, too, reconfirmed this at the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental talks for the normalization of their relations held in Beijing in February. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nonetheless, Japan styling itself a \"law-governed country\", has perpetrated the fascist suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan in a brigandish way even by mobilizing state force and increased its pressure upon the DPRK, deliberately linking the already settled \"abduction issue\" to Chongryon. How mean and base it is.\r\n Japan should know well that there is a limit to the patience of the Korean people.\r\n It is their will to certainly force the Japanese imperialists, their sworn enemy, to pay for the indelible crimes committed against them a thousand times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the report the Bush administration openly disclosed its attempt to make a preemptive attack on the DPRK, terming it again an \"outpost of tyranny\".\r\n Rodong Sinmun Friday carries a signed article in this regard, which says:\r\n The U.S. imperialist warhawks seek to mobilize a huge amount of manpower and material resources to quickly wind up a Korean war in an \"emergency\". This is nothing but a foolish miscalculation and wild fancy indicating their ignorance of the DPRK.\r\n Victory is always in store for the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has the weapon of single-minded unity of the leader, the party and the popular masses mightier than nuclear weapons. The might of this single-minded unity is inexhaustible as the party, the army and the people are closely united around the headquarters of the revolution. \r\n The Korean army is fully prepared to beat back any armed invasion of the imperialists at a single stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK all the people are armed and the whole country has been turned into a fortress. Its frontline area, rear and depth are an impregnable fortress. The Koreans have high pluck as they are led by Kim Jong Il, an invincible and illustrious commander. \r\n He is the best in military wisdom and insight, pluck and gut, strategy and tactics, military stratagem and commanding art. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is the most brilliant commander who has the world under his control and his decisions and orders lead the Koreans to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A new Korean war will turn into a real war in the 21st century. In this war unlike the Iraqi war, the DPRK will respond to the U.S. imperialists' gunfire with gunfire and their missile warfare with missile warfare. We will return one fire from them with ten or hundred fires. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A war between the DPRK and the U.S. will not be confined to the second Korean war only. The U.S. imperialist bellicose forces should clearly understand this and act with reason and discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people are the heroic army and people who have defeated two formidable imperialisms in one generation. They have always emerged victorious in the protracted stand-off with the U.S. imperialists, as seen in the Fatherland Liberation War fought in the 1950s, the case of the U.S. imperialists' armed spy ship \"Pueblo\", the case of \"EC-121\" large spy plane and the Panmunjom axe incident.\r\n The U.S. is not able to measure the mentality of the Korean army and people and the limit of their strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They value peace and do not want a war. But they will mobilize all potentials to make thousand-fold retaliation against the enemies if the latter invade even 0.001 mm of their territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The preemptive attack is, by no means, monopoly of the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
