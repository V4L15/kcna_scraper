Military experts are unanimous in commenting that it is the first time for the U.S. to deploy overseas the warship with such striking-capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Two cruisers equipped with similar missile defense system will be deployed in Yokosuka late in 2017.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the above-said warships are deployed, the number of the warships in the U.S. Navy base in Yokosuka will reach 14 including the U.S. nuclear carrier Ronald Reagan to be deployed at the end of this year, the appearance of the largest-ever warship fleet in Japan since World War II, foreign press reports said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the deployment of three warships equipped with Aegis system, the U.S. Navy base command in Yokosuka claimed it is part of the U.S. \"strategy for making a switchover to Asia-Pacific\" in a bid to \"contain\" the DPRK and China.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was also reported that the U.S. is mulling temporarily deploying four Global Hawks at the Misawa airfield of Japan from July.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these military moves under the pretext of \"containing the DPRK and China\" are aimed to kick up an overall nuclear war racket against the DPRK in the ground, air and seas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This fully revealed once again the aggressive nature of the U.S. imperialists who are making no scruple of periodically disturbing peace and stability in the region to attain their strategic and avaricious purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through a statement of the National Defence Commission the DPRK declared before the whole world that its army and people would launch a nationwide action of a new high level against the robber-like U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As clarified in the statement, the frantic moves the U.S. has stepped up for a nuclear war by introducing Chancellorsville, Global Hawk and the like would face stronger counter-actions of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to bear in mind that the DPRK has already put in place powerful strike group equipped with strategic and tactical rockets to cope with its missile threat.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is required to pay heed to the DPRK's warning that it is ready for conventional or nuclear or cyber wars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people still remember and will never forget such crime committed by the U.S. against humanity 70 years ago as dropping atomic bombs over Hiroshima and Nagasaki to achieve its strategic aim.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a serious miscalculation and daydream for the U.S. to think it can employ the same method on the Korean peninsula as what it did to attain its purpose.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that if the U.S. nuclear maniacs ignite a nuclear war on the peninsula at any cost, they will perish in the flames kindled by themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After all, the U.S. styling itself \"the world's only superpower\" will precipitate its final ruin."
