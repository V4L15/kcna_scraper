            "content": "KCNA assails GNP's fuss about suspected secret financial aid to north \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 4 (KCNA) -- Anti-reunification elements of the South Korean Grand National Party are making much ado about \"suspected secret aid worth 400 million U.S. dollars to the north.\"\r\n The GNP representative called a press conference on Sept. 26 at which he absurdly claimed that the present South Korean authorities sent 400 million U.S. dollars to the north in secrecy for the north-south summit talks. He made malignant accusations against the north, terming the alleged offer of fund an \"enemy-benefiting act\" and \"support for the north's efforts to increase its combat power.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Circulated at a plenary meeting of the GNP held on. Sept. 27 was a resolution containing the provocative sentence that the recent case proved that \"the reunification issue was reduced to mean bribery.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With this as a momentum the GNP motley crew kicked off a ruckus over the \"suspicion\" as if something shocking had happened. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a ridiculous burlesque. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The farce is, in a nutshell, a carefully orchestrated operation to defeat its rival by accusing it of an \"enemy-benefiting\" act with the presidential election at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This row can never be tolerated as it is a thrice-cursed criminal act intended to ditch the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a landmark of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As known to all, the GNP anti-reunification elements have opposed the historic joint declaration ever since its publication, always displeased with the process to improve the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inter-Korean relations are rapidly turning favorable for reconciliation and cooperation as the joint declaration is demonstrating its great validity. The GNP views this development as a happening quite unfavorable for its presidential campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, they felt an urgent need to orchestrate a \"shocking incident\" to ditch the joint declaration and freeze the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hence, the GNP dreamed up the farce \"suspected secret financial aid to the north\" and orchestrated it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never overlook the GNP's foolish burlesque as it has been keen on cooling the inter-Korean relations whenever there was a sign of their improvement and cooked up \"incidents\", talking about \"northward wind\" or something before elections in particular, in a bid to disturb the process of national reconciliation, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will certainly make the GNP anti-reunification elements pay for having hatched plots against the north, swimming against the nation's will for reunification.    \r\n   \r\n"

If neglected, it will be impossible to defend the country from aggressors and escape from slavery, much less protecting the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula has remained divided into the north and the south for over half a century due to the separatists, the aggressors, and the DPRK and the U.S. are technically at war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is contemplating about the use of even nuclear weapons against the DPRK after singling out it as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of a nuclear attack. This compels the DPRK to further increase its capability for self-defence. \r\n The Korean people do not want humiliating and slavery-imposing peace even if they may die. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK army-based policy is the most powerful political mode in the era of the army-centred policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will in the future, too, energetically push ahead with the work to strengthen the self-defensive armed forces in every way under the uplifted banner of independence, peace and socialism, so as to firmly defend the sovereignty of the country, socialism and peace and achieve the nation's prosperity and progress.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
