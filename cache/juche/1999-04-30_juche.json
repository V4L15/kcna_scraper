It keeps close scrutiny over movement of North Korea in relation to the Balkan war, he remarked.\r\n   Commenting on his remarks, Rodong Sinmun today says:\r\n   These remarks reveal the U.S. invariable intention to provoke a second Korean war.\r\n   Under its strategy, which is to conduct two wars at the same time in major areas, the U.S. seeks to ignite another war of aggression in the Korean peninsula, the main gate to Asia, while the war is going on in the Balkans.\r\n   Unusual movements of the U.S. troops in and around South Korea indicate that another Korean war is on the point of outbreak.\r\n   The relations between the DPRK and the United States, which are technically at war, are getting from bad to worse owing to the latter's adventurous maneuvers against the former. Under this situation, the U.S. provocative military actions may cause an armed conflict and a total war between the two states.\r\n   The DPRK is in full readiness to strongly counter any aggression on its initiative.   We warn that war on the Korean peninsula, which may be provoked by the U.S., will be quite different from the past Iraqi crisis and the present conflict in Yugoslavia.\r\n   The United States should think twice before recklessly throwing down the glove to fight the DPRK.       \r\n\r\n"

It deserves caution and deep apprehensions from the people in this region.\r\n   The recently-approved legislation included a \" bill on security in emergency in surrounding areas.\"  The bill legally guarantees the Japanese reactionaries \" support to the U.S.\"   in \" emergency in surrounding areas,\"   not in \" emergency in Japan.\"   The Japanese reactionaries opened up a broad road to reinvasion for obtaining hegemony and lording it over in Asia with the backing of the U.S.\r\n   Their criminal intention can clearly be seen in a just-okayed \" draft amendment to the law on the Self-Defense Forces.\"  They describe the \" draft amendment\"       as the one for rescuing the Japanese overseas by warships of the \"SDF.\"    \r\n   As a matter of fact, this means that they are to push ahead with the dispatch of the \"SDF\"  for overseas aggression in full swing.\r\n   From this the legislation is the aggressive war one to realise the old dream of the \" Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\"  and a criminal mechanism which may wreck peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and inflict all sorts of misfortunes and pains upon the people in this region.\r\n   The point at issue is that the legislation was approved by the diet. The approval eloquently proves that the diet is reduced to be a virtual waiting maid of the reactionary Japanese government and it is a group of militarist reactionaries going against public opinion and the trend of the times.\r\n   It goes without saying that the legislation aims at the DPRK.\r\n   The primary target of the \"bill on security in emergency in surrounding areas\"       is \" emergency on the Korean peninsula\"  and the primary target of the overseas dispatch of the \"SDF\"  is the DPRK.\r\n   All this clearly shows that the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion against the DPRK have reached a dangerous stage of practice. As a consequence, the military situation on the peninsula is so tense that a war may break out any moment.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare stage a comeback, ignoring our warnings, they are bound to meet a thousandfold retaliatory strike.       \r\n\r\n\r\n"
