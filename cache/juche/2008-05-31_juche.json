            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Traitorous \"Pragmatism\" under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 30 (KCNA) -- The \"pragmatism\" advocated by the Lee Myung Bak group has resulted in nothing but increasing south Korea's colonial dependence, aggravating economic bankruptcy and impoverishment of people's living and bedeviling inter-Korean relations. With nothing can it justify \"pragmatism\" or convince anybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in its commentator's article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unacceptable is \"pragmatism\" touted by the Lee Myung Bak group as it is a criminal move to cover up their true colors as sycophantic traitors keen on confrontation with the north, stem the trend of the times towards independent reunification and peace and prosperity and reduce the inter-Korean relations to a plaything of outside forces, the article asserts, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee's loudmouthed \"pragmatism\" is nothing but a treacherous rash act as it negates the idea common to the nation and incites confrontation with fellow countrymen, ignoring the fundamental characteristics and reality of the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"No nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" peddled by traitor Lee Myung Bak as a \"policy toward the north\" suffices to prove that he is desperately pursuing the confrontation between the north and the south in ideology, ism and system while calling for someone's \"change\" and blaming \"human rights issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lurking behind the signboard of \"pragmatism\" put up by Lee is his reactionary intention to negate and quell the spirit of \"By our nation itself\", the idea common to the nation clarified in the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Pragmatism\" on the lips of Lee is no more than an anti- reunification watchword as it is intended to reduce the inter-Korean relations to those between businessmen seeking selfish aims and perpetuate the national division in his own interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"National interests\" and \"reciprocity\" oft-repeated by the Lee group are quite contrary to the principle governing the inter-Korean relations and the purpose of inter-Korean cooperation reflecting the unanimous will of the nation. These phraseologies go to prove that they are seized with the philistine disposition of the mean-spirited dealers who give primary consideration to narrow-minded pursuit of interests and seek their own profits, utterly indifferent to interests common to the nation and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee's \"pragmatism\" is little short of a hideous act of treachery as it is intended to sell off the national interests to the outsiders and make the dignity and sovereignty of the nation their plaything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the signboard of \"pragmatic diplomacy\" Lee advocated the \"priority to the south Korea-U.S. relations\", claiming that the \"development of inter-Korean relations is possible only when the relations between south Korea and the U.S. remain good.\" He also blustered that he would deal with the inter-Koreans relations depending on the relations with the U.S. He went the lengths of uttering that he would settle the issue of inter-Korean relations in the context of external relations by internationalizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lee, not satisfied with leaving south Korea to the tender mercy of outside forces, seeks to make the inter-Korean relations subject to the relations with the U.S in a bid to sell off the national interests to foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior motive of Lee's \"pragmatism\" was brought to light by the recent visits he paid to the U.S. and Japan under the signboard of \"pragmatic diplomacy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He described cooperation with fellow countrymen as a \"drain on resources\", but was busy offering everything to his American and Japanese masters, disgustingly kowtowing to them. This is truth of the Lee group's loudmouthed \"programmatic diplomacy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All those facts go to prove that \"pragmatism\" much publicized by Lee is nothing but a fig-leaf to cover up the true colors of the Lee group as traitors and anti-reunification elements as it is the most odious sycophantic and treacherous watchword and the one aimed at realizing his political ambition by sacrificing the national interests to serve the outside forces. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
