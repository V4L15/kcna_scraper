            "content": "U.S. Reckless Plan for New Nuclear War Commanding System under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 29 (KCNA) --It was disclosed by a document of the U.S. forces on May 1 that Washington laid down a policy of allowing the commanders of the U.S. combined forces in different parts of the world including the Pacific forces to which the U.S. troops in Japan belong to request the president to permit the use of tactical nuclear weapons in case the U.S. and Japan and other allies are faced with the danger of WMD attacks by \"rogue states\" and terrorist organizations.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Sunday says in a signed article: The document called \"doctrine of combined operations\" was worked out by an order of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff at the outset of the year. This is a criminal plan to turn the whole world into shambles of a nuclear war and bring a fatal disaster to humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There has been the nuclear war commanding system whereby the U.S. president alone can order the use of nukes. But this document calls for transferring this right to the commanders of U.S. regional combined forces, making it possible to turn all its wars of aggression into nuclear ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently disclosed \"doctrine of combined operations\" clearly reveals the bellicose, aggressive and vicious nature of the Bush forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the doctrine, they limitlessly expanded the sphere of its use of nuclear weapons. This is a very dangerous military measure as it designates the whole world as targets of the U.S. nuclear strike. In a word, the doctrine allows the commanders of U.S. regional combined forces to use nuclear weapons against any country under any pretext irrespective of time, place and target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces regard the Korean Peninsula as the primary target of their nuclear strike in the 21st century. They listed the DPRK as part of \"an axis of evil\" and a target of its preemptive nuclear attack. They are busy with their moves to set up a regional combined command for a new Korean war, while shipping new type nuclear weapons into south Korea and its vicinity under the pretext of reorganization of U.S. troops. These days the U.S. warmongers are threatening the DPRK that they would launch a preemptive nuclear attack upon it without a warning. They have spent a huge amount of money to develop smaller nukes to be used in the new Korean war. They are contemplating using the nuclear war to be started by them on the Korean Peninsula as a prelude to converting all wars of aggression into nuclear ones. Herein lies the great danger of the U.S. moves to set up a new nuclear war commanding system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such U.S. moves will only lead to a global nuclear arms race and increase the danger of a thermonuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. persistently keep to the road of a nuclear war as now, it will never be able to escape self-destruction in the war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Report on Remains of Korean Victims of Forcible Drafting Issued\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 28 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Committee for Demanding Compensation to Comfort Women for the Japanese Army and the Victims of Forcible Drafting succeeded in finding out the bereaved families of those who were killed after being driven to shambles of the war of aggression as \"servicemen\" and \"civilian employees\" by the imperial Japanese army and probed the truth about some of their remains in the course of surveying the lists of remains of the Korean victims of forcible drafting at the Yutenji Temple in Tokyo in recent years. The committee issued a report on the results of the survey on May 27.\r\n Referring to the course and results of the survey, the report said: The committee received the lists of the remains from the fact-finding group of forcible drafting of Koreans in Japan at the outset of 2004 and made a survey on its basis keeping in touch with the relevant institutions. Its results said 430 persons among 1,135 on the lists are those from the northern half of Korea and 315 of those persons were taken away as \"servicemen\" and \"civilian employees\" of the ground force of the imperial Japanese army and 114 of them as \"servicemen\" and \"civilian employees\" of the naval force of the imperial Japanese army and they include one man whose identity remains unknown. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most of them are believed to have died against their grudge while being subject to slavery for the army and doing forced labor after being driven to shambles of war of aggression as \"servicemen\" and \"civilian employees \" from all areas of Korea including North and South Hamgyong, North and South Phyongan, Hwanghae and Kangwon provinces by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the finding out of bereaved families of some of the victims including Kim Jong Phyo (Seihyo Kaneshiro) No. 731 registered in the Japanese name on the lists of remains and their testimonies, the report said: This tells what bitter mental pain the bereaved families have suffered for more than 60 years, without knowing the fate of their sons and daughters and relatives and terms the inhuman behavior of the Japanese authorities toward the issue of remains of the victims of forcible drafting of Koreans a criminal act of adding to Japan's crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee confirmed through the survey of the lists of remains that remains of not a few victims were found to be mixed with remains of other persons and the boxes of remains contained various kinds of garbage instead of bones. It also mentioned how badly the remains of the victims of forcible drafting of Koreans were preserved and handled at several temples in different parts of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing to the disclosure of the surprising fact through the survey that the remains of victims of forcible drafting of Koreans of north Korean origin are buried at \"Yasukuni Shrine\", the report accused the Japanese government of committing a double or treble criminal act of infringing upon their rights and dignity by bringing their tablets to the shrine which honors class A war criminals including Hideki Tojo to symbolize Japanese militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report cited concrete facts to prove that the Japanese government has not clarified its view on the issue of the remains of Korean victims of forcible drafting and has taken no measure for the settlement of the issue although it is 60 years since Japan's defeat in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the report, the Japanese government has conducted more than 300 campaigns to collect remains of soldiers and military employees of the imperial Japanese army since 1952 which resulted in retrieving remains of 1.24 million persons. This year it is contemplating spending 57.9 billion yen to fund the \"undertaking concerning the 60th anniversary of the end of the war\" under the pretext of paying state homage to the soldiers, military employees and associate military employees who served the imperial army and their bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact-finding group of forcible drafting of Koreans recently clarified that 10.96,368 billion yen worth of deposit money (counted at the market price 120 times the value of currency in 1994) are kept at the Legal Affairs Bureau in Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that since Japan's defeat its government has failed to hand over to the DPRK even remains of one victim of north Korean origin although it did to south Korea remains of about 8,800 victims of south Korean origin including those preserved by the government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling attention to the fact that this year marks the 60th anniversary of  Japan's defeat, the report urged the Japanese government to thoroughly and comprehensively probe the truth behind the issue of the remains of Korean victims of forcible drafting, open the whole story to the public without delay, admit the state responsibility for it, make a formal apology and compensation to the victims and their bereaved families, find out remains of all victims and help bury them either at their native places or places where their relatives reside as desired by their bereaved families. It also underlined the need to ferret out all criminals who spawned the issue of remains and impose stern punishment upon them according to their accountability.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it arrested him recently under the strong denunciation and pressure of the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly shows again the double-faced nature of the U.S. which is clamoring for \"eradication of terrorism\" and \"war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. policy of \"anti-terrorism\" to invoke international law for \"anti-terrorism\" if necessary and ignore it in case of handicap. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. describes those terrorists serving the \"spread of American-style liberty and democracy\" as \"political exiles\" or \"dissidents\" to provide them with refuges and protect them. But it labels those countries which go against the grain with it as \"sponsors of terrorism.\" This impure action of the U.S. invites strong protest and indignation from the world over. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the  U.S. continues to resort to double-standards in the \"war on terrorism\", it will face greater curse and denunciation from the Korean people and the world public.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Everybody should not forget the fact that the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula occurred because the U.S. has deployed a huge amount of nukes in and around south Korea and threatened north Korea for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North Korea joined the NPT for two reasons -- the first is to remove the U.S. nuclear threat and the second is to sufficiently solve the problem of national electricity with nuclear power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. has worked hard to use the IAEA inspection as leverage of military espionage and pressure on north Korea and staged large-scale war maneuvers in the Korean Peninsula every year. This behavior compelled the DPRK to withdraw from the NPT to defend its supreme interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s several rounds of bilateral talks were held between the DPRK and the U.S. and in October, 1994, the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework was adopted with a view to fundamentally settling the nuclear issue of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, however, did not implement its duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seems that the United States has no intention to implement the AF and expects that the political system of north Korea will collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January of 2002, Bush designated north Korea as well as Iraq and Iran as part of an \"axis of evil\" and then as a target of nuclear preemptive attack.\r\n In January, 2003, the DPRK withdrew from the NPT to defend the sovereignty of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
