            "content": "Truth on \"suspected kidnapping of Japanese girl\" \r\n Pyongyang, April 28 (KCNA) -- The DPRK Measure Committee for Japan's Compensations to the \"Comfort Women for the Army\" and Pacific War Victims made public detailed information on the \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" case.  It says:\r\n   A queer probe into the \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl by an operative of north Korea\" is being tenaciously made in Japan.\r\n   Judging from the fact that not only an opposition politician but also Japan-resident Koreans were kidnapped unhesitatingly by the puppet agency for National Security Planning (ANSP) of South Korea in the land of Japan styling itself a \"law-governed state\", it is clear what the current racket is seeking.\r\n   We have warned more than once that the conservative politicians and venal media of Japan should clearly distinguish between justice and injustice and open their mouth instead of joining the \"ANSP\" of south Korea in its third-rate trick.\r\n   In disregard of our repeated warnings, however, they, on a political order from the south Korean puppets, have persistently misled the public opinion, vociferating about a fiction full of falsity and deception and reversing white and black. To make matters worse, some Japanese politicians who pretend to have reasonable judgement took as true the \"testimonies\" given by \"witnesses\" produced by the \"ANSP\" and inaugurated a \"superpartisan dietmen's league\" to probe the suspected abduction in an attempt to make the case a fait accompli.\r\n   This compels us to clarify the truth behind \"the suspected kidnapping case\".\r\n\r\n     \"Kidnapping case\" faked up by the headquarters of terrorism and kidnapping\r\n\r\n   There is no need to say that the case of \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" was a dastardly political drama produced by the south Korean puppets to incite the oonsciousness of extreme confrontation against the DPRK and an anti-DPRK campaign of some pro-south Korean conservative politicians of Japan who have joined in the trick of the south Korean puppets.\r\n   History proves that south Korea is a hotbed of terrorism and abduction.\r\n   The successive rulers of south Korea unhesitatingly committed acts of terrorism and abduction and invented shocking cases against the DPRK whenever they were seized with the ruling crisis.\r\n   In 1967 when feelings of democratisation of society and peaceful reunification showed signs of activity in south Korea, the \"Korean Central Intelligency Agency\", the predecessor of the \"ANSP,\" fabricated a \"case of operatives' team  aimed at communising south Korea\". In consequence,  famous musician Yun I Sang and scores of overseas Koreans were kidnapped and carried to south Korea from West Germany, France, Italy and other west European countries. Many of them were harshly executed.\r\n   South Korean opposition figure Kim Dae Jung was kidnapped in broad daylight in the centre of Tokyo on august 8, 1973.\r\n   The south Korean puppets kidnapped Han Yong Gil, an official of the south Korean trade legation in Paris, after killing his wife in August 1979. The south Korean puppets murdered Kim Hyong Uk, former chief of the \"Korean Central Intelligence Agency\", at an underground cell of \"Chongwadae\".\r\n   Cases of terrorism and abduction of Japan-resident Koreans in Japan more glaringly disclosed the true colors of the south Korean puppets as terrorists and kidnappers.\r\n   Among them were the case of the kidnapping of the deputy director of Sidae in downtown Tokyo on September 17, 1976, the abduction of \"Mindan-lining Japan-resident Korean Son Yu Hyong, his wife and son in June 1981 and the \"case of spy Ryang Tal Jin\" whom the south Korean puppets kidnapped after inviting him to \"visit the hometown.\"\r\n   The \"ANSP\" has fattened up and its methods of terrorism, abduction and murder have become more cruel since the Kim Young Sam \"civilian\"-veiled regime made its appearance.\r\n   A large number of cases of terrorism and abduction including the \"spy case of Kim Sam Sok and his sister\" of September 1993 have been produced by the \"ANSP\" under the \"civilian\"-veiled \"Government.\"\r\n   This time, the agency produced a false drama called \"kidnapping of a Japanese girl by a north Korean operative\" in the land of Japan.\r\n   If it is true that some Japanese girls have been missing since the 1970s, it is certain where they were taken to and for what purpose they have been used.\r\n   The culprit is none other than the \"ANSP\" of south Korea, which worked out even the worst script for confrontation with the DPRK.\r\n\r\n          What the \"suspected kidnapping\" case seeks\r\n\r\n   All cases of terrorism and abduction produced by the south Korean puppets have been used as a political gamble to incite the consciousness of extreme confrontation with the DPRK, divert elsewhere the attention of the people and the political camp and thus bring the ruling crisis under control.\r\n   The \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" was also faked up as a link in the chain of operations of the \"ANSP\" to bridge over the crisis.\r\n   It is a trite method of the south Korean puppets to produce false cases whenever their ruling crisis goes into the extremity.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam group are in a crisis owing to the crimes they have committed and to their involvement in the Hanbo incident, the largest-ever scandal of irregularities and corruption.\r\n   Foreign press reports said that the Hanbo typhoon, which blew away the \"absolute power\" and morality of Kim Young Sam, is shaking the south Korean regime to its very foundation.\r\n  Although the Kim Young Sam group employed all conceivable tricks and artifices, they could not win support and divert elsehwere the attention of the people and press media. So, as the last method, they needed to fabricate a shocking case with another country as a theatre.\r\n   This is one of the main purposes sought by the Kim Young Sam group when they produced the \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" with Japan as a theatre.\r\n   Another purpose of the Kim Young Sam group is to incite the consciousness of confrontation against the DPRK among the Japanese people, bar the progress of the relations between the DPRK and Japan and weaken the humanitarian assistance of the international community to the DPRK. to attain these sinister purposes, the south Korean puppets stood as \"witnesses\" those criminals who defected from the DPRK, and conservative politicians and venal media of Japan joined in the campaign for their own purpose. \r\n   Japan is the only country which has refused to atone for the indelible crimes against the Korean people for more than half a century.\r\n   The clamourings of the conservative politicians of Japan about \"suspected kidnapping of a Japanese girl\" are aimed at escaping from the moral blame for this refusal, by branding the DPRK as a terrorist state.\r\n   However, it is a miscalculation.\r\n   They would be well advised to know that the false drama will only bring their immorality and political ignorance into bolder relief. The more frenziedly they may engage themselves in anti-DPRK smear campaign, the bitterer the denunciation of them by the people at home and abroad will become.\r\n   The conservative politicians and venal media of Japan should look squarely at the reality, stop joining hands with the south Korean puppets in their frantic smear campaign and try to make probe into the truth before it is too late.\r\n   That is a correct prescription for the \"suspected kidnapping case\". \r\n\r\n"

According to the \"information,\" an unidentified \"ex-operative\" of north Korea who is also a \"defector\" heard from a hospital mate that north Korea \"kidnapped\" a Japanese middle school girl who is supposed to be the one missing in Niigata, Japan, twenty years ago.\r\n   The \"case\" is thus based on preposterous speculation and supposition so that even the Japanese authorities call it a \"suspicion.\"\r\n   Judging from the fact that the \"case\" was raised by the puppet agency for National Security Planning of South Korea, it is not hard to guess the nature and truth of the \"case.\"\r\n   We have no need and no wish to kidnap a middle school girl in Japan.\r\n   Although the Japanese Government is \"investigating\" the \"case,\" facts clearly show that the DPRK has nothing to do with it.\r\n   Because hostile forces had often launched an anti-DPRK smear campaign and we had no idea of the \"case,\" we did not mind it at first.\r\n   But, the background of the \"case\" is being brought to light and the \"case\" is turning into something against the dignity of the DPRK, we cannot but make our position clear.\r\n   It is obvious that the south Korean puppets abruptly concocted the false case in a bid to prevent Japan from setting out on the improvement of relations with the DPRK in step with the progress in DPRK-U.S. relations.\r\n   Nevertheless, some officials and media of Japan in concert with the south Korean puppets link the cases of people missing in Japan with the DPRK in a far-fetched way and raise the problem at the diet. They even formed a lliaison society of families of missing people\" and \"dietmen's league for probe into the suspected kidnapping,\" inciting hostile feelings toward the DPRK as never before.\r\n   Japan will be the only victim if it is involved in the plot of the south Korean puppets.\r\n   If the Japanese authorities, far from atoning for the past crimes and making sincere efforts to improve ties with the DPRK, continue with the smear campaign against the DPRK over the false case, we will be compelled to think that Japan is not interested in improvement of bilateral ties but is willing to stand in confrontation with the DPRK.   and then, we will have to take legitimate countermeasures. \r\n\r\n"
