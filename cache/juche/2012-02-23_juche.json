This is a mockery and insult to the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The planned \"nuclear security summit\" is continuity and extension of the U.S. and south Korea's nuclear racket against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the \"summit\" south Korea seeks to justify its smear anti-DPRK campaign and a nuclear war moves by taking advantage of the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK under the pretext of non-existent \"nuclear threat\" from it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its foolish immediate objective is to divert public criticism stemming from its total domestic and foreign policy failure and evade a stern judgment by the people through \"general election\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak regime, which is more dead than alive being isolated in and out, is making efforts to whitewash itself, availing itself of the \"summit\".

This is a revelation of their criminal intention to go without settling the crimes committed in the past and repeat their history of aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says if Japan launches militarist overseas aggression again, seized by its foolish daydream, failing to face up to the situation, it will never get rid of the abyss of ruin."
