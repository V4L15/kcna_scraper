Korean authorities hit for trying to repress labor movement\r\n  Pyongyang, May 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities fabricated \"five-point policy for prevention of illegal demonstration\" and \"six-point policy for prevention of illegal strike\" and began pursuing them.\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today describes this as a vicious, unjustifiable and brigandish act.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The recent fascist suppression is a prelude to a new repressive offensive against labor movement and an anti-worker and anti-social act which cannot be justified in any case.\r\n   The South Korean authorities threatened to crack down upon just demonstrations of the workers, talking about \"revival of the economy\".\r\n   It is clear that the \"government\" which has robbed the the workers of their right to existence and is now trying to repress them, cannot become a \"government for the sake of the people\".\r\n   Though the Kim Young Sam-led \"government\" of traitors under the \"civilian\" veil described the workers' struggle as enemy-benefiting, the present \"government\" authorities describe the struggle as \"illegal.\" No doubt, the incumbent rulers will outdistance Kim Young Sam's regime in repressing the workers.\r\n   There is a lesson drawn from the miserable end of the \"civilian\"-veiled dictatorship.\r\n   If the present \"government\" looks down on the barchanded poor people and turns its back on them, it will face a bitter condemnation from the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The whole country is engaged in farming this year, too. \r\n   Agricultural working people, servicemen and helpers are stepping up the transplanting of humus-pot maize seedlings. \r\n   South Hwanghae and South Phyongan provinces take the lead in this work.\r\n   Rice-transplanting began on many cooperative farms throughout the country.\r\n   Labor innovations are also reported from coal industry.\r\n   All coal mines are securing more coal fields and increasing production of coal by concentrating on tunnelling and pit construction.\r\n   Anju and Kaechon area coal mines built large-scale coal cutting faces to produce thousands of tons of coal more than their daily quotas. Sunchon and Tokchon area coal mines discovered coal fields of big deposits.\r\n   Electric power industry is gaining brilliant successes in production and construction. Large thermal and hydraulic power stations are systematically increasing the production of electricity.\r\n   This year more than 130 minor hydraulic power stations and some 400 substitute fuel-burning stations were built and hundreds of wind power plants were built to be commissioned. \r\n   Many units, therefore, meet the increasing demand for electricity by their own efforts. The construction of hundreds of minor power stations is in full swing throughout the country.\r\n   Railway transport workers are achieving great successes by laying solid material and technical foundations.\r\n   Steel and iron works are increasing the production to supply rolled steel of various standards and qualities to different domains of the national economy.\r\n   Dazzling successes are also gained in machine-building, chemical, building-materials and timber industries and many other fields of the national economy.\r\n   The project to build a new street between the Kumsusan Memorial Palace and the Pyongyang Airport as well as a more grandiose and beautiful capital city is successfully pushed forward.\r\n   The Korean people, full of faith and optimism,  are pushing ahead with the struggle to greet the 50th founding anniversary of the DPRK with a great pride and honor of being socialist victors.    \r\n\r\n"

The Japanese government is now trying not to make an apology and compensation for the criminal \"comfort women\" issue.\r\n  The Korean people and the progressives of the world will let Japan file an apology and compensation for the anti-ethic crime committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past.\r\n   It is ridiculous of the Japanese government to gain something in reliance upon the craftiness and shamelessness congenial to it.\r\n   The Japanese government should be aware of the trend of the times and abandon its bad habit.\r\n   Taking sincere attitude towards the past crime is beneficial to Japan herself.    \r\n   \r\n"
