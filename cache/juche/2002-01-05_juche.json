            "content": "Dignity of Juche Korea demonstrated\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The dignity of Juche Korea was fully demonstrated last year, says Rodong Sinmun in a by-lined article today.\r\n The Korean people look back upon the last one year with higher pride, self-respect and greater happiness than any other people of the world, it says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This national pride and self-respect of the Korean people find their expression in the fact that the dignity of Juche Korea was fully demonstrated as it has the great leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year witnessed a very complicated situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States had made every possible effort for hegemonism in pursuance of the policy of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration pursued a hardline policy towards the DPRK, backpedaling Korea policy of the preceding regime. The U.S. tried to stifle the DPRK by force of arms so as to demonstrate the \"effectiveness\" of its hardline policy and, through it, bring other revolutionary and progressive countries to their knees without much difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the situation changed and the U.S. intensified its hostile policy towards the DPRK, leader Kim Jong Il, who is possessed of rare wisdom and scientific insight, adopted a revolutionary measure to react to the hardline policy of the enemies with the toughest policy and powerfully encouraged the army and people to the defence of the country and socialist construction. The great army-based policy shattered to pieces a foolish attempt of the imperialist bellicose elements to bring the DPRK to its knees by use of force. It created an international environment favorable for the Korean revolution and increased international solidarity with the Korean people in their cause of justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il's visits to China and Russia had a great impact on the changes in the world political structure. The visits marked historic events of weighty importance in boosting the friendly relations with those countries to meet the needs of the new century. They also marked a momentous occasion in pushing forward the human cause of peace and independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year a top-level EU delegation paid a visit to the DPRK and the EU established diplomatic relations with the DPRK. All this was a clear proof of a new development of DPRK-Europe relationship and of the worldwide expansion of the DPRK's external relations. It was a product of independent foreign policy of the Workers' Party of Korea and the DPRK government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year also witnessed strengthened support and solidarity for the Korean people in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, in the year 2001 the dignity and honor of Juche Korea were exalted as never before and the prestige of the DPRK was fully demonstrated before the world.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The South Korean Federation of University Student Councils reportedly released a statement on Dec. 27 last year condemning the police authorities for arresting students and putting them under threatening investigation.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean police authorities unreasonably arrested Ko Min Su, student of the Ryongin branch of the university of foreign studies, and put him under an intimidating interrogation in a bid to arrest the participants in the recent people's meeting held in seoul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities' intimidation of leading members of the people's solidarity, the (South) Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the \"National Federation of Peasants Associations\" is intended to crack down upon the struggle of the workers, peasants and students by creating an atmosphere of \"public security.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The authorities should apologize for unwarrantedly questioning Ko Min Su and send him back to his family. We will fight against the police authorities if they label the students as \"rioters\" and treat them as criminals once again. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
