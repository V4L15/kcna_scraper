They finished the planting of humus-potted maize-seedlings and rice seedlings in time and in a qualitative way, making it possible to boost grain production considerably.\r\n   But the crops were damaged by devastating disasters again. A drought and 30'c-above temperature persisted in the country for months and, thereafter, tidal waves swept the nation's main granaries, making them hardly expect harvesting.\r\n   This year's disasters caused loss of some 1,200,000 tons of maize and some 600,000 tons of rice in the DPRK. This figure is what a joint survey team of the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization and the World Food Program confirmed in the disaster-stricken areas.\r\n   The World Food Program, the European Union and other international organizations and countries have rendered assistance and cooperation to the DPRK in accordance with international practice and humanitarian principles.\r\n   The Korean people feel grateful to international bodies, governments, organizations and individuals for their offering food, fertilizers, agricultural medicines, seed and other things necessary for farming.\r\n   The UN Food and Agricultural Organization, WFP and other international organizations have called for assistance and cooperation for the DPRK after making on-site surveys.\r\n   We appreciate disinterested international assistance and cooperation, which are greatly encouraging the Korean people in their efforts to recover from the disasters.    \r\n       \r\n"

The right-wing forces of Japan raised the \"suspected abduction issue\" which has nothing to do with the DPRK, inciting hostility toward the DPRK, the news analyst says, and goes on:\r\n   We do not consider such acts to represent the viewpoint and stand of individuals.\r\n   Those acts harmful to the atmosphere for the improvement of the relations between the DPRK and Japan make the DPRK doubtful about the stand and true intention of Japan.\r\n   We deal with the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations with clairvoyant insight and judgement. The improved relations will make it possible for the two countries to greatly contribute to the building of a new Asia, peaceful, stable and prosperous.      If the abnormal relations which were forged in the beginning of the 20th century continue in the 21st century, it will be a disgrace on the governments and peoples of the two countries.\r\n   As the lessons of the past show, the stumbling-block in the way of the improved relations between the DPRK and Japan is Japan's policy hostile towards the DPRK and its policy entirely inclined to South Korea.\r\n   It is the height of impudence for Japan to talk about the improved relationship with the DPRK, pursuing a policy hostile towards it.\r\n   If Japan is truly interested in the normalisation of diplomatic relations with the DPRK, it should stop pursuing the policy hostile towards the DPRK, as well as the policy entirely inclined to South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

Present were Ri Jong Ok, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Vice-President, other senior party and state officials and anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters.\r\n   Speakers including vice-premier of the Administration Council Kim Pok Sin and officials of science, education and the press said that Kim Jong Suk is an outstanding woman revolutionary who performed immortal feats in accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche. They also praised her as incarnation of loyalty who provided a brilliant tradition of defending the leader at the risk of life, the mother of the revolution who brought up the bright star of Mt. Paektu and the great teacher of the Korean women who created a new history in the women liberation movement.\r\n   She venerated President Kim Il Sung as the sun and lived a great life for the party and revolution, for the fatherland and people, going through all kinds of hardships,  they stressed.\r\n   They said that the tradition of defending the leader at the cost of life, a valuable sword of the Korean revolution, is an exploit performed by Kim Jong Suk for accomplishing the Juche revolutionary cause. She is immortal alive as a peerless general of Mt. Paektu who devotedly defended President Kim Il Sung,  they noted.\r\n   They said she gave a shining example in absolutely following the leader's ideas and leadership and thoroughly implementing them, and, for the first time in history, strengthened the women's organization into a revolutionary one faithful to the leader's ideas and leadership. \r\n   What is the greatest one of her immortal exploits is that she brought up the bright star of Mt. Paektu that is the destiny and future of the sun's nation, and opened the bright future of the glorious Kim Jong Il era, they said. \r\n   This will shine long generation after generation along with the Kim Il Sung nation.\r\n   The speakers stressed that it is the greatest glory and happiness for Juche Korea to hold in high esteem Kim Jong Suk as model of defenders of the leader, heroine of the anti-Japanese war and eternal mother of the revolution.\r\n   Symposiums were held in all provinces.    \r\n\r\n"

Korean authorities cold-shouldered by masters \r\n Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities, who are now under the trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund (IMF),  have been cold-shouldered by their masters, the United States and Japan, which are, indeed, owners of the IMF, according to the Munhwa Broadcasting Corporation (MBC).\r\n   On dec. 9, the South Korean \"Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs\", in an interview with the New York Times, asked the United States and Japan to grant \"aid fund\" earlier.\r\n   The masters' reaction to South Korea's request, however, was colder than expected. The United States made clear that it had no possibility of an early granting of aid fund it promised to give South Korea besides the IMF's rescue fund. It only urged the puppets to implement their agreement with the IMF.\r\n   As regards the implementation of the agreement, the IMF called a press conference on Dec. 13 and referred to the collusion between politics and business in South Korea. It openly criticized the South Korean authorities for maintaining surreptitious tieup between the \"government\" and banks and businesses.\r\n   The authorities, heedless of such cold shoulder, are persistently resorting to mendicant diplomacy.\r\n   According to Radio No. 1, the South Korean \"Foreign Minister\" phoned the acting State Secretary of the United States again on Dec. 13 and begged for aid, saying South Korea's crisis was related not only to the economic sector but to political and security aspects. He also asked the Japanese Ambassador to South Korea to pay \"deep attention\" to South Korea's financial crisis, saying, \"Japan will also be affected by the crisis\".\r\n   In response to the request of South Korea, the masters have only urged the puppets to thoroughly implement the agreement with the IMF.\r\n   The fact eloquently shows how miserable the Kim Young Sam \"civilian\" regime's fate is. The colonial authorities have sold off even the economic sovereignty, not to speak of the political sovereignty, to outsiders.    \r\n \r\n"
