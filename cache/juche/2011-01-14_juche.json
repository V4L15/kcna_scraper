He was very pleased that the factory is producing lots of quality consumer goods for improving people's standard of living by making an effective use of by-products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He then looked round cultural and welfare establishments including the hall of culture, the canteen and the bathhouse built by the factory in a peculiar manner to learn about its workers' cultural life and supply service. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks before the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the Suphung Bearing Factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the modernization of the factory, he made the rounds of production processes for hours to learn in detail about its technological updating and production there. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Seeing modern equipment and products, he was greatly satisfied to learn that the workers of the factory developed more than 50 kinds of bearings and rapidly increased their production by successfully putting the production processes on a modern and scientific basis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe examined the technologically improved machines and equipment and varieties of products ensuring high precision. He said that the workers of the factory solved many scientific and technological problems on their own by pooling their creative ingenuity and boosting cooperation, thereby bringing about a signal boost in production. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to channel primary efforts into the introduction of the latest technology and the technological innovation drive, noting that those who have a perfect mastery of science and technology can become conquerors in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called for pushing ahead with the updating of the equipment and the factory in a bold and ambitious manner to steadily boost production with locally available raw materials and their own work force under any circumstances. He indicated the orientation and ways to do so and proposed tasks before the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The last leg of his guidance was the Amnokgang Daily Necessities Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round several places of the factory including an injection-molding shop to learn in detail about its technological updating and production there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a revolution that the factory saved equipment enough for furnishing a shop, while securing huge reserve manpower by putting equipment including injection-molding machines on a CNC basis, he noted, extending thanks to its officials, workers and technicians for having achieved great successes in the efforts to push back the frontiers of latest science and technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He praised the factory for successfully manufacturing an ultra-modern uppers injection-moulding machine badly needed for keeping production going at a high rate at the Hyesan Footwear Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has an important role to play in developing the nation's daily necessities industry and improving the people's standard of living, he said, advancing the important tasks to be carried out by the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set the target for putting major production processes on a CNC basis to be attained by the factory till April 2012, the centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung, and specified the orientation and ways for hitting it. He showed such great benevolence as unraveling the problems raised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Jong Un, vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission of the WPK, Kim Kyong Hui, member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK, Pak To Chun and Kim Phyong Hae, alternate members of the Political Bureau and secretaries of the C.C., the WPK, and Ju Kyu Chang, alternate member of the Political Bureau and department director of the C.C., the WPK."

Side to Honestly Respond to Proposal for Dialogue\r\n Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea Friday gave an answer to a question put by KCNA in connection with the fact that the north side proposed the south side to have dialogues including talks between authorities and took measures of good faith according to the joint statement of the DPRK government, political parties and organizations.\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled that after the joint statement was released the CPRK in a statement of its spokesman formally proposed the south side to have dialogue in order to realize the important proposal clarified in the joint statement and sent to it notices containing technical measures one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no ground whatsoever for the south side to refuse to accept the recent proposal for dialogue as it did not attach any conditionality to the dialogue and its date and venue, etc. are specified in it and it has sufficient modality and procedures for conducting the dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, have not shown any willingness to respond to this proposal under this and that pretext since the very outset. They are taking a negative stand towards it, repeating only the words that \"there is no sincerity.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the north side's step of good faith, they were compelled to agree with the issue of opening the Panmunjom Red Cross liaison channel but they took a cool attitude towards the restart of the work of the office of the Consultative Council for North-South Economic Cooperation, under absurd pretexts. They have not yet sent personnel of the south side to the office and barred the use of its building. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This made the north side feel uncomfortable though it made such proposal of good faith.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as \"sincerity\" is concerned, there is no such sincere proposal as the one advanced by the north as it clarified that it is ready to meet anyone anytime and anywhere without any precondition to tide over the grave situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and improve the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are talking about \"counter-proposal\" but the north has neither received any formal proposal from them nor known anything about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the stand of the north that the south side should come out for dialogue and discuss all the issues at the negotiating table, not making irrelevant remarks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing the north and south sides cannot settle if they sit face to face open-heartedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The door of dialogue is open.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south side would be well advised to have a proper stance, though belatedly, and honestly respond to the north side' proposal for dialogue and measures of good faith."
