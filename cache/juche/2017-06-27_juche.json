The strategy creates the atmosphere of horror among political, public, media, information and all other circles in the U.S., putting Trump, advocator of the idea, on the chopping board of impeachment himself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Anti-immigration politics, little short of fascism's racist politics, has touched off aversion from big businesses which are gaining big benefits by relying on immigrated men of talents, and has sparked off derision by the world people as it denied the history of the U.S. itself, a multi-national and multi-racial country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world has never seen peace since the emergence of the \"American-first principle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After fixing it as the priority item of its policy for diplomacy and security to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula, and setting the \"maximum pressure and engagement\" as its DPRK policy, the Trump administration has pressed for the unprecedented nuclear threat and blackmail and economic sanctions on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its wild act of blocking even medical appliances and medications, to say nothing of even a drop of fuel oil, from entering the country, is an unethical and inhumane act, far exceeding the degree of Hitler's blockade of Leningrad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves to contain potential rivals China and Russia and hold the region and the rest of the world under its control have reached the extremes under Trump rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump group has caused the evil cycle of destruction, slaughter and instability even in the Mid-east.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. moves to stamp out anti-U.S. countries have complicated the situation in Latin-America, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Trump way of thinking that the whole world may be sacrificed just for the better living of the U.S., has put even its allies and stooges in a pretty fix.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. wantonly violated the Paris agreement on preservation of earth environment as an extension of its moves of defying even international law and agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the international community brands the U.S. act of conniving at the indefinite emission of carbon dioxide for its own interests as \"an act of putting into the shade Hitler's poisonous gas atrocity\" and \"a crime to annihilate humankind by turning green planet into a poisonous gas room as a whole\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that the \"American-first principle\" which brings horror and instability to the world is just intervention and dangerous war-first principle which defy the principles of non-interference and peaceful co-existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"American-first principle\" whose purpose is to turn the human society of modern civilization into the wild world ruled by law of jungle represents the height of arrogance and arbitrariness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies the crafty and ferocious nature of the \"American-first principle\" that stands out from the successive hegemonism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Yankee-way logic of hegemonism which claims everything has to exist to serve the U.S. is an anachronistic wild act and sophism that can no longer be effective in the era of independence where the sound way of thinking of humankind prevails.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The frantic ideology and forces harassing world peace and security and threatening the existence of human being have to be expelled from this planet. This is our demand and, at the same time, the urgent call of humankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All countries and nations have to fight against U.S. hegemonism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. hegemonism will face total bankruptcy in the face of justice and united strength."
