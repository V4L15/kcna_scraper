            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Pyongyang Children's Foodstuff Factory\r\n Pyongyang, December 16 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), gave field guidance to the Pyongyang Children's Foodstuff Factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the mosaic depicting President Kim Il Sung and the monument to field guidance provided by leader Kim Jong Il in the compound of the factory, he recollected with deep emotion the undying feats Kim Jong Il performed by visiting it on July 8, 2001 with loving care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said in an excited tone that the world knew no such great fathers as Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who regarded it as the most important affair of the party and state to love children, calling them kings of the country and devoting everything to them all their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He proposed erecting new mosaic depicting the President and Kim Jong Il with profound reverence so as to convey down to posterity their love for the children and future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the room dedicated to the history of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He recalled that the factory built under the care of the President turned into a comprehensive children's foodstuff production center for regularly producing and supplying foodstuff for babies in breast feeding and weaning periods such as powdered milk for babies, nutritious rice powder, varieties of powdered vegetables, powdered tangle and powdered fish, and soy-based milk and soy-based kefir good for the growth and development of children and pupils under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He told the officials and employees of the factory to intensify the education through the immortal exploits performed by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for its development so that they may keep production going at a high rate and their love for the children may always reach them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the product show room, soy-based milk shop, nutritious rice powder shop, the shop for powdered milk for babies and other places of the factory to learn about in detail the production and management of the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the production should not be stopped at the factory even a moment because to put the production on a normal footing at the factory was not a simple economic and business matter but a matter concerning the sense of moral obligation towards Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that the hostile forces are working hard to prevent the laughter of children from being heard, he underscored the need to boost the production of children's foodstuff so as to show them how the DPRK protects the children's happy life and defends socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to raise the quality of foodstuff to the highest level and develop new varieties of foodstuff for the growth of the children by comparing the foodstuff of the factory with the world famous infant's food and making an analysis of them with an ambition for holding world supremacy in foodstuff production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need to put all production processes on an automated, unmanned, germ-free and dust-free basis by learning from the foodstuff factories of the KPA which turned into model and standard of foodstuff factory in the country.  He called for perfectly updating the factory by the 70th founding anniversary of the WPK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the officials and employees of the factory. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Choe Ryong Hae, secretary of the WPK Central Committee, KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, An Jong Su and Han Kwang Sang, department directors of the C.C., the WPK, Ri Jae Il, first vice-department director of the C.C., the WPK, and Jo Yong Won, vice-department director of the C.C., the WPK."

            "content": "Portavoz de MINREX condena campana de DDHH anti-RPDC de EE.UU.\r\nPyongyang, 16 de diciembre (ACNC) -- En exclusiva con la ACNC concedida el dia 15 con motivo de que se torna cada vez mas febril la campana de \"derechos humanos\" anti-Republica Popular Democratica de Corea de Estados Unidos, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC dio la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, se hace cada vez mas acalorada la ofensiva de EE.UU. contra la RPDC en el campo de derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo durante la semana pasada, el secretario de Estado, el asistente del secretario para Asia Oriental y el Pacifico, el asistente del secretario para Democracia, Derechos Humanos y Trabajo, el \"enviado especial de DDHH del Norte de Corea\" y el representante especial de la politica sobre Corea del Departamento de Estado de Estados Unidos pronunciaron por turno las palabras que difaman a la RPDC cuestionando el \"problema de DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Departamento de Estado hizo publica la pauta concreta para la ayuda financiera a las entidades de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC mientras el Congreso norteamericano aprobo un \"proyecto de ley\" que empuja al administrador de la Agencia Estatal de Inteligencia y al secretario de Estado a espiar el interior de la RPDC y recoger los datos para la demagogia contra esta. Asi se dan sin escrupulos los movimientos para la escalada de la confrontacion con la RPDC en materia de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsos movimientos demuestran que EE.UU. politiza e impulsa de manera planificada la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC tomandola como espacio para suprimir la ideologia y regimen de la segunda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal comportamiento significa el abandono de la Declaracion Conjunta del 19 de Septiembre aprobada en las conversaciones a seis bandas en que la RPDC y EE.UU. se comprometieron a respetar la soberania de la contraparte y convivir de manera pacifica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que EE.UU. se enfrasca en derrocar el regimen de la RPDC valiendose de todos los medios y metodos, la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana perdera por completo su significado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC se puso de acuerdo con la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana no para ser ocupada por EE.UU. sino para eliminar la amenaza nuclear proveniente de este y garantizar la paz y seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia cuando esta sobre el tapete el enfrentamiento de \"DDHH\" RPDC-EE.UU., carecera de sentido cualquier dialogo sobre el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. dice unos chismes en cuanto a la excarcelacion de los norteamericanos retenidos en la RPDC. Pero, la RPDC libero a ellos no porque quiso el dialogo con EE.UU. sino como parte de la limpieza previa al enfrentamiento en la esfera de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn realidad, la RPDC tiene mucho mas que decir de los DDHH que EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs Estados Unidos el que cayo en aprieto al conocerse en casa los datos de torturas antieticas hechas por la Agencia Central de Inteligencia y los escandalos de discriminacion racial de los policias blancos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien son EE.UU. y sus satelites los que pasaron tremenda pena cuando fue desmentido su rumor manipulado sobre los jovenes y escolares norcoreanos que repatriaron luego de ser secuestrados por los traficantes de seres humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, el secretario de Estado, Kerry, orquesto la payasada de elogiar publicamente a un \"fugitivo norcoreano\" estafador que lleva consigo para utilizarlo en la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC. Este hecho muestra que Kerry esta enloquecido por la campana hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ex secretario de Estado, Powell, se habia dejado llevar por los embustes de la CIA que recoge y manipula las informaciones mediante torturas, y su sucesor Kerry actua como tonto siendo enganado por un \"fugitivo norcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor la via correspondiente, se ha enviado ya a Kerry el video que revela la forma de ser de aquel fugitivo estafador.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl intento de EE.UU. de derrocar el regimen de la RPDC cuestionando el \"problema de DDHH\" no es una politica sino un delirio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. probara la batalla de confrontacion de intransigente, nunca vista antes, que librara la RPDC frente a la politica hostil, y asumira la responsabilidad total del fracaso de la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana."
