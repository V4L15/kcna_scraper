No, it is entirely due to the United States. With economic blockade added to war threat, the north had no other choice but to arm itself with self-defensive power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants a solution to the \"nuclear issue of the north\", it should take the following measures at once: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firstly, it should replace the armistice agreement between the north and the U.S. with a permanent peace agreement and withdraw its forces from this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Secondly, it should promptly retract its economic blockade policy against the north which has lasted over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thirdly, it should officially declare that it will not lay any obstacle in the way of the Korean nation solving the reunification question independently by its own efforts  under the banner of the June 15 South-North Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly know that only when it takes these measures first can there be an advance in the settlement of the so-called \"nuclear issue of the north\". Otherwise, it is not entitled to talk about the north's possession of nukes or something more formidable.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
