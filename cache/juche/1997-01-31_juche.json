The news analyst goes on:\r\n   It is nonsensical for the u.s. conservative hardliners to talk about \"threat\" from the DPRK. They intend to carry out a military adventure with a false excuse. That is why they call for the \"expansion of security engagement,\" by which they mean a collective armed attack. It is not the DPRK but the united states that creates threat in East Asia. It is foolish to try to convince people of the \"necessity\" of U.S. military presence on the pretext of the DPRK's \"threat\".\r\n   The recent remarks of the u.s. secretary of defense are intended to set in motion military strength in a race to establish domination over Asia.\r\n   The intention of the U.S. conservative hardliners to stifle the DPRK by strength and dominate Asia remains unchanged. \r\n   They must give up the hostile policy toward the DPRK and the wild ambition to dominate Asia, as demanded by the world peace-loving people. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
