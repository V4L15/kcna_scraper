Korean Puppet Forces against Risky Military Moves\r\n Pyongyang, October 2 (KCNA) -- The recent situation on the Korean peninsula has reached the brink of a war owing to the reckless military provocations of the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t By introducing the guided-missile destroyer Spruance and a sea patrol plane of its navy into the East Sea of Korea recently, the U.S. conducted a drill for mounting a \"precision strike\" at the building of the supreme headquarters, Nyongbyon nuclear facilities and major strategic rocket bases of the DPRK together with the guided-missile destroyers of the south Korean puppet navy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is going to stage Red Flag Alaska 16 precision air strike drill in Alaska State under the simulated conditions of launching a \"preemptive strike\" at the DPRK with the air forces of the U.S., south Korea, New Zealand and NATO involved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A joint naval drill to be staged with the involvement of the nuclear carrier Ronald Reagan task force sailing to the waters around the Korean peninsula is also aimed at a \"preemptive strike\" on the supreme headquarters and major strategic rocket bases of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces completely took off the spurious mask of \"annual\" and \"defensive\" drills and are openly vociferating about \"preemptive strike\" and getting desperate in doing so.    This clearly shows the gravity of the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Serious is that such military maneuvers are pursuant to the adventurous \"plan for a preemptive strike at the north\" cooked up at the White House and Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 21 Obama, the chieftain of war, appeared at the UN General Assembly, at which he spouted that the DPRK should be made to pay a \"high price\". Then the director of the CIA, the commander of the U.S. Special Warfare Force, the commander of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea and other warmongers were closeted together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that the confab drew the final conclusion that \"preemptive military strike is the most important choice\" and discussed in detail the issue of \"reinforcement of armed forces\" and \"bolstering of counteraction capability.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group, inspecting frontline units of the puppet army, cried out for \"turning the whole north into a grave in a single strong strike.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The General Staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) has already solemnly declared that it will blow up the provocation bases the moment any slightest sign of intrusion into the DPRK's inviolable territory, territorial waters and airspace is detected. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as easy as pie for the KPA to frustrate the reckless military moves in south Korea and its vicinity as it has put into its strike range all the aggression bases in the U.S. mainland and operational areas in the Pacific. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strategic forces like nuclear weapons and rockets are not necessary for the KPA's first retaliatory strike.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the KPA opens fire of annihilation, the U.S. aggressors will perish before any others and south Korea will turn into a sea of flames and be reduced to ashes in a twinkling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aggressors and provocateurs should not forget even a moment that the nearer they come within the striking range of the KPA, the earlier they will meet their miserable end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the stern warning served by the army and people of the DPRK to the U.S. and south Korean puppet forces attempting to invade the DPRK."

Y seguidamente, el director de la Agencia Central de Inteligencia, el comandante de las tropas para operaciones especiales de EE.UU., el comandante de las tropas agresoras norteamericanas ocupantes en el Sur de Corea y otros belicistas se reunieron para trazar una conspiracion de guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDicen que en ese conclave confirmaron finalmente que el \"golpe preventivo militar deviene una opcion mas importante\" y consultaron detalladamente los problemas relativos al \"ampliado refuerzo militar\" necesario al ataque inesperado y el \"fortalecimiento de la capacidad de enfrentamiento\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA su vez, la traidora Park Geun-hye se acudio a las unidades de la primera linea del frente del ejercito titere surcoreano diciendo que tienen que \"asestarle un fuerte golpe al Norte para convertirlo en una tumba\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Estado Mayor General del Ejercito Popular de Corea ya declaro que aplastara todas las bases provocativas si se muestra un minimo indicio de agresion contra la tierra, el mar y el cielo de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara el EPC que toma en su esfera de golpe el territorio principal norteamericano y las bases de agresion del de la zona operacional del Pacifico no es mas que un juego reprimir las locuras militares que se escenifican en el suelo surcoreano y sus contornos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el primer golpe de represalia la RPDC no tiene necesidad de movilizar las fuerzas armadas estrategicas como las armas nucleares y los cohetes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se lanzan los proyectiles aniquiladores, los agresores yanquis seran primeros en morir y el suelo surcoreano se convertira en un santiamen en el mar de fuego y el monton de cenizas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agresores y provocadores no deben olvidar ni un momento el hecho de que cuanto mas se acerquen a la esfera de ataque de la RPDC, tanto mas se adelantara el momento de tragico destino de ellos mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la advertencia seria del ejercito y el pueblo coreanos a EE.UU. y los titeres surcoreanos locos en la furia de agresion a la RPDC."
