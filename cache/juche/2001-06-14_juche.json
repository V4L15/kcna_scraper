It is believed to happen once in 1,000 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From early march to this date precipitation in all parts of the country registered at 18.3 mm on an average, only 11 percent of the normal year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Heat recorded an all-time high in meteorological observation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Temperature in Kaesong, Sariwon, Hamhung, Wonsan and  Hyesan at noon in several days of April and May was 12-13 degrees higher than the normal year. It recorded 3 degrees higher than that in the normal year, taking the country as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strong wind 11-18 m/s and over 20 m/s swept several times the areas on the west coast including Pyongyang, Haeju and Sariwon and on the east coast including Hamhung and Wonsan. \r\n Agriculture is hardest hit by this drought, heat and strong wind. \r\n At present, soil in all parts of the country remained dry up to over 25 cm deep, making it hardly possible for such crops as maize, wheat, barley and potato to grow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No harvest can be expected from hundreds of thousands of hectares of farmland hit by drought and it is hardly possible to sow seeds there again. Rice-transplantation is close to abeyance due to shortage of irrigation water. Rice seedlings already transplanted are withering. \r\n Forest fire is breaking out in dozens of cities and counties in an unbroken chain, causing serious damage to forest resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various fields of the national economy are badly affected by this natural calamity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The state took measures to mobilize all pumping equipment and manpower for minimizing drought damage and draw sea water into rivers and other steps. But there is little improvement in the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Drought and heat are expected to last for more days to come.     \r\n\r\n"
