            "content": "What is \"joint study\" seeking ? = KCNA commentary =\r\n Pyongyang, October 22 (KCNA) -- An official of the U.S. Department of Defense on October 16 said that the United States and Japan should sign a memorandum of understanding on joint study of \"Theatre Missile Defence (TMD) system\" till the end of 1999.\r\n   What we cannot overlook is the fact that he said the military tieup between the United States and Japan is an important means to contain the self-defensive missile development of the DPRK and remove \"threats\" to Japan.\r\n   This fully shows that the United States intends to collect money from Japan under the pretext of \"missile threats\" from the DPRK, keep its military supremacy over the Asia-pacific region and thus bring it under its complete control.\r\n   The \"TMD\" plan is the key to implementing the U.S. strategy for world supremacy.\r\n   This is why the United States has annually invested huge amounts of money in this plan ever since the Cold War came to an end. Now that it was unrealistic and astronomical funds were needed, however, the plan has suffered repeated setbacks, driving the United States into a quagmire.\r\n   What the U.S. seeks in inveigling Japan into establishing the \"TMD\" system is to make up a deficiency in fund with the help of Japan.\r\n   Obsessed with a design to become a military power, Japan is zealously responding to the \"joint study\" of the U.S. strategy, states, regarding it as a golden opportunity.\r\n   History shows that Japan was engaged in aggressive acts with the backing of big countries.\r\n   Even after its defeat in World War �K, Japan dreamed of staging a comeback to Korea and other Asian nations.\r\n   It wants to become the \"leader\" of Asia by availing itself of this opportunity to become a military power.\r\n   This is the very reason why Japan is kicking up quite a row as if missiles would drop in the territory of Japan.    \r\nEven today when the world recognizes that the DPRK succeeded in launching an artificial satellite, it is doggedly insisting that the DPRK launched a \"ballistic missile.\" \r\n   In the final analysis, U.S.-Japan \"joint study\" is not intended for \"security\" but for attaining their aggressive and dominationist design to militarily contain the DPRK and neighbouring nations.\r\n   However, the U.S. and Japanese warmaniacs should know that their design is a daydream.\r\n   The more zealously they tighten military tieups in the name of \"joint study\" and others, the stronger the military counteraction of the Korean and other Asian peoples will become. \r\n\r\n"
