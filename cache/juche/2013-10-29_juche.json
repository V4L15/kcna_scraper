            "content": "KCNA Commentary Urges Japan to Behave with Reason\r\n Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities are working in real earnest to establish the national security council of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t The House of Representatives of Japan on Oct. 17 decided to set up an ad hoc committee for national security to deliberate on the bill for establishing the national security council, etc. and informally designated as its chairman the former minister of Finance from the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), who held the post of the director general of the Defense Agency in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Earlier, the chief executive of Japan, who called for building \"strong Japan\", expressed the will to establish the national security council and, at the same time, lay down a national security strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, in the final analysis, an extremely dangerous move of the present Japanese authorities as they are keen to round off the state machinery as befitting a war state. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national security council projected by Japan is just the same as the war mechanism of the U.S. as it is aggressive and bellicose in its nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the U.S. president is the chairman of the NSC which consists of the vice-president, the secretaries of State and Defense and the special assistant to the president for national security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the U.S. deems it necessary to launch a military attack and war against other countries, this institution is tasked to rapidly decide and handle the matters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is now going to apply the U.S. method of deciding upon major policies to rapidly react to \"contingency\" and immediately launch a war of aggression according to the prime minister's resolution and intention. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national security strategy to be presented by the security council, in essence, does not exclude the aggressive nature under any circumstances. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan recently adopted \"active pacifism\", a new self-portrait of Japan and a banner representing and leading Japan, as the main idea of the national security strategy. It is going to formally decide on it together with the \"defence program guidelines\" in December. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The national security strategy is nothing but a document for a war of aggression which specifies as a strategy the \"defence program guidelines\" censured by the international community as an aggressive document for war and a declaration of war. From this point of view, it is not hard to guess what disasters it will bring to the world in the future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For Japan to round off the state machinery for aggression and adopt a war strategy is a reality on the horizon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities at a meeting of the Japan-U.S. security consultative committee held in Tokyo early in October garnered the U.S. support for reexamination of the interpretation of the constitution for exercising the \"right to collective self-defense\", establishment of the national security council and increase of defense budget. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On October 16 the meeting of experts of the Japanese government worked out even a proposal for studying actions for exercising the \"right to collective self-defense\" which specifies possible war actions of the Japanese armed forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The LDP's dominance in the election of the House of Councilors provided the present Japanese government with a golden chance for speeding up the establishment of the national security council. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Facts go to prove that Japan's moves for reinvasion have reached a graver phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' reckless moves to rapidly turn Japan into a war state are nothing but the fools' rash actions precipitating their self-destruction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities are following in the footsteps of the past Japanese imperialists who met a miserable end after suffering a defeat in the war while rushing headlong into militarization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to behave with reason, properly understanding that its moves for turning it into a military power and launching overseas aggression would lead to its miserable destruction"

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- The \"inspection of administration\" by the Park Geun Hye's regime, the first one since she came to power, is now under way in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t Being brought to light through the \"inspection\" are despicable political frauds and plots, the moves to revive \"yusin\" dictatorship and aspects of unpopular misrule by the Park Geun Hye group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is increasing suspicion about the organized interference in the \"presidential election\" by the puppet Intelligence Service (IS) and the military cyber command, irrationality of the project of four large rivers, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was disclosed that IS agents for psychological warfare released articles supporting and praising the \"Saenuri Party\" and candidate Park Geun Hye or opposing and slandering the Democratic Party and its candidates 55 689 times from Sept. 1 to Dec. 18 last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was proved that they used internet to fully interfere in the election and that the crimes disclosed so far are just a tip of the iceberg. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the election campaign Park often let loose \"commitments\" pleasant to the ear such as \"era of people's happiness\" and \"economic recovery\" but now she is in a desperate situation being called a \"big liar\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She promised to pay a certain amount of pensions to the elderly above 65 years of age every month. But this election commitment has nearly been breached. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the \"Saenuri Party\" trumpeted about implementing the commitments. But now it is citing the present conditions as an excuse, feigning ignorance of the promise. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result, not only the commitment to pensions but more than 16 \"commitments to public welfare\" have been nullified. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now south Korea's economy dependent on outside forces has faced a serious crisis and people are left in the depths of distress. The jobless are everywhere in streets and the number of those committing suicide is on the steady increase, topping the world list. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That's not all. Even before coming to power, the conservative group openly praised the crimes during the \"yusin\" era, saying that \"'yusin in October' was an inevitable and the best option\". As soon as taking office they went on the rampage to make south Korean society the dark land under fascist dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t IS and other repressive bodies' political inspection and plot-breeding are being conducted in an open way. They indiscriminately launch campaigns to eliminate the \"forces following the north\" and trample down the progressive and democratic forces under the pretext of \"plotted rebellion case\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despicable political swindling, plot-breeding and unpopular rule prevail in south Korea, the situation reminiscent of the era of \"yusin\" dictatorship in the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean opposition parties call the eight months of rule by the conservative group \"eight frauds\" and \"eight worries\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The eight months of Park Geun Hye's regime revealed the false nature of the conservative group. This is the expression of the mindset of the south Korean people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is nothing to expect from the conservative group which prolongs its political life with frauds, plot-breeding and moves for the revival of \"yusin\" dictatorship."

            "content": "U.S. Should Roll Back Its Hostile Policy toward DPRK: World Public\r\n Pyongyang, October 29 (KCNA) -- World public is strongly demanding the U.S. roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK and accept the DPRK's proposal for replacing the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA) with a peace treaty in order to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t A Nepali paper said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation on the Korean Peninsula has reached the danger line amid acute confrontation. This is attributable to the moves of the hostile forces to stifle the DPRK and their provocative military drills against it. So, the tense situation is prevailing on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Dark clouds have lingered over the peninsula due to the military conflicts between the north and the south, the U.S.-south Korea joint military exercises and their repeated politically-motivated provocation moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Communist Youth Front of Italy in a statement noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint military exercises kicked off by the U.S. and the south Korean puppet authorities are, needless to say, a wanton violation of the AA and a real threat to world peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has long proposed signing a peace treaty with the U.S. but the latter refused to do so and has still stationed its armed forces for aggression in south Korea. The U.S. not only introduced huge nuclear weapons into south Korea but has steadily beefed up arms and equipment. The DPRK proposed the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula long ago but the U.S. has only unilaterally urged the DPRK to disarm itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the Sweden-Korea Friendship Association said that the AA has long lost its mission and role as a tool for reducing the tensions and the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula and that no one pins hope on it any more. He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the AA is left intact, peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity can not be ensured and the independent and peaceful development of the Korean nation cannot be expected.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has long raised the proposal for replacing the AA with a peace treaty and establishing a new and durable peace mechanism and made consistent and persistent efforts to carry it out. To replace the AA with a peace treaty is the first and foremost precondition for preventing the arms buildup and arms race on the peninsula and settling the relations between the north and the south and between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Finnish paper Tyokansan Sanomat stated:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the peace-loving DPRK proposed the U.S. again in the strong terms to replace the ceasefire with a peace mechanism in order to ensure durable peace on the Korean Peninsula. If the U.S truly wants peace and security on the peninsula, it should stop nuclear threat and war maneuvers against the other party with practical act, not just with words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should respond to the DPRK's proposal for signing a peace treaty as soon as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Jordanian paper Al Diyar said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact, the leadership of the DPRK and the resolute counteraction of its combat-ready armed forces brought the U.S. to its knees before the Korean people. The U.S. is driven into a tight corner, becoming a laughing-stock of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is turning the moves of the aggressors into bubbles by dint of the war deterrence for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the Denmark-DPRK Friendship Association said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the disposition and the mode of countermeasure of the DPRK to return hard-line action with tougher one. Therefore, the U.S. should roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK, respect its sovereignty and settle all the issues through dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. and its allies discard their hostile policy toward the DPRK and respect its sovereignty, the issue will soon see a settlement."
