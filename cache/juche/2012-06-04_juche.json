            "content": "General Staff of KPA Sends Open Ultimatum to S. Korean Group of Traitors\r\n Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- The General Staff of the Korean People's Army sent the following open ultimatum to the south Korean group of traitors on Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The celebrations of the 66th anniversary of the Korean Children's Union are now taking place in the revolutionary capital of Pyongyang with splendor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are a great political festival of children unprecedented not only in the history of the Korean nation but in the long history of mankind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As many as 20 000 delegates of school children have come to Pyongyang on invitation from all parts of the country, including remote villages and solitary islands.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the noble outlook of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il on the younger generation and the future that they showed paternal loving care and solicitude for them, calling them kings of the country. This outlook has been steadfastly carried forward by the dear respected Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the service members and people are immensely excited and pleased with this stirring reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is becoming envious of the DPRK, noting that such great event can take place in socialist Korea only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But it is only the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors in south Korea that is chilling the atmosphere of these auspicious events of the children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From May 29 the group set in motion Chosun Ilbo, Choongang Ilbo, \"A channel\" of Dong-A Ilbo, KBS, CBS, MBC, SBS and other media to launch a campaign defaming the above-said celebrations. It went the lengths of resorting to a new campaign of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, availing itself of this opportunity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The children of the kindergarten in magnificent and modern Changjon Street were so happy as to have a photo taken with      Kim Jong Un and sons and daughters of ordinary working people are participating in the above-said celebrations. However, the Lee group is letting loose a string of vituperations describing all these blessings as \"charades intentionally orchestrated\" by the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The auspicious political festival was opened amid joy and cheers of three million of schoolchildren, hailed by their fathers and mothers throughout the country. The group, however, is playing down it as \"events for publicity stunt,\" \"events to win popularity\", \"events to curry favor with them.\" It made no scruple of letting loose a spate of such invectives as deliberately hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK, describing the great inheritance of the love for the younger generation and the future as \"act of imitating gesture and copying after Hitler\" and \"the north's staging of a political show as that staged by the Nazis to train the Juvenile Corps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And the Lee group went the lengths of describing the unblemished naive schoolchildren as \"children on markets\" more familiar with capitalist markets than socialist policies and \"mere children knowing nothing about the world\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a new form of evil action hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. It is a thrice-cursed criminal act as it is a monstrous mud-slinging at the rosy future of our revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no country in the world as the DPRK which projects children as kings of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When babies are born, they are taken care of at palaces of babies and children are rapidly growing at children's palaces, bringing their talents into full bloom. They are leading such blessed lives under the immensely profound loving care of the great persons of Mt. Paektu, something rare to be found in any other parts of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was President Kim Il Sung who brought up all the children under his deep care with the noblest viewpoint on the younger generation and the future, despite snow and rain. It was leader Kim Jong Il who saw off the children leaving for their camps while starting his journey to the front along rugged roads in adversity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was Kim Jong Un who visited the Mangyongdae Revolutionary School on the New Year's Day and put forward its children as future pillars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was thanks to this profound care of the sun that the children were provided with ampler opportunities of learning and flags of the Children's Union fluttered more vigorously over their camps under the clean and blue sky of the country even under the difficult situation where its people had to fasten their belts in manifold adversity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Children are the future of the country and a symbol of hope and victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said vituperation let loose by the group of traitors is nothing but a shriek made by the group, utterly discomfited by the bright future of the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and rosy future of the younger generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From olden times, idiots are apt to see everything quite different from a reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that the group of traitors branded as fools, idiots and blockheads can hardly see the present world correctly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it is not true, how can the group describe the great inheritance of our nation as \"imitation\" and compare the children who would shoulder upon themselves the future of the nation with the juvenile organization of fascist Hitler?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for Hitler, he was the fascist fanatic who drove guiltless humankind into pitfalls of disasters and death, special class war criminal who destroyed his country and nation and die-hard tyrant who had no love for its children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people had already branded the worst traitor Lee as a notorious \"Hitler Lee\" and burned the traitor in effigy in Nazi uniform, bearing the same moustache as Hitler's as he has been hell-bent on mercilessly suppressing the protestors at the point of bayonet and enforcing an unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is said that one's wrong tongue-lashing is as harmful as a sword cutting off one's head.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon hearing the news that the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and slandered its loved children, the officers and men of the three services of the KPA are expressing towering resentment and pledging themselves as one to resolutely settle accounts by force of arms with those who violated the moral law of the nation and defamed the great man whom the people follow and the world look up to.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officers and men of the army corps, divisions and regiments on the front and strategic rocket forces in the depth of the country are loudly calling for the issue of order to mete out punishment, declaring that they have already targeted Chosun Ilbo at coordinates of 37 degrees 56 minutes 83 seconds North Latitude and 126 degrees 97 minutes 65 seconds East Longitude in the Central District, Seoul, Choongang Ilbo at coordinates of 37 degrees 33 minutes 45 seconds  North Latitude and 126 degrees 58 minutes 14 seconds East Longitude in the Central District, Seoul, the Dong-A Ilbo at coordinates of 37 degrees 57 minutes 10 seconds North Latitude and 126 degrees 97 minutes 81 seconds East Longitude in Jongro District, Seoul, KBS, CBS, MBC and SBS, the strongholds of the Lee group orchestrating the new vicious smear campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of this grave situation the KPA General Staff sends the following ultimatum to the Lee group of traitors:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK are the army of the supreme commander and the people's army which is devotedly defending the supreme commander and protecting his idea and the people and children whom he values and loves so much.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the iron will of the army of the DPRK that the dens of heinous provocateurs hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and desecrating its idea, system and people should not be allowed to exist as they are.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like ask the Lee group if it wants leave all this to be struck by the DPRK or opt for apologizing and putting the situation under control, though belatedly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should take a final choice by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now it is impossible for the officers and men of the KPA three services to keep back their towering resentment any longer. In case dens of monstrous crimes are blown up one after another, the Lee group will be entirely held responsible for this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the Lee group recklessly challenges our army's eruption of resentment, it will retaliate against it with a merciless sacred war of its own style as it has already declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are fully ready for everything.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time is running out."

It will only give birth to second, third monument to comfort women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will be beneficial for Japan, too, to settle its past."

            "content": "ACNC comenta la actitud evasiva de Japon en la liquidacion del pasado\r\nPyongyang, 4 de junio (ACNC) -- Japon continua con su absurda ambicion de eludir la liquidacion de sus crimenes del pasado manchados de sangre.\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ejemplo, se mueve obstinadamente para eliminar el monumento en memoria de las ex consoladoras sexuales del viejo ejercito japones, levantado en New Jersey, Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace unos dias, el consul general y otros diplomaticos japoneses, acreditados en Nueva York, suplicaron al alcalde de una ciudad de New Jersey el desalojamiento de ese monumento a cambio de las ofertas de fabulosas inversiones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, pasaron tremenda pena a la vista del mundo cuando el alcalde rechazo la propuesta japonesa en una conferencia de prensa diciendo que ese monumento es imprescindible para evitar la repeticion de guerras y violaciones de derechos humanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los obstinados compinches del Partido Democratico Liberal de Japon urgieron lo mismo al director del secretariado y al ministro del Exterior. Sumandose a la opinion de ellos, el canciller japones dijo que \"pensaria bien en las maneras de conseguir ese objetivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses insisten en remover el monumento en cuestion para encubrir sus tremendos crimenes cometidos en el siglo pasado y evadir cueste lo que cueste su liquidacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, son demasiado grandes y graves para ser ocultados esos crimenes de lesa humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tParticularmente, la conversion de incontables mujeres de las zonas ocupadas durante la segunda guerra mundial en esclavas sexuales de las tropas agresoras japonesas es una barbarie sin precedentes en la historia mundial de guerras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que la sociedad internacional este exigiendo al gobierno japones reconocer francamente su sucio expediente criminal del pasado, incluyendo el caso de ex consoladoras sexuales, pedir disculpas sinceramente e indemnizarlo. No obstante, Japon se porta al contrario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElimino la palabra ex consoladoras sexuales del ejercito japones en los manuales de historia que usan los alumnos de la secundaria e intenta eludir la liquidacion de sus crimenes mediante la farsa de \"indemnizacion\" por conducto de un fondo civil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es un desafio a la justicia y la conciencia y doble crimen contra las victimas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sincera disculpa y la indemnizacion son requisitos de la liquidacion del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los reaccionarios japoneses siguen actuando como ahora, apareceran el segundo y el tercer monumentos en memoria de las ex consoladoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa liquidacion del pasado es necesaria para ellos mismos."
