They are all the more perplexed because the judgement came after the new \"government\"  announced that it would not ask the Japanese government to make  \"government\"-level compensation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

The revolutionary stamina of the Korean working class is demonstrated all the more under the leadership of General Kim Jong Il, say the papers.\r\n   An editorial of Rodong Sinmun stresses that the Korean working class is a vanguard which upholds the headquarters of revolution in the van and a revolutionary rank boundlessly faithful to socialism. \r\n   The Korean working class has always supported the anti-imperialist cause of independence and the socialist cause of other people under banner of unity and remains faithful to the international duty even now when the socialist movement is undergoing trials.\r\n    It is unthinkable apart from the tested leadership of General Kim Jong Il that the Korean working class is creditably carrying out its mission and duty as the leading class of revolution for the times and history.\r\n   The entire working class should firmly unite around the General in one mind and always be a vanguard in upholding his idea and leadership.\r\n   The editorial calls upon the working class to display again its heroic stamina in the present forced march for final victory by vigorously struggling in the same spirit and the same stamina as in the period of the Chollima movement after the war in response to the calls of the Workers' Party of Korea Central Committee.\r\n   The entire working class should firmly defend its class stand and the socialist principle even under the difficult and complicated situation. Says the editorial.\r\n   Under the banner of the Pyongyang Declaration, it notes, the Korean working class should firmly unite with the revolutionary parties and working class of the world to defend and advance the socialsit cause and make all efforts to realise global independence against imperialism in the idea of independence, peace and friendship.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
