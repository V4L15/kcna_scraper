It is of great theoretical and practical significance in the accomplishment of the global cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says this in an article Monday, which reads in part: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This definition by Kim Jong Il is the most correct classic one based on a comprehensive analysis of the present world situation fundamentally different from the past period with the Juche-based viewpoint and stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sophism of the imperialists who described the abnormal development in the form of the collapse of socialism in some countries in the late 1980s and the early 1990s of the last century as \"bankruptcy of the cause of independence\" and \"end of socialism\" was an anachronistic hokum of fools to deny hard historical reality and the law governing the development of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era is an era in which the idea of independence is winning and its main trend is characterized by Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The popular masses are firmly standing in the center of the development of the history in the present era. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide are advancing along the road of independence and Songun and they are playing an ever greater role in shaping the destiny of humankind and the future of the world. This is the essential features of the present era, which distinguishes it from the last era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing can block the trend of the historical development of the present era toward independence and Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imperishable feats of Kim Jong Il for the global cause of independence that he gave a scientific analysis and assessment of the characteristics of the present era and has vigorously spurred on the development of human history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

A concession made by a country to the imperialists over the issue of the working class stand, taken in by their crafty ploy, would put it in the danger of losing even the gains of the revolution won at the cost of blood. To slacken the working class awareness, unable to discern the true nature of the imperialists, is little short of digging one's own grave. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists worked out a long-term strategy to stifle the DPRK which is holding high the banner of socialism and have worked hard to realize it. If a country makes a concession, the imperialists force it to make another concession and if it steps back, they come out with stronger demand. This is a trite method employed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent developments on the international arena go to clearly prove that there is no other option but to fight the imperialists out from a tough stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the DPRK wrought such a historical miracle as defending Korean-style socialism in the showdown with the imperialist allied forces single-handedly in the 1990s and have dynamically stepped up the drive to build a great prosperous powerful country, foiling the imperialists' vicious moves against the DPRK. They could do this because they have followed the road of Songun, attaching importance to the arms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they are a great programme for reunification common to the nation which the north and the south confirmed and solemnly declared at home and abroad through the July 4 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said principles clarify the principled problem, the guiding principle for most properly solving the issue of national reunification in keeping with the wishes and interests of the Koreans and the specific circumstances and conditions of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles put forward by the President have vigorously encouraged and promoted the cause of independent national reunification, receiving absolute support of all the Koreans as a great programme for reunification common to the nation for the last several decades for their validity and vitality. They brought to this land at last a new era of independent reunification, the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are still a lot of trials and difficulties in the way of national reunification.

And he gives comprehensive answers to the important problems arising in the party building and activities.  He has wisely led the efforts for their realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under his leadership the Workers' Party of Korea has been further developed and strengthened into the President Kim Il Sung's Party, ever-victorious steel-like party. It has firmly adhered to the independent principle and socialist principle even in the vortex of the harsh world political situation over last 15 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a result, the DPRK could victoriously advance along the socialist road without any turns and twists or deviation and the man-centered socialism take root deep in the life of the people as their unswerving faith in the period of the difficult \"Arduous March\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK, with Kim Jong Il, the prominent man of political ability, in the van of the revolution, will demonstrate its dignity and might as an eternally invincible party.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto no pasa de ser una peroracion anacronica de los ingenuos quienes pretenden negar la realidad historica y la ley de desarrollo de la humanidad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La actual es la epoca en que triunfa el ideal de la independencia y su corriente principal se caracteriza por el Songun (priorizacion militar). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En la epoca actual las masas populares figuran en el centro del desarrollo de la historia. Cientos de millones de habitantes del mundo avanzan por el camino de la independencia y del Songun y desempenan un papel aun mayor en forjar el destino de la humanidad y el futuro del mundo. Esto es la caracteristica esencial de la epoca actual distinta de la anterior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Con nada podra detener la corriente del desarrollo de la historia de la epoca actual enrumbada a la independencia y el Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El Dirigente Kim Jong Il dio analisis y evaluacion cientificos sobre la caracteristica de la epoca actual e impulso energicamente el desarrollo de la historia de la humanidad realizando asi proezas inmortales en el cumplimiento de la causa de la independencia en el mundo entero.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
