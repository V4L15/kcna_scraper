The typical case is that they ran an armored car over two young middle school girls, Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son, on a road in Yangju County, Kyonggi Province in broad daylight on June 13, 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States must withdraw its forces from south Korea at once, putting an end to the history of crimes in which it has only imposed misfortunes and sufferings on the south Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then, he had a confidential talk with Japan's defence minister over the matter of submitting to the provisional Diet a new \"amendment to the law on special measures against terrorism\". He also instructed the minister to give the people understandable explanation about the \"importance\" of Japan's involvement in the \"anti-terrorism war\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The defence minister and the foreign minister of Japan, too, stressed the \"need\" to revise the above-said law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on it, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today charges that their assertion is intended to let the \"Self-Defence Forces\" go on their advance and operational activities overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries, who persist in the revision of the law while leaving no stones unturned to carry it into practice, is to always act a war servant for the U.S and set out on the road of overseas expansion with the backing of their master obtained in return for their service, the commentary points out, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their theory of revising the law precisely means a doctrine for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are advertising about the opinion of the world community as if it is expressing \"understanding\" and \"sympathy\" with their involvement in the \"anti-terrorism war\". Such behavior is nothing but a distortion of the reality and a foolish deed of those not knowing where they stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world community does never want the Japanese militarists to participate and make \"contribution\" to the U.S.-led \"anti-terrorism war\" which makes blood-stained history of aggression. On the contrary, it demands that Japan settle its crime-woven past as early as possible and immediately stop the moves for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better behave themselves, facing up to the trend of the times.  \r\n\r\n"

Los asesinatos y otros actos criminales de las tropas invasoras yanquis ocupantes del Sur de Corea se perpetran sin cesar tambien en el nuevo siglo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe poner fin a la historia criminal que acarreo desdichas y sufrimientos a los surcoreanos y retirar sin demora sus tropas del Sur de Corea. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
