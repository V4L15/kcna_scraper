This clearly indicates that the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war of aggression against the DPRK and its preemptive nuclear attack upon it have been actively pushed forward at a final phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. war scenarios against the DPRK have been put into more specific and concrete shape. The U.S. has staged more than 100 provocative war drills together with south Korea and Japan every year. An exercise is now under way to evacuate families of the U.S. troops and other Americans from south Korea in case of emergency on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is obvious to everyone that such war drills are something that can be seen only on the eve of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the U.S. has massively transferred and deployed ultra-modern war equipment in and around south Korea under the signboard of filling up \"the vacuum of forces\" and \"security vacuum\" according to its plan for the redeployment of its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forward-deployment of 15 F-117s in south Korea suggests that the U.S. may mount any time a preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK as part of a new war against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for the extremely tense situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. loudmouthed \"CONPLAN\" and \"regular rotational deployment of the fighter bombers\" only remind one of an ostrich policy as they are aimed at covering up its attempt to ignite a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to give up its policy of aggression against the DPRK, clearly mindful that Washington's wild ambition to stifle the DPRK by force can never come true.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly shows how far their impudence and moral vulgarity have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has already been recorded as the world's biggest war criminal state with the worst record of abduction cases for the hideous anti-human crimes it had committed against Koreans and other Asian people in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, it does not bother to kidnap and abduct people of other countries, staging one \"abduction\" drama after another stunning the world people. The Japanese reactionaries' abduction of DPRK citizens, in particular, is well organized and premeditated in its scale and nature and most dastardly and malicious in its means and methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese woman residing in the DPRK An Phil Hwa revealed detailed facts in this regard before domestic and foreign reporters after her return to the DPRK in April. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of sarcasm for Japan to talk about the DPRK's \"abduction issue,\" as it is a master hand in abduction with a century-long criminal record. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan was and is the assailant and the DPRK the victim as regards the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has played wicked games to politicize and internationalize the \"abduction issue\", raising a terrific outcry over it whenever an opportunity presented itself. But this is nothing but a clumsy trick of a brutal assailant to paint himself as an innocent \"victim\" and thus cover up his crimes and evade the settlement of the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is left to be done by the Japanese politicians is to make a sincere apology and compensation for the hideous human rights abuses committed by Japan against the Koreans in the past, in conformity with the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
