They are a premeditated action of the Kim Young Sam group to bridge over the serious ruling crisis by inciting a war atmosphere.\r\n   The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland stressed this in its information No. 738 published on Monday.\r\n   The information said:\r\n   The traitorous \"civilian\" group, unable to put down the people's anti-Kim Young Sam struggle with fascist repression and deception, are now clamouring about \"threat\" from the north, as they did so often in the past.  In this way they are trying to divert the public attention within and without elsewhere and tide over the worst crisis.\r\n   It is well illustrated by the outrageous armed provocation of June 5, when warships of the puppets intruded deep into the territorial waters of the DPRK on the West Sea, fired shells at our peaceful fishing boats and attempted to kidnap them.\r\n   However, such criminal war moves will only precipitate their own destruction. \r\n   The Kim Young Sam group must awake from the foolish daydream of bridging over the present crisis through reckless military confrontation and war moves, immediately step down and face a stern punishment by the nation, as unanimously demanded by the fellow countrymen. \r\n\r\n"

The puppets also ordered universities to \"heavily discipline\" those who played the leading role in the inaugural ceremony of \"Hanchongryon\", close down its offices at all campuses and \"totally block violent demonstrations\".\r\n   The news analyst goes on:\r\n   It has been widely known that the puppets are trying to obliterate \"Hanchongryon\" which is leading the movement for independence, democracy and reunification and the struggle against Kim Young Sam and the \"New Korea Party\" by branding it as \"violent forces benefitting the enemy\".\r\n   The puppets' suppression of \"Hanchongryon\" has reached an extremely reckless stage and \"Hanchongryon\" is faced with graver danger.\r\n   It is as clear as noonday that their suppression will lead to a scorched-earth operation against all the pro- reunification, pro-democracy forces in south Korea.    \r\n   The puppets must squarely see the trend of the times, discontinue the suppression of \"Hanchongryon\" at once and release all the arrested students without delay. \r\n\r\n"

It is quite different from the capitalist economic system based on the law of the jungle.\r\n   Collective self-reliance is a basic principle in south-south cooperation. It is an independent international movement of the developing countries to help one another for the realization of their common purpose and interests without expecting \"assistance\" or \"donation\" from the developed countries.\r\n   Only when the non-aligned and developing countries adhere to the principle of collective self-reliance can they successfully put into effect South-South Cooperation in the spirit of independence, solidarity and cooperation, not depending on the developed countries.\r\n   Complete equality and mutual benefit is one of the basic principles of South-South Cooperation. \r\n   They should develop cooperation and exchanges for genuinely helping each other and promoting mutual interests, irrespective of the size of the territory and the degree of economic and cultural development, so that economic independence can be achieved and South-South Cooperation may be a model of the absolutely fair and equal international economic relationship.\r\n   The developing countries should establish a global system of preferential trade, expand barter and other forms of trade on the principle of mutual benefit and strive to give substantial assistance to the development of the national economy by giving loans with low interest or without interest.\r\n   What is important in South-South Cooperation is that the developing countries should put it into practice, mindful that this is their own concern to promote the common interests. To this end, they should have common views and attitude, intensify mutual political support, strive to implement the resolutions and action programmes adopted at international conferences, and constantly explore the positive forms and methods of broadening the scope of cooperation and enhancing its effectiveness. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

            "content": "KSC lambastes Kim Young Sam regime's crackdown on \"Hanchongryon\" \r\nPyongyang, June 11 (KCNA) -- The Korean Student Committee made public an open letter on Tuesday condemning the Kim Young Sam regime's harsh suppression of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) involving one million students.\r\n   The letter said:\r\n   In south Korea the autonomous activities of the student organization which had been continued over the past ten years have been totally banned and students arrested. Some university student councils have quitted \"Hanchongryon\", egged on by the puppet Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP), and moves have been seen to hurt the student organization.\r\n  Some dishonest students who have betrayed their honor and conscience for money given by the \"ANSP\" are favoring the south Korean puppet authorities in cracking down on \"Hanchongryon\" by branding its righteous activities as \"leftist, pro-communist activities benefitting the enemy\". \r\nThey, on clandestine instructions of the \"ANSP\", are charging that the student organization only seeks fighting, \"unaware of its intrinsic duty and role\".\r\n   It is the Kim Young Sam regime that compels \"Hanchongryon\" to engage in fighting. The regime has resorted to the unprecedented fascist rule under the \"civilian\" veil.\r\n   The blame for the casualties at the time of the inaugural ceremony of the fifth-term \"Hanchongryon\" does not rest with the organization, but with the \"ANSP\" and Kim Young Sam, who ordered the brutal crackdown on the students' peaceful event.\r\n   Some university student councils, ignoring the truth, have quitted \"Hanchongryon\" allegedly to seek a new student movement, instigated by \"ANSP\" hirelings. Among the universities are those which took the lead in the anti-dictatorship, pro-democracy  struggle of south Korean students in the past.\r\n   If a university rejects the lawful student organization, which has grown stronger through such heroic activities of students as the April 19, June 10 pro-democracy and August 15 Yonsei campus struggle, such an act is as good as hurting its own proud tradition and honor by itself.\r\n   The patriotic-minded students of \"Hanchongryon\" must exercise utmost vigilance, find out and ostracize those who try to disintegrate \"Hanchongryon\" on the instructions of the \"ANSP\", thus foiling its plots.\r\n   South Korea's venal media which help the \"ANSP\" in its efforts to stifle \"Hanchongryon\" must take a proper attitude and stand befitting genuine press faithfully serving the people.\r\n   Those who are calling for the disorganization of \"Hanchongryon\", a reunification vanguard, are philistines who have lost face as politicians. They must clearly know that what should be dissolved at once in south Korea is not \"Hanchongryon\" but the \"ANSP\", which plays every conceivable trick to obliterate the pro-reunification, pro-democracy forces. \r\n\r\n"
