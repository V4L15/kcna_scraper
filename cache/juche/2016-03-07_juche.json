            "content": "DPRK National Defence Commission Warns of Military Counter-action for Preemptive Attack\r\n Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- The National Defence Commission of the DPRK issued a statement on Monday in connection with the fact that the U.S. imperialists and south Korean puppet forces decided to kick off the largest-ever joint military exercises Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 today.\n\t\t\t\t\t They are claiming that the joint military exercises amount to \"a crucial pressure\" pursuant to the unreasonable UN \"resolution on sanctions\" faked up by them under the groundless pretext of the DPRK's self-defensive first H-bomb test and its legitimate launch of earth observation satellite Kwangmyongsong-4.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies, seized with extreme frenzy for invading the north, threw off even the deceptive mask \"annual and \"defensive ones\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation is getting ever more serious as the enemies decided to stage the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military exercises by the way of fighting an actual war involving the thrice-cursed \"beheading operation\" aimed to remove the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and \"bring down its social system\" pursuant to the extremely adventurous OPLAN 5015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement solemnly clarified the following principled stand as regards the fact that the prevailing situation reached a dangerous phase which should not be overlooked any longer:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The army and people of the DPRK will launch an all-out offensive to decisively counter the U.S. and its followers' hysteric nuclear war moves to plunge the space of the DPRK's existence into a nuclear disaster, not content with wantonly encroaching upon the sovereignty and security of the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragedy is that the U.S. and its followers have not yet realized how the illegal and outrageous \"sanctions\" make this land boil like a crucible of battle for wiping out the enemies and into what great fury their war frenzy for invading the north with nuclear threat is lashing all the service personnel and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the enemies are foolishly resorting to military means including nuclear attack on the DPRK, all its service personnel and people will turn out in the general offensive to fully demonstrate the tremendous military muscle with nuclear force as pivot which they have built under the slogan of wiping out the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys to the last man. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2 . The army and people of the DPRK will take military counteraction for preemptive attack so that they may deal merciless deadly blows at the enemies under the grave situation where they are working with bloodshot eyes to infringe upon the dignity, sovereignty and vital rights of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have the Juche-based mode of military counteraction to defend the socialist country as firm as a rock from any aggression and war in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the joint military exercises to be staged by the enemies are regarded as the most undisguised nuclear war drills aimed to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, its military counteraction will be more preemptive and offensive nuclear strike to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indiscriminate nuclear strike to be made by the DPRK will clearly show those keen on aggression and war the military mettle of Juche Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Preemptive nuclear strike of justice is to be made in the order specified by the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army in its crucial statement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. If the enemies dare kick off even the slightest military action while vociferating about \"beheading operation\" aimed to remove the supreme headquarters of the DPRK and \"bring down its social system\", its army and people will not miss the opportunity but realize the greatest desire of the Korean nation through a sacred war of justice for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have a military operation plan of our style to liberate south Korea and strike the U.S. mainland ratified by our dignified supreme headquarters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pursuant to it, offensive means have been deployed to put major strike targets in the operation theatres of south Korea within the firing range and the powerful nuclear strike means targeting the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces bases in the Asia-Pacific region and the U.S. mainland are always ready to fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If we push the buttons to annihilate the enemies even right now, all bases of provocations will be reduced to seas in flames and ashes in a moment and the U.S. imperialists' nuclear strategic means on which the puppet forces depend as \"saviors\" turn into piles of scrap iron whether they are in the air, seas and land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The time will prove how the crime-woven history of the U.S. imperialists who have grown corpulent through aggression and war will come to an end and how the Park Geun Hye group's disgraceful remaining days will meet a miserable doom as it is keen on the confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will make the gunfire of provocateurs in the reckless war of aggression sound as a sad dirge."

            "content": "Provokers Will Have to Pay High Price: CPRK Spokesman\r\n Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released the following statement Monday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the Park Geun Hye group of traitors finally commenced military actions to violate the sovereignty of the DPRK and destroy its right to existence by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is joint military rehearsal Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military exercises that started Monday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time they even cast away the spurious mask of \"annual\" and \"defensive\" which they have so far oft-repeated to conduct them as the most undisguised, most vicious and the largest-ever nuclear war rehearsal for invading the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rehearsal cannot but be branded as the ferocious war racket that can never be tolerated by the army and people of the DPRK as it was started in the wake of the fabrication of the illegal \"resolution\" of the UN Security Council against the DPRK in a bid to politically isolate it and strangle its economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is something unprecedented that almost all three strategic nuclear strike means of the U.S. were deployed throughout south Korea one by one and the large special operational groups and surprise strike landing teams of the three services of the U.S. forces which earned an ill fame as a group of murderers have been engaged in the exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is serious is that they are openly claiming that the aim of the joint military drills is to confirm the possibility of applying OPLAN 5015 to an actual war whose main contents are \"beheading operation\" targeting the supreme headquarters of the revolution of the DPRK, a surprise landing operation for occupying strategic vantage points all of a sudden and an operation for preemptive strikes at nuclear strike means of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation has reached the phase that can no longer be put under control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists and the puppet forces have escalated the situation under the pretext of the DPRK's H-bomb test for self-defence and its satellite launch for peaceful purposes, with an aim to ignite a war against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the prevailing situation the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea again reminds the U.S. imperialists and the puppet forces of south Korea of the fact that the DPRK did not make an empty talk when it said its measures for all-out counteraction include strong physical counteraction now that do-or-die battle of justice has begun to deal sledge-hammer blows at the aggressors and provokers seized with hysteria for a nuclear war and to defend the sovereignty and the right to existence of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war maniacs of aggression should not run wild if they are to evade the retaliatory strike to be inflicted by the miniaturized, high-precision and diversified nuclear weapons deployed in operation fields of the powerful revolutionary Paektusan army and ready to be used by it at any moment, and not to be perished in the sea of flames by various caliber multiple rocket launchers produced in a serial way and deployed even in reserve artillery units.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, and the Park Geun Hye group of traitors, the worst source of trouble to the nation, should never forget that all the bases of aggression in south Korea, Japan, the Pacific and the U.S. mainland are within the firing range of various type strike means of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemy should clearly know that all the operation units of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK, which turned the mode of their preceding military counteraction into that of pre-emptive strike to cope with the snotty military actions of the enemy attempting to stamp out the sovereignty and right to existence of the DPRK, are placed on a fully-ready posture to detect at once and launch a pre-emptive merciless and annihilating strikes at them, not giving any chance of regret, in case they show any sign of provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the final decision made by the service personnel and people of the DPRK that they should deal with the U.S. imperialists and the Park Geun Hye group of traitors by force of arms only as they are bereft of any common knowledge and reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans at home and abroad and the world peace-loving people aspiring after peace and reunification of Korea would respond to the DPRK's final war of justice against the U.S., the sacred war for national reunification, by joining the high-pitched no-war struggle against the U.S. and Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemy forces' war racket against the DPRK being recklessly staged in south Korea, a dangerous nuclear arsenal, is overlooked, the Korean nation will neither be safe nor will the world be able to escape from the disaster of a nuclear war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group of traitors will meet the bitterest defeat and disgraceful ruin as it once again cried out for making the DPRK pay a \"due price\" together with the gangster-like U.S. imperialists that challenged the dignity and social system of the DPRK in defiance of the solemn warnings served by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The final victory is in store for the service personnel and people of the DPRK who turned out in a just confrontation with the U.S. and the sacred war for national reunification under the uplifted banner of independence and Songun."

Nuestro ejercito y pueblo coreanos entraran en la ofensiva general para hacer frente total a la furia provocativa de guerra de agresion del imperio yanqui y las fuerzas seguidoras que insatisfechos con violar flagrantemente la soberania y la seguridad de la digna RPDC se desesperan para llevar nuestro espacio de subsistencia al torbellino de la calamidad nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa tragedia es que Estados Unidos y las fuerzas seguidoras no perciben todavia como la injusta e ilegal \"sancion\" hace convertir este territorio en el violento crisol de exterminio a los enemigo y como la locura de guerra de agresion al Norte acompanada de amenaza nuclear enfurece la ira de los uniformados y civiles coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDado que los enemigos recurren estupidamente a los medios militares inclusive el ataque nuclear a la RPDC, nuestro ejercito y pueblo se levantaran en la ofensiva general para manifestar sin reserva el inagotable poderio militar, cuyo medula son las fuerzas armadas nucleares, consolidadas bajo la consigna de exterminio completo al imperio yanqui y a los traidores titeres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.

            "content": "CRPP advierte a agresores y provocadores contra RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 7 de marzo (ACNC) -- En relacion con que se iniciaron al fin y al cabo las acciones militares de los imperialistas yanquis y la banda traidora de Pak Geun-hye encaminadas a aplastar con fuerza la soberania y el derecho a existencia de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, el portavoz del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 7 la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente entrenamiento militar conjunto es un simulacro de guerra nuclear de mayor envergadura para la agresion al Norte que se torna mas abierto y mas brutal quitando completamente el caracter \"anual\" y \"defensivo\" que hasta la fecha los enemigos lo enmascararon como \"lo anual y defensivo\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, nos vemos obligados a ratificar como los imperdonables alborotos belicosos de agresion por el ejercito y el pueblo de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea el presente simulacro que se realiza de inmediato despues de la fabricacion de la \"resolucion de sancion\" del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU inventada ilegalmente para aislar politicamente y asfixiar economicamente a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un hecho sin precedente de la historia el que fueron emplazados uno tras otro casi los 3 medios norteamericanos de ataque nuclear estrategico en la zona surcoreana y se movilizaron hasta las unidades de tropas especiales y los equipos de desembarco para el ataque de las fuerzas terrestres, aereas y navales norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no podemos pasar por alto es que esos tipejos estan anunciando abiertamente que la meta del presente simulacro reside en afirmar las posibilidades de las batallas reales de \"OPLAN 5015\" que incluye la \"operacion de descabezamiento\" para la eliminacion de la Direccion Suprema de la Revolucion de la RPDC, la operacion de desembarco sorpresivo para ocupar sorpresivamente a los importantes puntos estrategicos y la otra de ataque preventivo contra los medios de ataque nuclear de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion ha llegado a la extremada gravedad irrecuperable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los hechos testimonian fehacientemente que el imperio yanqui y los titeres surcoreanos vinieron agravando la situacion so pretexto de la prueba de bomba H, medida autodefensiva de la RPDC, y el lanzamiento de satelite artificial con fines pacificos con el objeto de encender la mecha de la guerra de agresion al Norte (de Corea).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrente a la situacion creada el Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) vuelve a recordar que no es vana la declaracion de la RPDC sobre la contramedida total incluida la fuerte reaccion fisica que ya hemos aclarado a los imperialistas yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos en el momento solemne en que se comenzo la justa lucha decisiva para castigar a la furia de guerra nuclear de los agresores y provocadores y defender la soberania y el derecho a subsistencia del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos agresores y belicistas deben actuar con prudencia si quieren evitar el ataque de represalia de las ojivas nucleares minimizadas, precisas y diversificadas, que estan ubicadas en zonas operacionales del ejercito revolucionario del monte Paektu y preparadas para lanzarse en cualquier momento, y de los proyectiles reactivos autopropulsados de diferentes calibres ya fabricadas en serie y equipadas hasta en la unidades de artilleria de reserva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos imperialistas norteamericanos, enemigos jurados de la nacion coreana, y los compinches titeres surcoreanos, obstaculo nacional de categoria especial, no deben olvidar ni un momento el hecho de que todas las bases de agresion situadas en el suelo surcoreano, Japon, region de Asia-Pacifico y el territorio norteamericano estan en el alcance de tiro de los medios de golpe de diferentes armamentos por las fuerzas armadas de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY deben darse clara cuenta de que todo el colectivo operacional de las fuerzas armadas revolucionadas coreanas, que cambiaron su establecido modo de reaccion militar con el de ataque preventivo frente a la ridicula furia militar de los enemigos que se desesperan para exterminar la soberania y el derecho a la existencia de la RPDC estan en el estado de ataque sorpresivo de asestarles con antemano el despiadado ataque demoledor a los enemigos sin darles el tiempo de arrepentirse si se descubren la minima muestra de movilizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo coreanos sacaron una conclusion final de que hay que saldar la cuenta solo con la fuerza militar con los imperialistas yanquis y la horda titere de Park Geun-hye, que no tienen el conocimiento ni el juicio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA nuestra justa batalla final antiyanqui y la sagrada guerra de reunificacion de la patria, todos los coreanos aspirantes a la paz y la reintegracion del pais y los progresistas mundiales amantes de la paz se veran obligados a responder con la fuerte y demoledor lucha antiyanqui, anti-guerra y anti-Park Geun-hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi nos quedamos indiferentes con los alborotos belicos de agresion al Norte de los enemigos que se ejecutan imprudentemente sobre el arsenal nuclear, la nacion coreana no podra estar a salvo, ni el mundo podra evitar la calamidad de guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSolo mereceran la mas miserable derrota y el vergonzoso fin a los gangsteriles imperialistas yanquis que se desafiaron a la dignidad y el regimen de la RPDC sin guardar en el corazon la advertencia severa nuestra y los compinches de Park, traidores astutos que volvieron a hablar del \"precio merecido\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa victoria final esta al lado del ejercito y el pueblo coreanos movilizados en la justa confrontacion total antiyanqui y la sagrada batalla de reunificacion enarbolando en alto la bandera de independencia y del Songun."

            "content": "ACNC advierte a EE.UU. a abandonar ilusion vana de derrocar la RPDC\r\nPyongyang, 7 de marzo (ACNC) -- El Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU fabrico la \"resolucion de sancion\" contra la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea acusandola de fortalecimiento del disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa y de  lanzamiento legitimo del satelite de observacion de la Tierra Kwangmyongsong-4. \n\t\t\t\t\tLa fabricacion de la \"resolucion de sancion\" anti-RPDC, siendo un acto hostil que ilegaliza los derechos independientes de un Estado soberano, no puede representar la justa demanda de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo nos hemos restringido ninguna vez por tales \"resoluciones de sancion\" carentes de la justicia e imparcialidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ex funcionarios de alto rango y muchos especialistas en el problema coreano de EE.UU. opinan unanimemente que mediante la sancion no se puede resolver el problema. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, el ex asistente del secretario de Estado norteamericano y profesor de asuntos internacionales de la Universidad de Pensilvania, Joseph Dethomas, inserto en la pagina Web de la Universidad Nacional de Australia EASP ASIA FORUM el articulo intitulado \"'Sancion' sobre el Norte de Corea significa la martillada sin clavo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl articulo senala que EE.UU., el Sur de Corea y Japon trasladaron de la politica de \"paciencia estrategica\" a la de sancion adicional para lograr la renuncia del plan nuclear y de misil de la RPDC y agrega que sera clarividente abandonar la esperanza en algun fruto. Acota que lograr con la sancion la renuncia del plan nuclear y de misil de la RPDC es una ilusion irrealizable igual a la martillada sin clavo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el interior de la ONU tambien diagnostican que la sancion anti-RPDC de la ONU de 10 anos pasados fracaso en impedir la prueba nuclear y el lanzamiento de misil de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos especialistas de la ONU sospechan la eficiencia de la sancion anti-RPDC de la ONU diciendo que las sanciones no pudieron frenar la ampliacion de la capacidad nuclear y de misiles de Corea socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa sancion anti-RPDC bajo el mando de EE.UU. desprecia la ley internacional y los reglamentos de las relaciones mutuas entre los paises y resulta una grave violacion de los derechos humanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Tratado sobre la Definicion de Agresion y otros convenios y resoluciones internacionales determinan como agresion y violacion de la ley internacional danar la soberania y la independencia economica de otros paises, tomar las medidas de presion economica sobre sus arterias de la economia y ejercerles el bloqueo economico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una conferencia de prensa, concedida en la sede de la ONU, el director operacional de la Oficina de Coordinacion de Asuntos Humanitarios de la ONU, John Ging, contesto que \"los ejecutantes de la sancion deben responsabilizarse de su resultado\" expresando preocupacion por la sancion anti-RPDC del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHistoricamente, EE.UU. aplico las sanciones sistematicas y globales en todas las esferas de vida socioeconomica incluso el comercio, la circulacion monetaria y la inversion de la RPDC a fin de aislarla y asfixiarla.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, recurrio con frenesi a las abiertas maniobras belicas para preparar las condiciones favorables a provocar la guerra de agresion mediante la debilitacion de la potencialidad militar de la RPDC y derrocarla con armas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, fracasaron la sancion y presion de mas de medio siglo de EE.UU. contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAun en medio de la persistente presion politica y militar, la amenaza y el bloqueo de las fuerzas aliadas imperialistas, la RPDC ocupo la posicion de pais poseedor de bomba de hidrogeno y lanzador de satelite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho demuestra que es una ilusion vana el intento de doblegar a la RPDC con la sancion."
