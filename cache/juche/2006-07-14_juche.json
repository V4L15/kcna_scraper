In this connection the delegation of the north side to the talks Thursday took the initiative of proposing the close of the talks and issued a statement clarifying its stand. \r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the north side made every sincere effort to make the talks fruitful on the basis of mutual understanding and confidence, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" clarified in the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The south side, however, deliberately threw difficulties in the way of the talks, echoing what others claim quite contrary to the interests of the nation at the talks between compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n  The south side raised only issues irrelevant to the talks contrary to the original mission of the talks, failing to propose any issue pending an urgent solution for the development of the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The south side went the lengths of refusing to discuss the proposal for developing the cooperation between the north and the south and reunion between separated families and relatives on a higher stage advanced by the north side from its compatriotic and humanitarian stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the north side's delegation exercised patience and showed magnanimity towards the delegation of the south side, repeatedly urging it to quickly rectify its wrong stand and return to its original approach toward the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side obstinately avoided the discussion on the basic issues under absurd pretexts and with poor excuses, though it claimed it understood the north side's intention and good will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a limit to the power and patience of the north side to persuade the other party refusing to respond to its sincerity and good faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The delegation of the north side is, therefore, of the view that it has no option but to go back irrespective of its itinerary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The responsibility for this entirely rests with the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side never likes an empty talk but will keep to the path chosen by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The south side will have to pay a due price before the nation for having made the hard-won talks fruitless and brought unpredictably catastrophic consequences to the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side will strictly take the south side to task for having rendered the talks fruitless with its hostile and unreasonable attitude towards compatriots in breach of the idea of the joint declaration.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n They have employed diverse ways and means for obtaining secrets of other countries' politics, economy, military and other fields to achieve their aggressive and reactionary purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been wiretapping telephone messages of the leadership and high-ranking officials of other countries for years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a recently declassified confidential document of the U.S., it began setting up wiretapping network targeting on the Soviet Union right after the Second World War. After setting up wiretapping centers with maximum capacity in Norway and Canada, the U.S. wiretapped telephone messages exchanged between Soviet vessels sailing across the Arctic Ocean. U.S. spy satellites kept watching Moscow and its spies installed wiretapping devices even inside the Kremlin Palace which housed the headquarters of the Soviet Union. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such wiretapping has become all the more undisguised since the demise of the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has attached particular importance to eavesdropping telephone messages and talks of the leadership and VIPs of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been keen on gathering information through hi-tech devices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. imperialists are watching waters of the Asia-Pacific with the help of supersonic detectors as part of their espionage operations based on the latest science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the Cold War the U.S. developed a supersonic detector to watch submarines in the Asia-Pacific under the pretext of \"coping with threat\" from the Soviet Union. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently it put waters through which Chinese fleets sail to and from the Pacific under its watch and has been hell-bent on hi-tech espionage against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are also using seabed optical fiber cables for wiretapping and espionage of other forms in the Asia-Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. installed new type supersonic detectors in the Asia-Pacific to intensify its spy operation in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It set up a new office specializing in espionage against the DPRK in the CIA and keeps WC-135W weather research craft in the air above the East Sea of Korea to intensify its espionage.  It is mobilizing various types of reconnaissance planes to spy on the DPRK. All this is a prelude to a new Korean war.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are popular with citizens for their fresh and good taste.\r\n The factory, built in October Juche 81 (1992), produces hundreds of tons of kimchi a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 20 kinds of kimchi produced there are supplied to Pyongyang citizens all the year round and kimchi made of whole cabbage is exported to China and other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is one of the kimchi factories constructed in accordance with the plan of President Kim Il Sung to free women from the heavy burden of the household chores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il, who is always concerned for the improvement of dietary life of the people, instructed officials that the production capacity of kimchi factories should not be reduced though families prepare kimchi by themselves. He added that factory-made kimchi should be provided to those who moved into new houses, married couples who made a home and hostellers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In an interview with KCNA, Kim Kum Hyong, manager of the factory, said: Kimchi is a traditional food peculiar to the Korean nation. The Korean kimchi was selected as one of the five world-best health foodstuffs recently by a world-authoritative health organ. I, kimchi producer, feel the national pride. I will do my best to produce a large quantity of kimchi and thus promote people's health.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
