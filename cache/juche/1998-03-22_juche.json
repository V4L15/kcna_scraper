It is aimed at enforcing the policy of war and aggression with these regions as main fronts, stifling the revolutionary and independent nations and taking the military initiative and strategic supremacy in big powers' scramble for supremacy and thus dominating the world by strength.\r\n   As above said, the United States, which regards strength as \"panacea\", is unhesitatingly taking arbitrary and high-handed, military actions in disregard of the progressive mankind, the United Nations and international law.\r\n   Its rulers now try to revive \"Monroe Doctrine\" and \"Marshall Plan\", clamouring about the worldwide trend toward \"integration\" and \"superiority\" of the American way and order. It is part of its moves intended to establish American laws and order in the world and thus Americanize the world.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
