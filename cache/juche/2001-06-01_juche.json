            "content": "U.S. forces' pullout from S. Korea demanded \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The Bush administration is insisting that the DPRK reduce its conventional forces under the absurd pretext of a number of threats from it and working hard to build up public opinion on the issue.\r\n In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disarmament on the Korean peninsula calls for terminating the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States, withdrawing the U.S. forces from South Korea, wiping out mistrust and misunderstanding between the north and the south and reducing their armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point is to put an end to the hostile relations between the DPRK and the United States and effect the U.S. forces pullback from South Korea. Armed forces in the north and the south cannot be cut down without finding a solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the agreement on nonaggression was adopted early in the 1990s thanks to the initiative and positive efforts of the DPRK the United States staged a large-scale war exercise against the north under the pretext of the non-existent \"suspected nuclear program\" of the DPRK, barring the implementation of the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This taught a lesson that inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation is bound to strike a snag unless the U.S. forces' pullback from South Korea is preceded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There may be different ways for effectuating it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The best of them is for the united states to give up its wrong policy towards the DPRK and sign a peace agreement with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By nature the issue of disarmament surfaced on the Korean peninsula due to the U.S. troops' occupation of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for this occupation the Korean nation would not have been split and two parts of Korea would not have levelled arms at each other for scores of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States keeps tens of thousands of forces in South Korea and hundreds of thousands of South Korean troops under its command. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a very big gap not only in the strength of armed forces but in combat equipment. The DPRK does not have even a single nuclear weapon but the U.S. troops have a lot of nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the troop reduction on the peninsula would be meaningless and invalid without the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from South Korea in view of either the aim and content of the issue of disarmament there or imbalance in the strength of armed forces between the DPRK and the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Troop cutback on the Korean peninsula should begin with the pullout of the U.S. troops. the withdrawal of the U.S. troops is prerequisite to disarmament on the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"
