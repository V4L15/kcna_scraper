President Kim Il Sung, the peerless patriot and legendary hero, put an end to the atrocious colonial rule of the Japanese imperialists by leading the heroic armed struggle to victory. After the liberation the U.S. imperialists placed south Korea under their military occupation. And when they provoked a war of aggression with the criminal scheme to realize their ambition for dominating Korea, the Korean nation gave them a taste of its fist and won a great victory in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace of the country and the dignity of the nation can be defended and the historic cause of national reunification be accomplished only by a resolute struggle for independence against outsiders. This is the truth engraved ever deeper on the hearts of the Koreans today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should wage a vehement struggle to achieve national sovereignty on the nationwide scale, holding aloft the banner of national independence against outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole nation should pool its strength and put up a stiff fight against the U.S. strategy of domination over Korea and anti-DPRK hostile policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reinvasion design of the Japanese reactionaries, the sworn enemy of the Korean nation, must be thwarted. With bitter resentment at the Japanese imperialists, all the Koreans should deal a decisive counter blow to the anti-DPRK sanctions by the Japanese forces of aggression and smash their anti-DPRK moves and make Japan pay a proper price for its past crimes through a nationwide anti-Japanese struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the domination and interference of the outsiders are to be brought to an end and national sovereignty be achieved, the \"Grand National Party,\" a group of traitors allied with outside forces, must be pushed out of the arena of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should work strenuously to see that importance is attached to the nation, peace defended and unity achieved under the banner of independence against outside forces and thus bring earlier the historic day when the desire of the March First fighters will be realized and the dignity of the reunified Korean nation be displayed all over the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reality of the DPRK reinforced the world people's faith in the victory of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the law governing the development of history that the new is sure to triumph in the struggle against the old. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism fundamentally differs from capitalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Capitalism is an unpopular exploiting society, an unequal society where the privileged have power in hands and get richer by exploiting the toiling people who account for the majority of the population. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism is incomparably advantageous to capitalism. In socialist society, the people are politically stable and lead a worthwhile and happy life, having sound thinking and mentality and culture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the DPRK, the people have become the master of the country and society and lead a happy life on an equal footing, exercising all their rights. The DPRK is the only country in the world where people are guaranteed all rights ranging from the right to work to the right to food, clothing and housing and the right to study and receive medical care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"advantages\" of capitalism much touted by the imperialists and the reactionaries are nothing but sophism to cover up the reactionary and corrupt nature and vulnerability of the capitalist system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
