The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have grown stronger in quality incomparable with that in the 1950s and the DPRK has strong power enough to smash any aggression by the enemies at one stroke. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as foolish as playing a life-risking gamble for the U.S. to try to stand in showdown with the DPRK which has emerged as a world-level political, ideological and military power. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly see who its rival is and opt for respecting the sovereignty of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. is true in its claim that it wishes for peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and has no intent to oppose the DPRK, it should, first of all, respond to the DPRK's demand for dismantling the \"UN Command\", military mechanism for aggression of the DPRK, to prove itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. assures us in practice of its intent not to pursue hostility towards the DPRK, it will come out for confidence-building. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should clearly know that it can expect nothing from the DPRK with its confrontation idea of the Cold War era, and boldly make a correct decision."
