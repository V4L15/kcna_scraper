Korea\r\nPyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released a statement Sunday on the lapse of 69 years since the U.S. imperialists' illegal occupation of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. occupied south Korea on September 8, 1945 under the pretext of \"disarming the Imperial Japanese Army\", the start of craftier and tyrannical colonial rule by the U.S. that replaced the Japanese imperialists, the statement said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. occupation of south Korea forced the Korean nation to undergo unprecedented misfortune of division and the most devastating war at the hands of the U.S., the Korean nation being divided into the north and the south, it noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the U.S. domination and occupation, south Korea turned into a military base for invading the northern half of Korea and Asia and dominating the world and into an outpost for a nuclear war. This posed the constant danger of war to the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. does not want the Korean nation getting reconciled, achieving unity and advancing for reunification. So it instigates the puppet forces to escalate hostility with the north and fight against fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not possible to improve the north-south relations nor is it possible to achieve peace, reunification and prosperity of the country and the nation as long as the U.S. military presence in south Korea is left intact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is imperative to end at an early date the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea, the root cause of all misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Gone are the days when the U.S. disguised itself as \"protector\" and \"helper\" of south Korea and no Korean wants the U.S. imperialist aggression forces to remain in south Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should roll back its anachronistic policy of occupying south Korea and its hostile policy toward the DPRK and pull out of south Korea at once together with its aggression troops before meeting a final destruction in the face of the strong protest of the Koreans and the merciless retaliatory blows by the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop acting as henchmen of the U.S. and imploring for the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' permanent presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the present regime of south Korea has a true intent on improving the north-south relations, it should discard the pro-American policy, stop all DPRK-targeted war drills in league with the U.S. and make a bold decision of withdrawing the U.S. forces from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Herein lies a key to achieving the peace and reunification of the Korean peninsula and improving the north-south relations."

Korea Are Root Cause of Disturbing Peace in Korea: Minju Joson\r\nPyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- 69 years have passed since the U.S. forces occupied south Korea, Minju Joson Sunday says in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces in south Korea are the root cause of deteriorating the situation on the Korean peninsula and disturbing regional peace and they are a cancer-like entity, the commentary notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the liberation of Korea there was a strong demand for the withdrawal of foreign forces from Korea. However, the U.S. forces stayed in south Korea, seeking their permanent presence there. They have committed ceaseless military hostile acts against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. shifted the pivot of its strategy for world domination in the 21st century to the Asia-Pacific region, regarding the Korean peninsula as a theatre of stand-off of force. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a military conflict occurs on the peninsula, it will quickly spill over to its neighboring countries and the U.S. will not be safe either. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces should be withdrawn from south Korea not only for the sake of peace on the peninsula and in the rest of the world but also for the lives of tens of thousands of American troops in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a matter of fact, the U.S. troops in south Korea are little short of hostages held by the DPRK. If the DPRK opens fire, the miserable U.S. soldiers in south Korea will never escape an annihilation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is a good time for the U.S. troops to go back politely. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. persists in military confrontation with the DPRK despite its warnings, the U.S. will be wholly responsible for the ensuing catastrophic consequences."

It is an undemocratic ruling against progressive media, they said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Media which should be closed are conservative ones slandering the north often and begging the U.S. to stifle the fellow countrymen in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the authorities do not take issue with such media but try to shut down Jaju Minbo, which has called for achieving independent and peaceful reunification in the spirit of By Our Nation Itself. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers declared they would not tolerate the moves of the above-said forces to shut down Jaju Minbo."
