This reveals the aggressive nature of Japan turning to the Right and heading for its militarization, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n In the new \"defence program\" the Japanese reactionaries called for establishing a posture for immediate counter-action to defend their territory and founding a \"central force for immediate counteraction\" for \"cooperation in UN peace-keeping operation\". This is nothing but a plan for overseas attack and war under the changed conditions and circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are considering defining the participation in the \"UN peace-keeping operation\" as the major task of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in the new program. This is prompted by their intention to dispatch SDF to any part of the world and officially push forward its overseas military operation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now escalating its war of aggression worldwide under the pretext of the \"war on terrorism\" and urging Japan to render active military support to it. Japan is taking this situation as a golden opportunity for revising the article in the present constitution which bans war and going in for overseas aggression without hindrance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the Japanese reactionaries are stepping up military preparations for overseas aggression without restriction under the pretext of \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK, the commentary says, contending that a strong military shield and countermeasure are the best option to retaliate against Japan's dangerous military actions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This move shows that the U.S. is framing terrible plots behind the scene to bring a storm of a nuclear war on the Korean peninsula, though it is talking a lot in public about \"dialogue,\" they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution read at the rally said the role of the U.S. Guam base was to throw the U.S. air force promptly into the Korean peninsula in case of contingency and the deployment of the strategic bombers there was a criminal arms buildup for bringing dark clouds of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war moves of the U.S. imperialists would be frustrated and peace and independent reunification be achieved certainly by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, it said.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the compatriots should wage a persistent and strenuous patriotic struggle for reunification with the conviction that the history of our nation was and is proud and will shine more brilliantly tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation-first spirit serves as an ideological and moral foundation for the nation to join efforts in solving the issue of reunification with the stance and posture that our nation is the best in the world. It is most essential today for all the members of the nation to give priority to the nation and pool efforts of the nation from the stance that their nation is the best. The issue of reunification can be solved in conformity with the will and interests of the nation only when we give priority to the nation and rely on its strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation-first spirit, which boosts pride in being the Korean nation and braces up national self-respect, is a powerful weapon helping vigorously advance the movement for the country's reunification with bolstered national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly indicates that its hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged and it has reached a more frantic stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. recent escalation of high-handed military posture and pressure upon the DPRK is nothing but a pipe dream intended to orchestrate on the Korean peninsula what happened in some Mid-east countries, pursuant to the logic of strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is expecting something to happen in the DPRK equating it with those Mid-east countries. This is a big blunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has strong pluck as its cause is just and as it has reliable self-defensive means which would guarantee the cause and, therefore, it will never tolerate any unjust pressure and high-handed practices against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also additionally deployed AC-130 ground attack aircraft and FA-18 fighter-bombers in south Korea, rendering the situation of the peninsula extremely acute. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year it perpetrated several grave provocations in the West Sea of Korea and committed hundreds of aerial espionage missions with the mobilization of strategic and tactical reconnaissance planes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. ceaseless war moves bringing the inter-Korean relations back to those of tension and confrontation are a vicious challenge to the desire of all the Korean people and peace-loving people across the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
