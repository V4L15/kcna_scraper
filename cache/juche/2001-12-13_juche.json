PKO\" in Japan under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 13 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary terms the recent adoption of the \"U.N. Peace-Keeping Operation Law\" at the session of the Japanese House of Councilors a very dangerous and disturbing development.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has not yet shaken off the ill-fame of an \"enemy state.\" For the Japanese Self-Defence Forces (SDF) to operate as part of the \"U.N. Peace-Keeping Forces\" cannot but be an insult to peace and mockery of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The law allows the SDF to carry out military operation against any war- and conflict-torn part of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the adoption of the law Japan seeks to attain two goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One is to lay a legal groundwork for militarily guaranteeing Japan's realization of its ambition to become a political power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The other is to legally launch overseas aggression under the signboard of \"U.N. Peace-Keeping Forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is now being made the next target of the U.S. \"anti-terrorism war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Once an unforeseen situation is created on the Korean peninsula by the U.S., Japan will inevitably join it under the pretext of \"supporting its operation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it is foolish of Japan keen on overseas aggression to try to deceive the world with the signboard of \"peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan unleashes a war of aggression against others, it will face a hundred times severer retaliatory blows.    \r\n\r\n"
