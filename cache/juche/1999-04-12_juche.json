According to a report on the state budget for this year at the 2nd session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly, 11% more funds than last year will be channelled into agriculture this year.   In order to effect a fresh turn in agricultural production Korea plans to make a signal innovation in potato farming.   Areas under potato cultivation will be drastically enlarged in Ryanggang, north Hamgyong and Kangwon provinces, high-yielding seeds will be sown to suit soil conditions and new advanced methods and technologies of potato cultivation applied for boosting its production.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A vigorous drive will be  launched in all fields of agricultural production to bring about an innovation in seed production, do farming on the principle of right crop on right soil and right crop in the right time and  widely apply two crop farming.   An innovation will also be effected in live-stock production through sustained efforts to expand grazing areas and increase the number of head of domestic animals of various species.    The provinces, cities and counties of the country will undertake land rezoning as a massive movement, drawing on the experience of Kangwon Province, to  obtain more arable lands with the result that the appearance of rural communities will change beyond recognition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year, too, the Worker's Party of Korea and the government significantly increased state investment in agriculture as  compared with the previous year and saw to it that the whole party, army and  all the people gave helping hands to farmers.   But, a long spell of a bad weather and natural disasters hit many parts of the country, causing  a great loss in agricultural production.   The food situation  is expected to remain very difficult this year, too.   The agricultural workers and other people are now speeding up sowing with redoubled efforts, taking food substitute, deeply aware that the key to building a powerful nation is to  reap a good harvest and solve  the food problem. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
