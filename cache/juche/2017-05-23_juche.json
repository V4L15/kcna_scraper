But it is absolutely ridiculous to see them finding fault with the DPRK's every measure for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK substantially displayed the capabilities for mounting a nuclear attack at Hawaii housing the U.S. pacific forces command and the Pacific operational theatre including Alaska, and has built full capabilities for attacking the U.S. mainland, the stronghold of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and its followers' despicable act of taking issue with the DPRK's measures for bolstering nuclear force will only result in increasing our hostility to them and furthering the efforts to diversify and modernize our own nuclear force."

            "content": "Portavoz del MINREX rechaza totalmente nuevo comunicado del Consejo de Seguridad\r\nPyongyang, 23 de mayo (ACNC) -- En exclusiva con la Agencia Central de Noticias de Corea concedida en relacion con que Estados Unidos y sus satelites cuestionan el lanzamiento de prueba del cohete balistico estrategico Pukguksong-2, el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea dio el dia 23 la siguiente respuesta:\n\t\t\t\t\tEn medio de que se reportan de manera multiple y sucesiva los eventos anunciadores del incremento de las fuerzas armadas nucleares del pais, los funcionarios de la rama de ciencias y tecnicas de defensa nacional y los obreros de la industria belica ejecutaron otra vez con exito el lanzamiento de prueba del cohete balistico estrategico tierra-tierra de mediano y largo alcance Pukguksong-2. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya trascendidos, el objetivo del reciente disparo estuvo en confirmar finalmente las especificaciones tecnicas del sistema de armamento Pukguksong-2 en su conjunto y examinar con suficiencia la posibilidad de su aplicacion en diferentes circunstancias de batalla, de modo que se pudiera emplazarlo en las unidades militares para el combate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto forma parte del proceso normal para consolidar el poderio de autodefensa nacional, siendo etapa previa al despliegue para el combate. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, al cabo de cuestionar nuevamente a la RPDC, EE.UU. y las fuerzas seguidoras volvieron a publicar el llamado comunicado del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU usando expresiones aburridas como la \"sancion\" y \"condena\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRechazamos totalmente el presente comunicado que consuena con los actos hostiles anti-RPDC de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs imposible que se escuchen palabras razonables en boca de EE.UU y sus satelites que tienen el veto cronico a la RPDC y estan colmados de la hostilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNos mueve a risa cada vez que les vemos acusando nuestras medidas de autodefensa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos manifestado sustancialmente nuestra capacidad de ataque nuclear sobre toda la zona operacional de EE.UU. en el Pacifico, inclusive Hawai donde se halla la comandancia de fuerzas norteamericanas del Pacifico y Alaska, y estamos en la disposicion de destruir el propio territorio norteamericano, bastion de agresores. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que esas fuerzas hostiles cuestionen nuestras medidas para el aumento de fuerzas armadas nucleares, se multiplicara el odio que nos hara acelerar la diversificacion y el desarrollo en alto nivel de esas fuerzas."
