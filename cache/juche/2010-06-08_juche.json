It took the lead in trumpeting about \"international cooperation\" and \"joint action,\" echoing the U.S. call for escalating the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t When the U.S. got more vociferous crying out for tightening the sanctions against the DPRK over the conspiratorial case, Japan blustered that it would \"slap more stringent sanctions\" against the DPRK and has further intensified the suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), a dignified overseas compatriots organization of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has gone the lengths of adopting a new \"law on the special measure for cargo inspection\" targeted against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This indicates that Japan's rash action to do harm to the DPRK by zealously partaking of its master's sanctions against the DPRK has reached an extreme phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind the above-mentioned behavior of Japan is its unlimited militarist ambition to realize its scenario for reinvasion come what may. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks to fish in troubled waters through the case of the warship' sinking as it is expanding the sphere of overseas aggression bit by bit, kowtowing to the U.S. master. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the above-said case broke out, Japan lost no time to adopt the said law which had been controversial since last year.
