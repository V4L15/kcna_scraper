            "content": "ACNC comenta acto verbal imprudente de reaccionarios japoneses\r\nPyongyang, 16 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Japon se atreve a hablar hasta del \"ataque\" a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, un funcionario del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de ese pais expuso abiertamente el intento de agredir a la RPDC, al decir que Japon puede hacerlo si se presenta la peticion de los titeres surcoreanos o una grave amenaza para la estabilidad del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs un discurso belicoso de los politicos enanos que actuan como cachorro recien nacido que no conoce lo temible que es el tigre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn los ultimos anos, Japon da acicate a la conversion en potencia militar desafiando a su estado legal de pais derrotado en la guerra que no tiene derecho a la beligerancia y a la participacion en guerra ni a la posesion de fuerzas armadas regulares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMediante la enmienda de la \"guia de cooperacion de defensa Japon-EE.UU.\" y la aprobacion de la \"ley de seguridad\", amplio a todo el mundo el teatro operacional de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", limitado antes al contorno del archipielago japones, y puede ejercer hasta el \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" bajo el pretexto de asistencia militar a los \"aliados\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPlanea fijar en 5 billones 100 mil millones de Ôø•el presupuesto de defensa nacional para el ano fiscal 2017, cifra mas alta de la historia, y desarrolla y compra muchos armamentos sofisticados. Ademas, impulsa los proyectos para modernizar las fuerzas aereas y navales y darles largo alcance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn consonancia con la \"guerra antiterrorista\" de EE.UU., se trazo la estrategia militar para el ataque a ultramar y entro en etapa crucial el avance a ultramar de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn tales circunstancias, se ha escuchado en boca no de un funcionario de Defensa sino del MINREX la palabra tan atrevida como \"ataque a Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nueva agresion de Japon a Asia es una cuestion de tiempo y su primer blanco es la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl igual que el siglo pasado, Japon trata de agredir a Corea y avanzar al continente tomandola como cabeza de puente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon sus acciones imprudentes, los reaccionarios japoneses conducen al pais a la autodestruccion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, se ha cambiado la posicion estrategica de la RPDC que emergio como digna potencia ideo-politica y la militar de talla mundial que cuenta con poderoso disuasivo nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs natural que la abrumadora mayoria de los japoneses rechace el ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa\" que causara desastres incomparables con los sufridos en el siglo pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades japonesas deberan actuar con prudencia."
