Japan, on its part, has faithfully served its American master with the calculation that its sycophancy toward its master would not only bring greater \"benefits\" to itself but help consolidate its \"position\" in the international arena. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One may judge that the U.S. is treated by Japan as its master while treating the latter as its servant because the former is not only a \"victor in the war\" but it has the status of being a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The U.S. does not allow the above-said authority exercised in handling international issues to be weakened even a bit nor does it intend to make any concession to others over that matter. The U.S. is only interested in keeping Japan as its faithful servant and getting it so ready that the former may effectively use the latter any time. And the U.S. does not allow Japan to have a position higher than what the former has in mind. There is not a significant change in the attitude of the U.S. even today. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is always keen to keep Japan under its watch and control as it does not want to see the latter behave so freely and pleased as to incur its displeasure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the true intention of the U.S. to treat Japan, pretending to support the latter before it, while seeking an ax to grind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, the U.S. and Japan are in the relationship in which each is keen to seek its own interests and aims, the former trying to fool the latter and vice versa.
