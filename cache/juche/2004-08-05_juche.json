Korean \"Ministry of Unification\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 4 (KCNA) -- The \"Ministry of Unification\" of south Korea posted on its Internet homepage a sheer lie. It claimed that nuclear scientist of the north Kim Kwang Bin, after turning his coat and running away from the north, testified to the fact  that the north developed nukes by use of highly enriched uranium in top secrecy and hid in other places researchers of the existing institute no. 19, nuclear fuel rods and other major facilities while freezing the facilities in Nyongbyon in 1994.\r\n Kim Kwang Bin whom the ministry painted as the man who sought asylum in a third country is a researcher of merit active at a maritime radioactive research institution of the DPRK. This being a hard fact, the ministry talked such sheer nonsense that Kim, director of institute no. 38, defected from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We make it clear that there are no such things as institutes nos. 38 and 19. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean right-wing conservatives have more than once spread such misinformation. Last year they let a rumor afloat that scores of scientists of the north who were doing normal work in their field exiled themselves to other countries and included in those exiles even those who died long ago only to draw public criticism and ridicule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, they are taking much pain to spread such misinformation. This campaign  is aimed at making the much publicized \"enriched uranium program\" sound plausible though it is a fiction in a bid to escalate international pressure on the north to drop its nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose and invent a pretext to attack it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the dishonest forces of south Korea are conducting such smear campaign under the manipulation of the United States in accordance with its scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is widely known that persistently peddling the fiction of \"enriched uranium program\" in a bid to charge the DPRK with the nuclear development, the United States circulated a false rumor about the \"transfer of nuclear technology\" by a Pakistani scientist and orchestrated even a deceptive drama called \"smuggling of uranium hexafluoride\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is intolerable that the U.S. is persisting in such a ridiculous smear campaign, far from drawing a proper lesson from having created a complicated situation by dreaming up the fiction of \"enriched uranium program\" and sparking a new nuclear crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the U.S. and other bellicose elements remain unchanged in their moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and their talk about \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\" and \"landmark proposal\" is no more than a deceptive ruse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking into consideration the fact that the U.S. set afloat a rumor about Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction before unleashing the Iraqi war, the DPRK is left with no option but to heighten vigilance against their anti-DPRK moves and take strong countermeasures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
