            "content": "KPA Panmunjom mission issues memorandum\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- The Panmunjom mission of the Korean People's Army issued a long memorandum today on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the signing of the Korean Armistice Agreement (AA). Citing facts, the memorandum indicts the United States for violating all key articles of the AA which stipulates the prevention of the outbreak of another war in Korea and a peaceful solution to the Korean issue and exposing the Korean Peninsula to a nuclear threat and a constant danger of war.\r\n Paragraph 60 of the AA stipulates that \"in order to insure the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, the military commanders of both sides hereby recommend to the governments of the countries concerned on both sides that, within three months after the armistice agreement is signed and becomes effective, a political conference of a higher level of both sides be held by representatives appointed respectively to settle through negotiation the questions of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea, the peaceful settlement of the Korean question, etc.\" But the U.S. left no means untried to prevent the political conference from being held, the memorandum says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. concluded the \"mutual defense pact\" with South Korea on August 8, 1953 in a bid to legalize the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea, openly challenging paragraph 60 of the AA which envisages withdrawing all foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In only nine months after the ceasefire the U.S. illegally introduced 177 combat planes, 465 artillery pieces of various calibers, 6,400 rockets, 1,365 machine guns and millions of various artillery shells and bullets into South Korea in violation of sub-paragraph 13 d of the AA which stipulates that \"the commanders of the opposing sides shall cease the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons, and ammunitions.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When this was detected by the neutral nations inspection teams the U.S. let guard, senior member of the U.S. forces side, declare at the 70th meeting of the military armistice commission held on May 31, 1956 that the allied forces were notifying the stoppage of the implementation of the part related to them in the AA article which stipulates duties to be performed by the neutral nations supervisory commission and the neutral nations inspection teams in areas under the control of the allied forces side. Later, it deported all members of the inspection teams who were active at five ports of south Korea at the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before scrapping sub-paragraph 13 d of the AA the then U.S. State Secretary Dulles, Defense Secretary Wilson, the chairman of the U.S. joint chiefs of staff and other officials in top echelon of the U.S. administration openly stated that the scrapping of the sub-paragraph was inevitable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the 75th meeting of the military armistice commission on June 21, 1957, the U.S. officially declared that it was giving up implementing sub-paragraph 13 d of the AA, letting loose the ridiculous jargon that it could not but introduce new types of weapons as it did not produce old types, so as to keep the \"relative balance of military forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the same day the U.S. Defense Department officially declared the U.S. government decision to introduce new types of weapons into South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the wake of this unilateral scrapping of the sub-paragraph the U.S. moved the \"UN command\" to Seoul from Tokyo in July 1957 and massively introduced new types of weapons into South Korea, stepping up war preparations in real earnest and in full scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government of the DPRK issued a statement on June 26, 1957 in which it proposed convening an international conference involving countries concerned in order to pull back all foreign forces from Korea, ensure a lasting peace and promote the peaceful settlement of the Korean question. On February 5, 1958 it made public another statement proposing a simultaneous withdrawal of all foreign forces including the U.S. forces and the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Out of the desire to pave the way for a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Korean-Chinese side took initiative by declaring the unilateral withdrawal of the Chinese People's Volunteers from Korea. The withdrawal was completed by October 26, 1958. Nearly 45 years have passed since then but the U.S. still keeps its forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dismantled the neutral nations inspection teams belonging to the neutral nations supervisory commission and the joint inspection team belonging to the military armistice commission, considering them to be stumbling blocks in the way of its preparations for a new Korean War. It has since worked hard for a long time to disorganize the commissions, the only remaining bodies for supervising the implementation of the armistice agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 25, 1991 the U.S. appointed a general of the South Korean army who had neither qualification nor mandate to handle the AA-related issues the senior member of the U.S. side to the Military Armistice Commission. This was an open mockery of the commission intended to wreck it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Military Armistice Commission was put out of existence, the neutral nations supervisory commission automatically disintegrated as it lost the object to work with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now in Panmunjom there no longer exist the military armistice commission and the neutral nations supervisory commission that were to supervise the implementation of the AA. As a result, provisions of the AA related to the military armistice commission I.E. from paragraph 19 to 35 of article 2 and provisions related to the neutral nations supervisory commission id est from paragraph 36 to 50 of the article were all reduced to dead letters. The AA is now in danger of being totally scrapped due to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is planning to arm the U.S. troops in South Korea with ultra-modern military hardware to be introduced there at the cost of 11 billion U.S. dollars after working out a new \"arms buildup plan.\" It is also instigating Japan and other satellites to naval and aerial blockades against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The arms buildup and blockade moves are, needless to say, acts of scrapping the AA and war actions. notably, \"Operation Plan 5030\", a new war scenario worked out by the U.S. Defense Department, goes to clearly prove what a dangerous phase the U.S. has reached in its military moves as it was worked out in total defiance of the present AA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unilaterally recoiled from implementing the sub-paragraph 13 d of the AA long ago and has turned South Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East by introducing huge nuclear weapons into it and is now openly calling for a preemptive nuclear attack. Under this situation it is indisputably clear that a war in Korea would be a merciless one in which the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK would meet with the latter's retaliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready for any war of showdown. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Keynote report at international conference\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the central committee of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, made a keynote report at the plenary meeting of the International Conference for Peace on the Korean Peninsula held here today.\r\n Recalling the fact that the Korean Peninsula had been an object of big powers' continuous scrambles in history as it is situated in a strategically important region, the reporter said that the U.S. mobilized in the Korean War more than 2 million-strong armed forces including the three services and mercenary soldiers from 15 countries and weapons of mass destruction banned by international law in a bid to realize its strategy to dominate the world after the Second World War, but suffered a bitter defeat in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed, it has been systematically violated and destroyed due to the U.S. policy of undisguised military threat and blackmail against the DPRK, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, in fact, thanks to the self-reliant national defence power of the DPRK that war has been deterred and peace guaranteed in the Korean Peninsula for over half a century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The sharp political and military confrontation is reaching its height in the Korean Peninsula. the U.S., ignoring the legal status of the DPRK which fairly withdrew from the NPT, is seeking to bring the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue before international meetings and the UN Security Council and make �gviolations�h of international law a pretext to justify its moves to provoke a new Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation requires all the peace-loving countries, all nations, organizations and people to turn out in the international solidarity movement to remove the danger of war from the Korean Peninsula in support of the just struggle of the Korean people for sovereignty and right to existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter raised the following matters: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n First of all, the U.S. criminal plot which has brought about the nuclear crisis in the Korean Peninsula again should be exposed to the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Next, it is necessary to wage an international movement to support the armed forces of justice for defending peace, while upholding the slogan of peace to ensure it in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I hold that it is necessary to inform the world that his excellency Kim Jong Il's Songun Policy, justness of which has been already proved in practice, is a powerful political mode to check the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices, which are apprehended by the international community, and help the small countries defend their dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Next, various forms of struggle should be waged to denounce the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and the crimes it committed during the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. really wants the peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula and the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations, it should apologize for all the crimes in Korea, punish those responsible, compensate to the victim side and take concrete measures for preventing the recurrence of the crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to correct the distorted history and defend justice, truth and human conscience, I propose to establish an international court in the framework of the current meeting which will historically and fully lay bare the atrocities the U.S. committed during the Korean War and its hostile policy toward the DPRK and call it to account. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last, I propose to conduct the movement for supporting the just cause of the Korean people in close combination with the struggle to restore the fair order of international relations and justice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the present situation prevailing in this region that all the actions against the DPRK are fraught with the danger of bringing about a clash in the Korean Peninsula and any clash may turn into a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should pay its attention to the fact that the U.S. is bringing charges of �gviolation of international law�h and �gobject of international concern�h against those countries situated in important regions to justify its war policy, while defiling the genuine value of international law and international relations. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Koreans in U.S. say no to traitor's projected U.S. visit \r\n \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Eastern Regional Federation of Koreans in the United States issued a statement on July 15 condemning traitor Hwang Jang Yop's projected U.S. trip.\r\n It said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the essential necessity of history and the undeniable demand of the times for our nation to pool its efforts and head for reconciliation, cooperation, unity, peace, reunification and prosperity. It is an immutable philosophical principle that those challenging this necessity of history and the need of the times are only fated to meet a miserable end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang Jang Yop defected to the south in a hurry when his abuse of authority, embezzlement of public fund and trips for illicit intimate relationship were brought to light. These days he had the face to appear in different places to commit more acts of treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He showed himself at a �gmeeting with family members of kidnapped Japanese�h on June 25 and a �gseminar on the issue of defectors from the north and human rights issue in North Korea�h on July 4. On every occasion he let loose a string of vituperation against the DPRK that brought him up. He went to the lengths of begging the authorities to allow him to visit the United States and Japan, so that he might work for propaganda against the north, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for June 25 it was a �ghistoric day�h for him as he left the country whose sky was clouded with gun smoke to study in a far-off foreign country during the war, the hardest period for the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He received the most profound loving care in the most difficult period of the country. Yet, he plunged himself into an abyss of the greatest infamy during its hardest days. He is the most depraved and dirtiest guy ever known. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n July 4 was the �ghistoric day�h when the three principles of national reunification--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--was declared before all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He left no stone unturned to commit such acts of treachery as toeing outsiders' line, praising the policy of war and fostering division at a time when all the fellow countrymen are joining hands with each other and renewing their firm resolution to bring earlier the reunification of the country through national cooperation. He, therefore, is an arch traitor and a chief criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen are, therefore, pointing accusing fingers at him with resentment. And the whole world ridicules him. The compatriots in the U.S. and Japan are resolved not to let him go back alive if he appears there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one would welcome his U.S. visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The federation as well as its members and fair-minded compatriots from all walks of life voice strong opposition to his trip to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-reunification forces in the south including the Grand National Party should stop at once the most ridiculous farce intended to use Hwang, the most wretched man in the world, in stemming the strong trend towards national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are closely watching how the South Korean authorities and the U.S. government will approach and handle the issue of his U.S. visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean authorities must not allow him to visit the U.S. because how to handle this issue is a touchstone showing the stand and attitude of the South Korean authorities toward the June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with slinging mud at the north, he went to the lengths of blustering that the north's regime should be toppled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe South Korean authorities will be condemned by all the fellow countrymen for behaving like an ostrich with its head on the sand if they allow him to visit the U.S. considering the issue as a technical issue related to an individual's tour raised at the lowest administrative unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. government, too, should not permit his America visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of his visit is just like a question mark against the U.S. willingness to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. government equates the issue of his visit with an issue related to the safety of a traveller and invites him to visit the U.S. to use him for a propaganda favorable for carrying out its hostile policy toward the north, a burlesque for moves for a war against the north, it will touch off resentment of the north and bitterer anti-American sentiment of all the Koreans in the north, the south and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our hope that the U.S. government will not commit such a mistake as inviting Hwang to the U.S. to bedevil the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those good-for-nothing guys are no better than a mass of excrement afloat on the rapidly flowing river. However hard they wag their tongues, national cooperation will be grow stronger day by day, the country will be reunified without fail and the Korean nation will prosper forever. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Pyongyang international conference opens \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- The International Conference for Peace on the Korean Peninsula was opened here Wednesday with splendour amid the great expectation and concern of the peace-loving progressives of the world on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Korean people's victory in the Great Fatherland Liberation War.\r\n It is a grand international gathering convened in response to an appeal released at a joint meeting of international democratic organizations and Asian regional organizations for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people in Colombo, Sri Lanka, in February. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the dangerous situation prevailing on the Korean Peninsula where a war may break out any moment owing to the moves of the U.S. imperialists to provoke a war to stifle the DPRK by force the conference will discuss issues arising in eradicating the root cause of this danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were president of the International Association of Democratic Lawyers Jitendra Sharma, secretary general of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Nouri Abdel Razzak Hussein, president of the World Federation of Democratic Youth Miguel Madeira, president of the Women's International Democratic Federation Marcia de Campos Pereira, honorary chairman of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea Paulette Pierson, and other delegations and delegates, foreign diplomats and correspondents here. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also present there were Yang Hyong Sop, vice-president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly, Mun Jae Chol, acting chairman of the Korean Committee for Cultural Relations with Foreign Countries who is chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, a delegation of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, a delegation of the Korean Democratic Lawyers Association, a delegation of the Korean National Peace Committee, a delegation of the Korean Afro-Asia Solidarity Committee and other officials concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the conference Jitendra Sharma made an opening speech. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the belief that the conference would contribute to building up international public opinion demanding the defusing of the tensions and the guarantee of peace on the Korean Peninsula and give strong support and encouragement to the Korean people in their heroic struggle to meet the blatant challenge and pressure of the outside forces and champion peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop in his congratulatory speech wished the conference success, expressing the belief that the conference would provide an important occasion of building up international public opinion denouncing the U.S. for imposing unspeakable pain and misfortune upon the Korean nation and demanding peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A plenary meeting for peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula was held. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rashed Khan Menon, chairman of the central committee of the Workers Party of Bangladesh, made a keynote report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mun Jae Chol, chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, in a supplementary report said it is the invariable stand of the DPRK that dialogue and pressure can not go together and the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula should be settled in a reasonable way in view of the circumstances of its emergence and the responsibility for spawning it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. infringes upon the sovereignty and security of the DPRK even a bit, the DPRK will wipe out the aggressors and provocateurs on this land to the last man and usher in a new era in which the Korean nation would always be able to live in peace free from any interference of outside forces, he warned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made by the chairman of the Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Committee of Nepal, the president of the Korean Friendship Association in Spain and the Arab Regional Representative for investigation into the Truth behind GIS' Atrocities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They accused the U.S. of perpetrating unilateral practices, interference and arbitrary practices in a bid to dominate the world in disregard of the UN charter and international law and imposing the pain of division upon the Korean nation and working hard to bring the scourge of war to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Sri Lanka-people's Korea Friendship Association, the vice-chairman of the Turkey-Korea Friendship Association, the deputy general secretary of the World Federation of Trade Unions, a member of the delegation of the U.S. Veterans' Organization for the Peace and the Representative of the International Action Centre in their speeches said that the key to the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. lies in the U.S. response to the bilateral talks with the DPRK with the will to make a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, and urged the U.S. to respond to the DPRK-U.S. talks, well aware of the nature and peculiarities of the nuclear issue and the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the People's Front of Workers, Peasants and Students of Peru, the president of the World Federation of Democratic Youth and the representative of the British Friendship Society with Korea in their speeches said that leader Kim Jong Il's Songun Policy serves as a practical factor of guaranteeing peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vice-chairman of the Russian Association for Friendship and Cultural Cooperation with the DPRK said the reality clearly shows that the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the reunification of Korea are hardly possible unless the U.S. troops quit South Korea and the U.S. gives up its wild ambition to dominate the whole of Korea, noting that the U.S. chiefly responsible for the division of Korea should not hamstring the implementation of the joint declaration any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the opening, the participants looked round the photos showing the history of aggression committed by the U.S. imperialists against the Korean people and saw a Korean documentary film �gAnswer of Korea�h at Yanggakdo International Hotel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conference continues. \r\n    \r\n"

Kim Jong Il set out the Songun Policy, the first of its kind in the world history of politics, and has trained the Korean People's Army into an invincible army, turning the DPRK into a powerful and dignified country which no aggressors dare attack, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chairman of the Peruvian-Korean Institute of Culture and Friendship, after seeing Korean films �gPanmunjom�h and �gKorea has risen from the ruins�h, said that the U.S., which was defeated in the Korean War 50 years ago, dares not provoke the Korean people today and it is beyond doubt that the Korean people would emerge victorious in the confrontation with the U.S. in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting in Austria. \r\n\r\n"

These acts of aggression are in violation of the treaty on the renunciation of war, the treaty on the definition of aggression and the UNGA resolution 3314 (xx1x) on the definition of aggression and acts of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. committed crimes against peace, war crimes and crimes against humanity on the Korean Peninsula in violation of the charters of the international military tribunal of Nuremberg and the Far East military tribunal, regulations of the Nuremberg tribunal and the principles of international law recognized at the trial and the code of laws on crimes against peace and security of mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the Hague convention respecting the laws and customs of war on land, which forbids the use of poison and poisoned weapons, and the Geneva protocol prohibiting the use in war of asphyxiating, poisonous and other gases, and of bacteriological methods of warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the provisions of different conventions and protocols, including the Geneva Conventions of August 12, 1949 on the protection of civilians in time of war and the same convention on the treatment of prisoners of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the universal declaration of human rights, the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crime of genocide, the convention on the abolition of racial discrimination in all forms, the international covenant on civil and political rights, the international covenant on economic, social and cultural rights, the convention on non-applicability of the statute of limitations to war crimes and crimes against humanity, and the convention on the prevention and punishment of the crimes of apartheid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the nuclear non-proliferation treaty, the international convention on prevention and punishment of terrorism, the agreement on the partial limitation of drug production, the Geneva Convention on the prevention of drug production and trafficking, and other conventions and un resolutions which ban the drug trafficking and use. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the internationally recognized customary laws and rules governing the use of force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. undermined the Korean Armistice Agreement, the DPRK-U.S.A. Joint Statement and the DPRK-U.S.A. Agreed Framework. The U.S. invalidated the joint declaration on denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and obstructed the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. violated the domestic laws of the DPRK, the People's Republic of China, Japan, the United States of America and other countries concerned in the course of pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment cited detailed facts to prove that the crimes were committed in violation of the above-said laws and regulations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the crimes committed by the U.S. in Korea in the past were unprecedented ones in light of their scope and brutality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seeing that the accused can never flee from their responsibility for bringing all sorts of misfortunes and pains to the Korean people after dividing Korea, the joint prosecution team urged the international joint justice team to rule that the U.S. must take all forms of responsibility indicated in international laws--political, moral, penal and material--and pass a judgment on it. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Hwang's projected U.S. visit rejected\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Western Regional Federation of Koreans in the United States issued a statement on July 18 as regards the U.S. visit of Hwang Jang Yop slated for September, the traitor who defected to South Korea six years ago. It said:\r\n Hwang, former secretary of the Workers' Party of North Korea, has been known to do writing under the protection of the intelligence service of South Korea after he fled to the south six years ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has been known recently that the Roh Moo Hyun regime is likely to permit Hwang's visit to the U.S. when he wants it in a bid to terminate the uncomfortable relations with U.S conservatives, reading their faces as they persistently insisted on realizing his visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang is known to visit the U.S. in September at the invitation of the U.S. defense forum foundation, a typical conservatives' body of the U.S., supported by U.S. defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One may think that we need not care about his activities in the south and his visit to the U.S. and Japan, considering it as a matter related to an individual's freedom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula is in such a crisis that a nuclear war may break out owing to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. if Hwang is allowed to visit the U.S. to make a testimony at congress and give anti-north lectures in different places against this backdrop, this will be little short of inciting the Second Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The united states is now making careful war preparations after working out the war plan 5030 intended to mount a military attack on north Korea next to Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is busy inventing various pretexts to attack North Korea and building up public opinion critical of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang is well aware of this. We the compatriots in the U.S. cannot sit idle and see Hwang to come to the U.S. and play into the hands of the U.S. conservative group keen to start the Second Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the June 25 war broke out, Hwang could escape it and study philosophy at Moscow University under the warm care of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greatly indebted to the country. He might not know how horrible the war was as he just read books in Moscow after escaping disasters of the Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As this wicked intellectual betrayed the benevolent country, his projected visit to the U.S. may be prompted by his desire to flee to America in quest of his comfort if an another war breaks out in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We believe that theories on change including Marxism-Leninism and the Juche idea he claimed to have studied should be acquired in the practice of specific social changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While reading his books, we found that his theories are nothing but rubbish that cannot be applied to specific social changes as they are for the sake of theories. That was why we threw them into waste baskets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We know that Kim Jong Il, Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, advised him several times not to write such nonsensical articles as they are of no help to any social change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Juche idea is a guiding idea founded at the cost of blood in the course of the National Liberation Struggle such as the anti-Japanese war and the anti-U.S. war, not a theory faked up by such dirty intellectuals as Hwang who studied at a university library of a foreign country in peace after escaping the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the members of the federation would like to state that the tongue-wagging of such dirty scum as Hwang in the south, the U.S., Japan and other countries would prove futile before the DPRK as it is putting forward the People's Army as the main force and engine for change and has attained the singlehearted unity of the headquarters of change, the party, the army and the people as socio-political organism under the Songun leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are very disappointed at the behaviour of the Roh Moo Hyun regime allowing Hwang's visit to the U.S. while reading the face of the U.S. conservative forces and the conservatives of the south and the U.S. egging him on to the U.S. visit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are opposed to his America visit and will closely follow him wherever he goes in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the danger of the war is escalating on the Korean Peninsula owing to the nuclear issue, all the members of the federation strongly call for an immediate cancellation of his U.S. visit, considering that his visit will not help settle the issue at all but complicate it. �@�@�@\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. escalated moves to increase tensions will lead to its self-destruction\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 24 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea today issued a statement to the press 50 years after the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement.\r\n The statement says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 50 years have passed since the conclusion of the Korean Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But durable peace has not yet settled on the Korean Peninsula in the 21st century, but the danger of a nuclear war is increasing on the peninsula. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. military presence in South Korea and its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last 50 years the U.S. has systematically violated and ditched the AA, rendering the situation on the peninsula strained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It deliberately led to breakdown the Geneva Conference on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue convened under the AA. And it has massively shipped into South Korea modern combat equipment including nuclear weapons in violation of the AA, ceaselessly stepping up the preparations for another Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nearly three decades since the 30th un general assembly session adopted a resolution on the pullback of all foreign troops from South Korea. but, the U.S. has since then kept its military presence in South Korea and posed constant threat to the DPRK through dangerous war gambles such as �gTeam Spirit�h and �gFoal Eagle.�h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the emergence of the Bush administration the hostile policy pursued by the U.S. to stifle the DPRK reached an extremely dangerous stage. As a consequence, a touch-and-go situation is prevailing in the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration announced an �garms buildup plan�h to equip the U.S. forces in South Korea with weapons of the latest type. It is now working hard to put �gsea and air blockade�h against the DPRK into practice and loudly talking about provocative �gOperation Plan 5030.�h &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is a blatant violation of the AA and a war action to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. seeks a sinister political purpose in working hard to bring the situation to the brink of war at any cost in defiance of the unanimous demands of the DPRK government and the international community for a peaceful negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is trying to complicate the nuclear issue that should be settled through the talks between the DPRK and the U.S. and increase South Korea's dependence on its security umbrella in a bid to put down the ubiquitous anti-Americanism in South Korea and demands for U.S. military pullback. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration is at pains to internationalise the nuclear issue that should find a fundamental solution through the direct negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. in an effort to block any improvement in the inter-Korean and DPRK-Japan relations, sell more weapons to South Korea and gain support from the U.S. military complexes and thus get favorable returns in the elections to be held next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aforesaid hostile acts of the U.S. compel the DPRK to build up a strong war deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We know well that the U.S., which is ditching one provision of the AA after another, intends to use any ultra-modern weapons on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will consider the ultra-modern weapons the new conservatives of the U.S. try to use as tactical nuclear weapons, which compels the DPRK to make as powerful weapons as them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should know well that its escalated moves to aggravate the situation on the peninsula will lead it to self-destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
