The Korean people's faith in socialism has become a scientific outlook on the world and they regard socialism as the most precious life and soul and a genuine life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key to victory in the general march of Songun revolution lies in energetically pushing forward the revolution and construction with firm faith in socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This march means a powerful mass onward movement which makes progress on the basis of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and by its force.\r\n It is the steadfast stand of the Party to build a rich and powerful country on its own, trusting its people and it is also the fixed will of the army and the people of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the original nature of a human being and a characteristic common to humankind to reject the exploitation and oppression, domination and subjugation and interference and pressure by others and strive to emerge and develop as a master of his own destiny, the times and the world.\r\n The independent world represents the world where such independence serves as a starting point of establishing all the international relations and all the members of the world community steadily consolidate and develop their relations on this basis. Each country and nation can fully exercise its sovereignty in the independent world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should never allow the old world structure of the 20th century full of contradictions to remain in the 21st century, especially the unipolar world structure dominated by the U.S. imperialists to be established. Tolerance of such structures will mean retrogression in building an independent new world and, furthermore, abandonment of the efforts to do so. \r\n Close unity of peoples of all the countries advocating independence is the best way and a fundamental guarantee for building an independent, new world. It is an important way of building this world to defend and advance the socialist cause while protecting peace and security from the imperialists' moves for aggression and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
