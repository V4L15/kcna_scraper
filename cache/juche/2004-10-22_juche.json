It has steadily improved the contents of the Law on Sex Equality and the requirements for its guarantee at various phases over the last more than half a century. The DPRK government will as always take an active part in the efforts of the international community to protect and promote the women's human rights.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Terms U.S. Violator of AF \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 21 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency released a�@detailed report Wednesday, 10 years after the publication of the DPRK-U.S.�@Agreed Framework (AF).\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AF released on October 21, 1994, together with the DPRK-U.S. Joint�@Statement on June 11, 1993, the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Statement on August 12,�@1994 and the DPRK-U.S. Joint Communique on October 12, 2000 served as�@landmarks of weighty importance in seeking a negotiated peaceful solution to�@the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and improving the hostile�@relations between the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, all these agreements were reduced to dead documents after the�@emergence of the Bush administration in the U.S. in January 2001. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group formally adopted a hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 6, 2001 Bush announced what it called \"North Korea policy�@statement\" in which it unilaterally pressurized the DPRK to accept an�@earlier inspection of nuclear facilities and cut down its conventional�@weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The administration slandered the DPRK, unreasonably terming it a \"rogue�@state, human rights abuser, lawless state and sponsor of terrorism\" even�@before sitting with it at the negotiating table. It thus sparked off another�@nuclear crisis and drove the bilateral relations to catastrophe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As if it were not enough with defiling the political system in the DPRK,�@Bush in his \"state of the union address\" made at Congress on January 30,�@2002 blustered that the DPRK is part of an \"axis of evil.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most serious of the crimes committed by the Bush administration is that�@it has totally reneged on its commitments under the AF and completely�@scrapped it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It had kept delaying the light water reactor project. The groundwork�@started as late as in August 2002. Nothing has been done in the project so�@far except the groundwork although it has already been beyond the deadline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. committed itself to provide 500,000 tons of heavy fuel oil to the�@DPRK a year, i.e. over 40,000 tons a month. However, it has never remained�@true to this promise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon Assistant Secretary of State Kelly's return home from his visit to�@Pyongyang early in October 2002 the U.S. told the sheer lie that the DPRK�@admitted its weapons program based on \"uranium enrichment.\"�@ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration decided to stop the supply of heavy fuel oil on�@November 14, 2002 and formally suspended its delivery through KEDO from�@December of the same year under this pretext. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the�@U.S. is for both sides to seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the issue�@from an equal stand of respecting and trusting each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was agreed at the third round of the six-party talks to hold the fourth�@round of the talks in September. But its prospect remains gloomy.�@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration deliberately laid a stumbling block in the way of�@settling the nuclear issue and pushed the talks to a stalemate as it had no�@willingness to seek a negotiated peaceful settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side reiterated the proposal for \"reward for freeze\" on the�@principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" at the third round of�@the six-party talks just as it did at the previous two rounds of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the U.S. persistently shunned the proposal and clarified its�@political stand that there can never be any reward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the six-party talks the U.S. only repeated its assertion that the DPRK�@must scrap its nuclear program first without showing any willingness to make�@a switchover in its DPRK policy. Moreover, it is now insisting that it can�@discuss other issues only when the DPRK accepts the CVID, a demand which can�@be made to a defeated nation only.\r\n It has shut its eyes to the nuclear-related secret experiments made by�@south Korea, applying double-standards though it has persistently raised a�@hue and cry over the DPRK's non-existent \"issue of uranium enrichment.\"�@ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently it passed the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" aimed to implement�@its hostile policy toward the DPRK through Congress in a bid to realize its�@wild ambition for a \"regime change\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The AF was, in fact, an agreement on the nuclear issue and its key point�@was its official assurance that the U.S. would neither threaten nor attack�@the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Bush administration reneged on this commitment and has pushed�@forward its \"strategy of preemptive nuclear attack\" at the phase of its�@implementation, escalating the nuclear threat against the DPRK and massively�@bolstering its forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush has already declassified a secret document worked out in September�@2002 that approved the use of nukes under the pretext of countering the�@attack of biological and chemical weapons from someone.�@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In January 2002 he announced \"a report on nuclear weapons posture\" in which�@it clarified that the U.S. would use nuclear weapons in Korea. Similar�@documents were made public in succession in the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his south Korean junket on November 17, 2003 U.S. Defence Secretary�@Rumsfeld threatened that the U.S. would mobilize even the nuclear force when�@necessary, thus making the nuclear attack an established fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the U.S. disclosed its \"operation plan 5030\", a new nuclear war�@scenario to attack the DPRK, and \"new operation plan 5026\" this February and�@\"operation plan 5027-04\" recently.�@ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In May last year the U.S. announced an \"arms buildup plan\" which called for�@spending 11 billion U.S. dollars in a few years to come. It is massively�@introducing into south Korea ultra-modern war means worth 13 billion U.S.�@dollars under the pretext of \"filling up vacuum in combat power\" allegedly�@caused by \"cutdown\" and \"relocation\" of forces.�@&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This February it deployed 24 B-52 and B-1 long-distance fighter bombers in�@Guam and scores of nuclear-powered submarines in waters off the Asia-Pacific�@region under the simulated conditions of an \"emergency\" on the Korean�@Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently its Defence Department decided to deploy 15 Aegis destroyers�@equipped with ultra-modern interceptor missile systems in the East Sea of�@Korea and its surrounding waters by 2006 under the pretext of coping with a�@\"missile threat\" from the DPRK. As its first phase the U.S. deployed Aegis�@destroyers belonging to the U.S. 7th fleet in the East Sea of Korea and they�@have already started performing their operation duties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also contemplating sending ultra-modern nuclear carrier flotilla John�@Stenis to waters off the peninsula. Carrier Kitty Hawk-led strike force has�@already been deployed in the Pacific. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has staged various large military exercises in the sky and sea and�@on land of south Korea including the Ulji-Focus Lens joint military exercise�@under the simulated conditions of a real war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality today irrefutably proves what a clear-sighted option the DPRK�@has taken to steadily increase all means for self-defence including the�@nuclear deterrent force to cope with the U.S. ever-increased moves to harass�@peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The use of force is not a U.S. monopoly. It is an unshakable determination�@and faith of the DPRK to counter confrontation with confrontation and�@counter a preemptive strike with a preemptive strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will bolster its war deterrent force both in quality and quantity�@to be strong enough to defeat any aggressor at a single stroke, given that�@the U.S. is foolishly attempting to contain the DPRK by force, while seeking�@a \"regime change.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the firm stand of the DPRK to steadily increase all political and�@military means in order to foil the U.S. evermore undisguised hostile policy�@toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By scrapping the AF the Bush administration glaringly revealed its true�@colours as a harasser of peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and�@Asia-Pacific. The administration will have to pay for its criminal acts. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To carry the strategy into practice, they are hastening the relocation of their forces overseas, putting stress on Northeast Asia including the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have completed an operational and command system to provoke a nuclear war in the area centering on the Korean Peninsula, but they are not contended with this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Crying that there are \"shortcomings\" in their existing nuclear war command system, the U.S. imperialist warhawks are working  to establish a new command system adapted to their strategy of world supremacy, strategy of preemptive strike and strategy of \"anti-terrorism war\" in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhat they seek is to separate the command systems in south Korea and Japan from the direct control of the command system of the U.S. Strategic Command and integrate them into an independent command system and, thus, establish a unified nuclear war command system which would make it possible to reduce the time to the maximum and stage blitz warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist war-like forces consider that Japan is more favorable than south Korea for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. In recent years, the U.S. forces have evaded as far as possible a war at short range and resorted to the tactics of forestalling strike by warplanes and missiles from a long distance. And they regard Japan as the area best suited to this tactics. For this very purpose, they intend to move the First Corps Command of the U.S. Army from their mainland to Japan and integrate the Command of the U.S. Forces in south Korea with the Command of the U.S. Forces in Japan whereby to set up an independent nuclear war commanding tower in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' immediate target is to finally examine and round off the operational command system for starting a nuclear war in the area centering on the Korean Peninsula and expanding it into a global thermonuclear war. This is why they are speeding up the relocation of their forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relocation of the U.S. forces for the execution of the nuclear war strategy of the Bush administration is being brought to a conclusion with the amassing of ridiculously vast nuclear war forces in and around the Korean Peninsula and the completion of the nuclear war command system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
