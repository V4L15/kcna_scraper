It is its ulterior motive to escalate its policy of pressure upon the DPRK under the pretext of the \"abduction issue\" and scuttle the above-said talks in case everything goes against its will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more cynical is that its bad behavior has reached a shameless phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is making no scruple of letting loose a spate of rubbish that \"it is disappointed at the fact that no progress has been made\" in the course of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula though more than one year has passed since the February 13 agreement was adopted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unlike other countries, Japan has no moral right to utter anything about the above-said matter because it has done all sorts of wrongs just to disturb the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its behavior of finding fault with this or that only reminds one of the scandalous action of the mentally deranged fellow.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Any provocative war exercises to be staged against the other side under this situation would only stoke its distrust and confrontation and they may easily develop into an all-out war. This is more likely as the U.S. conservative hard-liners, having bitterness towards the DPRK, are watching for a chance to torpedo the process of dialogue and ignite a war of aggression against it.  Herein lies the danger of the projected saber rattling. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality clearly proves that the United States and its lackeys the south Korean warmongers have always been chiefly to blame for blocking the Koreans' cause of independent reunification and bringing the danger of war, concludes the article.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
