He kindly asked them how old they were and if they had any trouble.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The children, touched by the parental love and affection which they had longed for even in dreams, sang before him the song \"Thank You, Marshal Kim Jong Un\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that they have nothing to desire more in the world as he provided them with nice dresses in every season and sent them even confectionery, fishes, fruits and honey and they eagerly waited for him, they loudly called him \"father!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round different places of the orphanage, he acquainted himself in detail with the conditions for upbringing and education and living environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his visit was the baby home.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the baby room he, seeing with a smile on his face the sleeping babies, asked when they were born. Watching children playing in the playing room, he let them speak and happily smiled at them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When seeing triplets, he let them sit on his knees. He recalled that President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il were very pleased whenever they were told about the birth of triplets, saying it was a good sign of prosperity of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the kitchen, he learned about what was served to the children.

Such remarks could be heard from the Japanese foreign minister on the same day.\n\t\t\t\t\t Those reckless remarks made by the Japanese ultra-rightist forces led by Abe remind everyone of a thief crying \"Stop thief!\" as they are intended for reversing the tide of daily-increasing international denunciation against Japan and thus creating a favorable atmosphere for their moves of militarizing Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their rash acts evoking much criticism in Asia have something in common with the war hysteria whipped up by Hitler in Germany after its defeat in the First World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known, the First World War ended with the collapse of militarism in Germany, but fascist maniac Hitler's assumption to power plunged many nations of the world into the bloodbath of another world war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by the wild ambition for reoccupying former colonies and, furthermore, building up a new vast empire in the world, Hitler had incited ultra-chauvinism and revanchism and restored the economy serving only for war in Germany. Over-heated in reinvasion, Hitler annexed neighboring countries one after another and, after all, unleashed the Second World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe's reckless moves are little different to those of Hitler.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now Japan is running headlong into militarism for reinvasion and Abe is taking the lead in it. Soon after taking power, he impudently sang \"Kimigayo\", symbolic of militarism, and called for restoring \"strong Japan\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his administration, Japan has made almost all the political and institutional preparations for militarization and overseas aggression with the adoption of new \"defense programme guidelines\", \"mid-term defense capability buildup outline\" and \"national security strategy\" after the organization of the \"National Security Council\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's \"Self-Defence Forces\" have already turned into a completely offensive one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Revision of \"Pacifist Constitution\", which bans Japan from going to war, enters the final stage. In the teeth of the international concern about Japan, which has turned into a war state, Abe visited the Yasukuni Shrine that enshrines war criminals, including Tozyo who branded as \"Hitler in Asia\", a revelation of his wild ambition to provoke the second \"greater east Asia war\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His ambition for reinvasion has driven the equilibrium of confrontation and friction to an extreme phase in the Asian region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past Hitler called for a fight against communism to justify the war, but at present Abe is trumpeting the theory of confrontation with the DPRK to rationalize the militarization of Japan for reinvasion. There is no difference between them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Though Japan is clinging to every possible cunning plot to justify and bring back its crime-woven past, it can never work on the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe, plagued with militarism, had better bring himself to his senses. A key to improved DPRK-Japan relations lies in Japan's sincere liquidation of its past crimes."

            "content": "ACNC comenta discurso sobre politica  gubernamental de Abe\r\nPyongyang, 4 de febrero (ACNC) -- En el reciente discurso sobre la politica gubernamental, el premier Abe volvio a hablar del \"dialogo y presion\" en cuanto a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea pretextando la \"solucion integral del problema de secuestro, armas nucleares y misiles\". El mismo dia, el canciller japones tambien lo imito. \n\t\t\t\t\tTales disparates de las fuerzas ultraderechistas encabezadas por Abe devienen una artimana astuta para apaciguar el creciente clima de criticas anti-Japon de la sociedad internacional y preparar un ambiente favorable a la militarizacion del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY hacen recordar a Hitler que despues de la primera guerra mundial infundia el fervor de guerra en Alemania derrotada con la ambicion de nueva agresion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo esta conocido por todos, la primera guerra mundial desatada en Europa hace un siglo llevo el fracaso al militarismo aleman, pero, la aparicion del maniaco fascista Hitler  trajo los desastres de otra guerra mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la ambicion de rescatar las colonias y fundar un nuevo imperio colonial en el mundo mas vasto, Hitler repuso en funcionamiento la economia de guerra insistiendo en el  extremo chovinismo nacional y el revanchismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInflado por el fervor de nueva agresion, anexo a fuerza uno tras otro a los paises vecinos y por fin, provoco la segunda guerra mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque son diferentes el tiempo y la nacion, el mundo ve ahora el resurgimiento de esa historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, Abe esta al frente de Japon que se dirige a la reagresion militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInmediatamente despues de su mandato, Abe abogo por rescatar \"Japon poderoso\" cantando abiertamente la cancion \"Kimigayo\", simbolo del militarismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mandato de Abe, Japon instituyo  el consejo de seguridad nacional y perfecciono todos los preparativos politicos e institucionales para la militarizacion y la nueva agresion. A citar ejemplos, aprobo el nuevo programa de defensa, el plan de arreglo de fuerzas defensivas de tiempo intermedio y la estrategia de seguridad nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\" ya se han convertido completamente en las fuerzas armadas de caracter ofensivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa enmienda de la \"constitucion de paz\" que prohibe la guerra espera la aprobacion final. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPese a la preocupacion de la sociedad internacional por Japon convertido en el Estado de guerra, Abe visito otra vez el santuario Yasukuni donde estan conservados los restos mortales de Tojo, reconocido como \"Hitler de Asia\", y otros criminales de guerra, demostrando asi la ambicion de provocar la segunda \"guerra de gran Asia Oriental\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ambicion de nueva agresion de Abe ya llevan al limite la estructura de enfrentamiento y antagonismo del continente asiatico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon iguales la locura del fascista Hitler, que abogaba por el combate anticomunista para justificar la guerra, y el proceder de Abe que insiste en el enfrentamiento con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea para justificar la nueva agresion militarista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, la artimana astuta de Japon de justificar y rehabilitar su pasado ensangrentado no puede ganar ningun apoyo ni consentimiento de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas importante para la mejora de las relaciones Corea-Japon es la liquidacion del pasado del pais isla."
