            "content": "Meeting of Frontrunners of Songun Revolution Opens \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- A meeting of frontrunners of the Songun revolution was opened at the April 25 House of Culture in Pyongyang Monday.\r\n Present there were senior party, army and state officials, Cabinet members, officials of the party, armed forces and power organs, working people's organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons and frontrunners in the fields of economy, science, education, literature and art, sports, public health and media. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea to the participants in the meeting was read out there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The message said that the DPRK's access to nuclear deterrent was an epoch-making event in the history of the Korean nation as it provided a sure guarantee for putting an end to outsiders' aggression and interference and bringing eternal prosperity to the country. It was also the most shining victory won in the tempest of the Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last two years our army and people have made successes greater than what was done in the past several years in the economic construction and thus put the national economy as a whole on an orbit of steady upswing, the message noted, and said: The Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the WPK highly praise all the officers and men of the Korean People's Army and the people for having worked hard to strikingly display the might of Songun Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Thae Bok, alternate member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, delivered a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter said that the Korean revolution, which was pioneered and emerged victorious with the help of arms under the banner of the Juche idea, has greeted the golden days of its development under the Songun politics of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the most admirable success made in the general march for the Songun revolution, he said, is that the biggest efforts were channeled into increasing the nation's military capabilities for self-defence, thus making it possible for the DPRK to demonstrate its might as a socialist military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the successful nuclear test the DPRK conducted with its own efforts and technology on the threshold of the significant anniversary of the WPK last year, he said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This helped the DPRK secure a reliable military guarantee for its prosperity and, as a full-fledged nuclear weapons state, greatly contribute to defending global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the DPRK has the invincible revolutionary army and powerful war deterrent. So we can declare confidently with high pride that we carried out all what should be done to defend ourselves and Songun Korea has become secure for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has taken the steadfast position of a power in political and ideological and military aspects. At last, an emotion-charged era of struggle has set in when our army and people should push ahead with the building of a socialist economic power after definitely rounding off the \"Arduous March\" and the forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the time for them to unite as one in mind under the banner of Songun, bring into full play the inexhaustible potentials they have built up in the do-or-die spirit and effect a great surge on all fronts of building a great prosperous and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us make a general advance toward the peak of a great prosperous powerful nation, full of confidence and pride of being the victors of the Songun revolution!\" This is the militant slogan that we should hold high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  All the servicepersons and people should speed up the general march for the Songun revolution this year marking significant revolutionary holidays and thus eternally glorify the immortal revolutionary history and feats of President Kim Il Sung and fully display the invincibility of the Songun revolution advancing under the leadership of Kim Jong Il and the spirit of the powerful and prosperous country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should value the single-minded unity, the greatest gain of the Korean revolution, and cement the unity of the entire party and army and all the people based on the revolutionary comradeship around the leader whenever the situation turns out to be tense and difficult tasks may face them in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also imperative for us to more thoroughly arm ourselves with the great Juche idea, the Songun idea, firmly preserve its purity and steadily push forward the revolution and construction along the road of Songun guided by the Juche idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlining the need to keep directing big efforts into increasing the nation's military capabilities for self-defence with the KPA as a core, taking the Juche-based Songun idea and line as immutable guidelines of our Party and revolution, the reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should continue to give top priority to the development of the national defence industry, a material basis of the military capacity, with the transparent viewpoint that one can live without drops but not without bullets. And it is necessary to let all the people learn the military affairs with sincerity and turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress by making the spirit of attaching importance to the military affairs prevail over the whole society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main task facing us at present is to shore up the economy as early as possible and radically improve the standard of people's living by concentrating all possible efforts, the reporter said, and stressed: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should demonstrate once again the spirit of the courageous army and people of the DPRK and the mettle of Songun Korea determined to find itself in the van of the world through the on-going gigantic advance for building an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speeches were made at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting continues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

One can defend oneself, have proper say and be respected only when one is strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the gun sights of the U.S. imperialists for aggression are leveled at the Korean Peninsula. The U.S., however, dare not ignite a war, only snarling with its sword unsheathed. This is because it cannot see any military possibility of realizing its ambition of dominating Korea in view of the balance of forces on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mysterious weapon of defense of peace which quelled the war hysterics of the U.S. imperialists, the warmongers, is the very Songun politics of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists dare not cross the doorstep of a Korean war, though they are thirsty for a war. The mighty war deterrent of the DPRK provided by Songun plays a decisive role in resolutely smashing the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula and defending peace of the country and the security of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
