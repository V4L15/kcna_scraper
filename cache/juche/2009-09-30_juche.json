And he highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaying that the factory has an important duty and role to play in improving the standard of people's living, he advanced tasks to be carried out by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe third leg of his guidance was the completed indoor swimming pool of Kim Il Sung University.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWatching the splendid swimming pool, he said it is an impeccable one. He highly appreciated the feats performed by the soldier-builders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen, he watched the swimming training of students.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said that the swimming pool of the university has been furnished with such high quality equipment and service facilities that it is fully available for the physical training and cultural recreation of its teachers and students and it can host international contests. We find our joy and happiness and the worth of making revolution when seeing this bright and cheerful appearance of the younger generation, the future of the country, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThen he learned about the progress made in the construction of the library of the university now under way and set forth the tasks to be fulfilled to build it on the best level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe said with pride that the nation's self-supporting economy is now making rapid progress, fully demonstrating its tremendous potential.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere has never been such bright prospect and abundant fruits in the history of building a great prosperous and powerful nation as today, he said. He earnestly called for bringing earlier the historic day when the people will beat the drum of triumph to declare the emergence of a great prosperous and powerful nation by increasing the speed of advance at this stirring time when a great victory is drawing near. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed great expectation and conviction that the city of Pyongyang would take the lead in the grand drive to build a thriving nation to play a vanguard role.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Kim Ki Nam, secretary of the Central Committee of the WPK, department directors and first vice department directors and other leading officials of the WPK Central Committee."

It is, therefore, nothing but a sinister scheme of the nuclear powers to maintain the sphere of their domination through their nuclear monopoly under the signboard of global denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK was compelled to have access to nuclear deterrent in order to protect the supreme interests of the country and the regional peace and security in face of the high-handed and arbitrary practices to violate the right to peaceful development of the Korean people who have been exposed to the U.S. nuclear threat for more than half a century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has already totally rejected the resolutions the UNSC unreasonably cooked up over its legitimate measures for self-defence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's dismantlement of nuclear weapons is unthinkable even in a dream as long as there exist the sources that compelled it to have access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMoreover, it is unimaginable to expect the DPRK return to the NPT as a non-nuclear state as it failed to play any role in preventing the U.S. forward-deployment of nuclear weapons in south Korea and its growing nuclear threat to the DPRK and has been abused for serving the purpose of the U.S. policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We totally reject UNSC Resolution 1887, too, as it is peppered with the hegemonic ambitions of nuclear powers and will not be bound to it at all. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung advanced an idea of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula and building a world free from nuclear weapons long ago. And it is the desire of the Korean people to live in a peaceful world without nuclear weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will make efforts to denuclearize the peninsula in the context of the building of a world free from nuclear weapons and the U.S nuclear policy toward the DPRK in the future, too, as in the past."

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses S. Korean Chief Executive's \"Proposal\" as Rubbish\r\nPyongyang, September 30 (KCNA) -- The south Korean chief executive spelt out \"Grand Bargain\" over the nuclear issue during his recent visit to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\tThis calls for offering things to the DPRK in return for its dismantlement of the core part of its nuclear program through the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe \"Grand Bargain\" is just a replica of the watchwords of \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" that proved bankrupt in face of criticism of the public at home and abroad. The chief executive of south Korea, in his statements made before and after the UN General Assembly session, asserted that for the north to respond to his \"offer\" is \"the last opportunity for it to maintain its system.\" This goes to prove that underlying his utterances are his watchwords \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" aimed at inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen and stifling them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula should be settled between the DPRK and the U.S. from every aspect as it is a product of the latter's hostile policy toward the former. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the U.S. that attempted to use nuclear weapons during the Korean war to eliminate the DPRK and it is again the U.S. that has waged ceaseless DPRK-targeted nuclear war exercises in the new century, too, after listing the DPRK as the target of its preemptive nuclear attack. But for the U.S. persistent hostility and nuclear threat to the DPRK, the latter would not have been compelled to have access to nukes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch being a hard fact, the south Korean chief executive is making much fuss, trumpeting about \"Grand Bargain\" while failing to say anything to the U.S. It is evident that he seeks to meddle and stand in the way of settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe might be well aware of the fact that the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is one to be dealt with between the DPRK and the U.S. But he took the trouble of peddling the above-said \"offer\" though others are skeptical about it, considering it as unrealistic. He is also to blame for his behavior but more deplorable is the \"team of advisors to the president\" which puts him to shame under the world's eyes. This makes the world view them as nothing but stupid guys who do not know where they stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean chief executive and his \"advisers' team\" had better have a midday nap under the nuclear umbrella provided by the U.S. rather than running helter-skelter, unable to sound out its master, much less knowing how the world moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are seriously mistaken if they calculate the DPRK would accept the ridiculous \"proposal\" for \"the normalization of relations\" with someone and for sort of \"economic aid\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKorean-style socialism has won steady victories despite the hostile forces' desperate sanctions and the DPRK's nuclear weapons have served as powerful deterrent for preserving peace and stability in the Korean Peninsula and other parts of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a pipedream to expect the DPRK will dismantle its nuclear program without the U.S. drop of its hostile policy toward the DPRK. The nuclear issue can find a genuine solution only when the whole Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world are denuclearized."

            "content": "ATCC critica prueba de lanzamiento de \"PAC-3\" de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 30 de septiembre (ATCC) -- Las \"fuerzas aereas de autodefensa\" de Japon realizaron la prueba de lanzamiento de misil antibalistico \"PAC-3\" en el lugar de lanzamiento de misiles de Estados Unidos\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta muy insolito este movimiento militar realizado despues de que el Ministerio de Defensa de Japon decidio emplazar de manera ampliada el misil antibalistico \"PAC-3\" en todo el pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Ministerio de Defensa de Japon determino ubicar los misiles antibalisticos \"Patriot\" en las 6 unidades antiaereas de las \"fuerzas aereas de autodefensa\" de todo el pais e instalo el misil tierra-aire \"PAC-3\" en la base aerea situada en la ciudad de Gakamigahara del departamento de Gifu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY planea emplazarlo hasta la primavera del ano proximo en la base de Tsuiki del departamento de Fukuoka y la localidad de Kyushu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa prueba arriba mencionada insinua que las maniobras de Japon por su conversion en la potencia militar se realizan de manera crucial en la etapa mas realista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn otra palabra, ella pone en relieve la agresividad y la peligrosidad de la politica de Japon para convertirse en la potencia militar y aumenta la peligrosidad del estallido de nueva guerra en el Noreste Asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras de Japon, que bajo el pretexto de la \"defensa\" emplazo de manera ampliada el \"Patriot\" en  todo el pais y realizo hasta la prueba de su lanzamiento, devienen un eslabon de las graves maniobras por la conversion del pais en la potencia militar destinada a la nueva agresion a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La teoria de \"interceptacion de misiles\" deviene la de ataque preventivo contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMediante ese lanzamiento los reaccionarios japoneses dan acicate a la perfeccion de los preparativos de nueva agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, el pais isleno insiste abiertamente en que la fabricacion, la ubicacion y la prueba de lanzamiento del misil antibalistico, que no pueden enganar la sociedad internacional, se necesitan para \"defender Japon y EE.UU. desde el posible ataque de misiles del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo su prolongacion el habla tanto de la necesidad de revisar el ejercicio del \"derecho a la autodefensa colectiva\" en direccion a \"interceptar los misiles\", y de fortalecer el \"sistema de seguridad Japon-EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto deviene la sofisteria extremadamente taimada y descarada para embellecer con el rotulo enganoso de la \"defensa para Japon y EE.UU.\" la realizacion de la militarizacion acusando a otros paises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora, pasa su limite la ambicion de Japon por la conversion del pais en la potencia militar encaminada a conceder a las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", cuya mision esta limitada a la \"defensa del territorio japones\",  la mision de ataque de la agresion a otros paises y a cambiar globalmente para eso el poderio militar como los armamentos, el sistema de mando y la capacidad de operacion conjunta con las fuerzas armadas extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy, Japon vale de todos los medios para poseer la capacidad de desarrollar las operaciones militares agresivas en cualesquier regiones del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses deben abandonar de inmediato sus peligrosas maniobras belicas que traeran  su autodestruccion."
