In pouring colossal fund and technology into the development of new-type nuclear warheads and the production of materials for nukes it seeks to beef up modern nuclear armed forces by giving fresh spurs to the development and production of new nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The director of the Nuclear Security Agency of the U.S. Department of Energy, some time ago, cried that it was necessary for the U.S. to maintain the nuclear armed forces and preserve the capability to modernize them, openly declaring that the U.S. would renounce the goals of nuclear arms reduction laid down in major international agreements signed in the past. This shows that the U.S. scheme to boost the modern nuclear armed forces remains unchanged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nobody's secret that the main purpose of the U.S. in working overtime to modernize and increase nuclear arms after declaring its strategy of preemptive nuclear attack lies in containing China and Russia by military forces and grasp military supremacy on the global scale. Foreign media note that Russia and China, on their part, are giving spurs to the modernization of the military forces including nuclear arms while increasing military expenditures for their own strategic goals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign media represent the unanimous voice of world conscience and international community when they say that world peace and security cannot be expected unless the nuclear weapon states fulfill their duties.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This reveals the U.S. criminal intention to intensify its forces' occupation and domination over south Korea and realize its anti-DPRK military strategy with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday stresses this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If south Korea is to fully exercise the prerogative of supreme command over its armed forces, it is necessary to fundamentally dismantle the military structure serving the U.S., to begin with, the paper says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In consideration of the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\", the U.S. set the stage for such farces as reorganizing the \"UN Command\" and establishing a system for integrating command in order to keep holding the control over the south Korean army. It is clear that the U.S. seeks to keep the combined operational mechanism, key in its master-servant military relationship with south Korea, under spurious signboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean military bluster that they would work out a new operational plan to replace \"OPLAN 5027\" and continue to stage \"Foal Eagle\", \"RSOI\" and other large-scale joint military exercises although an agreement was reached on the transfer of the \"right\". It is needless to say that in such case south Korea will be drawn deeper into the U.S. scheme to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. intends is to instigate the south Korean warlike forces to unleash a war against the DPRK and then shirk off its responsibility for it under the pretext of \"fratricidal war\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The transfer of the \"right\" would be meaningless as long as the U.S. imperialists continue their military occupation and rule over south Korea and escalate anti-DPRK war moves. The south Korean authorities should not be taken in by the clumsy farce but opt for taking a practical measure to get the U.S. imperialist aggression troops withdrawn from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Ridicules Abe's Loudmouthed \"Beautiful Country\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 12 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authorities like to talk about the building of a \"beautiful country.\" But they are becoming more vulgar and shameful in their behavior quite contrary to their motto. This is evidenced by the fact that the suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and phobia about Koreans in Japan have become evermore pronounced throughout Japan since Abe's assumption of premiership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe Cabinet openly chose it as a policy to crack down upon Chongryon and Koreans in Japan under the pretext of \"strictly enforcing law.\" It has steadily escalated this repressive campaign by setting in motion power machines including police and right-wing forces and media. Going beyond human imagination is the vicious and brutal nature of its crackdown upon Chongryon and Koreans in Japan as proved by Japanese public security authorities' search operations against Chongryon offices and schools and individual Koreans, increase in tax levies upon them and their arrest of Korean nationals and indiscriminate threat and violence against the above-said institutions and individuals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this background that the Tokyo Metropolitan authorities have recently made desperate efforts to prevent Koreans in Japan from holding a meeting and demonstration in protest against the above-mentioned unreasonable political suppression and human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attempt made by the Japanese authorities to block even a legal protest meeting, not content with suppressing Chongryon, only betrayed their sinister design to force the Koreans in Japan into slavery in violation of their elementary rights. This is nothing but a repetition of the gangster-like logic that Koreans should sacrifice their lives and properties for the sake of the \"Great Empire of Japan\" and a revelation of the brazen-faced intention to dominate other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National chauvinism serves as an ideological lever for aggression and domination. The Japanese reactionaries are now kicking off a whirlwind of ostracizing Koreans across Japan in a desperate bid to stifle Chongryon. This is intended to stoke uneasiness about security and national chauvinism among Japanese for the purpose of making the society veer to the Right and facilitating the militarization of the country and thereby paving the way for staging a comeback to Korea. In a word, the Japanese reactionaries' much touted building of a \"beautiful country\" is no more than a smoke-screen to conceal this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History goes to prove that the more black-hearted intention a country entertained, the more glossy words it used and the fiercer the fascist junta got, the more loudly it trumpeted about \"democracy\" and \"human rights.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The on-going frantic suppression of Chongryon by the Japanese reactionaries only testifies to the fact that they do not have even the slightest will to settle Japan's inglorious past or to be bold enough to turn over a new leaf. It, at the same time, glaringly shows what base and wicked country Japan, which claims striving to build a \"beautiful country,\" is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities would be well advised to repent of Japan's crimes and stop doing wrongs if they truly wish to build a beautiful country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
