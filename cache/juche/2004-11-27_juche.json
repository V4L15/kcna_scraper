Socialism cannot be defended without firmly relying on the army under the present situation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Ban on Internet Site Operation Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Korean Journalists Union in a statement on Thursday accused the south Korean authorities of disconnecting those Internet sites they claim to be \"pro-north\". This fully lays bare their sinister intention to totally deny the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and bring the north-south relations to those in the old era of confrontation, he noted, and went on:\r\n The south Korean authorities are now talking about the improvement of the inter-Korean relations, while defaming and denying the idea and system in the north and cutting off even the Internet connection between the north and the south in utter disregard of the spirit of the joint declaration. This is self-contradictory and nonsensical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should immediately stop their moves for confrontation with the north such as the action to disconnect Internet sites, bearing deep in mind that south Korea is the only politically underdeveloped area where Internet communications are cut off in this IT age, the only tundra of human rights in the world in this century where human freedom and rights are seriously abused. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persist in their tyrannical acts against reunification and democracy despite repeated warnings, the north will consider this as an action to bring the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse and they will be held entirely accountable for the ensuing serious consequences.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One of the key methods the U.S. imperialists employ in their operations against socialism at present is to destabilize it. It is their invariable strategy to destroy socialism. Violence as well as such destabilizing moves as psychological warfare are the key method of aggression used by them at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are keen to apply such crafty method to the DPRK. This is evinced by their desperate efforts to massively smuggle transistors, micro TV sets, etc. into the DPRK in a bid to break the unity in mind and destabilize and degenerate its society. Their great efforts are channeled into their nuclear blackmail against the DPRK. They are threatening to make a \"surprise preemptive strike\" at the DPRK's nuclear facilities. They went the lengths of announcing even the number of nuclear weapons to be used against the northern part of Korea. They seem to calculate that their nuclear blackmail will succeed in discouraging the army and people of the DPRK and depriving them of any confidence and getting them disorganized and degenerate, seized with defeatism. This clearly indicates how frantic they have become in their moves to bring down the DPRK, the bulwark of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite anachronistic for the U.S. imperialists to try to destabilize the DPRK. Its army and people will never be taken in by such their crafty destabilizing operation.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Koreans are proud of this fact still today as it is an important matter related to the legitimate history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fact that Koguryo was succeeded by Koryo also finds vivid manifestation in their names of same meaning and similar sound and in the fact that its founding father Wang Kon and not a few generals and soldiers who played pivotal roles in building the country were descendents of ruined people of Koguryo and the main territory of Koryo in the early days of its founding was the old land of Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was recognized as a self-evident truth by neighboring countries in those times and is also evidenced by the fact that Koryo was the first unified state which carried into reality the desire of Koguryo to incorporate the fellow countrymen and their states and it strove all along for its complete materialization throughout its existence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of Koryo demonstrated strong and patriotic fighting spirit and bravery just like those of Koguryo in the fight against aggressors. This also shows plainly that Koryo was the successor to Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Historical facts testify that Koguryo was a state of the Korean nation both in name and reality and Koryo was a unified state which succeeded to it, the article stresses, stating that Koryo will remain long in the history of the nation as the first unified state of Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
