Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the greatest national shame and tragedy not to be allowed to last any longer that the Korean nation has undergone sufferings resulting from the division imposed by the foreign forces upon it though the Koreans regard the national dignity and sovereignty as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Efforts to achieve national reunification represent a patriotic struggle to achieve the common development and prosperity of the nation by rejoining the severed blood ties of the nation divided into the north and the south and realizing national reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration comprehensively clarifies the principles and ways to independently settle the issue of the national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans responsible for settling the issue of the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Firmly upholding and thoroughly implementing the north-south joint declaration provides a sure guarantee for attaining national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is the main spirit and core of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the principle of national independence is observed is it possible to protect the national interests and independently achieve national reunification, a vital demand of the nation and its greatest interests, by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas dynamically forge ahead, resolutely opposing and rejecting the foreign forces' interference and domination and flunkeyism towards and dependence upon them, holding aloft the banner of national independence, can they surely accomplish the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 joint declaration serves not only as a declaration on national independence but as one on great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans stronger in patriotism than any others share the desire common to the nation, that is, the 5,000 year-old national identity and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are various differences between the north and the south. But Koreans can certainly achieve great unity if they think of national reunification, the supreme interests and demand of the nation, before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent and peaceful reunification of the country is sure to come true as the June 15 joint declaration, a milestone of independent national reunification, indicates the way for the nation to follow, the might of the great national unity is growing stronger as the days go by and the 70 million Koreans desire reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a blatant violation of the \"Pacifist Constitution\" of Japan which stipulates that Japan shall use its military force exclusively for the defense purpose only, denying any war action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming the exercise a military action prompted by Japan's aggressive ambition to have the SDF's military and technological edge for a preemptive attack and continental aggression and military supremacy in Asia from A to Z, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention in Japan's moves to bolster its military force is that it is in the process of fully reorganizing the SDF into armed forces of offensive nature equipped with long-range attack means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is regarding the DPRK as the primary target of its overseas aggression. It is the view of Japan that it can never realize its ambition for continental aggression unless it puts under its control the DPRK imposingly standing as an invulnerable socialist fortress and as a gateway to the Asian continent. Hence, it is watching for every chance to stage a comeback to Korea while further stepping up the hostile policy toward the DPRK than ever before. It is part of Japan's scenario to re-invade Korea that the Abe Cabinet is frantically tightening the sanctions against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan over the abduction issue and so on. The same can be said of the recent war maneuver staged by the SDF in Guam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond any doubt that the Japanese militarists will not hesitate to run the whole gamut of hideous crimes in order to realize their shameless ambition for overseas military expansion as they have rich war experience and huge modern aggressor forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Es una accion militar peligrosisima que se efectua por primera vez despues de la Segunda Guerra Mundial. Ademas, es una violacion abierta a la \"constitucion pacifista\" que niega la guerra y define usar las fuerzas armadas solo para la defensa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Senala asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este lunes y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es tambien una accion militar agresiva para tomar la superioridad tecnico-militar de las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" para el ataque preventivo y la agresion al continente, o sea, tomar la supremacia militar en Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo que llama atencion en el fortalecimiento de la capacidad militar del pais isleno es que las \"fuerzas de autodefensa\" se reorganizan en las fuerzas armadas ofensivas dispuestas de medios de ataque a larga distancia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon toma a la RPDC por primer blanco de la agresion a ultramar, considerando que es del todo imposible realizar su ambicion de agresion al continente sin apoderarse de ella que es una invencible fortaleza socialista en la puerta del continente asiatico. Es por eso que el pais isleno recrudece mas que nunca su politica de hostilidad a la RPDC acechando una oportunidad propicia para agredirla otra vez. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para ese fin, el gabinete de Abe arrecia sancion a la RPDC y la Chongryon (Asociacion General de Coreanos Residentes en Japon) cuestionando el problema del secuestro. Susodicho ejercicio fue perpetrado segun un guion de nueva agresion a Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es obvio que los militaristas japoneses poseedores de abundantes experiencias de guerra e inmensas fuerzas agresoras modernas pueden cometer los crimenes de toda indole para llevar a efecto su descarada ambicion de expansion militar a ultramar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
