            "content": "S. Korean media's attempt to twist essence of developments \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 25 (KCNA) -- Some media of South Korea recently expressed \"deep concern\" about the rapidly mounting anti-U.S. sentiment on the atrocities committed by U.S. occupation forces, according to Yonhap News of South Korea.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choongang Ilbo in an editorial said this anti-U.S. sentiment reached such an extent that the \"government\" should urgently tone it down, holding \"solution to the issue of the anti-U.S. sentiment should be sought in revising the status of forces agreement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Korean economic daily asserted the anti-U.S. struggle of the people should not be allowed to recur as it May \"threaten the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea,\" adding \"such actions would only support the north's demand for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a shameless assertion intended to twist the essence of developments, oblivious of the mission of the media as unbiased mouthpiece of public opinion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying the anti-u.s. Sentiment in South Korea is the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea. The problem, therefore, cannot be settled by a mere revision of the \"status of forces agreement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is evidenced by the fact that though the \"agreement\" has been revised 80 times since its signing in the 1960s, the number of cases of GIs' atrocities have further increased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Crimes committed in Rogun-ri and Maehyang-ri which have been disclosed recently are the only tip of the iceberg, in the light of tremendous mental and material losses suffered by the Korean nation under the U.S. forces' presence in South Korea that has lasted more than 50 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this period the U.S. has forced South Korea to pay nearly 100 billion dollars for the upkeep of the U.S. forces there. GIs have committed at least 270,000 cases of crimes such as robbery, rape and murder in South Korea since august 15, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Some South Korean media's misrepresentation of people's anti-U.S. sentiment despite these stark facts is an anachronistic way of thinking and an outright challenge to the DPRK which has consistently demanded the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This red herring is a direct product of the pro-U.S. flunkeyist policy, the U.S.-toeing policy of the successive South Korean rulers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The withdrawal of the U.S. forces is an urgent demand of the times and a prerequisite for national prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should not turn aside from the historic task and the South Korean media stop spreading misinformation intended to debase the people's anti-U.S. sentiment and consciousness of national independence. \r\n\r\n"
