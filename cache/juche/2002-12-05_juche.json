He showed deep loving care for its servicepersons, saying that they should be provided with the best living conditions as they are defending the country from a solitary island far away from the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He enjoyed an art performance given by servicepersons of the company. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the detachment a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts before having a photograph taken with the servicepersons of the detachment and their families.    \r\n\r\n"

It has gone so fool as to attempt to hinder the inter-Korean cooperation, saying that overland tour of Mt. Kumgang cannot take place without its approval. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. brigandish and unreasonable behaviour delayed all the projects of reconnecting the eastern and western coastal rail and road links and put the once brisk inter-Korean cooperation and exchange into rough weather. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a blatant challenge to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration that reflects the nation's will to promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests between the north and the south and high-handed interference in the internal affairs of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Plainly speaking, the U.S. is an aggressor that occupied Korea half a century ago and a stranger to the Koreans from a to z. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the U.S. has no justification to say anything on the issues arising in the inter-Korean cooperation and exchange as they are conducted by the Koreans themselves as desired by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is poking its nose into those undertakings in a bid to hamstring them. It is directing its efforts to stymying the inter-Korean cooperation while escalating the international cooperation to force the DPRK to disarm itself and yield to it under the pretext of its \"nuclear issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the U.S. that it will never succeed in international cooperation to force the DPRK to scrap its \"nuclear program\" unless the inter-Korean cooperation is hampered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, however, nothing but a pipe dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north will boost the inter-Korean cooperation to frustrate the U.S. reckless moves for international cooperation and open up a bright prospect of national reunification without fail.    \r\n\r\n"

This is an invariable stand of the DPRK and its principled stand and the mode of its counteraction will never change, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is accusing the DPRK of violating the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF). This is a mean act intended to isolate the DPRK internationally. Its talk about nuclear threat from the DPRK is a crafty maneuvers to cover up its true nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. announced its decision to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK from December which has been under way under the AF, thus unilaterally giving up its commitment to supply the heavy oil, the only point that has been implemented out of the four articles of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dishonest forces of the U.S. are talking nonsense that such measure is taken because the DPRK has violated the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their absurd assertion is aimed to create the impression that the U.S. took the measure because the DPRK breached the AF posing a threat to the U.S. though it made efforts to implement the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not be construed otherwise than a U.S.-style superpower logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aspect of its logic is that such a small country as the DPRK should not stand against the threat posed by a big country like the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's sovereignty and right to existence have been placed in greatest jeopardy due to the U.S. reckless moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. This compels the DPRK to possess military means powerful enough to cope with the threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is however, faulting this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly understand the DPRK's mode of counteraction, give up its superpower brigandish logic and promptly accept the DPRK's proposal for concluding a non-aggression treaty.    \r\n\r\n"
