He bravely fought against the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges to partition the country and ignite a war after going back to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He came to the north in September 1950 and devoted himself to the struggle for national reunification till the last moments of his life. He took the genuine patriotic road of national reunification after putting an end to his checkered career. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans in the north and the south know well about this as well as the lives of Ryo Un Hyong and Kim Ku who took the same path. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities branded Kim Kyu Sik and hundreds of others who came to the north as \"wartime abductees\" despite all these stark facts. This clearly indicates what an extreme phase they have reached in their anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nonsensical for them to claim that the DPRK abducted a lot of people and took to the north during the war though they were patriotic personages who voluntarily came here. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The action taken by them against these fair-minded personages is an intolerable insult to them and their families and the DPRK and another despicable provocation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By hyping the issue of \"wartime abductees\" as another \"human rights issue in the north\", the south Korean authorities try to escalate their anti-DPRK human rights campaign in the international arena and create complexity in the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a sinister attempt to defame the pro-reunification patriots and tarnish the image of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Abductees by the north\" and \"ROK army POWs\" touted by them so far are a product of such scenario of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are sadly mistaken if they thank they can attain their ulterior purpose through these poor charades and moves to escalate the confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They will only bring into bolder relief their true colors as diehard confrontation-minded elements and touch off rebuff and condemnation among all Koreans and all other conscientious people of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group had better face up to the trend of the times and behave itself."
