The December 5 Youth Mine, the November 28 Factory, the wharf of Taehung port and other construction projects have been completed one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Credit for all these achievements goes to General Secretary Kim Jong Il's outstanding wisdom and practical ability and indomitable will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the new year's day he has spared no pains giving on-the-spot guidance to every part of the country, saying that it is his idea and firm determination to build a powerful socialist nation in Korea at an early date so that no enemy  may encroach upon it and all the people may lead a happy life with nothing to envy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to the National Academy of Sciences on the first leg of his trips for on-the-spot guidance this year to provide a scientific and technological guarantee for the building of a powerful nation. He specified an orientation and ways to put the nation's science and technology on the world's level in the shortest possible time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then he visited the Thaechon Hydroelectric General Power Plant where he learned about how the power station was built and how the power production was going on. He gave it important tasks which would serve as a guideline in increasing the nation's power production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While visiting Taehongdan on the northern tip of the country, he indicated the way of making a signal innovation in potato cultivation, saying that potato is as good as rice and it is also important in building a powerful nation to cultivate potato well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He gave on-the-spot guidance to all major economic regions including Huichon, Manpho, Tokchon, south and north Hamgyong provinces, Kangwon Province, North Phyongan Province and so on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His tireless on-the-spot guidance greatly encouraged the  working people at all the units of the socialist economic construction to make a victorious advance, overcoming economic difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The country's economic situation still remains difficult owing to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK and several years of natural disasters. But, the Korean people are accelerating the second grand Chollima march at a canter, firmly united around the leader with the unshakable confidence that victory is in store for them. \r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses this as a mockery of and open challenge to the public at home and abroad  demanding a total abrogation of the notorious \"security law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As recognized by the world, the \"security law\" is the worst anti-national, anti-reunification fascist law in the world, the law which bars the South Korean people's righteous struggle for independence, democracy and reunification and incites north-south confrontation and a war atmosphere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities' farce of rewriting the \"security law\" is a broad hoax to cover up their true colors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As far as one of the typical poisonous articles \"charges of praise and encouragement\" is concerned, an individual's \"praise and encouragement\" is to be deleted from the application of the law but it provides for a merciless punishment of those who form or join in an \"anti-state organization\" and \"organizationally praise, encourage and propagandize\" its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are going to stipulate a condition in the \"law\" that the north may be excluded from the \"anti-state organization\" depending on \"change of its attitude\" such as \"drop of its plan to achieve reunification by force of arms\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such farce of rewriting the \"security law\" is, in essence, intended to render it more fascist and increase its function. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The notorious \"security law\" should not \"be amended,\" but totally abrogated. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japanese reactionaries assailed for their craftiness \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 9 (KCNA) -- Japan has long committed all sorts of vices against other countries, backed by big countries. Being dishonest, Japan is  apt to cheat others and resorts to any crafty act to meet its interests. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article laying bare the craftiness of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are too many instances proving this crafty nature of Japan to cite. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese authorities adamantly denied the crimes related to \"comfort women for the army\" at the outset, albeit they were aware of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As undeniable evidence and testimonies were provided as regards the crimes, they are talking about \"compensation\" from a \"civilian fund\" in a bid to evade their governmental responsibility for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Underlying their move is a crafty trick to convince the public at home and abroad that Japan's use of \"comfort women for the army\" was not an organized crime and evade governmental responsibility and compensation for this crime at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's craftiness finds a vivid expression in working hard to seek permanent membership of the UN Security Council and escalating its moves for nuclear armament and overseas reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When the DPRK  launched its satellite, Japan got frantic in its anti-DPRK campaign, insisting that it was \"ballistic missile launch\". This was prompted by its sinister intention to justify its moves for overseas reinvasion under the pretext of \"threat from the DPRK\" and divert elsewhere vigilance against Tokyo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This crafty nature of Japan comes out of its short-sighted way of thinking. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
