It was the line of grudge as it allowed the U.S. imperialists to occupy south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having secured a justification to set their foot of aggression in the Korean Peninsula under the pretext of controlling the \"allotted operational line\", the U.S. imperialists militarily occupied the whole area of south Korea and got started on the moves to provide a framework for carrying out the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On September 11, 1945, they set up the \"U.S. military government,\" appointing the commander of the 7th infantry division of the U.S. forces as its governor and the commander of the U.S. military police as chief of its police office. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They trained \"pivots\" of the south Korean army and reorganized south Korea's \"national defense guard\" into the \"national defense forces\" in September 1948 and classified it into the ground, naval and air forces in November. In May of 1949, they organized five divisions and one brigade involving all branches of arms and specialized service and in June organized the \"metropolitan\" garrison command and one division to enlarge the ground armed forces to 22 regiments under eight divisions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to modernize the military equipment of the south Korean army with aggression aims, the U.S. imperialists offered south Korea 110 million U.S. dollars of \"military aid\" enough for fully arming at least 50,000 soldiers in 1949. They also granted U.S.-made M-1s and carbines to the south Korean army units, thus equipping 93.7 percent of the south Korean army with modern arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The root cause of the Korean War lies in the fact that the U.S. imperialist gangsters made the 38th parallel line the artificial division line and illegally occupied south Korea by force of arms. The war was started by the U.S. imperialists' attack on the northern half of Korea on June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fifty odd years have passed after the war and nearly 20 years after the end of Cold War. However, the U.S. imperialists are still now keeping their occupation of south Korea while running desperately amuck to provoke a second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are greatly mistaken. If they ignite a war on this land again, the army and people of the DPRK will bravely turn out to root out the source of the war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the GNP is busy floating misinformation falsifying the truth of the festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland says this in information bulletin No. 931 released on June 22. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP has stood against the June 15 joint declaration and hamstrung its implementation, describing June 15 as a \"day of national humiliation\" and calling for the repeal of the joint declaration, the bulletin recalled, and continued: Moreover, it had neither justification nor qualification nor face to participate in the festival as it did not join the south side committee for implementing the June 15 joint declaration as a political party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side committee for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, foreseeing that the GNP's participation in the recent festival would only lay an obstacle in its way, repeatedly clarified its principled stand of refusing its participation in the festival and sent a notice to the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the GNP made its way into the festival in the name of \"guests to the festival\", though uninvited, and promised in advance that it would take part in it strictly in its private capacity. Guys from the GNP, however, obstinately insisted that they should be invited to sit in the first row of the platform party as \"representatives of the party dominating the south Korean National Assembly,\" breaking their earlier promise. They thus persistently tried to scuttle the meeting for national unity, the main event of the festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the calculation of the GNP that the successful holding of the festival and the growing atmosphere supporting the June 15 joint declaration would be absolutely unfavorable for itself at a time when \"the presidential elections\" are drawing near. For this reason, the GNP let its members join the south side delegation in a bid to create difficulties in the work of the festival. Everything would have gone well during the festival, had those lawmakers from the GNP stayed calm and withdrawn their insistence. They, however, insisted on their claim to the last moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, those legislators went the lengths of prattling that when they go back to the south, \"they would be welcomed as heroes who have scuttled the festival\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts clearly prove before the nation that if the GNP is allowed to meddle in the inter-Korean movement for reunification, it would bring every undertaking to a bankruptcy though it had been expected to be successful and in case it is allowed to come to power, it would drive the inter-Korean relations to a collapse and only make the atmosphere of confrontation and tension prevail in the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 23 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialist aggressors transferred 20 F-16 fighter bombers and more than 300 air force personnel from the air force base in Aviano, Italy and deployed them in their air force base in Kunsan, south Korea on June 19 in the wake of the announcement about the transfer made on June 14. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was reported that the fighter bombers would involve themselves in joint military exercises with the air force of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea and the air force of the south Korean armed forces during their long presence there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the U.S. imperialists staged madcap air battle drills and exercises for intensive strikes at ground targets, close air support and airlifting operations in coordinated operations with F-16 fighter bombers and formations of A-10 assault planes belonging to the U.S. seventh air force in south Korea after deploying overseas based F-15, F/A-18, E-3, EP-3 and flying corps of other type planes in their bases in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan-and Guam-based B-52 strategic bombers and F/A-18 pursuit and assault planes flew into the air over areas of south Korea in pairs or in formations periodically and staged air battle operational exercises in parallel with the long distance navigation exercises of dropping bombs before returning to their bases, while being refueled in the air. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very dangerous military provocation that the U.S. imperialists are busy staging frantic air battle exercises targeted against the DPRK by massively reinforcing the air force in and around the Korean Peninsula and introducing war planes even from Europe into it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist warhawks had better immediately stop the anti-DPRK war exercises and pull back the air force from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They were killed by the U.S. imperialists and the class enemies during the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Remains and relics of the dead and lethal weapons used by the killers were unearthed in the site of the chestnut storehouse and Takme Valley from May 13 to 28. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are tuft of hair burnt by fire, the severed foot with shoe, the split and crumbled bones of skull, legs and arms by hoe, shovel blade, hammer and iron bar, bodies without heads and legs and the bones with bullets. There are also the people to hold a baby in their arms or backs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among the lethal weapons are fired cartridges, bullets, a shovel with a rope attached to each side of the blade, different kinds of large nails, spit, iron bar, iron chains and wires used to bind the patriots, pieces of glass used in gouging out the people's eyes and blood-stained stones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Susan-ri, along with Sinchon of South Hwanghae Province, has been known as the land of grudge indicting the brutality of the U.S. imperialists and the class enemies. The murderers cold-bloodedly slew some 1,000 patriots and innocent civilians, one third of the population of Susan-myon at that time during the temporary strategic retreat of the Fatherland Liberation War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The visitors are swearing revenge on the U.S. imperialists and the class enemies a hundred and thousand fold. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The excavation work continues.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

No tiene obligacion ni calificacion ni honra de participar en el citado festival porque no se hizo parte del Comite Sureno para la Ejecucion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, senala el documento y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Al prever que la presencia de este \"partido\" en el festival creara obstaculo en la realizacion del acto arriba mencionado el comite norteno expreso varias veces la negacion de principios a la participacion del \"GPN\" y lo notifico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, el \"GPN\" se infiltro en el evento nacional con rotulo del \"huesped\". Y, al volcar su compromiso previo de participar en el estrictamente en \"calidad individual\" se obstino en ocupar un puesto de la primera linea de la tribuna como \"representante de un partido dominante en la asamblea nacional\" e impidio de toda trance la realizacion del Congreso de la Unidad Nacional, acto principal del festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La marcha exitosa del festival y la elevacion del ambiente de apoyo al 15 de Junio resultaran absolutamente desfavorables al \"GPN\" en visperas de las \"elecciones presidenciales\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por eso, el \"GPN\" incorporo sus miembros a la delegacion surcoreana bajo el objeto de llevar al fracaso el festival creando asi obstaculos en la marcha de este evento nacional. A pesar de que no habria ocurrido ningun problema si los parlamentarios del \"GPN\" se hubieran retirado de buena fe, se obstinaron hasta el ultimo momento en tomar parte en el acto. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Para colmo, los parlamentarios del \"GPN\" venidos al Norte dijeron que al regresar al Sur \"se convertirian en heroes por su merito de llevar al fracaso el festival\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los hechos prueban claramente que si el \"GPN\" se interviene en el movimiento por la reunificacion N-S, esta causa nacional se llevara al fracaso y si esta horda de traidores prevalece, se empeoraran las relaciones entre ambas partes de Corea y se soplaran vientos de confrontacion y tirantez en la Peninsula Coreana.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
