He spared time to have a picture taken with its participants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean women's movement has steadily developed into the Juche-oriented one remaining faithful to the idea and cause of the leader and demonstrated its might as an example of the progressive women's movement of the world under the wise guidance of peerlessly great men.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOnly victory and glory are always in store for the Korean people and women dashing ahead like snowstorm on Mt.

            "content": "CRPP condena acto pronorteamericano de banda titere surcoreana\r\nPyongyang, 8 de marzo (ACNC) -- Segun trascendidos, el embajador de Estados Unidos  acreditado en el Sur de Corea, Mark Report fue castigado en el lugar centrico de Seul por un civil surcoreano.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el pasado, hubo la lucha violenta antiyanqui tales como el incendio del instituto  cultural norteamericano en Pusan, la explosion del instituto cultural norteamericana en Taegu y el asalto de la embajada norteamericana en Seul. Pero, es la primera vez que el embajador norteamericano, gobernador general colonial en el terreno recibio  el sablazo de indignacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el Secretariado del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria (CRPP) hizo publica el dia 7 la informacion no. 1085.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota senala que el presente incidente ha sido el reflejo de la opinion publica y la expresion de resistencia de los habitantes surcoreanos a EE.UU. que agrava la crisis de guerra en la Peninsula Coreana desarrollando en el suelo surcoreano el peligroso entrenamiento militar conjunto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl problema consiste en que la banda titere surcoreana se desespera por ligar este incidente con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea calificandolo de \"conducta de las fuerzas pro-Norte de Corea\" subraya y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con que lo publicamos como castigo de justicia y la resistencia de la opinion publica a EE.UU., la banda titere nos acuso perversamente disparatando que es la \"proteccion al terrorismo\", la \"tergiversacion de la esencia del incidente\" y la \"palabra insensata que reconoce que ella misma es el grupo terrorista anti-DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY hasta, los policias y los medios de prensa conservadores se suman a esta locura diciendo que el protagonista de este incidente visito antes el Norte de Corea que le abrigo activamente cuando el tiro el ladrillo al embajador japones en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tE insatisfechos con esto lanzaron a los viejos conservadores ultraderechistas a insultar la maxima dignidad y la bandera de la RPDC creando asi el ambiente horroroso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo esto parte de la  maligna intencion de evitar la verguenza internacional sufrida por este incidente, desviando la atencion publica, exterminar en esta ocasion a las fuerzas patrioticas por la reunificacion y recurrir mas al alboroto internacional anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSobre todo, aprovechando el presente caso persiguen instigar a EE.UU. para que determine de nuevo la RPDC  como \"pais patrocinador del terrorismo\" y fortalecer mas el contubernio con su amo gringo y la cooperacion internacional anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTratar como criminal a su ciudadano que expresa resistencia a EE.UU. que desarrolla con frenesi los ejercicios militares conjuntos significa revelar mas la naturaleza de los traidores especiales pronorteamericanos."
