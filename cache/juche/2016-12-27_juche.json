Korea Discussion on \"Extended Deterrence Strategy\"\r\nPyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Tuesday in connection with the fact that the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces held discussion on \"extended deterrence strategy\" against the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t There was a meeting of U.S.-south Korea \"group for discussion on extended deterrence strategy\" in Washington shortly ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces agreed to set up the \"group\" in October and held its first meeting recently. This is a serious provocation aggravating the situation on the Korean peninsula and increasing the danger of a nuclear war there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the recent meeting the U.S. examined the rotation deployment of the U.S. strategic assets in south Korea under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. This is an extremely dangerous attempt to put nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK on a regular and institutional basis and stifle it by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By holding closer to it the south Korean puppet forces who are now foundering in the worst ruling crisis, and making them increasingly dependent on it in military field on one hand and by forming the U.S.-Japan-south Korea triangular military alliance and setting up NATO of Asian version on the other hand, the U.S. seeks to contain its rival nations and maintain its military edge in Asia-Pacific and thus realize its hegemonic ambition.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces recently clamored for the building of a nuclear-powered submarine at the instigation of the U.S., a clear revelation of their intention to act a shock brigade and servants in executing the U.S. strategy for invasion and domination of Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces are branding the DPRK's bolstering of its nuclear deterrence as \"threats\" but they can never cover up their criminal nature of threatening the DPRK with nukes and rendering the situation in the region instable through the introduction of huge strategic assets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present situation clearly proves that the DPRK was absolutely just and right when it made the decision and opted for the line to put a definite end to the danger of a nuclear war being imposed by the U.S. and defend peace in the region and the rest of the world in reliance on the powerful nuclear deterrence.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will in the future, too, hold fast to the Workers' Party of Korea's idea and line on simultaneously developing the two fronts and further bolster the nuclear force for self-defence in quality and quantity as long as the U.S. persists in its hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK."
