So, this General Assembly and the Year 2000 Special Conference must correctly find their cause and seek ways of their solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The continued challenges to the domain of social development are caused by unequal international economic relations hindering the economic development of developing countries. Today the developed countries are resorting to the unilateral and prejudiced economic steps such as high interest investment protectionism, thus widening the gap between the rich and poor countries and producing a lot of jobless people in developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is important to pay due attention to establishing fair international economic relations based on the principle of independence, equality and reciprocity, eliminating protectionism and solving debt problem in developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Meanwhile, the UN should actively help its member countries in their efforts for social development and the UN organizations pay primary concern to the solution of social problems in developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Each country must work out a policy for social development to suit its specific conditions  because socio-economic conditions and level of all countries are different. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Immediate release of reunification envoys urged\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 17 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities recently arrested and prosecuted the adviser of the south headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon) Ra Chang Sun, representative of the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils (Hanchongryon) that represents the south headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification Hwang Hye Ro and other representatives of reunification organizations on charges of violation of the fascist \"security law\" for visiting Pyongyang to participate in the August 15 Grand Pan-National Pro-Reunification Festival. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary condemns this as an unpardonable anti-national, anti-reunification criminal act, dismissing it as a vicious challenge to the reconciliation and unity of  the nation and its desire for the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The representatives of the south headquarters of Pomminryon, Hanchongryon and the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification are the patriots who had done praiseworthy things for the unity of the nation and the reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their participation in the August 15 Grand Pan-National Pro-Reunification Festival held in the north helped deepen the compatriotic feelings of the people in the north and the south and stirred up the nation's desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They left meaningful footprints on the road of the patriotic struggle for reunification, their hearts burning with patriotism and strong desire for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers arrested the patriots who should be cheered by the whole nation with flowers for their contribution to the unity of the nation and the development of the reunification movement. This proves that the South Korean rulers do not have any will to realize the unity of the nation and reunification. If even a drop of the nation's blood had run in their bodies, they would not have committed such a treachery and hideous outrage without hesitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir loudmouthed \"dialogue\" and \"reunification\" is nothing but hypocrisy flouting the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should stop their fascist suppression of the reunification envoys and release them immediately. \r\n\r\n"
