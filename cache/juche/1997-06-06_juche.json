            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on Ikeda's remarks\r\nPyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea issued the following statement today:\r\n   It has been reported that Japanese Foreign Minister Ikeda at a recent meeting of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Representatives urged the DPRK to dispose of its resources properly, strive for stable life of people and reduce armaments in order to solve the food problem. He even slandered the policy of the DPRK leadership, saying what the \"Administrator\" should do and how.\r\n   If it is true, we cannot but regard his remarks as an intolerable challenge to the Korean people.\r\n   The biggest problem is that he took a very rude attitude towards the leadership of the DPRK.\r\n   As is known to the world, Secretary Kim Jong Il, busy as he is leading all affairs of the party, the state and the army, always pays deep attention to the people's living conditions and stands in the forefront to overcome the current difficulties.\r\n   That is why the Korean people regard him as their father and the sun of the nation and are determined to share weal and woe with him.\r\n   If anyone hurls mud at the headquarters of our revolution, we will never pardon him, whoever he may be.\r\n   Ikeda's remarks revealed an unreasonable intention to interfere in the DPRK's internal affairs. He slandered the DPRK's policies, contending that it should solve the food shortage in such a way as \"arms reduction\".\r\n   Where and how we direct our resources and manpower is a matter pertaining to our sovereignty.\r\n   Obviously, it is vital to our existence that we, subjected to persistent military threat by the imperialists and reactionaries, attach importance to the military and further develop our revolutionary armed forces to be invincible.\r\n   If Japan is truly concerned about our food shortage, it should clearly see the situation, instead of crying for \"arms reduction\".\r\n   Our army and people will as ever firmly defend our socialist system, a valuable gain of our revolution.\r\n   Especially, our people will devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution headed by Secretary Kim Jong Il and annihilate those who provoke us even a little bit, wherever they may be. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
