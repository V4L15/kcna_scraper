Feeling the floor with his hand, he said it was necessary to smoothen it better so that the students may not have their knees hurt while exercising. Underlining the need to build the gymnasium better, he said he would send designers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt an e-library, he saw with keen attention students using computers and took measures for the operation of the computer network.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt their hall he sat on a chair used by them and said it was built well. He learned in detail about its acoustic conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that his visit to the school made him feel as if he had come to his birthplace, adding it offered him an opportunity to renew his determination to carry the revolution to completion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for the education and management of the school having a noble mission to bring up a backbone force, core force which will steadfastly succeed to the Korean revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, minister of the People's Armed Forces, KPA Generals Pak Jae Gyong and Hyon Chol Hae, First Vice Department Director of the C.C., the WPK Ri Jae Il and Vice Department Director of the C.C., the WPK Hwang Pyong So."

Esto no fue mas que un engano para ocultar su siniestro intento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl recibir el informe de trabajo del Ministerio de Reunificacion, Lee no oculto que su banda desea el \"estado de emergencia del Norte\" diciendo que es posible que se produzca \"cierto cambio en la situacion del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, por conducto de unos fulanos y menganos, lanzo una campana demagogica anti-RPDC para tildar como \"orquestados\" los llantos del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea por el fallecimiento del Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi bien la camarilla surcoreana intenta recrudecer su campana de enfrentamiento fratricida, eso solo adelantara su propio arruinamiento.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya ha declarado, la RPDC ajustara las cuentas hasta el final de los tremendos crimenes inmorales cometidos por los compinches de Lee durante el gran duelo nacional."
