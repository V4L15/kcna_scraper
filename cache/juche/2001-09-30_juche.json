Visits, contacts, reconciliation and cooperation should be conducted in conformity with the aspiration, demand and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n T1 get the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces withdrawn from South Korea and terminate the interference of foreign forces in the internal affairs of the nation is the fundamental condition for national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra right wing conservatives of South Korea are throwing a wet blanket over the atmosphere of independent reunification of the nation and begging for \"cooperation\" with foreign forces. The Korean nation should expose them in their true colors as the separatists and deal a resolute sledge-hammer blow at them on its own behalf.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Political suppression of Koreans in Japan condemned\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 30 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary denounces the Japanese authorities' search for Korean credit unions and officials under the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) as a flagrant insult and encroachment on the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and a deliberate provocation against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and a violation of their human rights.\r\n On September 26 the Japanese authorities called out over 300 prosecutors and policemen to search seven branches of the Kinki Korean bank, a computer room of the Korean credit union in Tokyo and homes of Korean bank officials under the pretext of \"evasion of examination\" and seize their documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a deliberate and premeditated political crackdown designed to threaten Chongryon, Koreans in Japan, Korean businessmen and union members in Japan and obstruct their patriotic activities, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As to Korean credit unions, Koreans in Japan organized them by saving money in the spirit of mutual help and cooperation despite the unreasonable financial discrimination of the Japanese authorities and financial bodies. Since their establishment Korean credit unions have neither interfered in the internal affairs of Japan nor violated nor ignored the Japanese law while conducting their financial and banking activities. However, the Japanese authorities oppressed and persecuted them under the unreasonable pretext, a crime which cannot be justified with anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish illusion for Japan to try to divert elsewhere the public attention at home and abroad with anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon campaigns and step up its moves to become a military giant and its moves for nuclear armament and overseas expansion in a bid to reinvade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately stop their unreasonable crackdown on Korean credit unions in Japan and protect them, independent national financial bodies, by law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan continues to resort to the anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon campaigns in defiance of our warnings, it will pay a high price.    \r\n\r\n"

That is not attributable to their poor arms but to the lack of the spirit of independence and the lack of faith in victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people's history of victory proves that it is most important to maintain one's own view and faith: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people decisively smashed the anti-DPRK campaign of the imperialists over the nuclear issue in the last annals of the 20th century and answered the U.S. imperialists' tough policy to stifle the DPRK with super toughness. The credit for this goes to leader Kim Jong Il's firm political view and faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialists are not strong enough to be afraid of. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to have more transparent independent idea and faith under the increasing pressure and blackmail of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the serious lesson and truth taught by the present revolutionary situation.    \r\n\r\n"
