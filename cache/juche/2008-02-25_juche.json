It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is important in establishing Juche in the musical art is to create and develop music with the main stress put on the national music and on the basis of the national melodies, actively encourage the traditional national music and national musical instruments, create new many songs of folk song style in the present times and accept the good achievements and experience gained in the musical art of other countries in the light of criticism to suit our specific conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our musical art fully representing the national flavor and emotion and overflowing with the Korean characteristics help the people cherish deep the great national pride and self-confidence and joy and happiness at working and living in the revolutionary era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly the achievements and experience made in thoroughly subordinating Western music and musical instruments to the Korean music with the main stress put on the national music and musical instruments are a clear proof of the validity and vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's unique idea of literature and art on developing the musical art from the viewpoint of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity and vitality of the Party's original policy of creating instrumental music have been fully displayed through the creation and performances of such masterpieces as Korean-style symphonies \"The Sea of Blood\" and \"The Flower Girl\" and orchestras \"Rich Harvest Comes to the Chongsan Plain\" and \"Arirang\" in the past annals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now further demonstrating their great might through the new high ground on which the music in the era of Songun has been put. Such admirable musical art works as piano concerto \"Song Devoted to Comrade Kim Jong Il\", orchestras \"General on a Galloping White Horse\" and \"No One Knows\" which clearly show new appearance of the development of the Juche-based orchestra in the new century, and string ensemble for pizzicato \"This Land Is Very Good\" give full play to the might of the Korean musical art with strong Juche character as they are excellent instrumental music works of our style, profound and philosophical in content and perfect in artistry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The music of the Pochonbo Electronic Band is a shining example in successfully creating the Korean-style music to suit the taste and emotion of the Korean people with electronic musical instruments as required by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the achievements made in the Juche-based musical art are the shining fruition produced by the outstanding idea of building music of General Secretary Kim Jong Il who has thoroughly developed the Korean musical art our own way.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their intensified war exercise in south Korea cannot be construed otherwise than an intentional move to spoil the atmosphere for the talks and bring the situation of the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war. Their aim is to ignite a war against the north when a chance presents itself, while wasting time under the pretext of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adventurous war gamble against the DPRK the U.S. is going to stage together with the warmongers of south Korea will have a negative effect on the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Leveling a gun at dialogue partner while talking about \"dialogue\" and \"improved relations\" is an act contrary to common sense and diplomatic practice. The escalating war exercises in south Korea cannot be justified in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. warmongers opt for the war gamble against the DPRK, bringing the situation of the Korean Peninsula into the irreversible grave phase against peace, they will be wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences, concludes the article.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea War Exercises under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- The United States is planning to stage large-scale war exercises with the south Korean forces from March 2 to 7 with tens of thousands of troops and modern war hardware involved. Even nuclear-powered carrier \"Nimitz\" is expected to participate in these war maneuvers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Saturday observers in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This saber rattling is slated to be staged against the dialogue partner at a time when the DPRK-U.S. dialogue is under way. This goes to prove that the U.S. does not stand for a negotiated settlement of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through these war exercises the U.S. war-like forces seek to more tightly bind south Korea to the \"military alliance\" with the U.S. and consolidate the foundation of their aggressor forces' presence in it in a bid to realize their scenario for a war of aggression against the north and their ambition for establishing the sphere of military control over Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has said more than once that it would neither threaten nor invade the DPRK by force of arms but seek a negotiated solution of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It intends to opt for the use of force in case things go against its wish, while contending it is good to attain its sinister political aim through dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has introduced fighter bombers into south Korea since the outset of this year and renamed the U.S. forces command in Japan \"first army corps field command.\" These moves are to serve the purpose of this strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' reckless moves for a new war which escalate the situation on the Korean Peninsula not only pose a direct threat to the security of the DPRK but also seriously affect the situation in the whole of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to boost the triangular military alliance involving the U.S., Japan and south Korea in a bid to seize military supremacy in the region and, moreover, realize its Asia strategy by use of allied forces, regarding the expected emergence of a new regime in south Korea as an opportunity favorable for carrying out its war strategy.

This is a patent proof that the U.S. is, in actuality, stepping up the moves for aggression and war while talking about global \"peace\" and \"security.\" Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. spends a stupendous amount of funds every year in an effort to develop new type sophisticated weapons and mass-produce them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. decided on a plan for the deployment of forces, the biggest since the Second World War, the key point of which is to relocate one-third of its forces till 2011. This is aimed at accelerating the beefing up and relocation of its forces overseas and establishing military domination over various regions of the world and thereby putting the world under its control through its high-handed practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves stepped up by the U.S. to militarize the space for the purpose of getting space supremacy are part of its scenario for realizing its wild ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A space command was newly set up and the development of space satellites equipped with interceptor missiles is making brisk headway and many spy satellites were launched one after another. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. said no to a draft treaty for demilitarizing space which calls for banning the deployment of weapons in the outer space proposed by China and Russia at the recent Geneva Disarmament Conference, thus revealing its true colors as a disturber of peace. Lurking behind this is a sinister intention of the U.S. to turn the space into a place favorable for establishing world domination and put the space under its unchallenged military control and hold military supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of the U.S. for militarizing the space are creating the danger of a new Cold War in the international community.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
