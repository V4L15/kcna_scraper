Some of them were drowned to death or died due to heart failure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Testifying to this tragedy, Deiji Egawa who worked at the Ishigawajima shipyard said that he happened to meet a group of Koreans running away to their lodging house on his way to home soon after the start of the air raids. He added: They were Koreans who had been taken to Japan on March 9. They were in bad shape as they had burns on their faces and hands and their clothes were worn out. The lodging house accommodated about 900 Koreans but only 250-260 Koreans survived. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Study of Responsibility for the War\" No. 53, the organ of the Center for the Study of Materials on War Responsibility of Japan referred to the damage done to Koreans by the air raids as follows: 41,300 out of 97,632 Koreans in Tokyo fell victim to the bombing. Death toll among them was believed to be far more than 10,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Japanese imperialists buried the dead including Koreans in 67 parks, temples and playing grounds of schools, etc. after the air raids without identifying them under the pretext that the Japanese king was expected to inspect this area and perpetrated such crimes against humanity as carelessly disposing of the remains of Koreans who were killed with their grudge unsettled by reburying them together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n All these facts go to prove that the death of so many Koreans during the intensive air raids on Tokyo was entirely attributable to the military occupation of Korea by the then Japanese government and military. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 60 years have passed since Japan's defeat, but its government is not contemplating discovering all the remains of the victims of the forcible drafting of Koreans and sending them back to Korea. On the contrary it is running the whole gamut of sleight of hand to evade apology and reparation for its crimes, trying hard to hide them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of the remains of the above-said victims presents itself as an urgent human rights issue and a humanitarian issue whose solution brooks not a moment's delay in order to give vent to the towering grudge of those who were mercilessly killed by the Japanese imperialists and alleviate the sufferings of the bereaved families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, the Japanese government should make public the truth about the forcible drafting of Koreans, forced labor and the issue of the remains of the dead and take earliest possible practical measures to fully apologize to the victims and their bereaved families and make reparation, instead of getting frantic with anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon, (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan) campaigns under pretexts of the \"abduction issue,\" \"issue of remains\" and \"human rights issue.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Each country has its own historical background and conditions and the nations differ from each other in their political views and social systems and ideas and religious belief and customs and languages. But if the world people are guided by this idea, they can surely achieve unity and emerge a mighty force capable of putting an end to the unfair outdated international relations and order and building a new independent world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the wishes of all countries and nations of the world to exercise their sovereignty with independence and develop on the basis of the traditions and customs, ideology and sentiments and style peculiar to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the idea of independence is regarded as the basis of unity is it possible for the world people to coordinate their desires and achieve solid unity and display its great might in the struggle against the hegemonic forces keen to suppress independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An independent life can be created and the development of human civilization and the building of a new society be accelerated only when peace is ensured.

The U.S. policy for invading Korea is aimed at keeping south Korea as its permanent colony and swallowing up the whole of Korea with south Korea as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. warmongers dare not ignite a war though they always watch for a chance to invade the DPRK because its army and people are fully prepared to wipe out any aggressors at one stroke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. is keen to use the south Korean puppet armed forces as a shock brigade in a war of aggression against the DPRK. In other words, it is its scenario to pit Koreans against themselves and fish in troubled waters. It is in pursuance of the scenario that the U.S. is relocating its forces in the area along the Military Demarcation Line in the areas of Phyongthaek and Osan and arming the south Korean puppet armed forces with latest war hardware. The U.S. projected sale of AIM-9Xs to south Korea is the product of the U.S. sinister design for aggression to escalate the military confrontation between the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK remains unchanged and the U.S. is becoming more persistent and cunning in its policy as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unshakable is the will of the Koreans to usher in a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. The U.S. bellicose forces and the Lee Myung Bak group would be well advised to behave themselves, bearing this in mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The group is imposing the anti-reunification education upon the younger generation, swimming against the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors is working hard to infuse anti-reunification, Cold War-minded consciousness into the students quite contrary to the trend of the times, but they will never succeed. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
