Korea Joint Military Drills Demanded by Korean in U.S.\r\nPyongyang, March 6 (KCNA) -- A member of editorial board of Minjok Thongsin, an internet paper of Koreans in the U.S., issued an article on Tuesday demanding a halt to the U.S.-south Korea joint military drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article noted that the U.S. is escalating military tensions while staging the joint military drills for a nuclear war against the north by mobilizing nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is terming the rocket launching drills of the north a \"breach of resolutions of the UN Security Council\", while wantonly violating the Armistice Agreement, the article charged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is not entitled to talk about this, it said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 40 odd year-long colonial rule over Korea by the Japanese imperialists was a product of the international politically-motivated operation faked up by the conclusion of the \"Taft-Katsura Treaty\" and the Korean war was a war of aggression ignited by the U.S. by inveigling its satellite forces in it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has no face to say about the north's action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is just the U.S. which has made lies to justify its crimes of killing innocent civilians after invading Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and other countries in Mideast.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is talking about the \"denuclearization of the north\" while fostering the war crisis by introducing Columbus, a nuclear submarine, in Pusan Port of south Korea on March 3 for the joint military drills. This is a deceptive behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should stop the joint military drills with the U.S. and have the stand of placing the nation above outsiders, though belatedly, the article concluded."
