In this regard Minju Joson today in a signed commentary says:\r\n U.S. President Bush at a recent joint session of the U.S. congress talked about a \"missile threat\" from the DPRK, terming it a \"rogue state.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"missile threat\" peddled by the U.S. is nothing but sheer sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that the U.S. threatened the DPRK after deploying aggression armed forces including a large number of missiles in and around South Korea, DPRK had no option but to develop missiles to cope with the threat. This is an issue pertaining to the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent moves to infringe upon the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK under an absurd pretext compel the DPRK to take corresponding measures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its counter-measure to protect the sovereignty and dignity of the country is not bound to anything and has no limit in its scope and strength.  As the DPRK representative clarified at the session of the U.N. disarmament commission, the DPRK has potentials, capabilities and will to take such measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even if this counter-measure results in sparking an arms race between the DPRK and the U.S. and scrapping all the provisions agreed upon between two sides, the DPRK will have nothing to fear. It has little to lose. But that will bring unpredictable consequences to the U.S. for which is will have to be fully responsible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK wishes peace but never begs for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK never says empty words. The U.S. it well advised to bear this in mind and immediately stop its provocations, hostile acts and moves to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. \r\n\r\n"
