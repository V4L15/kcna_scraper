It is possible to meet the requirements of attaching importance to the nation only when the requirements and the interests of the nation are considered as an absolute standard and fully met and the independent principle and the principle of putting the interests of the nation above all and defending it are firmly maintained, not yielding to the outsiders' pressure and blackmail. It presents itself as a more important issue than ever before to develop the inter-Korean relations and the reunification movement in the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and oppose and reject the outsiders' interference and obstructions and the anti-reunification conservative forces in south Korea, their lackeys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending peace is a militant task vital to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula still remains tense due to the moves of bellicose forces at home and abroad for a war of aggression. The war-like forces of the U.S. and south Korea continue staging DPRK-targeted large-scale military exercises, while getting evermore frantic in their arms buildup. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite natural for the Koreans to have stood against the moves of outsiders and their followers for aggression and war and waged a dynamic struggle to drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea under the uplifted banner of defending peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Achieving unity provides a sure guarantee for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present era requires the achievement of the national unity on a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to foil the moves of the anti-reunification forces in south Korea opposed to national unity while dynamically waging the struggle to achieve the national unity among Koreans at home and abroad.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
