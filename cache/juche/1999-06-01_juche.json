            "content": "Combating imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning called for\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The newspaper Rodong Sinmun and the magazine Kulloja, organs of the Central Committee of the Worker's Party of Korea, published a joint article entitled \"Let us reject imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Rodong Sinmun today in a lengthy article says that the imperialist ideological and cultural  poisoning is an important means of executing its strategy for world supremacy, corrupt capitalist idea is intolerable in socialist society,  imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning should be frustrated through a revolutionary ideological offensive and the DPRK should consolidate the socialist ideological and cultural front as firm as an impregnable fortress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the first part, the article says:   The imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning is a means of aggression and intervention committed under the signboard of \"cooperation\" and \"exchange.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the main strategy of the imperialists to dominate the world with corrupt ideas which they had failed to bring under their control with atomic bombs and dollars.\r\n   This poisoning is aimed at doing harm  to the excellent national character of each country and nation and making hundreds of millions of people across the world mentally deformed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the second part, the article points out:   In the socialist society, the imperialist ideology and culture,  the corrupt capitalist idea should not be tolerated under any circumstances.   It is the truth proven by history that if a slightest manifestation of the corrupt capitalist idea is tolerated, socialist society itself cannot exist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The former Soviet Union and east European socialist countries  collapsed not because their military and economic potentials were weak and the level of their cultural development was low. It was entirely because they opened the door wide for the  imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning.  Corrupt ideas spread by the imperialists are more dangerous than atomic bombs for the countries in the process of socialist construction.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This ideological and cultural poisoning is a vicious reactionary offensive aimed at breaking people's faith in socialism.  It is thanks to this faith that a socialist society is built and a socialist bulwark is defended.   Once the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning is tolerated, even the faith unshakable before threat of the bayonet will be bound to give in like a wet mud-wall. This is  exactly  degeneration. If one is taken to capitalist idea, he will abandon his faith and be disarmed ideologically.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an important method employed by the imperialists to make the faith in socialism  wither away to carry out ideological and cultural poisoning under the signboard of religion. Crafty, indeed, are the methods employed by the imperialists  to beautify the exploiting society, misplace the working-class trust in their party and incite anti-socialism by abusing religious creed.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning serves as a vicious means of destroying the unity and cohesion in the socialist society.   It inevitably invites the emergence of counter-revolutionary forces. It is bound to be followed by the appearance of counter-revolutionary elements who harbor an illusion about imperialism and resurgence of saboteurs and destructive elements.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History shows that any turmoil and activities of counter-revolutionary groups in socialist society are linked with the moves of the imperialists.   The imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning is just like tentacles  of the perilous campaign to harm the noble socialist way of life.   If any heterogeneous way of life is allowed in the socialist society  to stand opposed to its way of life, it will shake the society to its very foundation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the third part, the article says:   We should frustrate the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning by a revolutionary ideological offensive.\r\n   The revolutionary people should  undertake a more  dynamic struggle against imperialism till  it goes to its final ruin and the corrupt bourgeois ideology and culture is totally  eliminated from the earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is necessary to keep hold on ideological education as our life line and positively conduct it.    Now that the world is disturbed by the corrupt idea, there is nothing more dangerous than neglecting  ideological education of the people and leaving  them ideologically defenseless.    People should not allow any alien ideas to come into their mind.  Those who are not  equipped with the socialist idea are bound to take to the bourgeois idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Main emphasis should be put on offensive, in stead of defence in checking the imperialist ideological and cultural poisoning.  It is the most dynamic and efficient offensive  to carry out an ideological education of the people.\r\n   To pay exclusive attention to economic construction and abandon ideological work is just a suicidal act of opening the door for imperialist ideology and culture to infiltrate.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Efforts should be concentrated on the ideological education before anything else. To accelerate economic construction with a definite priority given to ideological education is the most revolutionary strategy to foil the imperialist  strategy of \"peaceful transition.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ideological education in the socialist society should be strictly socialist and revolutionary in its content. The ideological front should not allow anything ambiguous, compromise or concession. Wobbling ideological education  is worse than doing nothing. As some countries that were building socialism in the past carried on spotty education, neither socialist nor capitalist, it brought degeneration and setbacks to the ideological front. The ideological education should be strictly red both in its form and content.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is imperative to set up a mosquito net in all realms of social life. It is important to thoroughly block, first of all,  the channels through which the imperialist ideological and cultural poison can infiltrate.   Without this education people are bound to go sick mentally, morally and physically.  It is a most foolish act to neglect taking any revolutionary measure  to check this, aware of this disastrous consequences.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To set up a mosquito net  means a revolutionary benefit and love shown by the party that  is  responsible for the destiny of the people and leads them,  the only genuine protector of the people.   \"Speak out\" and \"pluralism\" called for by the imperialists and renegades of socialism should never be allowed in the ideological and political fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the economic domain, not the slightest illusion should be harbored about the capitalist way of business management based on money and about \"reform\" and \"opening\" that invite imperialism.   In the field of literature and arts, the tendencies toward art for art's sake, self-indulgence and \"freedom of creation\" should be strictly rejected.   Non-socialist elements should never be allowed. These are a hotbed of bourgeois ideology and culture.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The former Soviet Union and east European countries collapsed as they connived at and encouraged non-socialist elements.   It is important to decisively frustrate capitalist and non-socialist elements in their bud.   In its last part, the article calls for consolidating the socialist ideological and cultural front of the DPRK as an impregnable fortress.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It goes on:   The wise leadership of the Worker's Party of Korea that has given a definite priority to the ideological work has already been clearly proven in the revolutionary practice.   The Worker's Party of Korea is a militant party which has led the revolution and construction on the strength of idea with a firm hold on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK has pushed ahead with the socialist cause, invariably taking the theory of ideology as a guideline no matter which way the wind may blow.   The resolute, principled and uncompromising position maintained by the wpk in the ideological and cultural confrontation with imperialism  remains a brilliant  example in defending the socialist cause.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should retain a firm hold on the WPK's policies of the ideological work and thoroughly implement them.   Kim Jong Il is a great  architect of the socialist ideology and culture and a champion of human civilization.   Our socialist ideological position can  neither be destroyed nor can the aspiration of progressive humankind after independence be dampened as long as there is the great Kim Jong Il. \r\n\r\n"

They are now calling for \"culture without nationality,\" but it is no more than a sophism going against the trend of the present time when all the people live with country and nation as a unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In South Korea all aspects of society from formula of politics and language to way of life have adopted modes of the western countries including the United States and Japan.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reality shows that the ideological and cultural poisoning of imperialism leads a nation to decline and downfall,  not prosperous development.   This poisoning also makes several hundred millions of people of the world mentally deformed.   For a human being, political deformity is more miserable than physical malformation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The bourgeois ideology and culture stimulate vulgar instinct of people and reduce them to degradation with honeyed words. So, narcotics addicts, alcoholics and degenerates seeking to satisfy abnormal desire are daily increasing in number in those countries which have taken to such ideology and culture. And going unbridled are such social evils as depravity and corruption, murder, robbery and prostitution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the present times of civilization on the threshold of the 21st century, the imperialists have built a world of animals wilder than in the ancient times and the mediaeval ages. This crime can never be cleared.   Imperialism will be thrown into a dump of history for its malodorous ideology and culture as the ancient Rome Empire so mighty went to ruin with moral corruptness. \r\n\r\n"

The news analyst elaborates in detail on the fact that the U.S. have mapped out various operation plans and worked hard for their materialization since their defeat in the Korean War (July 27, 1953).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have revealed once again their brigandish aggressive nature to the whole of the world, the commentary says, and goes on:   In order to stifle the DPRK, they had employed all methods including isolation,  suffocation, military pressure and appeasement,  which did not work on the DPRK. They are now recklessly resorting to the exercise of strength, bereft of discretion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have made preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK in a systematic way and finally completed the military operational system.\r\nIn a word, they are scheming to  make a  preemptive attack on the DPRK with mobilization of their armed forces in the mainland, the pacific region, and South Korea, Japan's \"Self-Defence Forces\" and the South Korean \"ROK\" army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the Yugoslav crisis as an occasion, the U.S. are now intensively examining the feasibility and efficiency of the operation plan for invading of the north. The Balkan War unleashed by the U.S. is a test war for putting into practice the \"operation plan 5027-98) as well as a preliminary war for the second war of aggression on Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But, they are making a serious misjudgment.   It is an unshakable faith and mettle of the people and the army of Korea to meet the aggressors' challenge with a thousand-fold annihilating blow and the war of aggression with a liberation war of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S.  misjudge the mettle of the Korean people united around the great brilliant commander  in one mind and in the spirit of human bombs and ignite a war of aggression,  the Korean people will deal an annihilating and retaliatory blow to them and smash them into smithereens by all defensive and offensive means and potentials they have prepared for scores of years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Not only the U.S. aggressors but also all their followers who are involved in executing the \"operation plan 5027-98\" will not  escape the annihilating blow by the DPRK. \r\n   The U.S. and their followers  should clearly know who is their opponent. \r\n\r\n"
