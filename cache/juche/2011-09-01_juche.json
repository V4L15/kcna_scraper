The President visited Northeast China in September of 1964 and met with Premier Zhou Enlai. Kim Jong Il cordially met and had talks with General Secretary Hu Jintao in August of last year. It was revisited by Kim Jong Il again in May this year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe visited Jilin Province again on August 27 on his way home after wrapping up his visit to Russia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere are many time-honored revolutionary battle sites and historic sites including Jilin associated with the brilliant history of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle of Kim Il Sung in the area of Jilin Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe province has made rapid progress in various fields thanks to the great attention of the Communist Party of China and the devoted struggle of the people there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt tops the nation's list of producers in varieties of products in equipment, automobiles, and chemical fiber.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecent years witnessed the construction of express highways in various sections.

The Japanese militarists now regard it as an extremely troublesome and cumbersome thing as they seek to turn Japan into a military power and realize their ambition for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThat is why they are making a desperate effort to rewrite the Constitution overtly and covertly. Their ultimate goal is to make the \"pacifist Constitution\" a war Constitution. Japan's purpose is to turn the SDF into a regular army and put the establishment of a wartime mobilization system and start of a war on a legal and political basis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn a word, the Japanese reactionaries are set to pave the way for reinvasion and realize their militarist ambition in a legitimate manner by adopting the above-said war constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHerein lies the criminal and dangerous nature of the moves to revise the Constitution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is contemplating further modernizing its militarist forces in a bid to round off its preparations for overseas aggression and go into action any moment. The first target of this scenario is the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA spate of reckless remarks calling for the dispatch of the SDF in \"contingency\" on the Korean Peninsula are let loose and the attempt to grab Tok Islets are openly disclosed by the Japanese reactionary ruling forces. This eloquently proves that their reinvasion of Korea is becoming a reality."
