            "content": "Japan's Massacre of Koreans during Great Kanto Quake Indicted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 1 (KCNA) -- The History Society of the DPRK issued a memorandum on August 31 to indict the Japanese government for massacring Koreans in a premeditated and cruel manner during the great Kanto quake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the memorandum, the Japanese government, taking the great quake that hit the area of Kanto, Japan in September 1923 as a golden opportunity for suppressing Koreans, mobilized the Interior Ministry, the army and the police and even ultra-right organizations including the \"vigilant committee\", thus killing more than 23,000 innocent Koreans in cold blood in little more than 10 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government spread the fiction of \"uprising of Koreans\" in a bid to divert the Japanese people's criticism of government sparked off by the quake to killing Koreans. It then declared a \"wartime martial law\" and made \"combat\" preparations to kill defenseless Koreans in Japan, regarding them as \"enemies\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Kanto Martial Law Command ordered the army, the police and the \"vigilant committee\", etc. to commence the \"operation for exterminating Koreans\" after defining Koreans in Japan as \"enemies and insurgents\" according to the \"wartime martial law\".\r\n The command bolstered the ground and naval forces including Konoe division and the first division stationed in the area of Kanto in Tokyo and Yokohama. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of the troops present in the area under martial law reached more than 35,000 as of September 8 and more than 52,000 on September 10. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government saw to it that organizations including the \"vigilant committee\" and \"youth group\" specializing in killing Koreans were organized with ultra-right elements and ordered them to cooperate with the army and the police. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"vigilant committees\" thus totaled 3,688 - 1,595 in Tokyo metropolis, 603 in Kanagawa Prefecture, 300 in Saitama Prefecture, 366 in Chiba Prefecture, 336 in Ibaraki Prefecture, 469 in Gunma Prefecture and 19 in Tochigi Prefecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Under the direction of the command more than 70 army checkpoints were set up in the areas of Tokyo and Yokohama alone and hundreds of police boxes and police substations were ordered to operate as second checkpoints and Koreans among those passing through them were strictly screened and dealt with. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Japanese man-killers left no means untried to ferret out Koreans. Typical of them were forcing the passers-by to pronounce five yen and 55 sen in Japanese, those confirmed to be Koreans to tie scarves around their foreheads, passers-by to speak about their birthdays in Japanese and beating them hard till they make screams for the purpose of screening them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n These man-killers went rampant with \"hunting Koreans,\" scouring even mountains, riversides and meadows, to say nothing of streets, villages and houses, holding rifles, Japanese swords, daggers, bladed spears, bamboo spears, clubs and iron hooks and all other lethal weapons. When they caught Koreans, they cruelly killed them on the spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of the Koreans in Japan killed due to the Japanese government's cruel man-killing operations reached more than 23,000, according to the information released by the \"Government-General in Korea\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialist man-killers did not hesitate to commit such double crimes as burying a great number of dead bodies or burning them after spraying petroleum over them in order to keep the massacre of Koreans from being known to the world in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After massacring Koreans, the Japanese government shamelessly tried to conceal or distort the truth about it in a bid to evade the criticism of it by the unbiased public and the responsibility for the crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After proclaiming the \"wartime martial law\" the Japanese government organized the \"temporary secretariat for rescuing quake victims\" to eradicate the aftermath of the quake and set up in it a guard department working as a general command in charge of public security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The guard department conducted false propaganda about \"violence\" and \"crimes\" of Koreans in Japan in a bid to hide the government's responsibility for crimes and decided to spread the story that their \"violence\" was masterminded by the \"Reds\", communists, behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A typical decision was the September 5 top secret document \"An agreement on the issue of Koreans.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The massacre and suppression of Koreans by the Japanese government and its henchmen were crimes against humanity unprecedented in history for their scale and the crafty and cruel nature of methods used by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan brought so unspeakable misfortune to the Koreans as an aggressor and plunderer and committed so hideous crimes against the Koreans in political, economic, military, cultural, moral and all other fields. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government, however, is totally denying the crimes it committed in the past while dreaming of realizing the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\", far from repenting of and apologizing for its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should bear in mind that if it runs reckless, oblivious of this, it will never be able to evade a thousand-fold revenge of Koreans but remain a sworn enemy of the Koreans as long as it does not sincerely repent of its past crimes.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This has turned the area of Thaechon into a power-producing centre with a generating capacity of hundreds of thousands of kw of electricity. There also sprang up Orangchon Power Station No. 1, the Samsu Power Station and other large hydro-power stations as structures in the era of the Workers' Party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n This period also witnessed the appearance of minor power stations in various parts of the country such as Naephyong Army-People Power Station No. 2 and the Kumjingang Hungbong Youth Power Station which helped more than double the nation's generating capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period new Phunggok, Samchon, Ryongban and Pit No. 8 of Namyang Coal Mine and Pit No. 3 of the Namdok Coal Mine and others went operational and long-distance belt-conveyers have been completed in pits of the February 8 Jikdong Youth Coal Mine and the Ryongdung Coal Mine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A 100 ton electric furnace went operational at the Steel Shop of the Hwanghae Iron and Steel Complex in October, 2005. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The workers of the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex completed the construction of Coke Oven No. 4 and the reconstruction of Sintering Furnace No. 1 in a brief span of time by displaying the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This period also witnessed the opening of railways between Wonsan and Mt. Kumgang to traffic and their switch to electric traction and the appearance of the Branch for Manufacturing Wheels through Steel-rolling of the Rahung Railway Factory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The land-realignment in Kangwon Province resulted in cutting by half the total length of ridges between rice fields, ie, from over 12,000 km to more than 5,600 km and converting at least 233,800 patches of fields into more than 65,500 fields of standardized shapes and bringing over 1,760 hectares of new land under cultivation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n More than 53,000 hectares of land were realigned in North Phyongan Province, at least 100,000 hectares of land in South Hwanghae Province and over 94,400 hectares of land in South Phyongan Province and Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The construction of the Kaechon-Lake Thaesong Waterway extending about 160 km from Taegak-ri of Kaechon City to Lake Thaesong was completed in October 2002 and the construction of the nearly 280 km Paekma-Cholsan Waterway wound up three years later. The construction of a waterway is now making brisk headway in the Miru Plain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Many light industrial factories such as the Sinuiju Cosmetics Factory, the Taedonggang Beer Factory and the Kangso Mineral Water Processing Factory went operational. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n A lot of big modern stock-breeding bases have appeared in different parts of the country. Among them are the Hamhung City Youth Goat Farm, the Hamju Phyongphungdok Goat Farm, the Kyenam Stock-Farm, Wonsan Stock-Farm, the Songam Myonggi Cattle Farm, the Ostrich Farm, the Kusong Chicken Farm, the Kanggye Duck Farm, the Sariwon Pig Farm and the Phyongbuk Pig Farm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There also sprang up fish-breeding farms including the Pyongyang Catfish Farm, the Pukchang Catfish Farm and the Poman Fish Breeding Station. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hundreds of hectares of salt fields were constructed on the East Coast. Among them are the Kwangmyongsong Saltern, the Wonsan Bay Saltern and the Odaejin Youth Saltern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 600,000 dwelling houses were built in urban and rural areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\nElectricity and methane gas are used for heating and cooking in about 200,000 new dwelling houses built in rural areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n The Pyongyang-Hyangsan Tourist Road and the Youth Hero Motorway were built and ring roads constructed in scenic spots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Mt. Chilbo, a beauty spot on the East Coast, and Mt. Kuwol, a beauty spot on the West Coast, Mt. Jangsu, a famous mountain in South Hwanghae Province, and Mt. Jongbang, Mt. Paekun and Mt. Ryongak turned into attractive recreation grounds for people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Ullim Falls, the Kusul Falls and the Pidan Falls and six ponds once hidden in deep forests and Songam Cavern and Ryongmun Grand Cavern, the famous underground beauty spots, became tourist destinations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Pyongyang Kim Won Gyun Conservatory sprang up to be a grand centre for musical education and the Moranbong Theatre, the East Pyongyang Grand Theatre and the Taedongmun Cinema House were renovated as required by the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Okryu and Chongryu restaurants were face-lifted as popular comprehensive catering centers which serve national food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n These stirring realties are the precious fruition of General Secretary Kim Jong Il's outstanding leadership art and iron will and his total dedication to the country and the people. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In handling international issues, they should become unanimous in speaking for independence, impartiality and justice and steer the era in the direction of materializing their noble idea and achieving their purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should strive hard to boost the unity and solidarity on the basis of independence.\r\n The DPRK as a dignified member state of the NAM will firmly preserve its fundamental principle, idea and purity and fulfill its responsibility and role to steadily strengthen and develop it.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
