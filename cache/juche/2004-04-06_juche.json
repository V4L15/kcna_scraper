If the UN General Assembly has the authority to examine the resolutions of the UN Security Council which have direct effects on international peace and security and give relevant recommendations, it will be conducive to doing away with the strong-arm policy and unilateralism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"UN Command\" was framed up 50 odd years ago by the U.S. strong-arm and arbitrary practices. This was a crude violation of the UN Charter. The \"UN Command\" is, in fact, the U.S. Forces Command, being an illegal and anachronistic body, to all intents and purposes, and it is no more than a tool of aggression for attaining the U.S. strategic aim. \r\n\r\n"

Korean Judicial Authorities' Fascist Act Slammed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 5 (KCNA) -- The south Korean judicial authorities at the \"final trial\" of those involved in the \"remittance to the north\" inflicted penalties upon them.\r\n Commenting on this, Rodong Sinmun today terms this an intolerable anti-national and anti-reunification fascist act of challenging to the historic Pyongyang summit meeting an  the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and laying an artificial roadblock in the way of north-south reconciliation and unity. \r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The case of \"remittance to the north\" in south Korea was a product faked up by the ultra-right conservative forces including the Grand National Party under the manipulation of the United States to disparage the historic significance of the joint declaration and block the way of national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification. That is why no one admitted the case when it was made public in south Korea. All the fellow countrymen came out against incriminating \"remittance to the north\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paying no heed to these public sentiments, the south Korean judicial authorities inflicted harsh penalties upon them in the long run, overawed by the anti-reunification fascist hysteria of the traitorous group of the GNP. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of \"remittance to the north\" can in no case be an object of investigation or punishment. Enormous are the consequences of the \"special inspection\" forced under the arbitrariness and pressure of the GNP and the \"trials\" staged by the judicial authorities following it. This cannot be compensated with anything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case leads to the conclusion that the south Korean judicial authorities are a group of anti-reunification fascist murderers who, like the ultra-right conservative forces of the GNP, regard patriots as criminals and resort to fascist suppression in disregard of the aspiration and desire of the fellow countrymen. No one would consider it an exaggeration.    \r\n\r\n"

The DPRK cannot but take a serious view of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are going to provoke a war against the north by surprise while building up arms and staging war exercises in and around south Korea as they did in Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula is very strained. The U.S. imperialists do not want dialogue with the DPRK but seek to stifle it by strength at any cost. Since the U.S. has made this clear by its reckless saber-rattling these days, the DPRK is compelled to increase its military deterrent and take countermeasures for defending its sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increase of its nuclear deterrent by the DPRK is a legitimate self-defensive measure to cope with the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack and armed invasion against it. The U.S. dare not venture firing first at the DPRK as the latter has a powerful military deterrent. No one has the ground to take issue with the increase of military deterrent by the DPRK when the U.S. is hell bent on stifling it by a strong-arm military action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop its reckless act, clearly seeing the stance of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

He also gave instructions regarding the reconstruction of the cemetery on more than 80 occasions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the project was completed, he wrote \"Revolutionary Martyrs Cemetery\" on the board. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every year millions of local people, Koreans overseas and foreigners visit the cemetery to pay deep homage to anti-Japanese war hero Kim Jong Suk and other revolutionary martyrs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
