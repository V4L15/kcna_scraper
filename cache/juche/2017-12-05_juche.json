Once it is implemented, great advancement will be made in our activities for the Asia and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities and in the implementation of the human rights conventions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, our effort for this peaceful economic construction is faced with serious challenges. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sanctions imposed by the United States and its followers obstruct the enjoyment of human rights of our people in every way and encroach deep into the fields of activities for the protection of the persons with disabilities.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some countries under the strenuous pressure of the U.S. stopped the delivery of medical equipment and medicines for the maternal and infant health to our country and create indiscriminate difficulties even for the production of equipment, prosthesis and orthopedic tools for the persons with disabilities and the purchase of teaching aids and furnishings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We hold that the inhuman sanctions of all sorts that trample down on the humanitarian ideals and the principles of international human rights instruments cannot be justified with anything and they should be put to an end immediately and unconditionally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We reject politicization, selectivity and double standards in human rights and are also resolutely opposed to any attempt to use the human rights issues for ulterior political purposes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting discussed the future policy direction, effective ways of performance and others, along with the midpoint review of the Asia and Pacific Decade of Persons with Disabilities, essence of which was to ensure that the disabled can take part in all fields of social activities. And the relevant Beijing Declaration and plan of action were adopted there."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary on Disgraceful S. Korean Authorities\r\n Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- Which is the worst colony of modern version in the world and who is its \"master\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t The answer can be found in the recent meeting of the Joint Committee on \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) between the U.S. and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the meeting on SOFA which stipulated the status of the brigandish U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea, the U.S. refused to meet south Korea's demands at all over the discussed issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. denied opening of the contents of the meeting under the pretence of \"military secrets\" and turned down the issues of the reparation for the victims of the crimes committed by GIs and sharing burden for de-pollution of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' bases in south Korea, talking about \"intensifying preventive effort\" against GI crimes and the \"constructive discussion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a word, the meeting, which was run through with pressure and submission, proved that the relations between the U.S. and south Korea are master-servant relationship from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Koreans from all walks of life strongly denounce the humiliating behavior of the authorities who kept mum about the U.S. arbitrary practices at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the U.S. forces are present in not a few countries and regions and there are agreements on the status of forces. However, such slavery document can hardly be found in the world as the U.S.-south Korea SOFA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under this humiliating \"agreement\", the GIs present in south Korea have enjoyed extraterritorial privileges beyond imagination for more than half a century and the sufferings of south Koreans from it are untold.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical is the death of Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son, two schoolgirls of south Korea who were driven over by an armored car of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the pretence of \"military need\" the U.S. have installed in different parts of south Korea military bases and facilities at its will, turning the areas into a barren land. Furthermore, it has deprived south Korea of money running into astronomical figures every year, under the name of \"defence cost sharing\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea is suffering all sorts of humiliation and sacrifice under the slavery \"agreement\" in the present era of independence. This is a disgrace and insult to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean authorities bragged that they would talk something necessary to the U.S. But now they keep mum in bad shape at over such issues related to the life and safety of people as reparation for victims of GI crimes and cost for de-pollution. Until when does south Korea suffer such disgrace?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more shameful is that the south Korean authorities advertise about \"joint efforts for the strengthened alliance\" though they got a cold reception at the meeting.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are pro-U.S. sycophantic lackeys without an iota of soul of the nation as they turn away their face from the reality, in which the aggressors legitimately commit inhumane evils under SOFA, and beg for \"alliance\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the mindset of the south Korean public to abrogate the humiliating unequal \"agreement\" and drive the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, root cause of misfortune and sufferings, out of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clearly understand the demand of candlelight demonstrators desirous of independence against the U.S., far from getting hell-bent on confrontation with the compatriots while begging for the permanent U.S. military presence."

And they are now again engaged in the largest-ever combined air exercises with the involvement of warplanes including B-1B and stealth fighters. The fact serves as clear evidence that they have carefully made preliminary arrangements for provoking a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the U.S. imperialist warmongers' extremely reckless war hysteria, a grave situation is prevailing in the Korean peninsula that a nuclear war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The stern reality clearly shows that the U.S. is a mastermind of tension in the peninsula and a harasser of global peace and the U.S. imperialists remain unchanged in their scheme to stifle the DPRK by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such reckless war moves of the U.S. imperialists and the puppet warmongers will only accelerate their miserable end."

            "content": "ACNC insiste en abolicion del \"Acuerdo Administrativo\" EE.UU-Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 5 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Hace poco, tuvo lugar la reunion del comite conjunto EE.UU.-Sudcorea del \"Acuerdo sobre el Estatus de las Fuerzas\" (\"Acuerdo Administrativo\"), que estipula la posicion bandidesca de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ocasion, EE.UU. no acepto nada de las demandas de los titeres surcoreanos en cuanto a los problemas debatidos en la reunion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa parte norteamericana nego la exigencia de dar publicidad el contenido de la reunion con el pretexto del \"secreto militar\" y dio espaldas al problema de la indemnizacion a las victimas de crimenes cometidos por las tropas norteamericanas, la carga de gastos por la eliminacion de contaminacion ambiental en las bases militares norteamericanas y otros temas, hablando del fortalecimiento de los \"esfuerzos para prevenir\" los crimenes de los uniformados norteamericanos y de la \"consulta constructiva\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta reunion mostro una vez mas que las relaciones entre EE.UU. y el Sur de Corea son las entre dueno y sirviente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa arbitrariedad de EE.UU. y la humillacion del Sur de Corea provocan ahora la repulsion de distintos estratos surcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el mundo hay muchos paises y regiones donde estacionan las tropas norteamericanas y fueron firmados los tratados sobre su estacionamiento. Pero, es el unico el Sur de Corea donde existe el documento de esclavitud como \"Acuerdo Administrativo\" EE.UU.-Sudcorea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a tal \"acuerdo\", durante mas de un medio siglo las tropas yanquis ocupantes en el Sur de Corea disfrutan del privilegio extraterritorial, y al contrario, los habitantes surcoreanos sufren incontables desgracias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo testimonian el caso de las alumnas Sin Hyo Sun y Sim Mi Son, atropelladas por el carro blindado norteamericano, y otros incidentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBajo el pretexto de \"necesidades militares\", EE.UU. instala en cualquier lugar surcoreano las bases y establecimientos militares y convierte los solares ocupados en la tierra esteril. Bajo rotulo de la \"cuota para la defensa\", recoge cada ano una suma astronomica de dinero.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actual epoca aspirante a la independencia, el Sur de Corea paga con muchos sacrificios en virtud de tal \"acuerdo\", lo que es la verguenza y deshonra de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t?Hasta cuando sufriran tal ignominia las actuales autoridades surcoreanas, que antes fanfarroneaban que hablarian resueltamente \"No\" a EE.UU. y ahora estan desanimados sin decir nada en cuanto a los problemas relacionados con la seguridad de vida de la poblacion?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas absurdo es que los menospreciados titeres surcoreanos publican como si \"se lograran activamente los esfuerzos comunes para el fortalecimiento de la alianza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs lamentable el proceder de los traidores proyanquis surcoreanos que suplican la \"alianza\" a su patron norteamericano haciendo vista gorda a la realidad de que los agresores perpetran legalmente las atrocidades antieticos bajo el amparo del \"Acuerdo\" en cuestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa poblacion surcoreana exige abolir el documento humillante y desigual y expulsar a las tropas norteamericanas, origen de todas las desgracias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben prestar oidos a esa demanda, en vez de mendigar la ocupacion perenne de EE.UU. y recurrir freneticamente a la confrontacion fratricida."
