            "content": "Remarks of Spokesman for U.S. State Department under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the U.S. State Department recently cried that the U.S. had not withdrawn from the table the option including the use of strength, which was contradictory to the loud-mouthed words the U.S. is letting out to disguise itself as willing to solve peacefully the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK.\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious view of the remarks, considering they were uttered by an official figure speaking for the intention and stand of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dragging into light of day the real meaning of the \"landmark proposal\" laid by the U.S. before the 3rd round of the six-party talks, the analyst says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only too clear why the U.S. is persistently sticking to its robber-like demand for the DPRK to drop its nuclear program first, failing to show an affirmative response to the latter's proposal which indicates the only way to solve the nuclear issue by stages.\r\n The reality makes it clear that it has not given up its scheme to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK and there is no change at all in its policy to stifle the latter over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will be mistaken if the U.S. thinks the \"Libyan-style\" solution to the nuclear issue will work on the DPRK. It is becoming all the clearer that the U.S. is going to stifle the DPRK with strength at any cost, not giving up its hostile policy toward the latter. Such being the situation, it is only too natural for the Korean People's Army and people to fully prepare themselves to counter that. They have no alternative but to continue increasing their physical deterrent force needed for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its anachronistic hostile moves to stifle the DPRK, awakening from its foolish daydream. \r\n \r\n\r\n"

We will close the history of the U.S. forces' occupation and colonial rule over south Korea for the sake of peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop at once its arms buildup for a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 9 (KCNA) -- The Reunification Solidarity of south Korea reportedly called a press conference in front of the building of the \"government\" in Seoul on August 4 denouncing the authorities for hamstringing the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration.\r\n Speeches were made there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n O Jong Ryol, permanent chairman of the National Alliance for Democracy and Reunification, accused the \"government\" authorities of throwing a stumbling block in the way of reconciliation and cooperation between the south and the north as evidenced by their action to disallow the visit of the south side's non-government delegation to Pyongyang and invoking the anachronistic \"security law\" to label patriotic organizations including the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification \"enemy-benefiting organizations\" and intensify the crackdown upon pro-reunification patriotic figures. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Demanding the \"government\" stop at once the moves against reunification and the nation, he called upon all the patriotic forces to intensify the struggle for national unity so as to make the year 2005 marking the 60th anniversary of national liberation a year of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mun Kyong Sik, chairman of the south Korean Federation of Peasants Associations, said the authorities are putting spurs to the cooperation with outside forces while sending troops to Iraq for the purpose of strengthening the south Korea-U.S. alliance. History will never tolerate this, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An open letter to the authorities was read out at the conference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter strongly demanded the authorities stop all acts contrary to the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, opt for national cooperation, repeal the SL, an anti-reunification law, and immediately lift the \"enemy-benefiting\" label attached to patriotic organizations.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. New War Scenario under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 9 (KCNA) -- The U.S. bellicose forces in conspiracy with the south Korean military recently worked out a fresh \"operation plan 5027-04\" in which their previous war scenario against the DPRK has been put into specific perfect shape. Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary carried in this connection observes:\r\n The keynote of this four-phase operation plan is as follows: The \"combined forces\" consisting of 18 divisions of the U.S. forces present in south Korea and the south Korean army \"build a defense line\" on the western front before \"combined task units\" conduct \"operations for harassing the rear\" through \"air strikes at the areas of the north side.\" Then the U.S. third armored army corps is hurled into actions under the \"plan for reinforcing the U.S. forces in the wartime\" and, at the same time, they start \"full-dress northern expedition\" and the south Korea-U.S. \"combined marine corps\" land on the east and west coastal areas to form \"the second front\" and \"encircle and seize Pyongyang\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of this war scenario lies in that the operation plan involves blitz tactics of mobilizing ultra-modern military equipment and small armed forces, the Rumsfeld-style conception of war touted by the Bush regime. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What must not go unnoticed is that the U.S. imperialist warhawks are focusing this scenario on the \"operation for internally destabilizing\" the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists are seeking to achieve their aggressive aim to mount a surprise attack on the DPRK and conclude a war through blitz warfare. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is pushing forward in real earnest the relocation of its forces and their reduction and transfer of their bases in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. farce of \"reducing\" its forces is always followed by aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is massively introducing all types of up-to-date weapons and operational equipment into south Korea after drastically increasing the military spending of 11 billion U.S. dollars called for by the \"plan for bolstering its forces in south Korea to 13 billion. At the instigation of the U.S. imperialists, the south Korean military bellicose forces are hell-bent on the moves for confrontation and war with the north as evidenced by their drastic increase of military expenditure, madcap arms buildup and military provocations on the West Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bellicose elements had better stop acting rashly. Any mode of war will prove futile and the aggressors should not expect any mercy in face of the DPRK's war deterrent force it has built, pursuant to the Songun politics to reliably defend the peace and security on the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
