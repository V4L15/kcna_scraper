Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- A national workers' rally for the repeal of the bill on the retrogressive revision of the labor law on part-time job and for a legislation on the guarantee of rights was reportedly held on the University Street of Seoul on Oct. 10 with at least 15,000 workers attending.\r\n Speakers at the rally said if the government-introduced bill on \"dispatching workers\" which calls for overall expansion of the category of jobs to be occupied by dispatched workers and extension of their period is passed, the position of part-time workers will become more miserable and all of the regular workers will be reduced to part-time workers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon the workers to enter into a general strike to have the issue of part-timers solved and the workers' rights guaranteed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Representatives of public organizations including the co-representative of the Association of Women's Organizations of south Korea and the permanent representative of the National People's Solidarity in their speeches made at the rally held that the government-proposed retrogressive revision of the labor law on part-time job is not only an issue related to the part-timers but a social problem as it increases social inequality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They noted they could not but express astonishment at the government-introduced bill on expanding the above-said category of job in spite of the fact that 73 percent of all women workers are part-timers. They vowed to struggle to the last for the abolition of the part-time job in solidarity with the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions and the Federation of south Korean Trade Unions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution was adopted at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the rally, workers in various fields held meetings to resolve to conduct an all-out struggle in the remaining period of the year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Blasts S. Korea's \"Emergency Plan\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 15 (KCNA) -- It has been disclosed recently that the south Korean authorities worked out in secrecy such \"emergency plans\" as Chungmu 3300 and Chungmu 9000 to cope with the \"suddenly changed situation\" in the north and have steadily updated them, waiting for a chance to implement them. This sparked a big public furor.\r\n The authorities were reported to have called for coping with the situation and \"reunifying the country by absorption\" in the past. But it is the first time that the above-said fact has been disclosed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan is a strategy for confrontation with the north dating back to the Cold War era, a strategy which diametrically runs counter to the June 15 joint declaration, and an intolerable treacherous and anti-reunification criminal act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that the Ministry of Unification of south Korea has directly taken part in updating the plan calling for confrontation with the north even after the publication of the joint declaration in which the north and the south committed themselves to achieve reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such rowdyism as carrying daggers in their belts while paying lip-service to dialogue and cooperation clearly proves that they are challenging the system in the DPRK, taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the south Korean authorities are doing under the above-mentioned plan is nothing but a perfidy to their dialogue partner and a total negation of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their oft-repeated reconciliation and cooperation are, in the long run, no more than a fig-leaf to cover up the dangerous nature of their Cold War style confrontation strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not interested at all in the \"dialogue\" and \"cooperation\" touted by those who seek a sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean peninsula remains so tense that a new war may break out any moment due to the U.S. anti-DPRK racket over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is massively bolstering its forces present in south Korea to preempt a nuclear attack on the DPRK. It is also working hard to lay an international siege to the DPRK in a bid to force it to accept its demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is against this backdrop that the south Korean authorities are joining the U.S. in implementing its hostile policy toward the DPRK. This behavior will only bring the holocaust of a war to the Korean peninsula and bring the inter-Korean relations back to those of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Socialism in the DPRK remains indestructible as it has been consolidated as firm as a rock thanks to a high degree of political and ideological awareness of the popular masses and their revolutionary zeal strong enough to meet all challenges of the imperialists, and it is invincible socialism under which the leader, the party and the masses are united in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the south Korean fanatic agitators of confrontation with the north may work to do harm to the DPRK, backed by the outsiders, this will get them nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should repeal the \"emergency plan\" without delay and make an unconditional apology to the DPRK, pondering over the grave impact it will have on the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely follow their future attitude and will take necessary countermeasures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n To establish the Juche character in accomplishing the cause of national reunification means that the Korean nation independently settles all the problems arising in the struggle to achieve the reunification of the country in conformity with the desire and interests of the nation, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to preserve the cause of independent reunification and lead it to victory it is imperative for the Korean nation to resolutely reject outside forces' interference in its internal affairs and independently resolve all the problems arising in achieving reunification by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe Korean nation should firmly establish the Juche character in accomplishing the cause of national reunification so as to meet foreign forces' aggressive and anti-reunification challenge and more dynamically push ahead with national reconciliation, unity and reunification process. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces are fundamentally contrary to the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. It is impossible to stop outsiders from interfering in and obstructing the cause of reunification and promote reconciliation, unity, cooperation and interchange between the north and the south as long as flunkeyism and dependence on foreign forces remain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of the Juche character makes it possible to put an end to flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders. The united struggle of the Korean nation firmly armed with the Juche character is a decisive strength to do away with flunkeyism and the idea of depending on outsiders. Only when the Korean nation establishes the Juche character in the movement for reunification can it strengthen the driving force of reunification in every way, foil flunkeyism, dependence on foreign forces and anti-national pro-American cooperation and continue to step up the advance of the era of independence and reunification with the might of national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of the Juche character is the lifeline for the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should push aside all challenges to reunification by the might of Juche, the might of unity, and push forward the cause of independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Branding the DPRK's increase of military power for self-defence as \"proliferation of weapons of mass destruction\", the U.S. has called for an embargo on the export of goods for duel use. Not content with this, it is plugging other countries into its operation to realize an international blockade against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this fact, Rodong Sinmun Friday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has so far conducted ten joint naval exercises with armed forces of its satellite countries involved. The projected exercise is aimed to showcase \"international cooperation\" targeted against the DPRK and draw its neighboring countries into this move in a bid to escalate its policy to isolate and blockade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This exercise assumes more dangerous nature as it will be staged against the background of the increasing tension on the Korean peninsula. It will be an action of denying dialogue and wrecking peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks is not peace but escalating tension in Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula and the soon-to-be-staged exercise indicates that the U.S. imperialists' strategy to put military pressure on the DPRK and blockade and stifle it by force is inching close to the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK cannot but make a case of the Japanese authorities' move to host the exercise at the U.S. instigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such move is quite contrary to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration as the exercise is targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The use of force is not a monopoly of the U.S. and its allies. The army and people of the DPRK will remain on high alert and take a strong counteraction against the enemies' moves to isolate and blockade it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are also heinous flunkeyists and traitors who have viciously blocked independence, democracy and reunification in south Korea with the backing of the U.S. master, begged for the U.S. troops' permanent occupation of south Korea, slandered the DPRK and stubbornly opposed the abolition of the \"Security Law\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Never should it go unnoticed that the Grand National Party, which barely manages to live under the U.S. support and patronage, is taking an active part in the anti-national, anti-reunification acts, encouraged by the recent function arranged by its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The collusion among impure elements in the efforts to hurt the Korean nation is an act against the nation and history as it goes against the era of national independence, the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration.
