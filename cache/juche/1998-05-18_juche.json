Now socialist construction in our country requires a peaceful climate. The idea of our foreign policies stems from this requirement.\r\n   Friendship and solidarity among people advocating independence are vital to frustrating the imperialists' moves of aggression and war, ensuring independent progress of all countries and successfully promoting global independence.\r\n   Since the international reactionaries are trying with concerted efforts to divide and crush progressive nations and stamp out the cause of the independence of humankind, it is important for all the countries and people across the world to strengthen friendship and solidarity in advocating independence.\r\n   We will make efforts to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with socialist and non-aligned countries on the principle of independence. We will also develop good relations with capitalist countries that respect the sovereignty of our country.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today dedicates a signed article to the 18th anniversary of the Kwangju popular uprising in South Korea.\r\n   The author of the article says:\r\n   The uprising teaches South Korean people a valuable lesson that if they are to defeat armed enemies, they should firmly rally fighting ranks in an organisational way, join hand with each other and conduct a resolute joint struggle under unified command in all parts of South Korea.\r\n   Since the uprising, South Korean people have struggled for independence, democracy and reunification under the banner of anti-U.S. independence. However, their national dignity and freedom are still violated by outside forces as 18 years ago.\r\n   As long as the U.S. military occupation of and colonial rule over South Korea continue, the South Korean people cannot enjoy genuine independent rights and democratic liberty nor can the reunification of the country be achieved.\r\n   The South Korean puppets try to curry favour with their masters and prolong their power under their patronage by leaving the half of the country to outside forces as their colony and ruthlessly suppressing the popular movement for independence, democracy and reunification.\r\n   Realities require the South Korean people to valiantly fight for independence, democracy and reunification, inheriting the indomitable spirit of the heroic Kwangju uprisers. National independence, democracy and reunification are their only way out. The South Korean students and people from all walks of life should closely unite under the banner of anti-U.S.  and anti-fascist democracy and resolutely fight to build a new life and society, independent, democratic and reunified.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Japan should have known it already.\r\n   Japan should calmly review its stand concerning DPRK-Japan relations and its diplomatic  stance towards the DPRK and draw a serious lesson, he said, and added:\r\n   If Japan continues such unprincipled, reckless and foolish  act, we will not contact with it for the sake of our dignity.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their main mission is to help pupils to participate in the organizational and after-school activities. Teachers are also involved in guidance work.\r\n   After school is over, various forms of meetings are organized to educate pupils on revolutionary principles. \r\n   Many pupils take part in arts and crafts, computer and other technical hobby group activities and still others in sports group activities in schoolchildren's palaces and halls built in Pyongyang and local areas. This helps them to expand the intellectual horizons and get more knowledge about science, technology, literature and arts and improve their physical fitness.\r\n   Pupils visit factories, enterprises and cooperative farms to entertain the working people inspiring them to make further efforts.\r\n   They also take part in massive drives to keep streets, villages and schools tidy.\r\n   Free access is allowed to well-equipped libraries set up in towns, counties and districts.\r\n   Children's union camps are available in every scenic spot. Pupils go camping at old battle fields and other revolutionary sites and sometimes go hiking to toughen their bodies and get more courage.\r\n   After-school activities are free of charge.\r\n   The future of Korean schoolchildren is bright, since they enjoy the benefits of the universal compulsory education system.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
