            "content": "Mt. Paektu\r\n  Tokyo, January 7 (KNS) - Mt. Paektu is on a lava plateau in the northern border region of the Korean peninsula. \r\n   It is 385 km from Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. It is the highest mountain in Korea and is 2,750 m above the sea level.\r\n   Mt. Paektu is known as the ancestral mountain and it is symbolic of the patriotism of the Korean people and it embodies the spirit of the nation. This is the historic cradle of the victorious 20-year-long anti-Japanese war organized and led by President Kim Il Sung. There are battle sites, guerrilla bases and secret camps used during this period and a log cabin where General Secretary Kim Jong Il was born.\r\n   Mt. Paektu is a volcanic caldera with a crater lake, which appears to have occurred one million years ago. Paektu may be translated literally as \"White Head\".\r\n   This name originates from the fact that the top of the mountain and its surroundings are covered with white pumice stones which originated from various volcanic eruptions. \r\n   The mountain belongs to the coldest zone on the Korean peninsula and the weather is prone to sudden changes. \r\n   The scenery of the four seasons can be seen in one place on the top of the mountain.\r\n   Various species of animals and plants are to be found here.\r\n   The plants include Rhododendron ( which bloom even in snow ), Ganoderma and another 200 species. Animals include Paektusan tiger, Martes zibellina Linnaeus, Hydropotes inermis Swinhoe and another 55 species and subspecies of 18 families in 6 orders.\r\n   Thus Mt. Paektu becomes not only the national but also international conservation zones. Mt. Paektu is one of the five noted mountains and eight beauty spots in Korea.\r\n   The landscape and weather conditions of the Mt. Paektu area benefit the people's health.\r\n   Low air-pressue on the high land improves the respiratory function.\r\n   Ultraviolet rays become strong as one goes up the mountain and the air is clear and fresh and the ion density is high.\r\n\r\n"

Herein lies the key to achieving the reunification in an independent way, smashing every anti-reunification move of the separatists within and without, the article says, and goes on:\r\n   Fellow countrymen from all walks of life in the north, the south and abroad are different in living environment and conditions, ideology, political view and religious belief, the standards of learning and property. However, they, as members of the nation, are the same in mind and will to love the country and the nation, value the dignity of the nation and give priority to the common interests of the nation.\r\n   There is neither reason nor condition for proletarians and men of property, atheists and believers, communists and nationalists not to get united, if they subordinate everything to the sacred cause common to the nation, that is reunification and independence of the country and prosperity and development of the reunified country.\r\n   The great unity of the nation is achieved and cemented not in words but in the course of joint action of the entire Koreans at home and abroad for pooling efforts and wisdom for national reunification.\r\n   It is possible to build up a strong driving force of reunification and successfully achieve the reunification of the country if workers, farmers, students, intellectuals, believers, national capitalists of conscience and all other Koreans at home and abroad who want reunification, promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests, organizationally unite, support and cooperate with each other and take concerted action, transcending differences in ideology, ideal and system.     \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n  Pyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- The Seoul-Pusan rapid transit railway project has drawn public criticism in South Korea.\r\n   The project is a political burlesque and a large-scale scandal of the ruling quarters for gaining popularity with taxes wrested from the people. It was one of the \"commitments\" made by the former \"President\" Roh Tae Woo in the \"Presidential election\" in 1987. The Roh saw to it that the project began without the general design in June 1992 when the tenure of his office was drawing to a close. \r\n   The design of the project was repeatedly changed by the rulers in their political interests.\r\n   Kim Young Sam used the project for his political purpose. As a result, the design was drastically revised twice and the date of opening to traffic was postponed six years and 11 months more than the first plan (late in 1998).\r\n   As of late august last year, five years and two months after the start, no more than 13.7 percent of the project was done. It is foreseen that if current speed continues, the project would take 50 years.  The changes of the design on 38 occasions including changes of railroad and construction are likely to cost two trillion won.    The number of fraudulent operations is nearly 3,000 and over 70 percent of the project has to be done again.    \r\n \r\n"

It portrays men of the Korean people's revolutionary army who heroically defended the red flag of the revolution in the spirit of devotedly safeguarding the leader and with ardent patriotism under the command of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   \"KAPF Writers\" portrays the miserable life of the main character Ri Chan and other colonial men of literature and art who entered \"KAPF\" with the ambition for the proletarian literature.\r\n   It also deals with the happy life of men of literature and art after the country was liberated. Through this, it impressively shows that only when there is the wise guidance of the leader can literature truly contribute to the cause of the working people for independence and can the destiny and future of the men of literature and art be ensured.\r\n   In the movie Ri Chan wrote the words of the immortal revolutionary hymn \"Song of General Kim Il Sung\" representing on a high ideological and artistic level the faith and will of the Korean people to follow the President, the hero of the nation who liberated the country, with ardent feelings of respect.\r\n   Also included in the films created last year were feature films \"chief secretary of the Taehongdan County Party Committee\" (three parts), \"Tranquil Forefront\",  \"19 Fighters of Mt. Paekyang\" and \"Request\".\r\n   Besides, last year saw creation of films including \"Devote Your Sincerity\", \"Son of the Seventh Regiment\" (two parts) and \"My Look To Be Seen in Distant Future\".   \"Devote Your Sincerity\" and \"Son of the Seventh Regiment\" show endeavours of main characters to train soldiers into loyal ones equipped with the traditional trait of army-people unity and the spirit of resolutely defending the leader.\r\n   \"My Look To Be Seen in Distant Future\" stresses that one should live a meaningful life so that he can recollect his past without remorse.\r\n   The documentary film \"World-Famous Peak\" impressively shows through beautiful landscapes that Jong Il Peak of Mt. Paektu is the time-honored place of the Juche revolution.\r\n   The scientific film \"Grand Paektu Range\" proves on the basis of scientific materials that Korea has a mountain range from ancestral Mt. Paektu to Mt. Jiri on the south coast.\r\n   Besides, many documentary and scientific films were released last year.    \r\n\r\n"
