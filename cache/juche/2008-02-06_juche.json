Paektu and by the mode of forced march in the course of hewing out the way of the unprecedentedly arduous and rigorous revolution together with President Kim Il Sung long ago. Kim Jong Il adorned the whole course of revolutionary leadership with ceaseless forced march. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He has continued making the forced march in the whole course of revolutionary leadership, deeply aware of his noble mission and confident that the harder he works, the richer and stronger the country becomes and the happier its people get. The immensely valuable tradition and wealth for the victory of the Juche revolution would be unthinkable without his tireless efforts and zeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the course of weathering out hardships and ordeals to remain loyal to the leader, the Korean people learned from his spirit of making a forced march, acquired such strong idea and faith as struggling the way he did and emerged heroes in creation who know nothing impossible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His history of the forced march is a precious history of struggle as he has worked exceptionally hard not merely for today but for the prosperity of the country and nation in the distant future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Love Future!\" is a slogan put up by him while making an endless forced march with a revolutionary view on life that one must live not merely for today but for future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This forced march is a continuation of the long journey of the forced march made by President Kim Il Sung all his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set out on the road of the revolution after making a firm pledge to glorify Korea true to the intention of the President and has since carried out the forced march for several decades to honor his pledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every day of his forced march was characterized by his profound love and devotion to the country, the revolution and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has always emerged victorious in the struggle with his indomitable will, reacting to the enemy's hard-line policy with the toughest stand with the fixed faith and grit that he who laughs last laughs longer by holding higher the red flag of the revolution whenever the situation got more difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An immensely rosy future is in store for the country thanks to the dynamic leadership of Kim Jong Il who has glorified sacred history of the Songun revolution with endless forced march.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Danger of Japan SDF's Participation in \"Anti-Terror War\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 5 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries have recently passed a new \"bill on special measures against terrorism\" through the House of Representatives under the pretext of \"cooperation in the anti-terror war\" though it had been voted down at the House of Councillors due to the rejection by opposition parties. This set the stage for putting the new law into force, legalizing the dispatch of the Maritime Self-Defence Force to the Indian Ocean and its involvement and cooperation in the U.S.-led \"anti-terror war.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Self-Defence Forces' participation in the \"anti-terror war\" means a prelude to the Japanese militarists' overseas invasion and a test military operation for actual war. Herein lie the reactionary nature and danger of the SDF warships' resumption of refueling operations overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By instituting a \"permanency law\" the Japanese reactionary ruling quarters seek to legally and rapidly dispatch huge troops of the SDF overseas irrespective of place and time. The SDF's theatre of military operations is extending to vast areas of Asia-Pacific and the Indian Ocean, going far beyond the boundary of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is working hard to bolster modern military strike means, while resuming the military activities of the SDF warships in the Indian Ocean and stepping up the moves to build a new missile shield. This is aimed at launching military operations for aggression in real earnest in these regions from a strategic point of view. The DPRK is its primary target. This is evidenced by the fact that the Japanese reactionaries have recently deployed \"Aegis\" destroyer \"Kongo\" in the Sasebo base close to the DPRK in the wake of its test-firing of an interceptor missile, while driving the DPRK-Japan hostile relations into an extreme phase. The Japanese militarists are set to launch operations to conquer Asia and the rest of the world with their reinvasion of Korea as a starting point.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that now Japan has become the root cause of threatening peace and stability in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to remove the root cause of war before it is too late.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Through this, it seeks to make a more effective use of the bomber for carrying out its strategy for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite obvious that the U.S. development and possession of such long-range strategic bombers of new generation would make it possible for the U.S. to gain a military control over all parts of the earth including the possible launch of nuclear attack on any region of the world from its mainland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that the new strategic forces now being built up by the U.S. with so much effort would make the major hotspots and strategically important strongholds of the world their operational theatres and targets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. massive deployment of such unmanned planes, F-22s and F-35s in the Pacific hints that the U.S. Air Force's future strategy is to beef up its forces in Asia-Pacific including the Korean Peninsula. The above-said new bombers will also serve this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-mentioned U.S. strategy would only disturb the peace and stability in the region and escalate the military confrontation and spark off serious military clashes in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be chiefly to blame for the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
