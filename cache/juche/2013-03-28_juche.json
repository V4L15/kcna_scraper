            "content": "CPRK Spokesman Issues Statement\r\nPyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) on Thursday issued the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\tShortly ago, the U.S. and south Korean puppet group cooked up a \"joint plan to cope with the provocation of a local war,\" escalating the danger of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe joint plan signed by the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea and the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff of south Korea calls on the U.S. forces to automatically get involved in the conflict in case of the north's \"provocation of a local war\" and thus jointly counter it together with the south Korean puppet army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe plan for aggression elaborates on the contents of the operation and proposals on joint counteraction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this regard, the south Korean puppet group claims that a legal and institutional mechanism has been provided to ensure the U.S. forces' automatic involvement in the local war, the U.S. agreed with the principle on striking not only the base of provocations and supporting and commanding forces and that it has become possible to make a prompt and decisive counteraction against any provocation by the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these facts brought the U.S. hypocrisy to daylight and proved that the U.S. and south Korea are the root cause and chieftain of the provocation of a local war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said joint plan is a very dangerous document for invading the DPRK and an open declaration of a war of aggression against it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAny conflict on the Korean Peninsula will immediately lead to an all-out war and a nuclear war, not confined to a local war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Armistice Agreement, the north-south agreements on nonaggression and the joint declaration on denuclearization of the peninsula were totally nullified due to the grave provocations of the U.S. and the puppet group. Consequently, there is no  mechanism to deter a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWorse still, the U.S. and puppet warmongers are openly hatching sinister plots to bring down the statues of the great Generalissimos and monuments to them, symbols of the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. In order to counter these moves, the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army has already declared military actions against the U.S. mainland and the bases of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in Hawaii, Guam and the Pacific, to say nothing of the military targets and enemy ruling institutions in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHave the U.S. and puppet warmongers imagined what catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the \"joint plan for countering the provocation of a local war\" at this time?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are seriously mistaken if they try to threaten the DPRK with such farce.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hatred and resentment of the DPRK's army and people are running high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe signing of the plan will increase the justice of practical military actions of the DPRK which keeps not only Chongwadae in Seoul but the White House in Washington within the coordinates of high precision strikes. It is a foolish dream for the puppet group to seek a way out by clinging to coattails of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. nuclear umbrella will never help protect the puppet group as it will prove ineffective in face of the powerful nuclear strikes of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's army and people which launched a final sacred war to defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of its supreme leadership will make a clean sweep of the U.S., the ringleader of aggression, and the pro-U.S. puppet warmongers from the surface of the earth."

This sparks off a furor among south Koreans as it is an act little short of a modern version of slave trade.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are threatening with sexual harassment female \"defectors from the north\" to hustle money from them. This proves the nature of those who have taken the lead in the abduction under the signboards of \"freedom\" and \"human rights\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey have often been treated coldly in neighboring countries with the label of \"objects who are subject to non-application for entry\" attached.

uso pacifico del cosmos y conquistarlo es un justo derecho de todos los Estados soberanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, la prueba nuclear subterranea de la RPDC es una justa medida autodefensiva para defender la soberania del pais y la nacion y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana frente a las maniobras persistentes de EE.UU. y las fuerzas seguidoras para aislarla y aplastarla y a la amenaza nuclear mas abierta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs ilogico que EE.UU. puede realizar a su antojo la prueba nuclear, lanzar misiles y amenazar con las armas nucleares a otros, en tanto, la RPDC no puede realizarlos con fines pacificos y en el marco autodefensivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe mal en peor, aplicar la \"sancion\" bajo tal pretexto es una flagrante violacion a la soberania y la dignidad de un Estados soberano y un desafio a la ley internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es una demostracion de la naturaleza bandidesca de EE.UU. acostumbrado a aplastar con armas nucleares a otro que se le considera como un obstaculo en realizar su heguemonia mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos ejercicios militares conjuntos que se desarrollan con frenesi en el cielo, la tierra y el mar del Sur de Corea con la movilizacion de gran cantidad de los medios de ataque nuclear deviene el juego de fuego nuclear para exterminar a la nacion coreana al juzgar su caracter, dimension y contenido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor las maniobras imprudentes de EE.UU. y las fuerzas belicosas de la capa militar del Sur, fue invalido el Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea y todos los acuerdos de no agresion Norte-Sur fueron anulados, de manera que la Peninsula Coreana esta al borde de la guerra nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTraduciendo la voluntad de la nacion de frustrar rotundamente las imprudentes maniobras de guerra de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion del interior y exterior del pais y salvaguardar la paz, las tres Direcciones de la APRP declaran como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas belicosas de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea deben poner fin a sus ejercicios de guerra de agresion a la RPDC que imponen a la nacion coreana una catastrofe nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe conocer bien que las armas nucleares ya no son monopolio suyo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la situacion como ahora en que ambas partes beligerantes tienen armas nucleares, si volviera a estallarse la guerra en este suelo por el accidental choque militar, esto seria la guerra nuclear incomparable con la de la decada de 1950 y no estara salvo tampoco EE.UU. situado al otro lado del oceano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los coreanos aspirantes al futuro radiante de la nacion deben levantarse unanimemente en la lucha contra la imprudente campana del entrenamiento belico de agresion al Norte de Corea de EE.UU. y las fuerzas belicistas militares del Sur de Corea encaminada a devastar el territorio patrio e imponer desastres nucleares a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las fuerzas satelites tienen que retirar de inmediato la injusta \"resolucion de sancion\" de la ONU sobre el Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Peninsula Coreana son inaceptables los actos bandidescos como que EE.UU. fabricaba la \"resolucion de sancion\" abusando de la ONU y provocaba la guerra tomandola como pretexto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nacion coreana ya no es pais debil del pasado y esta tierra es diferente a los paises que sufrieron humillacion doblegandose ante la amenaza nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe ver exactamente la realidad y pedir disculpas por orquestar su farsa de \"sancion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que desarrollen con dinamismo todos los coreanos internos y externos del pais el movimiento masivo por concertar el tratado de paz este ano cuando se cumple 60 anos de la firma del Acuerdo de Armisticio de Corea!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa APRP exhorta ardientemente a todos los coreanos internos y externos del pais a desplegar fuertemente como movimiento pannacional variados actos comunes y actividades solidarias para extirpar de este suelo las fuerzas foraneas, causa de la guerra que continua la division de la nacion coreana e impone solo la desgracia y sufrimiento de toda indole, y demandar la concertacion del tratado de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpresamos la firme conviccion de que todos los partidos politicos, entidades y las personalidades de distintos estratos que aspiran a la paz y la reunificacion independiente del pais, enviaran el activo apoyo y la solidaridad con este llamamiento patriotico de la APRP."
