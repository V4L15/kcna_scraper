            "content": "Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il inspects statue, monument and hotel\r\nPyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Il, General Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, on Tuesday inspected a Statue of the President at Kim Il Sung Military University, a monument to his historical achievement at Mirim Airport and the newly built April 25 Hotel.\r\n   He first went to Kim Il Sung Military University to see the Statue of the President Kim Il Sung that had been erected on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   He looked round the statue, a monument and the wide education ground and expressed great satisfaction with the erection of the statue on the highest level.\r\n   He highly praised the teachers, cadets, soldiers and employees of the university for having successfully carried out the vast project in a short span of time.\r\n   He said the President will remain alive in the hearts of the Korean Army and people as he was a peerlessly brilliant commander who performed immortal exploits in building the army, firmly defended the sovereignty and dignity of the country and the nation and laid a firm military guarantee for the completion of the Juche revolution.\r\n   He gave the university important tasks.\r\n   He then inspected a monument to President Kim Il Sung's historical achievement built at Mirim Airport.\r\n   He recalled with deep emotion that Kim Il Sung visited the airport more than a hundred times and gave valuable instructions to strengthen the people's air force into an invincible force.\r\n   He said the President's great exploits are clearly recorded in the glorious history of the air force.\r\n   He called for conducting education briskly among servicemen and civilians through the monument which will hand down to posterity the President's immortal exploits for army-building.\r\n   He then went to the April 25 Hotel which was newly built on Mirim plain.\r\n   Looking round the interior and exterior of the hotel including a bedroom, a washroom, a dining hall and a kitchen, he learned how the hotel had been built. He highly praised soldiers and helpers for having built the hotel in a short span of time and contributed to demonstrating the potential and stamina of socialist Korea once again.\r\n   He said the construction of the hotel in a short span of time is a miracle that can be worked only by the heroic Korean People's Army (KPA) which is intensely loyal to the party. He added that the country will always remember the soldiers' heroic feats and proud achievements in socialist construction.\r\n   He called for equipping the hotel, an asset of eternal value for the army and people, with better facilities, planting many trees around the hotel, creating a pleasure park and providing those who stay in the hotel with good conditions for cultured life.\r\n   As many servicemen and civilians will use the hotel, they should be given best services, he said, and gave the hotel important tasks for its management and operation.    The Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission was accompanied by director of the General Political Department of the KPA Jo Myong Rok, chief of the general staff of the KPA Kim Yong Chun, Minister of the People's Armed Forces Kim Il Chol and general officers of the KPA. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Treacherous agreement must be abrogated\r\n Pyongyang, October 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a commentary on a \"fishing agreement\" the South Korean rulers signed with Japan.\r\n   The analyst of the paper says:\r\n   In the \"fishing agreement,\" the present South Korean regime, styling itself \"government for the people,\" failed to specify dominium over Tok Islet, part of our inviolable territory, and use its name. Worse still, it included the islet in the fishing zone under the joint control of South Korea and Japan.\r\n   This means that the South Korean rulers have abandoned dominium over Tok Islet.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries have employed every conceivable means to make the international community recognize that Tok Islet is a disputed zone for dominium and thus to deprive Korea of its territory and territorial waters.\r\n   By signing the fishing agreement, the South Korean rulers have given pledges to brigandish demands of the Japanese reactionaries.\r\n   What is the gravest of treacherous acts is to sell interests of the country and nation.\r\n   Nevertheless, the present South Korean rulers, in a bid to attain their dirty political ambition and enjoy personal prosperity, have sold  to their Japanese master even dominium over Tok Islet, and the territorial waters on which fishermen are staking their fate.\r\n   This shows that they are a group of traitors like \"five traitors of 1905\" who are interested only in their own interests, clean indifferent to the country and the nation.\r\n   They must abrogate the treacherous agreement, apologize to the nation for this and stop pro-Japanese flunkeyist and treacherous acts at once. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, Japan has neither condition nor ground to covet the islet.\r\n   The Korean people are enraged with the Japanese reactionaries  for trying to seize the inviolable territory of Korea, far from apologizing and compensating for their crime-woven past.\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare  to encroach on the inviolable territory of Korea, the Korean people will make them pay dearly for all the past and present crimes.\r\n   We do not play on words. \r\n\r\n \r\n"

Mun Ik Hwan, too, urged the release of Father Mun, a reunification prize winner.\r\n   Earlier, on September 23, the Taejon-South Chungchong Provincial Alliance for Democracy and National Reunification, through the paper Hangyore, called for a stop to repression of nongovernmental  reunification movement, the abrogation of the \"system of law observance oath\" and the unconditional release of all prisoners of conscience. \r\n\r\n"
