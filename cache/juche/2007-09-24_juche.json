And no outside forces can replace the Korean nation in accomplishing the cause of national reunification. The Korean nation with 5,000 year-long proud history of development is able to hew out its destiny with responsibility. It is a clear manifestation of the fact that the movement for national reunification has steadily developed, overcoming ordeals and difficulties caused by the vicious moves of the separatist forces at home and abroad against reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to prove that as the Korean nation is the very one responsible for national reunification,it comes to be the driving force of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the Korean nation's movement for national reunification is accompanied by the fierce struggle against the U.S. and its followers bent on the scheme to keep the Korean Peninsula permanently divided into two, it is essential for all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to unite. The decisive guarantee for the cause of national reunification lies in the great unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when the Korean nation flatly rejects the outside forces' interference and obstructions to the issue of national reunification and closely unites on the principle of national independence resolutely opposing flunkeyism and idea of dependence on outside forces, can it become the decisive force in the movement for reunification as the driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The entire Korean nation should firmly rally under the banner of \"By our nation itself\", the idea of national independence and great unity, to consolidate the driving force of national reunification in every way.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In that case the fallout of the war may extend not only to the Asia-Pacific region but also to all other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula is the region fraught with the greatest danger of war in the world. There is no legal and institutional mechanism for averting a war on the Korean Peninsula. The DPRK and the U.S. have been technically at war for several decades and it has reached a more dangerous phase due to the moves of the U.S. imperialists for war. \r\n The Korean Peninsula has become the primary target of the Japanese reactionaries' oversea aggression. The U. S. imperialists' means of nuclear strike are targeted on the DPRK round-the-clock and their nuclear war exercises are being escalated. In consequence, a nuclear war may break out on the peninsula any moment due to the moves of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is entirely thanks to the DPRK's peace-loving stand and its efforts to ensure peace that a war has not broken out in Korea and peace has been preserved there though the situation there remains so tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is striving hard to ensure durable peace in Korea, while frustrating all incessant moves of the imperialists for war, pursuant to its policy of giving importance to military affairs, the policy based on the philosophy on army that peace can be guaranteed with arms only, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anti-Reunification Moves under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 23 (KCNA) -- The Internet newspaper of Koreans in the U.S. \"Minjok Thongsin\" carried an article dedicated by an editor on September 19 denouncing outsiders and the sycophantic and treacherous forces of south Korea for their moves to disturb the holding of inter-Korean summit meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article dealt with all the more pronounced moves of the foreign forces and the sycophantic and treacherous forces of south Korea to check the holding of the summit with its approach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, John Bolton, former U.S. ambassador to the U.N., has gone so impudent as to meddle in the issue of the summit and some politicians of the U.S. emphasized the need to adjust the speed of the improvement of the inter-Korean ties and its war-like forces have spread all sorts of rumors to pull up the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan deliberately suppressed the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and Koreans in Japan while insistently pursuing its one-sided hostile policy toward the DPRK. It also turned down even the humanitarian demand of Chongryon to render aid to the DPRK to clear away the flood damage and impudently repeated the \"abduction issue\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Grand National Party of south Korea, a traitors' party, has become all the more vicious in its moves to openly oppose the summit and left no stone unturned to put a break on its holding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article called on all Koreans to shatter the anti-reunification moves of the outsiders and the sycophantic and treacherous forces of south Korea including the GNP, their followers, and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Entonces, la guerra se extendera inevitablemente a la region de Asia y el Pacifico, y las demas regiones del mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La Peninsula Coreana es la region que prena la mayor peligrosidad de la guerra en el mundo. En ella  no existe el mecanismo juridico e institucional para detener la guerra. Tambien, durante decenios esta peninsula se halla tecnicamente en el estado de guerra que se agrava mas por las recrudescentes maniobras de provocacion de la guerra de los imperialistas norteamericanos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios japoneses la toman como primer blanco de ataque en su agresion a ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Los medios de golpe nuclear de EE.UU. estan apuntados contra la RPDC y se menudean los ejercicios de guerra nuclear de aquel contra esta. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es posible que se desate a todo momento la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana por este imperio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Pese a esta situacion tirante se mantiene la paz en esta region gracias a  la posicion y los esfuerzos de la RPDC por la preservacion de la paz. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La RPDC, al practicar la politica de dar importancia a los asuntos militares basada en la filosofia segun la cual el fusil mantiene la paz, se esfuerza activamente por preservar la paz duradera de la Peninsula Coreana frustrando a cada paso las incesantes maniobras de agresion de los imperialistas.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
