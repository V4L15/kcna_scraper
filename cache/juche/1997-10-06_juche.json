The fiction of \"human rights issue\" is a fabrication of the south Korean against the north.\r\n   The human  rights of all people are guaranteed by law and not the slightest violation of them is allowed under the socialist system, which values humankind most.\r\n   In the DPRK the citizens substantially exercise genuine independent rights in all spheres of political, economic and cultural life and enjoy all possible rights including employment, food, clothing, housing, education and medical treatment.\r\n   This undeniable reality is admired by people around the world.\r\n   By raising a hue and cry over \"human rights issue of north Korea\" the south Korean  intend to conceal the serious human rights violations in south Korea and divert world attention elsewhere. Their sinister intention, however, can never be realised.\r\n   South Korea is notorious for human rights violations.\r\n   Now more than 70,000 guiltless people are subjected to political persecution in some 40 prisons. Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners, are undergoing psycological and physical sufferings, not allowed to return to the north where their kith and kin are waiting. The \"civilian\" regime mobilizes even the \"defence security command\" of the puppet army in surveillance over student movement, with a view to obliterating the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils.\r\n   They are a few examples of human rights violations in south Korea.\r\n   As for those who appeared at the \"press conference,\" they are human scum who fled to south Korea, abandoning their parents, wives and children, afraid of judicial punishment for their grave crimes such as \"embezzlement of public property\" and \"personal abuse.\" They are not qualified at all to talk about human rights. Through the anti-DPRK campaign with such renegades, the puppets will get nothing but criticism and scorn from the international community. \r\n   We issue a warning to some U.S. Forces against their encouragement to the south Korean puppets in inter-Korean confrontation and their conspiracy in the anti-DPRK campaign. \r\n   Their behavior will have a bad effect on the improvement of DPRK-U.S. ties.\r\n   The south Korean puppets must review their own serious human rights situation, rather than resort to the wornout false propaganda over human rights in the DPRK.\r\n   The dishonest forces of the U.S. must realise that conspiracy will result in an unpredictable situation.\r\n   We will watch their future attitude. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
