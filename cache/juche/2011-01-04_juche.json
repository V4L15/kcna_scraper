            "content": "Minju Joson rechaza la \"hoja de ruta\" publicada en Sur de Corea\r\nPyongyang, 4 de enero (ATCC) -- Hace poco, el Comite de Derechos Humanos del Sur de Corea publico la llamada \"hoja de ruta politica de tres etapas\" para \"mejorar la situacion de derechos humanos del Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\tEsa \"hoja de ruta\" toma por su meta inmediata \"erradicar la violacion de DDHH\" por alguien hasta el ano 2012 y consiste en establecer hasta el 2015 el \"sistema de proteccion de DDHH\" y promover a la larga la \"fundacion de un aparato de DDHH y la independencia del poder judicial\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun ella, la oficina del premier titere surcoreano se hara cargo del \"problema de DDHH del Norte\" y lo ventilara en la opinion publica internacional al organizar un mecanismo de consulta de que formen parte los embajadores extranjeros en Seul. Igualmente, se brindara ayuda a las entidades de DDHH y se reanudaran la radiodifusion y el lanzamiento de volantes contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el rotativo Minju Joson publico hoy un comentario individual, que senala en particular:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, la administracion titere surcoreana calumniaba a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea por conducto de unos fulanos y menganos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY ahora quiere lanzar la campana de DDHH anti-RPDC dando directamente su cara. Este hecho revela que la banda de conservadores surcoreanos esta enloquecida a mas no poder por el enfrentamiento fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos no tienen cara para cuestionar el estado de derechos humanos de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de tomar el poder, violaron flagrantemente los derechos humanos de los habitantes. Por ejemplo, ordenaron a los policias armados usar la violencia y asesinar al fuego a los moradores que protestaban el desalojo forzado de sus hogares en pleno invierno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, estallo un gran escandalo politico al revelarse que la oficina del premier titere surcoreano investigo en secreto a los civiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el Comite titere de Derechos Humanos se dedica a censurar a los connacionales haciendo vista gorda del serio problema de DDHH de su casa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la banda de conservadores tiene un poco de conciencia, debera reflexionar de su crimen de haber convertido el Sur de Corea en el infierno de DDHH y democracia y prestar debida atencion a la proteccion de DDHH de los habitantes surcoreanos."
