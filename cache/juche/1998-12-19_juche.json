Korean rulers' economic \"restructuring\" denounced\r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- The spokesman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea issued a statement on December 18 in connection with struggle of workers and people from all walks of life against the anti-popular labor policies pursued by the South Korean rulers under the manipulation of the U.S. imperialists.\r\n   The South Korean authorities and business conglomerates decided on and published  a \"program of restructuring\" of five conglomerates on December 7 under the pressure of the International Monetary Fund, which is led by the U.S.imperialists. And they are going to expand the \"restructuring\" to other businesses, which will result in massive layoffs.\r\n   Anti-U.S., anti-\"government\" rallies and demonstrations staged by labour organizations, workers, evacuated citizens and students are an eruption of pent-up resentment against the flunkeyist and treacherous moves of the rulers,  who have killed the economy. They are also a righteous struggle to retake the dignity of human being and the right to existence.\r\n   The present South Korean rulers have sold off factories, banks, buildings and even land to monopoly capitalists of the United States and other countries, crying for introduction of foreign capital which is ruinous to the economy. And they have ruined the economy with super-retrenchment policy, high interest policy and \"economic restructuring,\" bowing to the pressure of IMF.\r\n   The reality shows that the South Korean rulers are the traitors to the nation, who completely trample  down even the vital rights of workers and people, joining hands with outside forces, for maintenance of power and their enrichment and prosperity.\r\n   The only choice of the South Korean workers and people is to put an end to the domination of outside forces and the misrule of the rulers through indomitable struggle against the U.S. and \"government\". \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": " S. Korean historian on exploits of masters of historyWoman commander of Mt. Paektu\r\n Pyongyang, December 19 (KCNA) -- Choe Jin Song, a researcher of the South Korean Institute of Historical Affairs,  published a lengthy article on the noble feats performed by the peerlessly great men in formulating national history, according to radio Voice of National Salvation from Seoul.\r\n   He said:\r\n   North Korea named the ancient culture on the basin of the River Taedong centering on Pyongyang \"Taedonggang Culture.\" This is a great event in the five-thousand-year history of the nation.\r\n   In the article headlined \"as there are great men, history is set to rights\" he wrote about the energetic study and sacred feats of President Kim Il Sung, brilliant archaeologist and the greatest veteran of history, and the great leader Kim Jong Il, great master of history and genius of historical science.\r\n   The academic world of history is now acclaiming the discovery of \"Taedonggang Culture\" which holds a full-fledged place in the five major civilizations of the world, he said. With this naming  the \"theory of cultural transference,\"  which explains the development of the primitive culture on the Korean peninsula by extrinsic action  and finds the origin and native place of the founder of the nation in an alien country, has proved false.\r\n   According to the author's view, the history of the Korean nation,  which had been distorted and obliterated by the flunkeyist historians and reptile imperialist historians, has been corrected by the energetic study and outstanding leadership of the great veterans of true history.\r\n   The article continued:\r\n   President Kim Il Sung ascertained many relics and remains with his clairvoyant insight and scientific logic and corrected the position of \"great victory in Salsu\" no one had doubted for more than a thousand years. And he gave a scientific exposition of the date of building of the successive states of Korea including ancient Korea, Puyo, Paekje and Silla and personally found the mausoleum of King Tangun, the founder of the Korean nation, which had remained open to question.\r\n   The leader Kim Jong Il reformulated the logic of unification of three states by Silla which had been regarded as an established theory for 800 years, gave a new exposition of the territorial  unification by Koryo and made sure that Palhae, together with Silla, should be dealt with in the main system in delineating the history of the Korean nation from the late seventh century to the early tenth century. And he gave answers to important questions arising in the history of the nation as a whole including the question of the birth and formation of the nation, thus setting an example in the study of history based on the Juche view of history.\r\n   Thus,  they put to rights the five-thousand-year history of the Korean nation, a history which would  otherwise  have been buried in obscurity. They placed the history of the nation on the highest peak of the world history. They are indeed great teachers of history, great masters in the academic world  of human history and peerless patriots. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"

Paektu without an equal in history. \r\n   I see Korea, the country of generalissimo Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il vibrant with songs in the fluttering red flag of victory.\r\n   Indeed, Mt.

The Korean people and army will fight as they did in the anti-Japanese war and the Fatherland Liberation War so as to accomplish the historic cause of national reunification.\r\n   The anti-Japanese guerrilla war method is very instrumental in seizing the initiative in any situation, keeping the enemy on the defensive and dealing a telling blow at the enemy.\r\n   It proved its worth in the two wars against Japan and the U.S.\r\n   Although the Korean people's revolutionary army was not a regular army and had no backing of the state, it always seized the initiative in a lot of operations and battles against the one million-strong Kwantung army of the Japanese imperialists and liberated the country.\r\n   The war method also proved its great merit in the last Korean War in which the myth of the \"mightiness\" of the U.S. imperialists was shattered to smithereens and their \"history of victory\" came to an end.\r\n   The Korean People's Army (KPA) has powerful means of offensive and defense for a modern war. It has a Juche-based war method as well. Invincible is the KPA that has increased strike capacity  unlimitedly and practiced protean tactics.\r\n   The Korean war method proved successful in the two wars and has been very instrumental in defending the bulwark of socialism for decades. \r\n   Sooner or later, the U.S. will be aware of what the Korean War method is like. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n"
