It is frantically staging farces of the anti-reunification education slandering the system of the DPRK while inciting the inter-Korean confrontation among inhabitants of south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Ministry of Unification's distribution of extremely unsavory textbooks for \"unification education\" malignantly slandering the DPRK and beautifying the policy of confrontation towards the DPRK is another unpardonable provocation against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The gentry of the ministry filled the textbooks with phrases advocating extreme hatred for compatriots, confrontation of systems and \"unification through absorption\" after deleting all the expressions like \"partnership\", \"dialogue and relations of cooperation\" mentioned as regards the inter-Korean relations from them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group went the lengths of distorting facts about the June 25 war and the military clashes between the north and the south caused by them by describing them as \"southward invasion\" and \"provocations from the north\" and impudently hurting even the system in the DPRK and the dignity of its leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why, even those concerned with education in south Korea as well as broad public are becoming increasingly critical of new textbooks, terming them  \"guidelines for the education in the divided country\", not textbooks for \"unification education\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ministry is blustering that it would distribute the above-said textbooks among all primary, middle and secondary schools, libraries, educational and research institutions across south Korea to enforce such education among all the inhabitants. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These dastardly moves are lashing educationists and other people in the DPRK as well as all other Koreans into great fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe commission vehemently denounces the group of traitors for publishing such textbooks as another serious provocation against the DPRK, insult to sacred education and crimes against reunification, the nation and ethics as they reveal its sinister intention to win in the confrontation of systems.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Education is regarded as inviolable in any society as it is meant to teach justice, truth and scientific knowledge and bring up true social beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"unification education\" touted by the group is an unheard-of hideous move to falsify truth and stir up extreme hostility and consciousness of confrontation among compatriots in a bid to turn them into sworn enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What is more intolerable is that Minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek who claims to be a professor spearheaded the recent publication of textbooks. He instructed to completely rewrite textbooks from the viewpoint of confrontation despite strong public criticism and directly examined their contents. He made sure that such textbooks were printed in hundreds of thousands of copies and let the Ministry cover the expenses for their distribution on a priority basis, stunning the public. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These facts go to clearly prove that he is an anti-reunification confrontation maniac and a bete noire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History records such war criminals as Nazi Hitler who infused xenophobia and chauvinism into his people, hurling so many people of the world into shambles of the World War but does not know such immoral group as Hyon's gentry who stooped to such unethical acts against compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hideous provocations perpetrated by the puppet military warmongers are results of such anti-reunification education for confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said moves are nothing but last-ditch efforts of those thrown into the bottomless abyss of crisis by the total failure of their domestic and foreign policies, towering public grudge and people's criticism. They will only spark off denunciation and disillusion among the people at home and abroad and hasten their shameful destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors including Hyon who have no choice but to use even education related to the future of the nation, as a lever for escalating the confrontation with compatriots are bound to face a miserable fate, cursed and condemned by the nation."

Korea Urged to Withdraw from It \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Crimes released a statement Saturday on the lapse of 45 years since the south Korean puppet forces signed the humiliating \"Status of Forces Agreement\" (SOFA) with the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t The agreement concluded on July 9, 1966 is a document of slavery of modern version as it legalizes the presence of the U.S. imperialist forces for aggression in south Korea and connives at their arbitrary practices and crimes and grants limitless privilege and status to them in trial of criminals, use of land and facilities, taxes, immigration control, etc., the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the strength of this humiliating and unequal agreement the U.S. forces have committed all sorts of crimes including violence, plunder, murder and rape almost every day and lorded it over south Korea as a real ruler and extraterritorial entity for the last 45 years. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Still vivid in the memories of people are innumerable shuddering atrocities committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces. Among them are the incident in Tongduchon where a woman's hair was shaved, stunning the world, murder of Yun Kum I, the drop of bombs over Maehyang-ri and their killing of two middle schoolgirls by driving an armored car over them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recently disclosed burial of defoliant by the U.S. imperialist forces is another tragic product of their presence in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have committed all sorts of crimes, occupying south Korea for several decades but have not been punished at all under SOFA. On the contrary, they have become more arrogant. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are free from punishment even after south Koreans are killed with their grudge unsettled, looting their properties and devastating their land. There is nowhere to complain even when people are killed by GIs, the brutes. This is the reality of south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t SOFA is an unprecedented document proving that south Korea is a colony of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its existence is a shame not only on the south Koreans but on all other Koreans as it is a slave document of modern version.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Lee group of traitors is asking for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea while actively defending the agreement. It is offering the money collected from the people as taxes for the U.S. forces' upkeep while escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen as an executor of the U.S. aggression and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group's hideous sycophancy and treachery to serve the U.S. have lashed the nation into great fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality proves that the nation, to say nothing of the south Koreans, cannot escape pain and sufferings as long as SOFA and the U.S. imperialist aggression troops are allowed to remain in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The shackling SOFA should be immediately abolished and the U.S. troops pulled out of south Korea as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans who value the dignity and sovereignty of the nation should turn out in the patriotic and sacred war to sweep away die-hard pro-U.S. traitor Lee and drive the U.S. forces out of south Korea."

Pero, no reciben ningún castigo según el \"convenio de administración\", sino actúan con más arrogancia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ahora en el Sur de Corea no se cuestionan la matanza, el saqueo y la devastación territorial por parte de las tropas norteamericanas. Y los habitantes no pueden quejarse de sus sufrimientos injustos por bestias yanquis. Esto es la realidad del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrácticamente, el \"convenio de administración\" es un documento vendepatria sin precedente que muestra que el Sur de Corea es la colonia de EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa existencia de este documento es la ignominia de los habitantes surcoreanos y de toda la nación coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de esto, la banda del traidor Lee suplica la ocupación eterna de las tropas norteamericanas en el Sur de Corea protegiendo activamente este convenio,  y se entrega a la confrontación fratricida siguiendo a las maquinaciones bélicas agresivas de EE.UU. y sacrifican hasta el impuesto de los surcoreanos para mantener las tropas norteamericanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal acto proyanqui, servil y vendepatria de la banda de Lee provoca la indignación de toda la nación coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad muestra que si dejan intacto el \"convenio de administración\" Sur de Corea-EE.UU. y las tropas agresivas norteamericanas ocupantes de esta parte, los surcoreanos y toda la nación coreana no podrán evitar penalidades y desgracias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe abolir de inmediato el ignominioso \"convenio de administración\" y las tropas agresivas norteamericanas deben  ser retiradas cuanto antes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos surcoreanos, que aprecian la dignidad y la soberanía de la nación, deben levantarse con valentía en la sagrada lucha patriótica por aniquilar rotundamente la banda del traidor Lee y expulsar a las tropas yanquis ocupantes del territorio surcoreano."
