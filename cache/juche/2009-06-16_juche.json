            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves to Turn Japan into Military Power Slammed\r\n Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are now busy with the moves to have the exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" allowed, the \"three principles of arms export\" reexamined and  \"acquire the capability to attack enemy bases\" and study and develop a satellite aimed at gathering intelligence, etc. These developments are a vivid manifestation of the moves for turning Japan into a military giant that have reached a serious phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cites facts to prove that Japan has worked in real earnest to build offensive forces for reinvasion since the demise of the Cold War, openly revealing its militarist nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the sinister intention and strategic goal of the Japanese reactionaries to establish military hegemony after turning the land, seas and space into huge military bases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the fact that Japan is now keen to build up its offensive forces in a craftier manner, not content with having turned itself into a force of aggression and a war state equipped with the perfect modern offensive forces system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan at a meeting of the panel for the review of the defence policy changed the wording about \"enemy base\" made in its original proposal into \"a strategic base\" in a bid to prevent it from being interpreted as Japan's acquisition of its independent offensive capability. In other words, it changed the contents of the proposal to the effect that Japan wishes to acquire the capability to attack strategic bases under the Japan-U.S. cooperation system. This is a revelation of Japan's scenario for reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such change in the wording can never help alter the aggressive nature and true colors of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such jugglery as burying one's head in the sand like an ostrich can never work in the bright world today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries to speed up the beefing of modern armed forces under the pretext of \"coping with\" someone's \"military threat\" in an effort to convert Japan into a military giant and kick off reinvasion anytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is, however, as foolish an act as precipitating its self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to stop such suicidal act as jumping into the fire with faggots on its back."
