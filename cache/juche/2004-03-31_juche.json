At the hearing the director for Missile Defense of the Department \"praised\" Japan for its decision to introduce the MD developed by the U.S. in the fiscal 2004. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main purpose of the U.S. move to establish the MD is to neutralize other powers' military potentials including nuclear deterrent and establish an unchallenged position as the only superpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this strategic purpose the U.S. unilaterally pulled out of the ABM treaty defying the concern, denunciation and rebuff of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. administration has since sped up the establishment of the MD in real earnest. It is contemplating spending 9 billion U.S. dollars for the MD out of the budget for this year and 10.3 billion U.S. dollars next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is instigating Japan, Australia and other countries to simultaneously push ahead with the establishment of the MD in the Asia-Pacific region. This also requires a colossal amount of fund. The official of the U.S. Department of Defense praised Japan at the hearing as regards the introduction of the MD in the hope of attaining its aim with ease by use of funds and technology from other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While pushing ahead with the MD which requires an additional huge budget as well as military spending by other countries, the U.S. is still asserting that it is aimed to cope with the \"missile threat\" from north Korea. This is a clumsy behavior unsuitable for the superpower. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An unbroken chain of recent ballistic missile tests in different countries is by no means unrelated to the U.S. moves to establish the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. goes ahead with the MD in disregard of the warning of the international community, the world can never escape from the danger of proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and escalated nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A lot of U.S. missile bases in and around south Korea and Japan are posing a constant threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care about whether the U.S. establishes the MD or not. But it is a right to self-defence for the DPRK to counter it as long as the U.S. is persistently pulling up it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After declaring the doctrine of \"preemptive attack\" the U.S. is working hard to plug Japan into the establishment of the MD aimed at a military attack on the DPRK. It can never remain an onlooker to this move.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

The Japanese reactionaries seek to attain their criminal purpose by taking an active part in the U.S. \"international siege operation.\" Through the projected exercise the Japanese reactionaries seek to achieve this aim. It is the objective sought by Japan in the exercise to create an atmosphere of the U.S.-led international blockade against the DPRK and environment favorable for its reinvasion of Korea. \r\n It is nothing but a foolish daydream for Japan to invade the DPRK with the U.S. backing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to behave itself, bearing in mind that it will never escape its self-destruction if it continues running amuck like a newborn puppy knowing no fear of a tiger, availing itself of the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary as regards the close of the joint saber-rattling of the U.S. forces and the south Korean military.\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foal Eagle and RSOI turned out to be evermore dangerous plays with fire as they were staged at a time when the U.S. has been pushing ahead with disturbing military moves under the pretext of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' war maneuvers are an unpardonable challenge to the DPRK and the world peace-loving people desirous of a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has taken part in the Beijing six-way talks, talking about a \"peaceful settlement\" of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. But as seen above, it is keen on adventurous saber-rattling targeted against the dialogue partner under the signboards of dialogue and peace. It staged the provocative war maneuvers for aggression against the DPRK right after the six-way talks while paying lip-service to dialogue.

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n Giving full play to the national character is one of the basic factors of guaranteeing the existence and development of the country and the nation, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National character is a quality peculiar to a nation as it is a community whose members are united close because of the same blood, language, culture and territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The national character reflects the spirit of independence and cultural tradition of the nation and it serves as a precious boon to the country and the nation and an important wherewithal for socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialists are leaving no means untried to obliterate the national character of the people, regarding \"globalization\" and \"internationalization\" as an important means for realizing their ambition for domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a prerequisite to successfully stepping up the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation to give full play to the national character at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is possible to successfully build a great prosperous powerful nation of Juche only when the national character is preserved and given full play in all fields of politics, economy, ideology, culture and morality and more new advantages of the nation are created. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Giving full play to the national character at present serves as an important guarantee for achieving great national unity and national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are a proud homogenous nation as they have brought their history and culture spanning 5000 years into bloom and they are advantageous to others in wisdom, talent and resourcefulness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Korean nation unites on the basis of the national commonness and under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit, no foreign force can keep it divided. This is evidenced by the shining successes made in the movement for national reunification since the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas project the common feature of the nation that has carved out its brilliant history as a homogenous one in one and the same territory and unite on its basis, can they foil the war moves of the U.S.imperialists, defend peace and stability on the Korean peninsula and achieve prosperity common to the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In recent years it waged several wars of aggression against those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are stepping up preparations for a nuclear war against humankind. The U.S. nuclear blackmail and its moves to provoke a nuclear war are vicious criminal acts as they create a terror-ridden atmosphere in the international community and hinder the creative activities of people and the progress of history.

Weapons on Human Bodies\" in DPRK Disclosed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- Kang Pyong Sop and his family who are makers of false documents about the \"experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\" in the DPRK called a press conference at the People's Palace of Culture here Tuesday to clarify the truth behind the false report about this experiment in the DPRK released by media of south Korea and the West.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are five members in my family including myself, my wife, two sons and a daughter who is married. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The documents on \"experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\" widely misused by enemies were false documents fabricated by my first son Kang Song Guk, who defected to the south seven years ago, and my family, he said, disclosing the truth of the case before Korean and foreign journalists as the maker, observer and witness of those false documents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We received messages from our first son on several occasions, saying that he had caused many troubles to his parents and requesting us to meet him in China so that he could give us some money. So I crossed the border illegally with my wife on the 29th of August last year and met him in Yanji. And in early November I met my second son Song Hak there, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Song Guk said to his parents that if they would say that they had brought important information about \"the experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\" at a workshop in the February 8 Vinalon Complex where his father works, they would be given a huge sum of money by  human rights organizations in the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When I said the production of chemical weapons was unthinkable at my complex, my son told me that he would prepare documents, insisting that those human rights organizations in the south would simply believe that the complex is a chemical factory and may produce such things. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then Song Guk took several papers out of a cardboard box on which such letters as \"Certificate of Transfer\", \"name, sex, date of birth\", \"place of birth\" and \"place of residence\" are printed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then he asked me to recall the names of those who died in one or two years back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We wrote the name of Rim Chun Hwa, elder maternal cousin, on one paper. He worked as a farmer in Sinhung County, South Hamgyong Province and died of an illness. Names of four more people were written on separate papers though we knew nothing of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I told my son Song Guk that \"songmyong\" and \"saengnyonwolil\" (which means 'name' and 'date of birth' in the Korean translation of old Chinese characters) are not used in documents in the DPRK but 'irum' and 'nannal' (which means the same, but is a pure Korean language) are used. When I told him what was the use of making such false documents, he reproached me instead, saying that he would take care of everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that his handwriting would not do because they would easily recognize it. Then he asked me to write a few letters. As my handwriting looked bad, he asked his brother Song Hak, a university graduate, to copy it from a draft paper. He then took out a seal and an ink-pad from a box and stamped the false documents with a seal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When seeing that seal, I knew that the seal was a fake because the national emblem on the seal was not real. The mountain above the hydro-power station was not Mt. Paektu, but an ordinary mountain and there was only a dam without any generating house beside it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the real story about how false documents about the \"experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\" which we have never witnessed or heard of and which has never taken place came into being and were delivered to the south by Song Guk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fabrication of false documents was, in the long run, a criminal act that tarnished the image of the dignified DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kang Song Hak, who had been enticed into writing out the false documents, said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My brother said that we were doing it to make a large sum of money. But I think that it was a political farce orchestrated before we went to China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My brother was idle from his early years and did not like to study at all. It is hard to believe that such false documents were invented by my brother's head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I think that my brother was allured by some agents who sought to isolate and stifle the DPRK and tempted us to fabricate the false documents about the non-existent \"experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speaking of how the false documents were written, Song Hak said in the \"certificate of transfer\" in the name of Rim Chun Hwa, he put Rim's place of birth as \"Huinsil-dong, Sapho District, Hungnam City, South Hamgyong Province.\" But Sapho District is in Hamhung City, not Hungnam City. As I filled in what my elder brother dictated, I wrote down a wrong name which hardly be found among the administrative districts of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My elder brother waited for the sealed space of the papers to get completely dry before crumpling them and putting them in water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThen he took out and spread all the papers before drying them again. When I asked him why he was doing like that, he answered it was necessary to make any examiner to take them for real, not for false ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This was how I wrote the horrifying false documents on the DPRK's alleged \"experiment of chemical weapons on human bodies\" the kind of which the Nazi Germany committed against POWs during World War II and which I had only seen in movies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kang Song Hak then showed his handwriting to the journalists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Daughter Kang Hye Yong said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n My motherland showed leniency to my family for our frank confession of crimes, and allowed us to live together as before after we returned home. I've been hearing about and experiencing the benevolent and all-embracing politics of the Workers' Party of Korea and the Government of the DPRK time and again but I've never felt it so keenly and deeply as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I curse my eldest brother Kang Song Guk who betrayed not only his own family but his own motherland. I also hate those who instigated him to drive our family into such an abyss of sin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kang Pyong Sop's family asked journalists to disclose the truth of the mean trick of those trying to slander our dignified DPRK to the whole world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Warhawks' Projected Deployment of Aegis in East Sea of Korea Flayed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 30 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland in its information bulletin No. 864 on Tuesday bitterly denounced the U.S. warhawks's adventurous moves to deploy uptodate Aegis as a vicious challenge to the unanimous aspiration and desire of all the Koreans for peace of the country and its peaceful reunification and an open military provocation to the DPRK.\r\n The information bulletin said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently the U.S. announced that it would keep latest type destroyer Aegis equipped with uptodate missile interceptor system in the East Sea of Korea on a permanent basis from September under the pretext of coping with the \"ballistic missile attack\" from someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly indicates that the U.S. war scenario against the DPRK is being put into practice in real earnest at a final phase as it is a dangerous military provocation leading the situation on the Korean peninsula and in the region to the worst phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As this move has brought the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK aimed to stifle it by force of arms into bolder relief, the DPRK is left with no other option but to take a self-defensive step to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Strength is not a monopoly of the United States. It should act with discretion, clearly seeing who its opponent is, withdraw its aggression forces from the Korean peninsula at an early date and stop at once its moves to unleash a war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
