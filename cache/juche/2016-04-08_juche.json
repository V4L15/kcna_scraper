            "content": "Minju Joson Dismisses \"Provocation\" Touted by Obama as Height of Shamelessness\r\n Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Obama in an article contributed to the Washington Post in the run-up to the \"nuclear security summit\" claimed that the UN Security Council's \"additional sanctions\" against north Korea showed it has to pay a price for its \"provocation.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Friday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the U.S. and its allies that are real provocateurs bringing heavy clouds of a nuclear war to the Korean peninsula. However, Obama is vociferating about \"provocation\" by someone. It is the height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Humiliating self-restraint and concession lead to more horrible destruction and upheaval and a lot of people meet miserable deaths. This is the bloody lesson drawn by history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., the biggest nuclear weapons state and only user of A-bombs in the world, designated the DPRK as the target of preemptive nuclear attack and has steadily posed nuclear threats to it, watching for a chance to bring down it. Under this condition, for the KPA to counter it with a decisive preemptive nuclear strike in case there is the slightest sign of the enemy's movement is a legitimate exercise of the right to self-defence to protect security and peace of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already clarified, the DPRK will mobilize all the means including nuclear force and mercilessly punish the aggressors and provocateurs the moment they encroach upon the supreme interests and sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, and root out the very source of threats to its sovereignty and peace and security of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world will see how the service personnel and people united close around the supreme headquarters with one idea and purpose will emerge a winner in the decades-long standoff with the U.S."
