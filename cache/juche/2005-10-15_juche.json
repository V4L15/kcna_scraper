The U.S. should make a bold decision to take a practical measure for eradicating the last leftover of the Cold War from the Korean Peninsula.\r\n A delegate of the DPRK said this, addressing the meeting of the First Committee of the 60th U.N. General Assembly on Oct. 7.\r\n It still remains a pressing issue to prevent a nuclear arms race and denuclearize the world through nuclear disarmament and in order to realize substantial disarmament and ensure durable peace in the world it is necessary to analyze the present situation with a cool head and indicate right ways for it, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The DPRK will feel no need to keep even a single nuclear weapon only if the DPRK-U.S. relations are normalized and confidence is built between them and, accordingly, the former is no longer exposed to the latter's threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe DPRK sincerely approached the discussion at the recent fourth round of the six-way talks held in Beijing from its principled and fair and aboveboard stand and out of magnanimity in order to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, its avowed final goal, thus making it possible to meet all challenges and reach an agreement on the principle of the denuclearization in broad terms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is essential at present is for the U.S. to provide light water reactors (LWR) to the DPRK as early as possible as evidence proving its halt to the nuclear threat to the latter and its substantial recognition of the latter's right to nuclear activity for a peaceful purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is the DPRK's avowed final goal and it is its consistent stand to seek negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. The peninsula cannot be nuclear-free through the DPRK's abandonment of its nuclear weapons program alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will make every possible effort to clear the peninsula of the threat of foreign forces and ensure lasting peace in the future, too, he concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Their moves to emerge a military giant keen on overseas expansion arouse big apprehension and uneasiness among people in Asia and other parts of the world for their aggressive and dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are desperately pushing forward the arms build-up and the retrogressive revision of the constitution behind the scene while raising a hue and cry over \"military threat from north Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of Japan to become a military power and institute wartime laws are part of its moves to round off the preparations to reinvade the DPRK.\r\n The Japanese reactionaries claim that Japan may fight a war against north Korea and it would strike the heart of north Korea while amassing major units of the \"Self-defence Forces\" in western areas of the country close to Korea. This is little short of a declaration to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK and a military provocation. Japan's moves to grab Tok Islet have something in common with this and therefore they can be interpreted as a prelude to its reinvasion of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is working with bloodshot eyes to revive its colonial domination over Korea. The Japanese reactionaries' stepped up moves for reinvasion will only accelerate their isolation and destruction. The Japanese reactionaries should bear this in mind and roll back their hostile policy toward the DPRK and drop the ambition for invasion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are called upon to realize these three forms of cooperation. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a vital and essential task before the Korean nation to realize these forms of cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is a core issue in carving out the destiny of our nation and resolving the national issues. The national independence guarantees the dignity and rights, honor and happiness of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is a crucial matter related to the security of the Korean nation as it is the generally accepted idea of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Protecting peace from a war is a very urgent task before the Koreans who underwent horrible war disaster in the 1950s and have been exposed to the constant threat of war for many years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunification is the biggest task of the Korean nation. The Koreans desire reunification awake or asleep as they have undergone sufferings and misfortune resulting from the territorial division for more than 60 years. Reunification, indeed, represents patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism are main goals of struggle common to our nation and they are inseparably linked with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and reunification would be unthinkable without independence. Peace against war protects independence and is aimed at attaining reunification. Reunification is also designed to achieve national independence and lasting peace for the nation. Independence, peace and reunification are vital to the Korean nation and they are the national task to be fulfilled by the Koreans without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence, peace against war and reunification and patriotism can be achieved only when all Koreans go united close in their resolute struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans can successfully achieve whatever they wish only when these three forms of cooperation have been realized. They guarantee independence, peace and reunification and the successful implementation of the June 15 joint declaration, the article concludes.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
