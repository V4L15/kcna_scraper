Thanks to his Songun politics, he said, the Korean people will win a greater victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reggie Ranatunge, chairman of the Sri Lanka-People's Korea Friendship Association, noted that it is under the wise leadership of respected Kim Jong Il that the Korean people are giving full play to the might of Korean-style socialism without the slightest vacillation despite the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\r\n Trotsky Serano, international secretary of the Socialist Party-Ample Front of Ecuador who is president of the Canar Provincial Institute for Friendship and Solidarity with the DPRK of Ecuador, stated that Marshal Kim Jong Il has equipped himself with the personality and qualification of a leader of people from his childhood after he was born on Mt. Paektu and is respected and revered by the progressive humankind of the world as the genius of military affairs and a veteran statesman. The greatest one of his exploits is to pursue the Songun politics, said Serano.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary assailing Foreign Minister Aso and other ultra-right conservatives for letting loose recently a string of jargons whitewashing the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The voices blasting the unreasonable behavior of Japan are growing stronger in the world than ever before. Even the U.S. political circles and media are becoming critical of the Japanese right conservative politicians' frantic moves to whitewash the past crimes and revive militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's wrong attitude toward the history of aggression and its settlement proves that it does not want peace but aggression and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's ultra-right conservatives are keen to instill a militarist viewpoint on history and the spirit of revenge deep into the Japanese people and create a social atmosphere to stage a comeback to Korea. This is evidenced by Japan's reality.\r\n Japan has already rounded off its material, military and legal arrangements for overseas aggression. What remains to be done is to put its scenario for overseas aggression into practice. Korea is made its primary target. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is tampering with its criminal history of brigandish occupation of Korea and colonial domination over it, while persistently evading its responsibility for settling its past. It is working hard to grab Tok Islet and concentrically deploying the main forces of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in western Japan. All these moves clearly indicate that the Japanese militarists' moves for reinvasion of Korea have reached a reckless stage.\r\n No distortion can ever change history. It will remain unchanged despite the change of the era and the flow of the time.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a lesson of history that the defence of socialism means victory but the abandonment of it means death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conviction that only socialism enables people to defend their dignity and right, true life and happiness, and optimism that Korean-style socialism will make a long drive,--this is the revolutionary faith of our army and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of the U.S. imperialists to isolate and stifle Korean-style socialism are now becoming more vicious, but they cannot break the revolutionary faith of our army and people who regard socialism as their life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people will continue to make leaping progress and innovation in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation with the might of a revolutionary offensive, rallied close around Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a by-lined article.\r\n It is the intrinsic requirements of the movement for national reunification to struggle against the anti-reunification forces, the article notes, and goes on:\r\n The Korean people have waged a stubborn struggle for smashing the challenges and obstructions of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad in the whole course of the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea are a major obstacle to the patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity.\r\n The Koreans should regard the struggle against the anti-reunification forces as one of the major tasks before the three-point patriotic movement and wage an uncompromising struggle against the pro-U.S. conservative forces of south Korea opposed to national reconciliation and independent reunification. \r\n The movement of Koreans for national reunification has developed into an all-people movement for reunification and patriotism irrespective of differences in ideology, political view and religious faith under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can match the united strength of the nation.\r\n The pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea zealously toeing the hostile policy of the U.S. imperialists towards the DPRK have become extremely frantic in their moves to perpetuate the national division and escalate the confrontation among compatriots. This reality urgently requires the Korean people to wage a more dynamic struggle for smashing their machinations. The steadily advancing movement for reunification alone can contribute to achieving the cause of national independence. In this sense reunification requires a struggle and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Victory is always in store for the Korean people waging a dynamic struggle against the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Displayed there were over 10,000 pieces of art works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The standings were decided by the method of bringing together the opinions of visitors at the exhibition where gold prizes were awarded to the Korean paintings \"Lake Chon on Mt.
