            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Consultative Meeting of Officials in Fields of State Security and Foreign Affairs\r\nPyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- A consultative meeting of officials in the fields of state security and foreign affairs took place as regards the grave situation prevailing in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK), first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), convened the meeting and guided it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPresent at the meeting were Choe Ryong Hae, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA; Hyon Yong Chol, chief of the General Staff of the KPA; Kim Won Hong, minister of State Security; Pak To Chun and Kim Yong Il, secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK; Hong Sung Mu, vice department director of the C.C., the WPK; and Kim Kye Gwan, first vice-minister of Foreign Affairs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Jong Un received a report on the new situation and circumstances prevailing on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe successful launch of satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 was an exercise of a legitimate right of a sovereign state and it was recognized by even leading special organs of the U.S. However, a grave situation was created on the Korean Peninsula and in its vicinity due to the unprecedented anti-DPRK moves of the hostile forces which arbitrarily and provocatively fabricated the \"resolution\" of the UN Security Council on tightening sanctions against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSince April last year the DPRK has made every possible effort to prove the peaceful nature of the satellite launch; it ensured transparency, going beyond international practice, and chose the time when the situation was relatively peaceful for satellite launch, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the hostile forces deliberately denied the DPRK's right to satellite launch in a bid to use it  as a pretext for stifling it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and its allies took this high-handed hostile action in wanton violation of the sovereign state's independent right to develop space publicly recognized by international law. This indicates that the U.S. has reached its height in its anti-DPRK strategy to stand in confrontation with it to the last out of inveterate repugnancy and enmity towards the ideology and social system chosen by the people in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis has thrown a grave obstacle to the efforts to be focused by the DPRK on economic construction so that the people may not tighten their belts any longer on the basis of the war deterrence for self-defence provided by leader Kim Jong Il all his life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDifferent countries concerned made efforts to fairly solve the problem and prevent the deterioration of the situation. But, it became clear that there was limit to their ability, as they admitted. This fact proved once again that the DPRK should defend its sovereignty by itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt also became clear that there can be no denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula before the world has been denuclearized.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the consultative meeting Kim Jong Un expressed the firm resolution to take substantial and high-profile important state measures in view of the prevailing situation as the stand had already been clarified by the National Defence Commission and the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK through their statements that powerful physical countermeasures would be taken to defend the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country. He advanced specific tasks to the officials concerned."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Accused of Fabricating UN \"Resolution\" with Foreign Forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released the following statement on Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place another astonishing case. The U.S. and its followers cooked up a \"resolution on tightening sanctions\" at the UN Security Council by terming the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes an inter-continental ballistic missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fabrication of \"the resolution\" this time represents the height of the hostile policy toward the DPRK and moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK as it is the last-ditch efforts of the hostile forces displeased with the ever-increasing authority and national power of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean puppet group of traitors took the lead in fabricating the \"resolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 of the DPRK lifted off in December last year, the group desperately took issue with it, talking about \"provocation\" and \"blatant challenge\" against the international community. It worked hard to see the UN apply additional \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, vociferating about \"strong counteraction\" and \"tightened sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other mandarins of the south Korean regime visited theU.S., Japan and other neighboring countries to discuss \"close cooperation at the UN\" and asked them for their active participation in the moves for tightening \"sanctions against the north\". Not content with this, the south Korean group unhesitatingly submitted a \"proposal for additional sanctions against the north\" to the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the group which clamored for \"independent additional sanctions\" together with the U.S. and it is again the group which was the first to utter \"welcome\" and \"implementation of the resolution\" right after its fabrication at the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such hordes of traitors who worked with bloodshot eyes to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces as the south Korean group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The row kicked up by the group against the DPRK over its satellite launch is aimed to tarnish its image, save the face of the group that fell to the ground and deliver the anti-DPRK policy from its total bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group salvaged wreckages of the DPRK's carrier rocket Unha-3 from waters of the West Sea and was stunned by the high level of its technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As fellow countrymen the group should have been pleased with the great event to be recorded specially in the national history spanning five thousand years, the event which fully demonstrated the dignity and might of the nation. Nevertheless, it behaved so foolishly. This shows it is betenoire bereft of an iota of reason as human beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are greatly infuriated by the fabrication of the UN \"resolution\" by the U.S. and its allies and the group's desperate efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea vehemently rejects the UN \"resolution\" in the name of all the fellow countrymen, branding it as an unpardonable grave challenge to the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, at the same time, strongly condemns the reckless behavior of the group taking the lead in faking up the UN \"resolution\" in league with foreign forces as the most despicable act of treachery and an unbearable provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing grave situation the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea solemnly declares the following counter-measures against the south Korean puppet group, representing the towering anger and unanimous will of the army and the people of the DPRK and all other Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Now that the south Korean puppet conservative group is more desperately kicking up a racket against the DPRK over its nuclear and missile issues with the U.S., there will be no more discussion on denuclearization between the north and the south in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection, we declare complete nullification of the \"Joint Declaration on Denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula\" adopted in 1992 and its total invalidity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint declaration already proved a dead paper long ago due to the moves of the U.S. and the puppet group for a nuclear war against the north and their nuclear rackets against it. It is needless to say that there is no need for us to be bound to the declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. As long as the south Korean puppet group of traitors persistently pursues a hostile policy toward the DPRK, we will never negotiate with anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historical lesson shows that there is nothing to be solved when meeting with those who pursue confrontation with the DPRK and this will only bedevil the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should not think about any dialogue with us as long as it sticks to the policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. If the puppet group of traitors takes a direct part in the UN \"sanctions,\" the DPRK will take strong physical counter-measures against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Sanctions\" mean a war and a declaration of war against us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already declared that \"we would react to provocation with immediate retaliatory blows and a war of aggression with a great war of justice for national reunification.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group would be well advised to stop acting rashly, bearing in mind this warning served by us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All our service personnel and people will never allow the reckless confrontation moves of the group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who dare stand in the way of our just cause will never be able to escape deadly retaliatory blows."

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for All-out Action to Defend Country's Sovereignty\r\nPyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- It is the unshakable will of the Korean people to frustrate the hostile moves of the U.S. and its allies, dishonest forces against the DPRK and launch an all-out action to safeguard the sovereignty of the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\tRodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a bylined article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe UNSC should regard impartiality as its life and soul, but it openly adopted its \"resolution\" in gross violation of the sovereignty of the DPRK by playing into the hands of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. took issue with the DPRK's satellite launch, asserting that a rocket tipped with a satellite becomes a carrier rocket and a rocket tipped with a warhead becomes a missile. The world, however, clearly witnessed satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2, not a warhead, accurately put into orbit by carrier rocket Unha-3. This being a stark fact, the U.S. adamantly insists it was a test of a long-range missile launch though it recognized it. It is sadly mistaken if it thinks this brigandish logic will work in this bright world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK will not remain a passive onlooker to the infringement upon the sovereignty of the nation and the supreme interests of the country. Very just is the resolute stand taken by the DPRK under the situation where there exists neither the six-party talks nor the September 19 joint statement as the U.S. took the lead in encroaching upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, its allies are supporting it and the UNSC is getting hostile to the DPRK, bereft of impartiality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe prevailing situation requires the army and people of the DPRK to turn out as one in the all-out action to defend the sovereignty more precious than their lives and shatter the moves of the U.S. and other hostile forces to isolate and stifle the DPRK. It also clearly shows to what the DPRK should orient and subordinate the building of an economic giant, conquering of space and bolstering of war deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and its allies should be held wholly responsible for catastrophic consequences to be entailed by their reckless provocations against the DPRK, warns the article."
