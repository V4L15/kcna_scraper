He expressed satisfaction over the fact that its servicepersons are prizing and handling with care combat and technical equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Going round the cozy barracks and their compound, he praised the sub-unit for keeping its post in good order after sprucing up it well. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He made the rounds of an educational room, bedroom, a mess hall, a wash-cum-bath house and a daily provision store and other entertainment and educational and supply service facilities. No details escaped his attention ranging from beds of seamen to the processing of non-staple food and its storage and their tastes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He appreciated the efforts made by the commanding officers of the unit, pleased to learn that they have provided their soldiers with good living conditions, bearing deep in mind the teaching of President Kim Il Sung that the supply service precisely means a political work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Informed of the preparations for wintering by commanding officers of the sub-unit, he told them to make thoroughgoing measures for wintering so that the soldiers may spend the winter under warm conditions as cold weather is expected to come before long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to pay particular attention to the living of seamen as they are active in rough seas in all seasons, he said all the commanding officers should have warm love for the soldiers and take paternal care of them so that they might not feel even the slightest inconvenience in their living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the servicepersons of the sub-unit a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts before having a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su and Senior Vice Admiral Choe Pu Il and Ri Yong Chol, first vice department director of the C.C., the WPK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The House of Representatives of Japan approved another bill on extending the sanctions against the DPRK including a total ban on imports from the DPRK and embargo on DPRK-flagged ships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that it has not departed even a bit from the mean political mode whereby its preceding regime adopted it as a policy to slap sanctions on the DPRK, oft-repeating a trite stance that it can never take part in economic aid unless progress is made in settling the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As well known, the DPRK has taken practical measures for the denuclearization under an agreement adopted by the six parties and the countries concerned have sincerely honored their commitments under it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, it is only Japan which is throwing a hurdle in the way of the talks while evading the commitment it made at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said facts raise a question as to whether Japan is qualified to attend the six-party talks or not. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the calculation of the Japanese ultra-nationalists that they can secure a justification for militarization and nuclear weaponization by scuttling the six-party talks aimed at settling the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present Japanese Cabinet seems to be not in a position to make any decision to make a switchover in its foreign policy as it is under the strong pressure of ultra-right conservative forces at home. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's sanctions against the DPRK are quite contrary to the trend of the overall international situation and will only result in making the hostile relations between the DPRK and Japan further fester. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be a right option for Japan to drop its trite, hard-line and conservative approach toward the DPRK and thus swim with the trend of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the South-South cooperation is developed in all fields, it will be quite easy to neutralize the present unequal international economic system and build a new fair international economic order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people in the developing countries which won their independence have worked hard for social progress and national prosperity with common desire to realize independence. The commonness in past life, present desire and purpose of struggle provides a groundwork for the people in those countries to unite and boost the South-South cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The developing countries have enough conditions and possibilities for the South-South cooperation. If they boost economic cooperation and exchange useful technologies and experience with each other by making good use of their own economic potentials and possibilities, they can surely build self-supporting national economy and ensure their prosperous development and national prosperity without relaying on the West. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent stand of the DPRK to boost the South-South cooperation. Over the past years the DPRK government has paid deep attention to strengthening the cooperation and rendered disinterested support and exerted much effort while taking an active part in the activities of the Non-aligned Movement, G-77 and UN organizations. In this course, it has accumulated a wealth of experience and made signal achievements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK, as it committed at the Second South Summit, proposed cooperation projects in different fields for developing countries in Asia and Africa and has exerted efforts for their implementation this year as it did last year.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
