But this is nothing but a sinister intention to stage a new sabre rattling to stifle the DPRK under the signboard of the championships. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A good atmosphere of reconciliation, cooperation and peace is now prevailing on the Korean Peninsula thanks to the positive efforts on the part of the DPRK to warm the inter-Korean relations and contribute to the global peace and stability. Much upset by this, the U.S. has decided to reinforce its armed forces in South Korea under the pretext of \"surveillance\" during the world cup in a bid to turn the present situation in its favour at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite clear that its moves would not only create an atmosphere of confrontation and escalate the military confrontation between the north and the south to disturb the regional stability but have a baneful impact on the World Cup. \r\n The U.S. will be entirely to blame for this as it is keen on all high-handed and arbitrary practices to serve its interests only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is going in for peace, reconciliation and cooperation despite the complicated international situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to act with discretion, facing up to the present trend of the times.     \r\n\r\n"

It has long been seriously dealt with not only by the victimized countries but by different international organizations including the UN and non-governmental organizations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is because Japan's crimes were very serious slavery and war crimes against humanity as it wantonly violated the justice and morality of the international community and international laws by most wantonly infringing upon the rights of the Koreans and other Asian people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should apologize and settle all its crimes in view of their gravity and unethical nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, Japan is still working hard to justify, distort and cover up its past crimes, although over half a century has passed since the end of the war and the world has entered the second year of the new century, in a bid to keep those crimes buried in oblivion and evade an apology and compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is the fact that it has never made any sincere apology and compensation to the victims in the DPRK, the biggest victim of Japan, and its Korean victims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan refuses to repent of its inglorious past while seeking the leadership of the world. This is very abnormal which can never be pardoned by the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany made an official state apology for the war and paid more than 60 billion dollars to the countries and individuals that fell victim to its war crimes and is now taking additional measures for compensation. Not only Italy and other countries which followed Germany during the war but neutral and victor nations officially clarified their stand on wartime crimes and redeemed them according to responsibility for them. And this process is going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only Japan that is sidestepping the redress for its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis can not be construed otherwise than a total negation of its defeat in the war and the history of its aggression and crimes and a challenge to the need of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Japan's settlement of its past has become an international issue today, which reflects the desire of progressive humankind aspiring after peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to make a proper political decision as regards the issue, bearing deep in mind that a sincere apology and compensation for its past would be an important option for its benefit.    \r\n\r\n"

I will never forget it and take revenge upon Japan at any cost, she added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Philippine woman Julia Foras testified to the aftereffects of the sex slavery forced upon her by the Japanese imperialists when she was 13. She bitterly cursed the Japanese soldiers who reduced her to a cripple and Japan where their descendants live. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indonesian woman Mardiem recalled that her hope of becoming a stage actress in her girlhood was dashed by the Japanese imperialists' outrage. In order to force Japan to pay for it I will not die before I see that country apologizing for its wrongs and punishing the criminals, she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An Song Duk, victim of forced drafting, testified to the fact that he was forced to do slave labour at a communications equipment assembling factory in Inchon city when he was 15. I cannot forget the untold misfortune and sufferings the Koreans underwent even if Japan apologizes for them a thousand times, he added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hwang Jong Su recalled that he was forced to toil and moil in Otaru, Hokkaido, Japan, subjected to inhuman treatment and insult. He testified to the fact that a lot of young and middle-aged Koreans met grievous deaths there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n World media are giving wide coverage to their testimonies as they are a clear reminder of the Japanese imperialists' past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unpardonable are the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the last century.     \r\n\r\n"

He dreamed up a variety of cases such as \"plot to overthrow the state\" and \"spying case\" to punish and kill many democratic and patriotic figures, youth and students. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Early in the 1960s he sentenced those involved in the \"case of Minjok Daily\" to heavy penalties on unreasonable charges. He sentenced those involved in the arson attack on the \"American Cultural Centre\" in Pusan on March 18, 1982 to capital punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri is a guy with a vulgar view on etiquette and morality and a most corrupt man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He spent a staggering amount of ill-gotten money in each \"presidential election\" and \"national assembly election\" . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Terming Ri a foe of democracy, the nation and reunification and a top-class pro-U.S. and pro-Japanese sycophantic element bereft of morality and conscience, the article notes that the Korean nation will face nothing but misfortune as long as Ri is allowed to betray the nation and stand in the way of reunification, only seeking personal luxury and glory and power. \r\n    \r\n\r\n"
