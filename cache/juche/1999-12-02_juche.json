Korean venal paper's \"human rights\" rhetoric \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, December 2 (KCNA) -- The \"1st international meeting on human rights and refugees in North Korea\" reportedly opened at a university of South Korea on Wednesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The tricksters of the ultra right-wing venal paper \"Chosun Ilbo\", manipulated by the South Korean authorities, invited some anti-communist maniacs to the meeting from different countries and let them talk nonsense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a deceptive trick to cover up their despicable crimes and mislead public opinion only to be ridiculed by the world people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As is universally recognized, South Korea, a colony of the U.S., is the worst graveyard of human rights in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is illustrated by the recently disclosed killings of civilians committed by the U.S. aggressor forces during the past Korean War and their spraying of defoliant over areas along the Military Demarcation Line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities have kept behind bars for scores of years POWs of the Korean People's Army, who should have been repatriated to the north in accordance with the Korean Armistice Agreement and the international law. Not content with this, they still detain them in South Korea, refusing to send them back to their hometowns in the north. This inhumane act is inviting strong condemnation by the whole nation and humankind as it is an inexcusable crime against humanity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such being the situation, the \"international meeting\" on someone's \"\"human rights issue\" is under way in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a mockery and insult to human conscience and as shameless an act as a thief crying \"stop the thief\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is as clear as noonday that the \"human rights\" rhetoric made in such graveyard of human rights as South Korea is nothing but caws of a crow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    What merits serious attention as regards such a farce going on in South Korea is that the anti-communist venal paper Chosun Ilbo is taking the lead in never-ceasing anti-DPRK smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The venal paper, far from apologizing for its criminal anti-DPRK diatribe while functioning as the \"security planning board in charge of the press,\" keeps slandering the DPRK in the service of the \"intelligence service.\" It must be mindful that its anti-DPRK smear campaign will bring nothing good to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities engage themselves in the anti-DPRK smear campaign by use of Chosun Ilbo and through what they call \"international meeting.\" If they think they can escape from public denunciation of the criminal atrocities they have committed against the nation, they are seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They should make an apology for their crimes of worsening the inter-Korean relations and barring national reconciliation and unity and discontinue the mucky smear campaign at once. \r\n\r\n"

They manifested their positions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK side said its position concerning the DPRK-Japan relations is clear and remains unchanged. If Japan honestly apologizes and compensates for the immeasurable misfortunes and disasters it inflicted on the Korean people in the past and renounces its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the DPRK will make friendly approach to Japan, one of its neighbors, and then the abnormal relations between the two countries will be improved, it added. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese side expressed apology and repentance for Japan's colonial rule over Korea and said it is a major task to improve the relations between the two countries that have been abnormal since World War II. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese side manifested its position to put an end to the abnormal relations through negotiations without conditions and improve them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The WPK side said \"missile launch\" and \"abduction\" are words unfriendly and hostile toward the DPRK. The words do not sound good for the two peoples and will only aggravate their relations, it stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There are good examples of cooperation between the two countries in the settlement of humanitarian issues, the two sides noted, and called for settling such issues through negotiations between red cross organisations of the two countries in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The two sides emphasized that negotiations should begin soon to settle within this century the unhappy things that have occurred in this century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They had identical views that talks for diplomatic relations between the two countries should be resumed without delay so that bilateral relations may be improved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The talks proceeded in a sincere, good atmosphere. \r\n\r\n"
