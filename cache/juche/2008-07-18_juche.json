Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its talk about \"potential enemy\" and \"means to deter attack\" is nothing but sophism intended to hasten the modernization of nukes and the development of new type weapons, the article notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing concrete facts to prove that the U.S. is pushing forward the modernization of nukes behind the curtain of \"nuclear disarmament,\" the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is steadily developing and manufacturing new type nukes, while warning other countries not to develop and possess nukes. This is a gangster-like behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for sparking off a new Cold War and arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are working in real earnest to build missile shields, regarding a preemptive missile attack as the main thrust of its military strategy in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The increased spurs put by the U.S. to building missile shields and modernizing nukes and other military equipment would only compel other countries to take corresponding measures against them. Consequently, these moves will escalate the arms race and the danger of nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula is fraught with the greatest danger of a nuclear war in the world at present. The U.S. warlike forces are stepping up the production of latest type weapons while amassing war forces in the areas around the Korean Peninsula for the purpose of igniting another Korean war, with a hue and cry over the non-existent \"military threat\" from the DPRK. It is their strategic aim to ignite a nuclear war in Korea and escalate it into the areas around it in a bid to conquer Asia and realize its ambition for world domination. The U.S. has already made public its scenario for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK as a prelude to its nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces are getting frantic with arms race and nuclear arms buildup at a time when the world people are making positive efforts to create a peaceful environment. This is a blatant challenge to the desire of humankind for peace and an act of seriously threatening and disturbing world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their reckless arms buildup and moves for aggression are increasing the danger of war and putting peace, security and stability in the world at great peril. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to drop their foolish ambition to dominate the world with an upper-hand of strength and swim with the trend of the times towards peace and disarmament.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Peace and prosperity present themselves as historic tasks to be achieved without fail to accelerate the cause of the country's reunification and carve out a bright future of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group is keen to obliterate the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and stem the trend of the times towards independent reunification and peace and prosperity. Its treacherous and anti-reunification true colors have been fully revealed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that it is impossible to successfully usher in the new era of independent reunification and peace and prosperity as long as the Lee group hell bent on flunkeyism towards the U.S., anti-reunification acts and confrontation with compatriots is allowed to betray the nation any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Koreans are to implement the above-said slogan to the letter, they should intensify the nationwide struggle to smash the vicious anti-reunification acts of the Lee clique of traitors, first of all. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
