He branded the U.S. as the world's biggest nuclear criminal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Other speakers at the forum referred to the might of the DPRK which has defended and glorified its ideology and system, not yielding to the U.S. moves against it, and expressed their resolutions to conduct energetic actions for friendship and solidarity with the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A statement adopted at the forum assailed the U.S. for having pursued its hostile policy toward the DPRK in defiance of the desire of the Korean people for independence, peace and reunification, thus driving the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war. \r\n It expressed full support to the Korean people in their struggle to defend their ideology and system and build a great prosperous powerful nation under the banner of the Songun politics of leader Kim Jong Il and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country true to the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. \r\n Present there were delegates of 18 organizations of Philippines and anti-war peace activists from different countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A delegation of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with World People was present there on invitation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Outcries of Commander of U.S. Forces in S. Korea Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 2 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea was recently reported to have cried out for \"strengthening the posture to cope with the wartime situation.\" This indicates that the U.S. imperialists are invariably pursuing their wild ambition to launch military invasion of the DPRK as it was an open war agitation. Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary.\r\n By the \"posture to cope with the wartime situation\" he meant the readiness to launch the second Korean war, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well known that the U.S. forces in south Korea are nothing but a shock force and an advance party of the U.S. imperialists for invading the DPRK and, furthermore, for holding military supremacy in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' talk about \"cutback\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea and \"redeployment of forces\" is nothing but a charade aimed at concealing their aggressive aim. In recent years the U.S. has massively forward-deployed nuclear strike means and other war hardware in south Korea, Japan and other regions of Asia-Pacific. They are also busy with the moves to boost the operation commanding ability and the capability for preemptive strikes for a war of aggression against the DPRK. To this end they have staged madcap reckless military exercises in south Korea and in its vicinity in preparation for another Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are egging south Korea on to join in the moves to establish the missile defence system in a dangerous bid to launch military aggression against the DPRK. \r\n They are, at the same time, deliberately coiling up the tension on the Korean Peninsula to carry out their scenario for aggression. The U.S. loudmouthed \"dialogue\" is nothing but sophism intended to slacken the vigilance of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the U.S. bellicose forces dare launch aggression against the DPRK, its servicepersons and people will decisively beat back their invasion with tremendous war deterrence and firmly defend the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country. The U.S. would be well advised to cogitate about the serious consequences to be entailed by its military option against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
