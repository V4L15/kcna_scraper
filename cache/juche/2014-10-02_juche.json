She even cried out for passing the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\", which was not adopted for the past decade, at the puppet National Assembly session.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The racket over the \"north's nuclear program\" and \"human rights in the north\" kicked up by Park Geun Hye is no more than a struggle of a mentally deranged woman thrown into despair and a desperate bid of a criminal facing her miserable end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park seems to think that it is wisest to support her master's rhetoric about the \"human rights in the north\" in order to prolong her remaining days even by clinging to the dirty coattail of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She is resorting to the racket of \"human rights in the north\" in a bid to bury into oblivion the horrible human rights situation in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She should seriously think why the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" is rejected by south Koreans including the political circle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If she has even a bit of normal thinking faculty, she should face the harsh denunciation of the nation and keep her mouth shut even though she may not take necessary measures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  She was raised in Chongwadae watching her father taking to flunkeyism and submitting to big powers. After his father's tragic death she led an isolated life, away from ordinary people. So, she might know about \"human rights\" in the society where the rich gets ever richer and the poor ever poorer but she can never understand the genuine human rights in genuine society centered on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park is seriously mistaken if she thinks she can distort the truth and defy the just mindset of the people by making such coarse invectives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her ugly stream of invectives that she will settle the \"human rights issue in the north\" through \"cooperation with the international community\" is little short of an open declaration of her intention never to give up the ambition for \"unification through absorption\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should clearly face up to the reality, not forgetting even a moment that her short tongue can put her long neck at stake."

In the statement the committee denounced the south Korean puppet forces for seriously violating the north-south joint declarations and pushing the north-south ties into the worst catastrophe.\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obsessed by the anachronistic wild ambition for \"unification through absorption\", the Park Geun Hye group totally denied all the agreements reached between the north and the south and escalated confrontation with the fellow countrymen. Recently it groundlessly took issue with the nuclear program and \"human rights issue\" in the north at the UN, making a blatant challenge to the dignity and social system in the DPRK and glaringly revealing its despicable confrontational nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Acts of defying north-south declarations reflecting the unanimous will of the nation can never be pardoned and they are bound to face the most shameful ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration serve as the starting point and a cornerstone for the development of the north-south ties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park regime speaks out in public that it does not deny the north-south declarations but, in fact, it has totally denied and wantonly violated the declarations by peddling confrontational scenarios such as \"confidence-building process\" and \"Dresden declaration\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The implementation of the October 4 declaration will naturally lead to the solution of such issues as \"cooperation\" and \"building of groundwork\" much touted by the south Korean authorities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, they have persistently denied and turned their faces away from the implementation of the north-south declarations because they have pursued \"unification through absorption\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that the more desperately they undermine the foundation for the improvement of relations and make a mess of all the achievements made in the June 15 era of reunification and persist in the hotchpotch \"north policy\", the more clearly they will reveal their true colors as confrontation maniacs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park should mind that as the watchwords of \"no nukes, opening and 3 000 dollars\" put up by traitor Lee Myung Bak was branded as confrontational policy, her hideous \"north policy\" can also meet a miserable end, being rejected by the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Act of sycophantic treachery encroaching upon the fundamental requirements and interests of the nation will meet stern punishment by the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To move to settle the reunification issue by relying on outsiders is the most shameful act of sycophantic treachery today when the scramble over the Korean peninsula is getting fierce day by day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Park begged the U.S. to give support so that south Korea can make \"preparations for unification\", playing the coquette with the U.S. and took the unrealistic issue of \"world peace park\" even to the UN, asking for help. She is really wretched pro-U.S. stooge and traitor to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are not able to discuss the internal issue of the nation which should be solved with the north unless they get an approval of the U.S. and they can do nothing in the north-south relations without instructions of their master. Such a sycophantic attitude of submitting to the U.S. can not be found in any other part of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless joint military exercises with the U.S. which offer the Korean peninsula to serve the interests of outsiders must be put to an end at an early date.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An end should also be put to such despicable act of kowtowing to outsiders and soliciting them to escalate confrontation with the north.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will deal the heaviest blow to anyone who resorts to heinous hostile act of slandering its dignity and social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's hostile acts of doing harm to the fellow countrymen and stirring up confrontation have gone beyond the tolerance limit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon those who dare defame its dignity and social system, no matter who or where they might be, but deal the most merciless sledge-hammer blows to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not just pay lip-service to \"dialogue\" but immediately stop their own anti-DPRK reckless acts first and make the riff-raff stop such hostile acts as doing harm to and slandering the compatriots in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities continue taking the road of confrontation to challenge the aspiration of all Koreans for reunification as now, they will never be able to escape a miserable fate like traitor Lee Myung Bak who was cursed and punished by the nation for his vicious confrontation with the fellow countrymen in the north."
