Kim Jong Il praised by south Koreans \r\n Pyongyang, July 13 (KCNA) -- Members of the February 16 Fellowship Society Active in Pusan city saw a video show of a military parade held in Pyongyang in April and expressed reverence for Secretary Kim Jong Il, according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation quoting information of the Pusan City Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea.\r\n   A member of the society, Sonu Chol, said that the parade was a great political festival, which demonstrated the invincible might of the Korean People's Army, and no army in the world can match the army which has close ties of kinship with its Supreme Command.\r\n   This is why the united states, which styles itself the only superpower in the world, is bewildered before the north.    \r\n   It is the great honour of the Tangun Nation to hold Secretary Kim Jong Il, an extraordinary brilliant commander and a peerless hero, at the head of the nation, said members of the society. They hardened their resolution to hold the general in higher esteem and carry out his intention at the risk of their lives with a view to bringing earlier the historical day when they will welcome him in the square of reunification. \r\n\r\n"

Ham Suk Nyo, sister of Ham Se Hwan, and Kim Ryong Je, son of Kim Yong Thae, sent letters to Jimmy Carter, former President.\r\n   The letters said the United States, a Party to the Korean War, is responsible for the repatritation of the pows.\r\n   The daughters of Kim In So earnestly requested the Clintons to pay deep concern to the repatriation of their father.\r\n   They expressed the hope that the President and the First Lady will help their old father, who is now disabled after being kept in prison for more than 30 years, be sent back to the north so that he may live a happy life in his remaining years together with his daughters.\r\n   They also expressed the belief that Hillary Clinton, who enjoys high reputation for her activities for justice and the defense of human rights, will pay deep concern to his father's repatriation.\r\n   In letters to the congress leaders, they hoped that they will direct deep attention to the wanton violation of human rights of their father and other pows in south Korea. They also wanted them to bring up the issue for discussion among congressmen so that they may take a step for their father's repatriation as early as possible and honestly implement the U.S. obligation under the Korean armistice agreement.\r\n   In a letter to John Tilelli they said that as the man who signed the Korean Armistice Agreement was the then commander of the U.S. 8th army, he, from the historical point of view, is obliged to pay deep interest in the repatriation of the pows, which the 8th army commander left unsettled.\r\n   They hoped for his help, believing that if he make efforts for the repatriation of the pows, their father would be sent back to the north immediately without difficulties.\r\n   Ham Suk Nyo, in a letter to Jimmy Carter, said she hoped that the DPRK and the United States would discuss not only the repatriation of U.S. servicemen's remains but the repatriation of his father, a pow, to his hometown.\r\n   Kim Ryong Je hoped for Carter's assistance, convinced that he, who values humanitarianism and is active for world peace and security, will work hard for the repatriation of the pows, victims of the Cold War. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
