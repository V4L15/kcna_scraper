This was an epochal event which brought a fundamental turn in the history of the Cuban people, he noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the victory of the revolution the Cuban people have firmly defended the motherland, the revolution and the sovereignty of the country from the aggression, blockade and subversive activities and sabotage of the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries and dynamically pushed ahead with socialist construction, thus radically changing the appearance of the country, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We highly praise the party and the government of Cuba for having proclaimed the invariability of the socialist system and achieved many successes in various domains proving the advantages of socialism despite the ceaseless moves of the hostile forces to obliterate the revolution, and wholeheartedly wish the fraternal Cuban people greater success in their future work.    \r\n\r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Lesson Taught by This Year's Struggle for Peace and Reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 30 (KCNA) -- This year the Korean nation raised it as an urgent task of the nation to avert the danger of war and defend peace on the Korean peninsula and have waged a valiant struggle for its implementation. But the U.S. imperialists have persistently escalated their military moves, pushing the situation of the country to the brink of war for one year.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the United States to keep the Korean peninsula divided into the north and the south, and south Korea under the permanent occupation of its aggression forces and use it as a bridgehead from which to seize the whole peninsula and establish a domination over the vast area of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As part of its criminal moves the U.S., this year, too, ceaselessly perpetrated reckless military provocations, driving the situation on the Korean peninsula to an extreme phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEspecially, the U.S. imperialists vociferated about a \"military option\" against the DPRK over the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and worked hard to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts clearly prove that the U.S. is the principal disturber of peace and the root cause of a war on the Korean peninsula and the entire Korean nation is responsible for defending peace and preventing a war there. This, therefore, clearly indicates that there is only the confrontation between the Korean nation in the north and the south and the United States and it is impossible to achieve peace of the country or its independent reunification apart from an anti-U.S., anti-war struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a lesson taught by the struggle of the Korean nation for peace and reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both independent reunification and peace are for the sake of the Korean nation and it is the task before it to achieve them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and abroad, deeply conscious of their responsibility and role as the defenders of peace and the driving force for the independent reunification, should more vigorously turn out in the struggle against the U.S. and war in sky-high spirits.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

All the Buddhists in the north and the south should achieve reconciliation and unity and drive out the U.S. troops, the very one responsible for the nation's division, from south Korea, and defend and implement to the letter the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration in order to build on this land the paradise free from pain and full of happiness desired by Buddha, they stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the June 15 joint declaration is, indeed, a declaration of national independence which opened a new era of reconciliation and cooperation on this land which had been ridden with distrust and confrontation, they expressed their firm resolution to turn out more actively in the struggle to decisively  shatter the moves of the anti-reunification forces and implement the joint declaration by concerted efforts of all the fellow countrymen.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With noble civic consciousness they turned out as one in purchasing bonds, reposing their firm faith in socialism of Korean style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great progress has been also made in the economic and cultural construction this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The construction of large power stations including Ryesonggang Power Station, the Orangchon Power Station and Kumyagang Power Station made brisk headway. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A vigorous drive was waged at major industrial establishments to put the production on a normal footing and update the equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The land realignment projects in Pyongyang, South Phyongan Province and Nampho City and the Paekma-Cholsan waterway project made rapid progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Various beauty spots have been discovered and splendidly built. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n New successes have been made in the development of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The year also witnessed successes in the art and sports development to powerfully encourage the army and people of the DPRK in their efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the victories achieved by the army and people of the DPRK in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation are a brilliant fruition of the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
