It is, therefore, entirely just for the DPRK to steadily bolster its nuclear arsenal for self-defence in order to protect its ideology and system and the peace and stability in the region as it has already clarified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She would be well advised to give up such a foolish attempt to plug a third party into the U.S. move to put pressure on the DPRK, though  belatedly, properly understanding that no pressure can ever work on the DPRK. It is inconceivable for the DPRK to go out for the talks before it is delisted as \"an outpost of tyranny.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better behave realistically and wisely if it truly wishes to have the six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also omits the fact about the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army while describing the forcible drafting of Koreans as \"enlarged application of the labor and military conscription system\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book in its separate part headlined \"Japan Helped Korea in Its Modern History\" claimed that \"colonialization was helpful to Korea's modernization,\" while omitting the details of damage Korea suffered during the 1592-1598 Japanese invasion of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, a Japanese textbook for primary schools carries a picture of Tok Islet accompanied by an explanation of \"Takeshima (Tok Islet) over whose dominion Korea and Japan stand in confrontation\". In this part the book hypes this matter as \"an issue related to Japan's defence\" and \"an example of an infringement upon its sovereignty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that such textbooks are now being examined by the above-said ministry after being presented to it last year and its results are expected to be announced early next month, KBS added that the outcome will likely throw another serious obstacle to south Korea-Japan relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 16 (KCNA) -- The U.S. aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk anchored at Pusan Port on Monday to be involved in the U.S.-south Korea RSOI and Foal Eagle maneuvers.\r\n Along with it, cruisers, destroyers and other warships belonging to the flotilla sailed into south Korean ports in groups. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on Tuesday, which says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At a time when the situation is growing tenser over the nuclear issue, the United States has sent this notorious flotilla to south Korean ports in the wake of the announcement of its plan for the military exercises. This is another open military blackmail and an intolerable provocation against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current developments are evidently a prelude to a war against the north. This clearly proves once again that the U.S. call for \"a peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue and \"six-party talks\" are nothing but an empty talk and there is no change in its aggressive policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Leveling a gun at its dialogue partner in the wake of anchoring the aircraft flotilla at south Korean ports, the U.S. is crying for the six-party talks and trying to force the DPRK to \"abandon its nuclear program.\" Such high-handed and arrogant act fully reveals the aggressive colours of the Bush administration seeking to disarm the DPRK and vanquish it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. argues that there is no question in its \"policy of strength\" on the Korean Peninsula but the DPRK's war deterrent for self-defence is dangerous and should be called into question. This assertion will work nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must know clearly that the stick of strength is not almighty and it is not its monopoly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. persists in its moves for the provocation of a nuclear war, totally ignoring the unanimous demand of the DPRK and the global community for the renouncement of its hostile policy toward the DPRK, the latter has no alternative but to strengthen its nuclear deterrent, a treasured sword and shield for defending peace of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is entirely to blame for the failure to resume the six-party talks and the grave obstacle laid in the way of the solution of the nuclear issue between it and the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be well advised to withdraw the carrier flotilla from south Korea at once, give up the projected war maneuvers targeted against the DPRK and pull out its aggression forces at an early date, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by its reckless and dangerous war provocation moves against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should resolutely abandon their stand of toeing the U.S. line and of confrontation with the north, clearly mindful that the anti-north war exercises with the U.S. flotilla involved are a foolish act of bringing disaster to the nation and lifting an axe only to drop it on their own feet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
