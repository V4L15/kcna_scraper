In order to defend peace it is, therefore, necessary to throw overboard the ultra-right conservative forces including the GNP through the great alliance against the conservatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the patriotic people and progressive forces representing different circles in south Korea should turn out as one in the movement to achieve the great alliance against the conservatives for the purpose of defending peace on the Korean Peninsula decisive of their destiny, irrespective of political view, religious belief and ism, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

En adhesion activa a la politica de agresion de las fuerzas foraneas desatan la campana de confrontacion con la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea (RPDC) acarreando asi un nubarron de la guerra nuclear a la nacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Historicamente, los compinches de este partido quienes heredaron la idea de sus antepasados de obediencia a las grandes potencias y de confrontacion con la RPDC anteponen las fuerzas foraneas a la nacion y registran solo el expediente delictivo anti-RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La politica de sumision a EE.UU. del \"GPN\" deviene fuente del malentendido y la desconfianza entre el Norte y el Sur de Corea y obstaculo principal de la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y la unidad nacional. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La defensa de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana es una cuestion vital directamente relacionada con el destino de la nacion y para preservarla es preciso eliminar el \"GPN\" y otras fuerzas conservadoras ultraderechistas mediante la realizacion de la gran union anticonservadora. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los habitantes patrioticos y otras fuerzas progresistas de distintos sectores del Sur de Corea, por encima de las diferencias de criterio politico, creencia religiosa e insistencias, deben levantarse como un solo hombre en la realizacion de la gran union anticonservadora para la preservacion de la paz de la Peninsula Coreana que deviene cuestion vital para si mismos.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
