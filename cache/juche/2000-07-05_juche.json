This is not aimed to cope with any \"threat\" but round off their preparations for overseas invasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their moves for the conversion of Japan into a military power are intended to realize their ambition for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK is the first target of the Japanese reactionaries' overseas aggression.\r\n   The daredevil drill of pursuing \"mysterious ships\" being staged by them, while spreading the rumour of \"threat\" from the DPRK is nothing but a prelude to their invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to these  moves.    \r\n\r\n"

On this basis they chose over 30 high-yielding trees of them and grafted those trees before examining the results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This led to selecting and breeding six high-yielding species. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Per-hectare walnut yield of these species is seven or eight times that of an ordinary walnut tree. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They found white-seed pine-nut trees for the first time and succeeded in obtaining good-quality high-yeilding species by a new method of pine-nut bud-grafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The pine-nut yielding rate of the species is 1.5 times that of an ordinary one and the shell of white-seed pine-nut is 0.3 mm thiner than others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This method of grafting makes it possible to increase the rate of rooting to over 90 per cent and boost the propagation rate more than 10 times as compared with branch-grafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The researchers adapted big bamboo from tropical and subtropical areas to the climatic and soil conditions of Korea and improved its nutritive condition to change its metabolic form and strengthen its cold-resisting nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They studied and succeeded in fixing a proper time for bamboo cutting, and developing its new method, transplanting young bamboo and improving its species. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   New achievements have been introduced into cultivation of acacia for firewood to open a prospect of increasing per-hectare productivity.    \r\n\r\n"
