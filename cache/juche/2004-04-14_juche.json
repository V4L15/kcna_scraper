This dirty guy should have already faced a stern judgment by the south Korean people and have been eliminated from the political arena.\" It is, therefore, ridiculous and foolish for him to desperately work to restore his old position, beating the worn-out drum for confrontation with the north though the nation lives in a bright era after the publication of the June 15 declaration whereby it strives to achieve reunification by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The people from all walks of life in south Korea should severely punish through the \"election\" the U.S. and its henchmen who are working with bloodshot eyes to stem the trend of the national history toward independence, democracy and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Korea, Cradle of Humankind\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, April 13 (KCNA) -- Korea, which boasts of many picturesque rivers and mountains, is one of the several cradles of humankind in the world.\r\n It has been proved by many relics and remains belonging to the beginning period of humankind discovered in Pyongyang and other areas of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them are Komunmoru relics discovered in a grotto in Huku-ri of Sangwon County, Pyongyang. They, belonging to a million years ago, the early period of the Old Stone Age, are among the oldest primitive relics ever found in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The primitive stone implements and fossil animal bones found out there were proved to be remnants left behind by dawn men. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, fossil Paleolithic men called \"Hwadae Man\", \"Ryokpho Man\" and \"Tokchon Man\" were discovered in Soksong-ri of Hwadae County, North Hamgyong Province, Taehyon-dong of Ryokpho District, Pyongyang, and Tokchon City of South Phyongan Province respectively. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The relics belonging to the middle of the Paleolithic era or over 100,000 years ago were discovered in Kulpho-ri of Rason City. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are typical of those left behind by Paleolithic men. Fossils and relics of Neolithic men such as \"Sungrisan Man\", \"Mandal Man\" and \"Ryongkok Man\" were also unearthed in various areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts prove that the Korean peninsula is one of the areas where humans came into being and developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peninsula had a natural and geographical environment and climate favorable for the birth and development of humankind and a systematic process of the organic evolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though there were several glacial periods in the fourth geological age, the climate of Korea was rather mild as it was slightly affected by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The palaeozoological, spore and pollen analysis shows that there was not a radical change in the climate of Korea but only a change from subtropical climate to temperate one.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
