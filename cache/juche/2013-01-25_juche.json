He, at the same time, wisely led the work for consolidating the party cells in every period and at each stage of the party and the developing revolution and increasing its role in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The great leader Comrade Kim Jong Il paid deep attention to strengthening the party cells, regarding it as a fundamental issue in strengthening the whole party. He convened the Short Course of Secretaries of the Party Cells from across the country in May Juche 80 (1991) and sent to it his historic letter \"Let Us Strengthen Party Cells,\" clearly indicating the orientation and ways to turn all the party cells into those loyal to the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also convened the Meetings of Secretaries of Party Cells in March Juche 83 (1994) and October Juche 96 (2007) in order to bring about a radical turn in strengthening and developing the party and carrying out the cause of building a thriving socialist nation by firmly building all the party cells into vanguard organizations true to the Songun revolutionary leadership of the party and further enhancing their role. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dear respected Comrade Kim Jong Un, who is successfully carrying forward and developing the idea of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il on building the party and their feats, specified the original idea and line of strengthening and developing the WPK into Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's party which will be glorious forever. He took important steps for decisively raising the leadership ability and role of the party by strengthening all the party cells as demanded by the development of the party and revolution. He conferred on the secretaries of the party cells the valuable title of revolutionary soldier faithful to the party and scout who takes the lead in implementing the party's policies. He is wisely leading them to glorify the honor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the party faces the sacred tasks to brilliantly accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, the cause of building a thriving socialist nation rallied in single mind behind Kim Jong Un under the banner of great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the WPK decides as follows to make sure that the whole party is consolidated and a turning-point is made in building a thriving socialist nation by strengthening the party cells, basic organizations of the WPK and cornerstones propping it up, under the prevailing situation in which the struggle for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche is being waged on a new, higher stage: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The WPK will make it a rule to hold a meeting of secretaries of cells and convene it when necessary. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The meeting of secretaries of cells of the whole party to open on January 28, Juche 102 (2013) shall be called the Fourth Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the WPK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Short Course of Secretaries of Party Cells across the country held in May of Juche 80 (1991) shall be called the First Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the WPK, the Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the Whole Party held in March of Juche 83 (1994) the Second Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the WPK and the Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the Whole Party held in October of Juche 96 (2007) the Third Meeting of Secretaries of Cells of the WPK."

            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Accused of Fabricating UN \"Resolution\" with Foreign Forces\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea released the following statement on Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place another astonishing case. The U.S. and its followers cooked up a \"resolution on tightening sanctions\" at the UN Security Council by terming the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes an inter-continental ballistic missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The fabrication of \"the resolution\" this time represents the height of the hostile policy toward the DPRK and moves to escalate the confrontation with the DPRK as it is the last-ditch efforts of the hostile forces displeased with the ever-increasing authority and national power of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean puppet group of traitors took the lead in fabricating the \"resolution\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 of the DPRK lifted off in December last year, the group desperately took issue with it, talking about \"provocation\" and \"blatant challenge\" against the international community. It worked hard to see the UN apply additional \"sanctions\" against the DPRK, vociferating about \"strong counteraction\" and \"tightened sanctions\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade and other mandarins of the south Korean regime visited theU.S., Japan and other neighboring countries to discuss \"close cooperation at the UN\" and asked them for their active participation in the moves for tightening \"sanctions against the north\". Not content with this, the south Korean group unhesitatingly submitted a \"proposal for additional sanctions against the north\" to the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the group which clamored for \"independent additional sanctions\" together with the U.S. and it is again the group which was the first to utter \"welcome\" and \"implementation of the resolution\" right after its fabrication at the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world knows no such hordes of traitors who worked with bloodshot eyes to escalate the confrontation with fellow countrymen in league with foreign forces as the south Korean group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The row kicked up by the group against the DPRK over its satellite launch is aimed to tarnish its image, save the face of the group that fell to the ground and deliver the anti-DPRK policy from its total bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group salvaged wreckages of the DPRK's carrier rocket Unha-3 from waters of the West Sea and was stunned by the high level of its technology.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As fellow countrymen the group should have been pleased with the great event to be recorded specially in the national history spanning five thousand years, the event which fully demonstrated the dignity and might of the nation. Nevertheless, it behaved so foolishly. This shows it is betenoire bereft of an iota of reason as human beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are greatly infuriated by the fabrication of the UN \"resolution\" by the U.S. and its allies and the group's desperate efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea vehemently rejects the UN \"resolution\" in the name of all the fellow countrymen, branding it as an unpardonable grave challenge to the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK and the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, at the same time, strongly condemns the reckless behavior of the group taking the lead in faking up the UN \"resolution\" in league with foreign forces as the most despicable act of treachery and an unbearable provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing grave situation the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea solemnly declares the following counter-measures against the south Korean puppet group, representing the towering anger and unanimous will of the army and the people of the DPRK and all other Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Now that the south Korean puppet conservative group is more desperately kicking up a racket against the DPRK over its nuclear and missile issues with the U.S., there will be no more discussion on denuclearization between the north and the south in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In this connection, we declare complete nullification of the \"Joint Declaration on Denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula\" adopted in 1992 and its total invalidity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The joint declaration already proved a dead paper long ago due to the moves of the U.S. and the puppet group for a nuclear war against the north and their nuclear rackets against it. It is needless to say that there is no need for us to be bound to the declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. As long as the south Korean puppet group of traitors persistently pursues a hostile policy toward the DPRK, we will never negotiate with anyone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The historical lesson shows that there is nothing to be solved when meeting with those who pursue confrontation with the DPRK and this will only bedevil the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group should not think about any dialogue with us as long as it sticks to the policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. If the puppet group of traitors takes a direct part in the UN \"sanctions,\" the DPRK will take strong physical counter-measures against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Sanctions\" mean a war and a declaration of war against us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already declared that \"we would react to provocation with immediate retaliatory blows and a war of aggression with a great war of justice for national reunification.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group would be well advised to stop acting rashly, bearing in mind this warning served by us.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All our service personnel and people will never allow the reckless confrontation moves of the group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who dare stand in the way of our just cause will never be able to escape deadly retaliatory blows."

            "content": "Korean Peninsula's Denuclearization Becomes Impossible\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, January 25 (KCNA) -- The January 23 statement, released by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea in response to the \"resolution\" adopted by the UN Security Council at the initiative of the United States, said the DPRK drew a final conclusion that the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula is impossible.\n\t\t\t\t\t This has made invalid the September 19 Joint Statement, which was adopted at the six-party talks on the principle of respect for sovereignty and equality, signaling an end to the discussion on the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is entirely attributable to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK, which has been pursued before the nuclear issue in the Korean Peninsula came up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., which divided Korea into two after the Second World War, refused even to call the DPRK by its official name, to say nothing of the establishment of diplomatic relations, while opening diplomatic ties with socialist countries in Eastern Europe different from it in ideology and social system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK joined the UN in Juche 80 (1991) and established diplomatic relations with many countries. But the U.S. still refuses to recognize it as a sovereign state with whom it should co-exist in the international community, regarding it as a target to be removed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such hostile policy of the U.S. is clearly represented in maintaining the state of truce in the Korean Peninsula for more than a half century while persistently posing military threats to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Armistice Agreement, concluded on July 27, 1953, was a transitional measure aimed at withdrawing all foreign troops from the Korean Peninsula and ensuring permanent peace there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the U.S. intentionally chose to prolong the state of armistice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In November 1953, it defined as its ultimate goal to prevent the spread of communism into south Korea by turning it into a military ally while maintaining the armistice regime until \"pro-American unification\" is achieved on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, the U.S. deliberately ruptured the Geneva conference for a peaceful solution to the Korean issue in June 1954. It also turned down all peace proposals made by the DPRK government, including a proposal for conclusion of a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. and a proposal for replacing the armistice agreement with a peace accord.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile it has hurled latest military hardware into south Korea, including nuclear weapons, and carried on DPRK-targeted joint military exercises for scores of years under various names in line with such war scenarios as \"OPLAN 5029\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has restricted trade with the DPRK and imposed all sorts of economic sanctions on it under the pretexts that the DPRK threatens regional stability and does not cooperate with the U.S. in its \"anti-terrorism\" efforts and that it is not a nation based on the market economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A few days ago, it cooked up a \"resolution\" over the DPRK's satellite launch for peaceful purposes, calling for tightened sanctions against the country aimed at stifling its social system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It even practiced live shell firing with the DPRK flag as a target and steered the move to destroy statues of Kim Il Sung, eternal president of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The facts show that force, not words, is needed to cope with the U.S. hostile policy and that it was quite right for the DPRK to take the road of Songun (military-first), the road of independence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has already risen to be a full-fledged nuclear state and the day was gone when the U.S. threatened the former with nukes. The DPRK's access to nukes was due to the constant threats of the U.S., the world's biggest nuclear weapons state.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The self-defensive nuclear deterrent of the DPRK is instrumental to preventing a new war and ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula."

Sin embargo, el imperio la considero no como contraparte a coexistir en la misma sociedad internacional sino como objeto de eliminar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa politica hostil anti-RPDC del imperio se ha manifestado en el hecho de que continua  amenazando militarmente a la RPDC manteniendo mas de medio siglo el estado armisticio en la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acuerdo de armisticio de Corea, acordado en 27 de julio de 1953, fue la medida transitoria para retirar de la peninsula todos los ejercitos extranjeros y asegurar la paz  duradera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el imperio opto intencionalmente el camino de prolongar el estado de armisticio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. determino en noviembre de 1953 como meta final sobre Corea mantener el sistema de armisticio hasta que se logre la \"unificacion proyanqui\" y evitar la \"transformacion comunista\" de toda Corea al convertir al Sur de Corea en su \"aliado militar\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRompio premeditadamente en junio de 1954 la reunion de Ginebra para la solucion pacifica del problema de Corea y nego todos los proyectos propuestos por la RPDC tales como concertar el tratado de paz RPDC-EE.UU., la conversacion a 4 bandas por estructurar en la Peninsula Coreana el duradero sistema de paz y sustituir el acuerdo de armisticio por las conversaciones de paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIntrodujo en el territorio surcoreano modernos armamentos incluyendo las armas nucleares, trazo los planes de guerra coreana como \"OPLAN-5029\" tomando la RPDC como enemigo y despliega durante varios decenios los simulacros conjuntos para su realizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRestringe el comercio con la RPDC e intensifica la sancion economica bajo el vistoso rotulo de que la RPDC \"amenaza\" la estabilidad de la region, no coopera con el \"esfuerzo antiterrorista\" de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUltimamente, invento hasta la \"resolucion de sanciones\" para aplastar el regimen de la RPDC acusando hasta el lanzamiento de satelite con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPerpetro sin vacilacion alguna el tiroteo contra la bandera de la RPDC y comete los actos provocativos de manipular el complot para destruir las estatuas de bronce de los grandes hombres sin iguales del monte Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad muestra que se debe responder a la politica hostil anti-RPDC del imperio no con las palabras sino con las fuerzas y que es justo mil veces el camino de independencia y del Songun optado por nosotros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC ya se ha convertido en el digno pais poseedor de armas nuclear y desaparecio para siempre la epoca en que el imperio nos amenazaba con armas atomicas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pueblo coreano llego a tenerlas porque el imperio, mayor poseedor de armas nuclear en el mundo, se desespera para derrumbar la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl disuasivo nuclear independiente de la RPDC es arma omnipotente para prevenir la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana y defender fidedignamente la paz y la estabilidad."

Y cuando fue aprobada en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU la \"resolucion\" anti-RPDC, lo aplaudio antes que nadie e insiste en \"observar la resolucion\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este mundo no hay otras fuerzas como la banda traidora surcoreana que se entrega con frenesi a la confrontacion fratricida en connivencia con las fuerza extranjeras. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos cuestionan el lanzamiento de la unidad no. 2 del satelite \"Kwangmyongsong-3\" con el fin de manchar la imagen de la RPDC, mantener su prestigio deshonrado y seguir la politica conflictiva anti-RPDC en el fracaso total. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, ellos temen por el alto nivel tecnico de la RPDC tras averiguar los restos del cohete transportador \"Unha-3\" caidos en el Mar Oeste. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"resolucion\" de la ONU inventada por EE.UU. y sus fuerzas satelites y las maniobras de los titeres surcoreanos provocan una gran indignacion del ejercito y pueblo coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria califica de un grave desafio intolerable a la dignidad y soberania de la RPDC y al pueblo coreano la \"resolucion\" de la ONU aprobada por las fuerzas hostiles acusando de nuestro lanzamiento legitimo del satelite con fines pacificos, y la rechaza en nombre de toda la nacion coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, denuncia el proceder imprudente de la banda titere, que actuo freneticamente en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras por aprobar esa \"resolucion\", como crimen antinacional mas grosero y una provocacion imperdonable a la parte connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon respecto a la situacion grave, el CRPP aclara las siguientes contramedidas a la banda titere del Sur de Corea, reflejando la gran indignacion y la unanime voluntad de los militares y civiles de la RPDC y los demas integrantes de la nacion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Dado que la banda conservador surcoreana recurre mas que nunca junto con EE.UU. a la campana nuclear y de misiles anti-RPDC, no habra nunca en el futuro entre ambas partes coreanas el debate sobre la desnuclearizacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon respecto a esto, declaramos la invalidez total de la \"Declaracion conjunta sobre la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana\" aprobada en 1992. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEse documento quedo en letra muerta ya hace mucho tiempo por las maniobras de guerra nuclear y la campana nuclear anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y la banda titere, razon por la cual no tenemos la necesidad de restringirse por ello. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Mientras que la banda traidora surcoreana sigue recurriendo a la politica hostil anti- RPDC, no nos trataremos con nadie.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ensena la leccion historica, el tratamiento con los perseguidores del enfrentamiento anti-RPDC empeorara mas las relaciones intercoreanas sin resolver nada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no deben pensar en conversar con nosotros antes de renunciar su politica de confrontacion fratricida. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. En el caso de que la banda traidora surcoreana se incorpore directamente en la \"sancion\" de la ONU, se tomaran las fuertes contramedidas fisicas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"sancion\" es precisamente la guerra y la declaracion de guerra contra la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa hemos declarado que \"responderemos a la provocacion con el inmediato ataque de represalia, y a la guerra de agresion con la justa guerra por la reunificacion de la patria\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere debe actuar con prudencia teniendo presente nuestra advertencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos militares y civiles coreanos no perdonaran jamas sus imprudentes maniobras conflictivas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que se atrevan a atentar nuestra justa causa, no podran evadir nuestra fuerte venganza y el golpe demoledor."
