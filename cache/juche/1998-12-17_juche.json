Nor should they act like a \"giant\" insolent enough to provoke a war without hesitation.\r\n   If they do not want to make an irrevocable mistake, they should be mindful of this warning. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The film vividly shows  the spirit of devoted defence of the leader displayed by the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters and ties of kinship between the leader and his soldiers.\r\n   44 serials of the multi-part feature film \"the Nation and Destiny\", typical of Korean films, have been produced up to this year since the first serial was  created in Juche 81 (1992). Parts 9 through 11 of \"Working Class,\" serials of the film, deal with the heroic struggle of workers in Kangson and with careers of people who covered different paths of life.\r\n   \"Trunks grow from the roots\" depicts young Korean people growing into true patriotic men thanks to the loving care of General Secretary Kim Jong Il who put forward the idea of attaching importance to young people.\r\n   Films based on military theme were created this year including \"Formation of girls-driven assault planes\" and \"Pilot Kil Yong Jo.\"   \"A family basketball team\" and other films based on actual life were also created.\r\n   Tens of television films reflecting the spirit of the era were created this year.   Among them are \"We can not retreat\"  (4 parts), \"Ships go to seas\" (parts 4) and \"Express train\" (2 parts). \r\n   Over ten animated cartoons including the popular multi-part one \"a Squirrel and a Hedgehog\" (parts 8 through 10), \"Foot mark of rabbit\" and \"a Tiger and Three Friends\" were created. \r\n  \r\n"

It demanded that the United States withdraw its troops and nuclear weapons from South Korea unconditionally without delay.\r\n   The Congolese Socialist Party in a statement in the name of a special meeting of its political bureau said that the U.S. new war plan is entirely contrary to the will of the Korean people to reunify the country by means of confederation in accordance with the five-point policy of great national unity. It demanded immediate repeal of the plan.\r\n   The Centre of the Indian Trade Unions and the All India Peasants' Union in statements denounced the U.S. imperialists for their new war provocation moves in staging all kinds of military exercises with mobilization of huge armed forces after working out such a plan for the second Korean war as the \"operation plan 5027\"  and strongly demanded that they stop at once all actions of wrecking peace on the Korean peninsula.\r\n   The Syrian Arab Union of Writers in a statement said that they support people's Korea that is braving threat of the United States and will always stand on the side of justice against exploitation, oppression, colonialism and robbery.\r\n\r\n"

Nuclear-capable B-52 strategic bombers  and warships for coastal landing operations flew or sailed from Japanese bases.\r\n   The United States could indiscriminately drop bombs and fire shells toward the inviolable land of the DPRK from these bases during the Korean War in the 1950s, but the situation has changed.\r\n   We have a powerful means of offensive enough to crush the aggression forces in any region at one stroke.\r\n   Vice marshal of the Korean People's Army Jon Jae Son said that \"we will take a merciless strike on the enemies' position wherever they may be on the earth and make it a sea of fire.\" \r\n\r\n\r\n"

These warheads can be turned into nuclear warheads if they are charged with nuclear substances.\r\n   Buoyant with the nuclear ambition, the Japanese militarists need to create an atmosphere under which they can turn Japan into a nuclear giant as they want. In other words, they need the permanent membership of the UN Security Council.\r\n   All of the present permanent members are nuclear weapons nations.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are now trying to occupy a permanent seat in a bid to legally arm Japan with nuclear weapons, turn it into a nuclear giant and thus attain their design for overseas expansion, freely wielding nuclear weapons.\r\n   If Japan becomes a permanent member of the UN Security Council, the world will certainly be exposed to greater danger of nuclear war.\r\n   Much effort is not needed to guess what catastrophic consequences will arise when sabre-rattling samurais wield nuclear weapons against the world.\r\n   The source of calamities must be removed beforehand, and no room must be given to it. \r\n \r\n  \r\n"
