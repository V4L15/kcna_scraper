He went round the indoor resting place on the 17th floor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The indoor resting place has been successfully built so that teachers and researchers may have stroll, reading and amusement games and their children may play to their satisfaction, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went out to the veranda to enjoy a bird's-eye view of the cityscape. He was pleased that the apartment houses are located in a good place and their appearance made the Ryonghung Crossroads look nicer. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said there is nothing to spare for teachers and researchers of the university who train scientific talents who will be responsible for the future of the country in the age of knowledge-based economy, age of campaign of brains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that educators of Kim Il Sung University would achieve bigger successes in the education of younger generation and training of talents true to the party's intention. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Thae Bok, member of the Political Bureau and secretary of the C.C., the WPK; Ma Won Chun, vice department director of the C.C., the WPK; Thae Hyong Chol, president of Kim Il Sung University; and Kim Thae Hi, chief secretary of the party committee of the university."

Korean Media of Inciting Confrontation\r\n Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- Conservative media and riff-raffs styling themselves \"experts on the north\" in south Korea are malignantly slandering the just step taken by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t They are trying to falsify truth, asserting \"the north's postponement of the reunion of separated families is bedeviling the inter-Korean relations\" and \"the north has totally broken its promise with the south by taking issue with mere words uttered by a government official and media\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such rhetoric is nothing but sophism intended to evade their responsibility for having thrown the slowly improving inter-Korean relations into the phase of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as those conservative media and \"experts on the north\" are concerned, they are nothing but leftovers of the era which earned such ill-fame as waiting maids of power and paid trumpeters misleading public opinion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are no more than a group of traitors as they took the lead in bedeviling the inter-Korean relations, far from contributing to their improvement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As early as in the period when all Koreans were seething with the desire for reunification, those reptile media joined  the conservative group in slandering the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration as \"north's document for operation against the south\" and \"agreed promise which cannot but be dishonored \".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the people of the DPRK were grieving over the greatest loss of the nation, they dared describe it as \"forced and orchestrated sorrow.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, they went the lengths of describing the compatriotic and humanitarian efforts made by the north with sincerity as \"an offensive for tactical dialogue\" while persisting in their wrongdoings to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When a series of achievements were made in the north-south relations thanks to the efforts of the north, they hurled mud at their dialogue partner, trumpeting about \"results of the south's confidence-building process.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, reptile media and paid trumpeters in south Korea have taken the lead in stirring up confrontation with compatriots and hostility toward them by running the whole gamut of lies and fabrications. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that they are letting loose a whole string of rhetoric in a bid to create such impression that they are concerned over the north-south relations and agreements.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors, who consider it as a job to pursue confrontation with compatriots in breach of impartiality and conscience, is as bad as cancer and a source of trouble as they stand in the way of mending the inter-Korean relations and achieving national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that it is impossible to remove distrust and atmosphere of hostility among Koreans unless the false propaganda of those reptile media and tricksters is brought to an end in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those confrontation maniacs should be eliminated for the reconciliation and unity of the nation, peace and reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bases of those die-hard trumpeters have already been placed within the range of strike of the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear in mind they will only invite a disaster for patronizing those agitating confrontation."
