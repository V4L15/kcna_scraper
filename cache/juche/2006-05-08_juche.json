The article is published on the occasion of the 80th anniversary of the Down-with-Imperialism Union formed by President Kim Il Sung and the 50th anniversary of the study tour of the revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu started by leader Kim Jong Il.\r\n The article notes that the army and the people of the DPRK have dynamically stepped up the general march for the Songun revolution, regarding the Paektu revolutionary traditions as an eternal lifeline for accomplishing the cause of Juche.\r\n In its first part the article stresses that the above-said traditions established by the President serve as an invincible banner of eternal vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traditions are eternal guidelines for the revolution as they embody the principle of the Songun revolution which calls for exploring the road of revolution and winning its victory with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of attaching importance to arms served as the kernel and starting point of all the lines and policies, strategies and tactics in the protracted course of the Korean revolution. The principle of Songun helped work out fundamental guidelines for building the party, the army and the state, lay down a strategy of giving importance to the ideology and achieving unity and  indicate the shortest cut to the social transformation, human remoulding and nature-remaking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Paektu revolutionary traditions also mean the tradition of revolutionary comradeship and single-minded unity, and they serve as an ever-lasting weapon for successfully accomplishing the socialist cause in the present times as they contain rich experience gained in the Songun revolution and exploits performed in its course.\r\n The Korean revolution is a glorious revolution as it achieved the steel-like unity of the whole party and society deeply rooted in the Paektu traditions of single-minded unity and has always emerged victorious with its might. In this proud course, the traditions of the Korean revolution have been given steady continuity and our country has demonstrated its might as a powerful state that boasts the single-minded unity.\r\n In the second part, the article notes that the Korean revolution is sure to triumph as it has a great history and traditions and they have been steadfastly carried forward. \r\n Kim Jong Il is the great protector and successor to the Paektu revolutionary traditions because he has directed utmost efforts to inheriting the revolutionary traditions, regarding this matter as essential for the victorious advance and accomplishment of the revolutionary cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 50 years ago, he started the study tour of revolutionary battle sites in the area of Mt. Paektu. And on Ryongnam Hill he made a historic pledge to creditably succeed to the revolutionary cause of Kim Il Sung. He thus made a new glorious history of inheriting the revolutionary traditions in the country, cherishing the unshakable faith in the Paektu revolutionary traditions established by the President.\r\n He is an iron-willed commander who has trained the People's Army to be the best protectors of the Paektu revolutionary traditions and invincible revolutionary armed forces of Mt. Paektu. He is, at the same time, a prominent and veteran leader who has prepared the 3rd and 4th generations of the Korean revolution as genuine heirs to the Paektu revolutionary traditions to give a steady continuity to the Songun revolution and created a heroic epic of the Songun era with the Paektu revolutionary spirit and fighting stamina. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the third part the article describes the ongoing general march for the Songun revolution as a heroic all-people march in the present times to win a final victory of the Songun cause by following up the march to Mt. Paektu started by the President.\r\n To fully display the vitality of the Paektu revolutionary traditions is a very important work for glorifying the history of the Korean revolution as a history of devotedly defending the leader forever, and a sacred struggle to give steady continuity to the history of the victorious Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also a worthwhile struggle to ensure the fresh and great progress of Korean-style socialism with conviction of victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 21st century in which we advance under the guidance of Kim Jong Il will shine as a glorious century because the Songun cause of Juche will emerge victorious with the might of the Paektu revolutionary traditions and the country will achieve the greatest prosperity, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
