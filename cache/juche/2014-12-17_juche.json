            "content": "FM Urges European Countries Not to Peddle \"Human Rights Issue\"\r\n Pyongyang, December 17 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the DPRK answered a question raised by KCNA on Wednesday in connection with the disclosure of European countries' conspiracy with the U.S. in its human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t At a time when cruel tortures committed by the CIA against inmates in its secret prisons were disclosed recently to come under fire by the international community, the information that European countries had conspired with the U.S. in them was brought to light. This is sparking great uproar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, 21 European countries including Britain actively cooperated with the U.S. in its human rights abuses as evidenced by the facts that they allowed the CIA to set up secret prisons and interrogation bases and Okayed inmates' passage through their territories and their stay there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t EU and European countries have so far often found fault with other countries over their alleged human rights violations, behaving as if they were a \"model\" in protecting the human rights. And they have zealously joined the U.S. in its \"human rights\" campaign against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But, this time, it was disclosed that most of EU member states became servants in the U.S. brutal human rights abuses. This brought to daylight the fact that the signboard of \"human rights protection\", which was professed as one of its major pillars of EU policies, was only ostentation and proved to be a smokescreen to conceal a political hypocrisy peculiar to Europe. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The European countries are now faced with a strong condemnation and pressure at home and abroad. There come strange voices from several European countries that they only gave a green light to CIA to operate secret prisons but did not grant a right to torture prisoners. There also comes a spate of discontent among them. Those countries grumble that they demanded the deletion of their cooperation in U.S. acts of torture but it was opened to public as it was. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the final analysis, Europe has been reduced to a servant fated to sit in the dock for acting under the baton of the U.S. It scuttled the human rights dialogue with the DPRK, which had been smoothly under way a decade ago, under the wire-pulling of the U.S. over the DPRK's nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently alone, EU recognized the DPRK's will to seek an international cooperation in the field of human rights. But, pressurized by the U.S., EU behaved so recklessly as taking the lead in adopting the \"human rights resolution\" against DPRK, which is based on lies told by a few human dregs at the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t European countries should be well aware of their own situations where they have lost even elementary qualifications to peddle the \"human rights issue\" of somebody. They would be well advised to bear in mind that they would only harm their own interests and lose their faces if they follow others without independent viewpoints. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If European countries are truly concerned for the protection of human rights, they should learn how to behave themselves and stop peddling \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK peppered with fabrications, though belatedly, and opt for calling the extra-large scale human rights violations by the U.S. into question at the UN and on other international fora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By doing so, Europe can only redress its past and become a genuine champion of human rights as claimed by it."

They prodded such human scum as \"defectors from the north\" into asserting that a \"systematic elimination of the disabled was taking place in north Korea\" and spread sheer sophism that the DPRK is set to send its team to Paralympic Games, etc. to conceal its \"policy of eliminating the people with disabilities\".\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Central Committee of the Korean Federation for the Protection of the Disabled (KFPD) made public a statement on Tuesday in this regard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable abuse of the DPRK and an unbearable insult and mockery of the disabled people, the statement noted, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government has consistently respected the human dignity of the disabled and provided them with all conditions and circumstances so that they may enjoy equal social and political rights with the ordinary people and take active part in the state and social activities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the Democratic Blind Alliance of Korea was formed in February, Juche 37 (1948) and has since conducted brisk activities. Since its founding the DPRK has taken a series of legal and institutional steps for preferential state treatment and protection of the disabled and spared no investment in implementing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Central Committee of the KFPD was founded in 1998 with an objective of sincerely helping the state shape and implement the policies of protecting the disabled and controlling and guiding the work for protecting the disabled in an integral manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sanatoriums are found everywhere for the disabled so that they are given free functional rehabilitation service. The modern Munsu Functional Rehabilitation Clinic appeared in Pyongyang City in 2013 to render comprehensive functional rehabilitation service to the disabled.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK Law on the Protection of the Disabled adopted on June 18, 2003 and amended and supplemented in November, 2013 provides a legal guarantee for their rights. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has been confirmed by foreign experts and media persons of AP, APTN and other Western media through their visits and news coverage activities that the rights, dignity and interests of the disabled are satisfactorily ensured both on a legal basis and in their life thanks to the correct policy of the DPRK government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The hostile forces' racket over \"issue of the disabled\" is nothing but a poor attempt to stir up the atmosphere of international pressure on the DPRK over its \"human rights\" even by picking up a new \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reckless trumpeting made by \"defectors from the north\" to get a petty amount of dollars is not worth even a passing note. But it is more ridiculous for politicians of Britain and other Western countries to chime in with their propaganda, utterly ignorant of the reality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those hostile forces had better stop at once their mean and poor smear campaign for meeting their sinister political purposes."
