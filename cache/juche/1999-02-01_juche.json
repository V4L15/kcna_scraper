            "content": "Memorandum of KAPPC on DPRK-Japan relations\r\n   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 1 (KCNA) -- The Korean Asia-Pacific Peace Committee (KAPPC) released a memorandum today as regards the DPRK-Japan relations developing into the worst phase owing to Japan's current frantic anti-DPRK campaign.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The memorandum says:\r\n   The DPRK and Japan, which had been in abnormal relationship owing to Japan's past crimes committed against the Korean nation and its hostile policy toward the DPRK, took the first step for the normalization of bilateral relations in the late 1980s.\r\n   A \"joint declaration of the Workers' Party of Korea and Japan's Liberal-Democratic Party and Socialist Party on DPRK-Japan relations\" was adopted in Pyongyang in September 1990.\r\n   The three-party joint declaration stated that Japan should make an official apology and an adequate compensation to the DPRK for the immeasurable misfortunes and disasters and losses Japan inflicted upon the Korean nation for 36 years in the past and for 45 years later.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also confirmed the principled matters arising in bilateral relations such as start of intergovernmental negotiation for removing the abnormal relationship between the DPRK and Japan and establishing bilateral diplomatic relations at an early date.\r\n   As a result, three rounds of preliminary talks and eight rounds of full-dress talks were held.\r\n   However, the talks came to a rupture without any fruit due to the moves of Japan's Foreign Ministry authorities and other right-wing conservative forces.\r\n   The Japanese authorities also overruled the \"agreement on resumption of DPRK-Japan negotiations\" adopted between the WPK and Japan's three ruling coalition parties in March 1995.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At that time the four parties agreed to resume negotiations between the two countries and hold talks for the normalization of bilateral relations without any precondition and strictly from an independent stand. Under the agreement, working-level contacts and preliminary negotiations took place for the resumption of the DPRK-Japanese intergovernmental full-dress talks from 1996, at which a consensus of views was reached upon almost all the technical matters. \r\n   However, Japan raised an issue of \"missing Japanese\" and an issue of \"those deprived of nationality.\" Though the DPRK made a magnanimous response, Japan slandered the DPRK over \"missile test\" and \"suspected underground nuclear facility,\" abandoned the negotiations for normalisation of DPRK-Japan ties and suspended air Koryo's flight to Japan.\r\n   Japan went sofar as to threaten the DPRK with \"strike,\" \"strong counteraction\" and \"military option.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the three-party joint declaration and the four-party agreement were signed by ruling parties and involved government officials of Japan directly, the Japanese government has a legal and moral obligation to carry them into practice.\r\n   The Japanese authorities, motivated by their ambition for reinvasion, hindered the movement for improved ties between the two countries.\r\n   Japan worked hard to realise its aggressive design in line with the U.S. strategy of stifling the DPRK.\r\n   The Japan \"self-defence forces,\" which were deployed mainly in the north, were re-deployed mainly in the southwest, with the DPRK as the target. The \"crisis around Japan\" specified in the \"U.S.-Japan defence cooperation guidelines\" was revised as \"crisis caused by North Korea.\" \r\nU.S.-Japan joint military drills are targeted at the DPRK.\r\n   Military bosses of Japan visit South Korea to discuss war scenario against the DPRK and even show up at Panmunjom to whip up war fever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's current campaign over \"missile launch\" and \"suspected underground nuclear facility\" is also a radical product of its hostile policy toward the DPRK.\r\n   As far as nuclear suspicion is concerned, no one can vouch when Japan possessed of much plutonium enough to make thousands of Hiroshima-type nuclear weapons will reveal its nuclear teeth.\r\n   Japan is worsening its ties with the DPRK because it does not want the reunification of Korea.\r\n   Japan also aims to avoid apologizing and compensating for its past crimes against the Korean nation.\r\n   For the DPRK to receive an apology and compensation from Japan is an important political issue to defend and exercise the Korean nation's dignity and independent rights as well as an acute military issue to�@frustrate Japan's reinvasion scheme and preserve peace.\r\n   Without help from Japan, we have lived and can live in the future, too.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The official and unofficial contacts for DPRK-Japan relations held in recent years have clearly showed that Japan answers benevolence with evil, and favor with enmity.\r\n   Now that Japan dislikes improved ties with the DPRK and takes a hostile policy toward us, we have no intention to waste our effort and time.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must clearly see the present reality of the DPRK that is turning into a powerful, thriving nation through a leaping progress with vast potentials and must refrain from reckless acts that may lead to their self-destruction.\r\n   The character of the Korean people is to answer a sword with a sword, and rice cake with rice cake.\r\n   Japan must ponder over this. \r\n  \r\n    \r\n"

She is Hyon Myong Gyong, a second-year pupil at the Maengsan Senior Middle School.\r\n   As a nursery child, she learned to speak and write Korean and committed to memory all the names of countries and their locations on the world map. This surprised her parents and nursery teachers. The teachers saw her remarkable faculties of hearing and memory and taught her simple English words.\r\n   At the age of 2, she had a command of over 200 English words and could read English books adapted for children. At three, she entered primary school and at seven, went on to senior middle school.\r\n   In a recent county meeting of teachers, she appeared before them to speak English sentences and sing an English song. She invited a resounding applause from the audience. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
