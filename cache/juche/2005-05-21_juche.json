            "content": "S. Korean Ruling Party's Treachery Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 20 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front Wednesday made public a statement denouncing the Uri Party of south Korea for swimming against the trend of the times towards a progressive reform in conspiracy with the Grand National Party (GNP), according to Kuguk Jonson Internet site.\r\n Recalling that the Uri Party at a recent extraordinary session of the \"National Assembly\" met the unreasonable demands of the GNP group when discussing the \"bill on the past history,\" the statement noted this is nothing but a product of the political bargaining conducted by the ruling party with the anti-reform GNP behind closed doors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Uri Party at a political huddle with the GNP group held  at the end of last year had already compromised with it on canceling its plan to handle a legislation on reforms within the year and taking it up at an extraordinary session of the NA in February this year. As if it were not enough with this deferment, the ruling party reduced the \"law on the past history,\" the first of its kind in the history of the NA, to an anti-reform law, thus committing a crime against history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that the Uri Party conducted \"another compromise bargaining\" with the GNP. Afterwards the ruling party at the above-said session went without even taking up the issue of the \"National Security Law,\" though it had promised to get it scrapped at the session, in return for passing \"bill on the construction of the administrative city,\" thereby unhesitatingly breaking the promise made with the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Uri Party can never evade the responsibility for seriously scuttling the purport of the legislation on reforms and thus chilling the people's desire and bringing the reform process to a setback. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Uri Party, which once advocated progressive reforms, departed from its earlier stand and opted for a political collusion with the GNP under the pretext of what it called viable politics, openly shunning progressive reform. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a treacherous act of swimming against the trend of the times in which people aspire after the new. It is quite clear what will be entailed by the political bargaining and collusion with the GNP group forsaken by the compatriots.\r\n The Uri Party should behave itself, bearing in mind that it is closely watched by the pro-progressive reform forces and people's punishment knows no mercy.    \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are contemplating the application of economic sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is a deliberate and premeditated provocative move to scrap the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration and drive the confrontation between the two countries to a dangerous phase of clash. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile relations between the two countries are now inching close to the dangerous phase of explosion. Under this situation the DPRK is left with no option but to take a decisive counter- measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK value its sovereignty as their life and soul and will never allow anyone to infringe upon it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Deeply engraving on our hearts the essential meaning of the line of the Songun revolution that arms are immediately the revolution and the destiny of the nation, we should always share destiny with arms, rain or shine, and thus work bigger miracles and perform greater feats in the worthwhile general march today under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members and other working people should deeply grasp the idea of collectivism theoretically and have the firm faith in the advantages of socialism and its victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should decisively smash the enemies�f moves to disintegrate our ranks from within and their scurvy psychological warfare to resolutely defend our ideology and idea, our morality and way of life.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On May 21, Juche 35 (1946), he broke the ground for the project.\r\n Before the liberation of the country (1945), the river had been flooded in rainy season every year, submerging lots of houses and cultivated land.\r\n Addressing the ground-breaking ceremony, he said that the project should be carried out successfully to mark the start of the nature-remaking work for building a rich and powerful democratic and independent state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Greatly inspired by his speech, Pyongyang citizens completed the project, in which they had to build a five-kilometer-long dam with transport of more than 420,000 cubic meters of earth, in a matter of 55 days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The completion of the project freed the River Pothong from flood once and for all and renewed the looks of Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAlong the River Pothong, a ten-kilometer-long canal was dug, recreation grounds with a total area of more than 300 hectares appeared and many grand monumental edifices such as the People's Palace of Culture, Pyongyang Indoor Stadium, Ice Rink and Changgwang Health Complex constructed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The grand nature-remaking, initiated by the President, has been accelerated on a larger scale under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that the land-rezoning project is a part of the grand nature-remaking for the development of the country and a patriotic work for the posterity.
