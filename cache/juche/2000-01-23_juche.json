It is now anchoring at the river taedong in Pyongyang, where the U.S. pirate ship \"General Sherman\" was sunken, to be visited by people from all walks of life and servicemen of the Korean People's Army and foreigners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Yun Song Sik said that no sooner had \"Pueblo\" been captured than the United States sent a fleet of scores of warships, including a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, to waters off Wonsan and formed a combat flying corps consisting of at least 730 planes, while putting political and diplomatic pressure upon the DPRK. But this conflict ended in the victory of North Korea as the United States officially admitted its intrusion into the territorial waters of the DPRK and signed a document of apology 11 months later.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This was followed by the shooting down of a large spy plane \"EC-121\", which the U.S. touted as \"Pueblo in the sky\", on April 15, 1969, the \"Panmunjom incident\" on August 18, 1976, sinking of \"Escort Craft 56\" on January 19, 1967, the shooting down of U.S. military helicopters on July 14, 1977 and on December 17, 1994, and many other incidents. But each time the United States was compelled to make an apology to the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All these victories that demonstrated the national pride and self-confidence have been won thanks to the matchless grit and ever-victorious stratagem of the President Kim Il Sung and General Secretary Marshal Kim Jong Il. They are the result of the wise leadership of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il who trained the people's army as a-match-for-a hundred army capable of defeating any formidable enemy in one blow, as a main agent of revolution and turned the whole country into an impregnable fortress, on the strength of the army-first policy and the perfect unity between the army and the people who devotedly upheld the idea and leadership of the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States must know well that the Korean people and army are the heroic people, the matchless army under the leadership of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, the invincible and iron-willed commander, he declared, warning that the U.S. will meet nothing but disgrace and death in the confrontation with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"
