This is sheer misinformation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK solemnly declared in October 2006 that, being a responsible nuclear weapons state, it would never allow nuclear transfer, and has stood by its words. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK never makes an empty talk but always tells truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said story is nothing but a clumsy plot hatched by the dishonest forces who do not like to see any progress at the six-party talks and in the DPRK-U.S. relations.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

To this end, Abe spun out the sugar-coated mishmash during his recent Asian junket that Japan would boost economic \"aid\" and \"investment\" in Asian countries and endeavor to achieve \"co-prosperity\". In this way, Japan is seeking to lull the alert of the countries in the region and lay a foothold for launching an aggressive military operation by sending the \"SDF\" to the sea of the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is why Japan has gone on a rampage by zealously taking part in multi-national joint military drills staged in the Pacific in recent years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hidden behind Abe's doctrine of securing \"a maritime defense line\" is Japan's Machiavellian intention to get harsher in economic domination and plunder in Asian countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries think that Japan would be able to gratify its ambition of economic domination over the Asian countries, not to speak of securing a sphere of naval operation for the \"SDF\", only if Japan seized the control of the vast sea linking the Pacific and Indian Oceans. Herein lies the purpose sought by Abe when he advocated establishment of \"Asian\" partnership for securing \"a maritime defense line\" during his Asian junket.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "All Koreans Called upon to Struggle for National Independence\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- To stand for national independence or dependence on outside forces is a touchstone that distinguishes reunification from division and patriotism from treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is senseless to talk about national independence, while pursuing flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces, the article notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dependence on outside forces is as foolish an act as putting a noose of destruction around one's neck by oneself. If one hesitates to take the road of national independence and cooperation, failing to face up to the reality in which the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" has become a trend of the times, one will commit such a shameful criminal act as disturbing the peace of the country and security of the nation and blocking the cause of national reunification, thereby leaving an indelible blot in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is stipulated in the historic June 15 joint declaration that the north and the south agreed to independently settle the issue of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. It means that the north and the south made a promise before the whole nation to fully introduce national independence in settling the issue of reunification on the basis of their recognition that national independence is the great principle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is the most just principle for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of Korea's reunification is, in its essence, the one of putting an end to the outside forces' domination over south Korea and interference in it and establishing the national sovereignty throughout Korea. The independent character of the cause of national reunification requires the whole nation to firmly maintain the principle and stand of national independence in the movement for reunification with the transparent consciousness of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence helps reject outside forces' aggression and interference and guarantees the peace and the victorious progress of the cause of reunification, while flunkeyism and dependence on outside forces only do harm to the movement for national reunification and bring the destiny of the nation to ruin. Dependence on outside forces would bring nothing but continued division and war disasters. The principle of national independence that calls for solving all issues by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, rejecting outside aggressor forces' domination and interference against reunification is the main principle of national reunification which they should neither abandon nor soften up under any circumstances.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
