They are resorting to every foul trick such as changing the terms of the unconverted long-term prisoners or calling for \"exchange.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This reveals their cunning and sinister intention to refuse and put a brake on the repatriation of the unconverted long-term prisoners at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have argued that the unconverted long-term prisoners, who are eagerly wishing to return to the north, should be \"exchanged\" for defectors to the north, who are refusing to go back to the south. This assertion does not work on anybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unconverted long-term prisoners should unconditionally be repatriated to the north according to the requirement of the international law and the principle of humanitarianism. \r\n\r\n"

This reflects the unanimous will of all the Korean people to achieve the cause of great national unity, the cause of the country's reunification, without fail in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The national unity and reunification, which the Korean people wish to attain, can be achieved only when the great idea and policy of great national unity are carried out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great national unity should be achieved on the principle of national independence under the banner of patriotism and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Invariable is our stance that we will join hands with anyone aspiring after national reunification with national conscience not only on the road of the country's reunification but in the struggle for the prosperity of a reunified country, not delving into his past, regardless of what crimes he committed against the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the workers, peasants, intellectuals, youth and students, urban petty propertied class, national capitalists, politicians, businessmen, men of culture, religionists and soldiers in South Korea should make contributions to national reunification, the common cause of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only by doing so, can they fulfil their duty and obligation as members of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In spite of differences in idea and ideal, political view and religious belief within our nation, all the fellow countrymen except a tiny handful of anti-reunification forces can think, act and unite as one on the road of reunification and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the fellow countrymen in the north, south and overseas should make visits and contacts, develop dialogue and strengthen solidarity and thus escalate the movement for great national unity and national reunification. \r\n\r\n"

He reacted to the U.S. threat and blackmail by stating that the DPRK decided to withdraw from the nuclear nonproliferation treaty when the U.S. was taking issue with the DPRK over \"nuclear issue\" in 1993. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was thanks to Kim Jong Il's leadership ability that the Korean people continued to achieve fresh successes without any vacillation after passing away of President Kim Il Sung in 1994 and despite consecutive years of natural disasters in the subsequent period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Happy are the Korean people guided by a tested leader who leads the country to peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They have Kim Jong Il as their leader who is an indomitable revolutionary, brave and courageous fighter, illustrious commander and a most prominent statesman. The Korean people are ever victorious as Kim Jong Il believes in the people and they trust and follow him as their great leader. \r\n\r\n"

Accordingly, it is an unbreakable law for the people to go in for socialism.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The realities of those countries where capitalism revived clearly prove that people's desire for socialism cannot be checked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those countries found no solution to such serious problems as economic bankruptcy, massive unemployment, crimes and immorality and corruption last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The only way out of such politico-economic crisis and ideological and moral confusion is to revive socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Foreign public figures who visited the DPRK last year unanimously lauded socialism of Korean style and hardened their resolution to learn from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how complicated the international situation may be the socialist cause is sure to triumph despite obstacles and difficulties in its advance. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
