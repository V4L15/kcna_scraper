They decided to rename the  Preparatory Committee for Joint Functions of Koreans in the North, South and Overseas for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration the National Joint Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration (June 15 National Joint Committee) as required by the developing reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe regional preparatory committees in the north and the south and overseas will accordingly be renamed the North Side's Committee, South Side's Committee and Overseas Side's Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n2. They also decided to adopt and effectuate the Statute of the National Joint Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration from Dec. 10 to more effectively operate the joint committee as a solidarity organization of the north and the south and overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n3. Delegates of the north and the south and overseas sides expressed unanimous views on consolidating the achievements made in the reunification movement this year and bringing about a fresh turn in the movement for national independent reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation in 2006, too, under the banner of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

S. imperialists recently decided to deploy the latest carrier \"George Washington\" in their naval base in Yokosuka, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.  This was a revelation of their undisguised intention to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK to invade and stifle it. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U. S. imperialists have turned south Korea into the biggest nuclear base in the Far East to threaten the DPRK with nukes and find a pretext for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having massively deployed their nuclear forces in south Korea, they openly disclosed their intention to launch a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK in the event of \"contingency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When starting the Korean war, U.S. President Truman ordered to work out a criminal plan for using atomic bombs in the war. It was stipulated in the \"guidelines for the security\" of the U.S. troops in south Korea that nuclear weapons are bound to be used should a war break out in Korea. This goes to clearly prove that the U.S. imperialists' preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK is an established fact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose elements created serious nuclear crises on the Korean Peninsula in the 1990s and even in the new century. All of them were aimed at finding pretexts for mounting a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present U.S. administration became more undisguised in its attempt at the preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. It suspended all dialogues and negotiations which had been under way in the period of the previous administration and listed the DPRK as a part of \"an axis of evil\" in its \"State of the Union Address\" for 2002. The U.S. also listed the DPRK as the target of its preemptive nuclear attack in March of the same year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, it is the unchangeable strategy and ambition of the U.S. imperialists to stifle the DPRK through a preemptive nuclear attack. It was none other than the U.S. that compelled the DPRK to bolster up its physical deterrent forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the United States truly wants a solution to the DPRK-U. S. nuclear issue, it should drop the above-said reckless intention and take practical steps for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean GNP Gentries' Hooliganism under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- The worst anti-reunification elements in south Korea committed such despicable vandalism as completely destroying the graveyard of unconverted long-term prisoners in Pogwang Temple, Phaju City, Kyonggi Province on Dec. 5.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unconverted long-term prisoners deserve to be praised by society and the people as patriotic martyrs for reunification as they dedicated themselves to the country and the Korean nation. However, those elements committed double murder of those prisoners. They are the ruffians utterly indifferent to the country and the nation and bereft of ethics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent vandalism was instigated and wirepulled by none other than the GNP, a group of wicked anti-reunification conservative elements. The area devoted to honoring unconverted long-term prisoners has become an object of argument due to \"the assertion about ideology and political coloring\" since it was built by a religious organization of south Korea in May. This was attributable to the far-fetched assertion and provocation on the part of the ultra-right conservatives including the GNP. Some days before the occurrence of the vandalism, Kang Jae Sop, floor leader of the GNP, taking issue with the graveyard of unconverted long-term prisoners, talked nonsense at a meeting of the party leadership that it was little short of totally negating the \"nature of the system\" to praise the unconverted long-term prisoners \"who were operatives sent to the south or guerillas\" as patriotic martyrs for reunification. He was reported to have urged the authorities to take responsible measures in that regard. He went the lengths of asserting that the GNP would send lawmakers from the party to the spot to make an investigation into it in a bid to make the issue more complicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis goes to prove that the hideous vandalism was perpetrated by fascist rascals at the undisguised instigation of the GNP and on its scenario. \r\n The recent case teaches all Koreans a bitter lesson that if they allow the anti-reunification conservative forces including the GNP to go reckless, south Korea can never be in peace nor can the inter-Korean relations make smooth progress and the Korean nation is bound to undergo greater disasters.\r\n These forces can never go scot-free but face a stern judgment of the nation and history as they do not hesitate to trample down upon ethics and morality in a bid to cover up their crime-woven past and prolong their dirty remaining days.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is applying unjust double standards in the field of human rights while taking issue with human rights of other countries and styling itself the human rights judge which no one admits. Rigmarole on human rights made by the U.S. and some other Western forces is, in essence, the theory of overturn of system, regime change and a prelude to aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have serious human rights problems although they say this or that about \"human rights\" issue of other countries. The U.S. is the worst human rights abuser of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even in the new century the U.S. unhesitatingly committed such hideous human rights abuses as undisguised aggression on sovereign states and massacre of innocent civilians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is not all. It was recently disclosed that the U.S. has operated secret prisons in European countries and CIA airplanes have used airports in those countries to carry POWs from Iraq, Afghanistan and other areas. This has sparked off a big furor worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now treating prisoners barbarously at its forces' concentration camps overseas including the Guantanamo naval base. \r\n Like this, the U.S. is covering up its human rights abuses while faking up and taking issue with human rights of other countries. It is using them as a pretext for aggression, pressure and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights precisely mean the right of the state, the article says, adding that the Songun banner held high by the Koreans is greatly encouraging the world people in their efforts to build a new world in which human rights are respected in the new century.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
