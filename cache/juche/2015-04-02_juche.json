Those spies were unmasked and arrested while perpetrating espionage against the DPRK in a bid to do harm to its supreme leadership and bring down its socialist system.\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the puppet group is urging the DPRK to \"free and immediately repatriate\" the thrice-cursed ones unmasked and arrested at the scene of crimes, not content with noisily talking about \"groundless evidence and claim\" and \"detention of south Korean inhabitants.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group also egged conservative religious bodies on to noisily claim that what the thrice-cursed criminals did was \"only missionary work to help the poor in the north.\" Conservative media and experts and even human scum are getting zealous in inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen and pulling up the DPRK, letting loose such invectives that \"the north lured and abducted south Koreans\" in a bid to \"use them as hostages for playing a strategic card, shift the blame for the 'Cheonan' warship sinking onto the south and foment discord among south Koreans.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's noisy trumpeting about \"allurement and abduction\" far from making a sincere apology for the thrice-cursed crime is, indeed, the height of shamelessness and another thrice-cursed provocation against the DPRK, says a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) in a statement on Thursday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive south Korean puppet regimes ceaselessly perpetrated espionage, subversive and conspiratorial acts against the DPRK and pretended ignorance and employed all sorts of sleight of hand whenever truth behind them was brought to light. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group denied its thrice-cured crimes but resorted to red herring operations to deceive the public when their spies were unmasked and arrested in the DPRK, as evidenced by the case of those who were arrested while scheming to demolish monuments to the immortality of the leaders erected in praise of them in the DPRK that are symbolic of its supreme dignity and the case of Kim Jong Uk, a spy of the puppet Intelligence Service unmasked and arrested after infiltrating into the DPRK last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As such puppet regime's stereo-typed method has already been fully exposed to the world, even the recently arrested IS spies vehemently denounced the regime at the press conference, saying the regime might deny again all the facts if the truth behind their crimes were brought to light there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the puppet regime continues denying its fully exposed thrice-cursed crimes and resorting to confrontation racket, the DPRK will go on opening to public other evidence and information to shed light on terrorism plotted by the puppet regime and truth behind its conspiratorial moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will unmask and mercilessly punish to the last those who joined in espionage, subversion, terrorism and abduction operations against the DPRK to dare hurt the dignity of its supreme leadership and its socialist system, no matter who they are, what masks they are wearing and where they are in hiding."

It was again the U.S. that is working hard to turn cyberspace into a theatre of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Heads of state and government organs and key businesses of various countries have become targets of the NSA's wire-tapping.  Confidential information being stored in governments' and personal computers are being hacked by U.S. agents to help the White House shape its policies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such hacking attack of the U.S. is an act for igniting a war of aggression as it is aimed at carrying out its cyber military strategy to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The keynote of the strategy being pursued by the U.S. is to mount a preemptive cyber attack on a certain target through internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To this end, the U.S. already advanced the conception of cyber warfare early in the 1990s and has stepped up arms race and preparations for a cyber war in real earnest in a bid to carry out its military strategy in cyberspace under the pretext of \"protecting national interests\". The cyber warfare command was organized by the U.S. navy in December, 2002. And this was followed by the formation of cyber warfare units in its air force and army. The U.S. Cyber Command was set up in 2010 to command in a unified manner all the military actions concerning cyber warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Obama signed a secret presidential order concerning the U.S. cyber operation policy in October 2012. Pursuant to it, the U.S. Department of Defense is developing new type weapons that can jam and paralyze military computer systems of other countries although they are not connected to the internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, the U.S. is zealously stepping up preparations for large-scale cyber attacks on other countries, blinded by its wild ambition to dominate the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the U.S. cyber military strategy is a thrice-cursed crime as it triggers world-wide race for cyber warfare and throws the world into mayhem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has often made much fuss over cyber attack to give impression that it is a victim of cyber terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t For example, it kicked up the racket of \"imposing additional sanctions\" upon the DPRK after deliberately linking it with the cyber attack on the Sony Pictures Entertainment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a charade of the U.S. is aimed to create a favorable atmosphere for executing its pre-emptive cyber war by branding sovereign states, notably, the anti-U.S. independent countries, as cyber attackers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., though belatedly, should be well aware of the fact that its wild ambition for dominating the world through cyber warfare is no more than a pipedream."

The recent confessions made by spies who had been on the payroll of the puppet Intelligence Service glaringly laid bare the criminal nature of the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign. This goes to prove truth that the DPRK can never sit at a negotiating table with the group of thrice-cursed traitors as they are keen to stifle it awake or asleep and that it should boldly retaliate against them with merciless punishment only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon the puppet forces going reckless, seized by the wild ambition for \"unification of social systems\" but strongly react against them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already issued a stern warning against the puppet group's move to set up the above-said office in Seoul at any cost.

It is, at the same time, an independent political mode to which the principles of Songun idea are fully applied.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers praised leader Kim Jong Il for honorably defending socialism of Juche built by President Kim Il Sung through his Songun revolutionary leadership and laying a solid foundation to achieve the prosperity of Korea and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche and providing a sure guarantee for its victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also lauded him for opening a turning phase of national reunification and firmly defending the world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They said that Kim Jong Un is adding brilliance to the Songun revolutionary idea and feats of Kim Jong Il, expressing confidence that the DPRK would always win victory, holding aloft the great banner of Songun."

A continuacion, las fuerzas aereas y terrestres tambien organizaron respectivamente las unidades ciberneticas. En 2010, nacio la comandancia cibernetica que conduce de modo unificado las acciones militares de las fuerzas armadas norteamericanas para la guerra cibernetica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn octubre de 2012, Obama firmo la orden secreta del presidente sobre la politica de operaciones ciberneticas de EE.UU. Ahora el Departamento de Defensa norteamericano desarrolla armas ciberneticas de nuevo tipo que paralizaran el sistema militar de otros paises aunque no este conectado con Internet.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, EE.UU., enloquecido por la ambicion de hegemonia mundial, prepara el ataque cibernetico de gran dimension contra otros paises. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, la estrategia militar cibernetica de EE.UU. es el tremendo crimen que acarrea la carrera internacional de terrorismo cibernetico y lleva al mundo al caos y destruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, EE.UU. habla como si fuera la mayor victima de ataque cibernetico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVinculando injustamente con la RPDC el ataque cibernetico contra Sony Pictures, armo el alboroto de \"sancion adicional\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa verdadera intencion de EE.UU. es tildar a los paises soberanos, en particular, a los antiyanquis e independientes de terroristas ciberneticos y crear el ambiente favorable al cumplimiento de su guerra cibernetica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta vez, el mayor terrorista cibernetico EE.UU. reconocio a la sociedad internacional que su pais fue el hacker de la red de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe tener presente que su ambicion de tomar la hegemonia mundial mediante la guerra cibernetica es una ilusion nunca realizable."
