This only betrays the political imbeciles' ignorance of the reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nRodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government withdrew from the NPT to defend the supreme interests and sovereignty of the country under the present situation. This was solely for the purpose of self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its toughest measure is neither threat nor blackmail against anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. is floating misinformation that the DPRK's just measure is aimed at wresting a sort of \"concession\" and getting \"economic benefits.\" The U.S. even went to the lengths of making ridiculous remarks that the DPRK will not get any \"aid\" unless it meets the U.S. demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Base and ridiculous is the U.S. trick to defile the DPRK's just toughest measure with unreasonable and distorted assertion and accusations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what misinformation the U.S. floats to slander the DPRK it will not withdraw its principled stance. The further the U.S. escalates its military threat and pressure on the DPRK, the tougher countermeasures it will take to cope with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop misinterpreting the DPRK's principled stance and tough measure and honestly opt for solving the issue with a sound faculty of thinking.    \r\n\r\n"

But this is a penny-worth trick to fool the public opinion at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These joint military exercises are to be staged after the U.S. imperialists have recently deployed scores of B-52, B-1 strategic bombers and several communication commanding and special  reconnaissance planes close to the Korean Peninsula and put the 7th U.S. air force present in South Korea into a \"semi-war state\" under the pretext of coping with an \"emergency\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is increasing the possibility of their preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. which is posing a nuclear threat to Korea by threatening to use nukes. It singled out the DPRK as a target of its preemptive nuclear attack in breach of the DPRK-U.S. joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has systematically breached the statement, refusing to honor its commitments, and shown no positive response to the DPRK's constructive proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Worse still, it is now going to stage such nuclear war exercises as \"Foal Eagle\" and \"Reception, Staging, Onward Movement and Integration\" exercises. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proves that the U.S. is only keen to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK, utterly indifferent to solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is becoming clearer as the days go by that the fuss of the U.S. imperialists about the nuclear issue is nothing but a trick to justify their moves for a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can they conceal the criminal nature of the war drills or realize their wild ambition to invade the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

It is the most advantageous socialist system centered on the popular masses in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system is politically, ideologically, economically and militarily stable and indestructible. Under this powerful system, the people's army and people of the DPRK have always countered any moves of aggression forces with strong courage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. has sustained only failures and serious setbacks in the moves to stifle the DPRK for the last several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yet, the U.S. is still desperately working to strangulate the DPRK. This only betrays its increased zeal for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to clearly understand the socialist system and behave with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can destroy it.    \r\n\r\n"
