But liars have short wings.\n\t\t\t\t\t Persons involved in the heinous politically-motivated case testified to the fact that it was committed under the U.S. aid and with its final approval.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. instigated south Korean intelligence agencies to let human scum form a organization for demolishing statues in the DPRK. It was deeply involved in the whole course of the case while offering them a large amount of money and subversion and sabotage means and even examining and approving the plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that those devoid of elementary morality and conscience can not dare commit so a monstrous \"undertaking\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community was so shocked to find that the U.S. manipulated the terrorist case directly linked with the supreme dignity of a sovereign state despite its loud call for combating terrorism. According to data available, a meeting for U.S. special operations is a regular happening in Florida State. At a recent meeting, a brigadier general of the U.S. Army referred to the importance of spy activities in the DPRK. He said U.S. special units have already kicked off collecting information in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of Defense organized a secret action unit called the defense secret department at the Defense Intelligence Agency, intensifying information collection outside war zones. This organization preferentially aims at such countries as the DPRK, Iran and China. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An official of the U.S. Department of Defense said that the new organization is aimed at letting agents hold right posts in cooperation with the Central Intelligence Agency and collect necessary information. This is not so surprising news.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Information collection by U.S. special units in the DPRK was exposed by the action program of the U.S. Department of Defense which was opened to the public several years ago. The U.S. has prepared \"conflict\" in such a way as rallying agents near the border areas of the DPRK and spreading rumors there to create confusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. set a special item in the national budget every year and has escalated psychological warfare against the DPRK and operations for undermining it while providing a fabulous amount of funds to anti-DPRK plot-breeding organizations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent attempted terrorist act was a violation of international law, which was committed on the line of their extension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Included in the International Anti-terrorism Law are regional conventions on ban of terrorist acts and punishment of terrorists, international convention on prohibition of terrorism by explosives and international convention on banning provision of funds for terrorism. Mentioned in the conventions are violence or threat by violence of life and health of state leaders, government officials and public figures, acts of destroying and disturbing state public properties and use of firepower weapons, explosives and poison for indiscriminative violence, forms of international terrorism. Such acts are bound to be strictly punished as they are international terrorist crimes, and no statute of limitations is applicable to criminals.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should meet the demand of the International Anti-terrorism Law. It can never evade the responsibility for the recent case. It should admit the gravity of the heinous politically-motivated, state-sponsored terrorist act against the DPRK as it acted a back-stage manipulator and make an official apology to the DPRK. The U.S. should punish felons responsible for the terrorist acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. applies two separate standards regarding the punishment of terrorists, it will result in fuelling terrorism, plunging the U.S. mainland into uneasiness and wrecking world peace."

She said it should be called \"forcible 'sexual slavery' for Japanese army\". Following this, the deputy spokesman for the U.S. Department of State made clear the official stand of the U.S. government seeing it as a serious human rights abuse.\n\t\t\t\t\t When the sexual slavery-related remarks by the U.S. secretary of State were opened to the public, Japanese Foreign Minister Genba went busy, confirming it and calling for lodging a protest with the U.S. government.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson says in a bylined commentary Tuesday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This act can be done by a despicable person whose appearance as human being can hardly be found.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese army took away 200,000 Korean women as sexual slaves and ruthlessly violated their bodies and dignity. This was the greatest tragic story in the 20th century which was clearly disclosed by testimonies of victims and historic records. Even the U.S. thinks that it is too much for it to protect its junior ally.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We would like to question the Japanese government that if 200,000 Japanese women suffered the same disgrace, contempt and maltreatment as the Korean women did, what would be the feelings of the Japanese?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's attitude toward the expression of the sexual slavery is a brigandish and shameless one just like a thief crying \"stop the thief!\" No country in the world is as shameless as Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world is set to terminate the inglorious past and open up a new era for reconciliation and cooperation.

Ro Su Hui, vice-chairman of the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification, was thrown to the ground and carried off in a headlock by the south Korean regime in early July. Ro visited Pyongyang to pay respects at ceremonies to mark the 100th day after the death of general secretary Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arrest made a very small splash in the western media, because it didn't square easily with the message that has been delivered by media outlets in Europe and the U.S. for the last two decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In fact it is almost impossible to find any piece of positive European journalism relating to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The lack of western sources in north Korea has allowed the media to conjure up fantastic stories that enthrall readers but aren't grounded in hard fact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These roles are dusted off whenever there are flare-ups. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the south Korean navy ship, the Cheonan, sank on March 26, 2010, the south Koreans accused their neighbours of having fired a torpedo. A detailed rebuttal by North Korea's military was disregarded by the wider world, as was the offer to aid an open investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean public wasn't widely convinced of north Korean involvement\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While north Korean actions are condemned and derided, very few column inches are devoted to scrutiny of south Korea's \"president\" Lee Myung-bak and his oppressive policies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They prosecute anyone speaking in favour of north Korea or communism in general. There are frequent reports of detention without trial, human rights abuses and clampdowns on freedom of speech. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhatever your view on the actions of north and south Korea's governments, the hypocrisy of using one-sided journalism to label north Korea a rogue, propaganda-led state is surely self-evident and fans the fire of intolerance and animosity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Korean divide is a complex, multi-faceted political situation. Nobody benefits from turning it into a moral melodrama and we should demand more from our supposedly impartial media."
