It is an intolerable challenge to those workers calling for democracy and vital rights and an open violation of justice and human rights.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters should draw a serious lesson from the miserable end of their preceding dictators who met their doom while getting frantic in the suppression of the workers and people and discontinue cracking down on the just struggle of the KCTU and the workers under it and other people without delay.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The statement expressed the expectation that the international working class movement organizations, trade unions of all countries and the workers affiliated with them will lift voices of justice denouncing the South Korean ruling quarters' suppression of the labour movement and extend greater support and solidarity to the just struggle of the South Korean workers. \r\n\r\n"

It is a premeditated intrigue to kick up a new whirlwind of suppression of the labour movement and throw a wet blanket over the atmosphere of solidarity between workers in the north and south.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters should discontinue layoff and \"restructuring\" at once, ensure democratic freedom and rights of the workers including the three rights of labour  unconditionally and set free all the arrested workers and people promptly as demanded by the workers. \r\n\r\n"

This is the truth recognized by the world people.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il who has flawlessly personified Kim Il Sung's steadfast stand of anti-imperialist independence is the invincible commander who is gaining control over the formidable imperialist enemy in a high-handed manner and turning it to play in his hands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Only one country in the present world, socialist Korea, led by Kim Jong Il is displaying its power as the sole rival which stands face to face with the United States styling itself the \"only superpower in the world\" and which showers fire upon it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea is, indeed, a model country proving validity and invincibility of socialism and an ideal country representing the future of the 21st century, and Kim Jong Il is the soul and heart of Korea and the symbol of all victories and successes.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He published important works in time which are consistent with resolute faith, coherent logic and profound truth to expose sophism of the imperialists and socialist renegades and clearly indicate the road ahead of history. Today the socialist movement is greeting the era guided by the great Juche idea, centering on him and the Worker's Party of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that there is his guidance, the moves of the imperialists to make the world capitalist and \"integral\" will be smashed and the world of independence where the Juche idea will prevail will come. \r\n   The human cause of independence, the cause of socialism, is sure to win. \r\n\r\n"

He, not minding muddy roads of the rainy countryside, swamps of tidelands and steep mountain roads and passes, called on farmers and turned the Hwangju Kindung plain, the Singye Miru plain, Paekmu plateau, tidelands on the west coast and all other lands of the country, which were once neglected as barren lands, into fertile lands.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEven an advanced age of 80, he made a long journey ranging from Yonsa county, North Hamgyong Province, and the Paekmu plateau, Ryangang Province, in northern tips of the country to the Yonbaek plain adjacent to the demarcation line, and visited the Kumdang Cooperative Farm in Onchon county, South Phyongan Province, and the Taesong District Cooperative Farm, Pyongyang, in June 1994, the last year of his great life, and consulted farmers about the farming problem of the country one by one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The best Juche method of farming, new agricultural guidance system and theses on the socialist rural question were established by him reflecting the will of farmers during his on-site guidance.\r\n   Indeed, a new era of irrigation, electrification, mechanization and application of chemical fertilizers in the countryside has come under his great loving care. \r\n\r\n  \r\n"
