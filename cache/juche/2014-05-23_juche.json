This cannot be interpreted as a truly responsible stand but it is a revelation of the intention to contain the people through hard-line steps.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a nutshell, one can hardly understand for what Park would like to be responsible as there was no reflection in her talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The measures mentioned in the talk are not what should be immediately done by her, the commentary said, stressing that she should clarify how she is going to probe the truth together with the people, before taking a half-baked initiative.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t People will never overlook Park seeking to shirk off the responsibility by making public the talk, the commentary noted, stressing that they would clarify for what she should take responsibility."
