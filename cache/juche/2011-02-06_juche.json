            "content": "US \"Engagement\" Policy Slashed--Rodong Sinmun\r\nPyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun, a major newspaper of the DPRK, terms \"engagement\" advocated by the U.S. a synonym for aggression, war and interference. \n\t\t\t\t\t In a bylined article on Sunday, the newspaper says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"engagement\" policy, one of the methods employed by the U.S. authorities, reveals their intention to control all other countries and regions and make the world move under the U.S. direction by interfering in their matters. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under the veil of \"engagement\" the U.S. has interfered in the internal affairs of other countries politically and militarily.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. authorities criticize other political modes different from the U.S. and western-style ones as \"wrong\", asserting that they should follow the U.S.-style political system through their \"political reforms.\" This is intended to convert other countries' political system and life into the American way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. call for \"enlarged multilateral engagement\" with Asian countries comes out of its cunning trick to put them under its control by escalating its \"engagement\" in their various matters arising in the political field.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has enforced the military intervention policy under the pretext of \"regional security\" and \"control over dispute\", whenever unexpected armed disputes and disorder happened in different regions and countries. Prompted by such way of thinking and stand, the U.S. is pursuing the military \"engagement\" policy aimed at maintaining its superiority over strength in various regions of the world and expanding its power sphere.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This military \"engagement\" policy of the U.S. is getting evermore pronounced in Northeast Asia and especially the Korean Peninsula at present. This policy is mainly aimed to stifle the DPRK and realize the U.S. rule over the whole area of Korea. The situation of the peninsula is becoming more strained and practical danger is growing serious due to the U.S. whereby another Korean war may break out at any moment."

Korea Military Talks Criticized\r\n Pyongyang, February 6 (KCNA) -- Japan's defence minister recently had talks with his south Korean counterpart, in which they agreed to hold defence ministerial and vice-ministerial talks in turn once in a year. This means that Japan will start a new dangerous military collusion with south Korea, says Rodong Sinmun, a major newspaper of the DPRK, in a bylined article on Sunday.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarist forces' escalated scheme for a military agreement with south Korea shows that they are impudently running towards reinvasion as they have become puffed by the moves for turning Japan into a military giant, the article points out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It further says:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's military confab with south Korea is intended to speed up the moves to build a U.S.-Japan-south Korea military alliance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese militarist forces have designated the DPRK as the first target of their reinvasion of Asia. They are running wild to realize their ambition for staging a comeback to Korea, riding on the war chariot of their U.S. master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never pardon those forces who committed indelible war crimes against the Korean nation in the past and frantically seek to set out on the road of reinvasion again under the U.S. umbrella of war in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion of Korea are as good as inviting their own destruction. They should squarely see the pent-up hostility of the Korean army and people toward Japan and stop at once the criminal scheme for triangular military alliance and reinvasion of Korea through establishment of military alliance with south Korea."
