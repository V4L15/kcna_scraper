            "content": "KCNA Refutes IAEA Director General's Remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- El-Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), reportedly let loose a string of absurd remarks at the U.S. Congress recently that north Korea's pursuance of the development of nuclear weapons is likely to send the worst signal to other countries and that north Korea has not implemented the NPT at all.\r\n His remarks go to prove that the IAEA is acting a waiting maid of the U.S. because it is only echoing Washington's assertion that the DPRK should drop its nuclear weapons program first, failing to understand the origin and nature of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., away from its principle of impartiality as an international organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is widely known that the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. surfaced as the U.S. has ceaselessly bolstered the latest nuclear combat equipment in south Korea, increasing its nuclear threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Dialogue\" and \"diplomacy\" on the lips of the U.S. as regards the nuclear issue are nothing but hypocrisy aimed to gain time. It is an undeniable fact that what the U.S. really seeks is not to let the DPRK move from the negotiating table but increase pressure upon it in every aspect and escalate the nuclear stand-off behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's nuclear deterrent for self-defence can never be \"the primary international security concern\" as it is totally aimed to cope with the nuclear threat of the U.S. It is, therefore, nonsensical that the DPRK's nuclear deterrent sends the \"worst signal\" to other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Concern\" and \"signal\" touted by El-Baradei fully reflect the crafty intention of the U.S. to lay an \"international siege\" to the DPRK on the charge of being a \"nuclear criminal\" in a bid to isolate and stifle the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n El-Baradei, insensible to the reality, talked again about the DPRK's non-compliance with the NPT. This is an unreasonable remark ignoring the sovereignty of the DPRK as it is not obliged to implement the NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, in order not to allow the supreme interests of the state to be encroached upon any longer, the DPRK government in a statement issued on January 10, 2003 declared that its withdrawal from the NPT which had been temporarily suspended would automatically and immediately take effect. The DPRK thus completely pulled out of the NPT on January 11, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, El-Baradei is still pulling up the DPRK this or that way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly shows how shamelessly he is working to apply the same method of inspection to the DPRK as that applied in inspecting Iraq as a prelude to the U.S. aggression against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the IAEA is truly interested in the nuclear non-proliferation, it should call the U.S. unreasonable action into question before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IAEA fully disclosed its true colours as a servant of the U.S. by pressurizing the DPRK to comply with the NPT though it is no longer a signatory to it, turning a blind eye to the U.S. wanton violation of it and U.S. escalation of the nuclear threat to the DPRK. El- Baradei was impudent enough to talk about \"enriched uranium program\" and the like as dictated by his master, oblivious of his position as the boss of an international organization. He should be ashamed of behaving like that way.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Some days ago, U.S. Defense Secretary Rumsfeld openly hinted at an attempt to develop nuclear weapons capable of penetrating underground at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations Committee. The director of the U.S. National Nuclear Security Agency in a lecture blustered that the U.S. would not hesitate to resume the nuclear test, if necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This eloquently proves that the Bush administration is, indeed, a group of warmongers without an equal in the world, the sworn enemy of humankind, the ringleaders of worldwide nuclear threat and proliferation and a wrecker of the world peace. \r\n The DPRK is the main target of the U.S.-planned horrible nuclear war. That is why the Bush administration is further aggravating the situation while deliberately throwing a hurdle in the way of the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 26 (KCNA) -- National security depends on the definite withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea to the last man.\r\n In the wake of the U.S. recent announcement of its plan to send some of its aggressor forces in south Korea to Iraq under the pretext of \"urgent Iraqi situation\" and \"redeployment of its forces overseas\" the ultra-right conservative forces of south Korea are making much ado in a bid to keep them in s. Korea. They are making shrill cries intended to create the impression that a war would break out any moment due to what they call \"security gap.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard a spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) Tuesday issued a statement denouncing this ridiculous behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. planned transfer of some of its forces in south Korea to Iraq is a product of its cunning scheme to reuse the old \"theory of security\" for stamping out the independent movement against the U.S. in south Korea, reviving the moribund ultra-right conservative forces and rounding off the war scenario against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace and security on the Korean peninsula can never be guaranteed by the U.S. It is the common task of the Koreans in the north and the south to preserve them through national cooperation by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of the south Korean people for independence and democracy will never come true nor the whole Korean nation will escape a nuclear holocaust to be imposed by the U.S. upon it as long as the U.S. imperialist aggression troops remain in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation lives in the era to implement the June 15 joint declaration and the era of national cooperation. It has powerful Songun politics aimed to protect the whole country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are called upon to vigorously turn out in the struggle to force the U.S. aggression forces out of south Korea to the last man, deeply aware of national independence    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. must be quite well aware of this, not being blind and deaf. However, it has gone so impudent as to kick up a ruckus, wagging its tongue over human rights performance and democracy in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. must stand in the dock of the Human Rights Court of its own accord to face a stern judgment as demanded by the world and human conscience and pull back all its troops who are committing human rights abuses in south Korea and other countries and regions.
