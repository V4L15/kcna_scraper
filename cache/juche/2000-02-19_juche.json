This strategy of his was, indeed, brilliant and peerlessly superb. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In particular, he gave precious teachings as regards the situation of Chongryon and its true course to follow. The teachings were a great program for the movement of overseas Koreans, the kind that could be advanced only by a distinguished leader of matchless ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On the political ability of the Marshal, the article said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the 1990s he smashed the imperialists' isolation and suffocation moves and defended socialism and launched a great advance for building a powerful nation in Korea. This victory represented a great monument of history, a result of his distinguished leadership ability and political ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was also the result of the army-first politics, the embodiment of his unique idea of attaching importance to the military affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His political ability is displayed by the leadership ability that turns impossibility into possibility. The single-hearted unity of Korea, a fundamental basis for the building of a powerful nation, has been achieved by his political ability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A man capable of moving a person is regarded as a great man of best ability. Our Marshal has this best ability to touch the hearts of all people and move the world with warm love and kindness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Possessed of the best ability in the world in the present era characterized by competence, our Marshal is the greatest genius and the greatest man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So I want to declare to the world with a high pride that his ability has such mysterious strength as giving energy and wisdom, wellbeing and success to progressive mankind, while bringing frustration and fear, failure and destruction to the reactionaries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ability of General Secretary Kim Jong Il will turn the 21st century into a century of Kim Jong Il as it did in the 20th century. \r\n\r\n"
