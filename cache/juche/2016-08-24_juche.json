It decided to expand the military exchange and cooperation such as conclusion of an agreement on the protection of the military information with Japan, establishment of more hotlines between the defence authorities, inspection of the military drills and mutual visits of aircrafts and warships on several occasions such as the \"2016 Asia security meeting\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They resumed the south Korean puppet Navy's training flotilla's entrance into Japanese ports, which had been stopped over the past five years and are stepping up the establishment of the system of sharing information among the U.S., Japan and south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces' ever more undisguised military nexus with Japan is not just the simple military and diplomatic act but a challenge to the desire of the compatriots to settle accounts with Japan for its past crimes without fail and thrice-cursed treacherous one of opening the way for the sworn enemy of the Korean nation to launch reinvasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan which had committed the unprecedented crimes after occupying Korea in the last century still work with bloodshot eyes to reinvade Korea, denying the admission, apology and reparation for its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean peninsula is the first target of Japan's exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, Japan which provided a springboard for openly advancing to the Korean peninsula with the amendment of the \"U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines\" set the DPRK as the first target, talking about the \"automatic involvement of the \"Self-Defense Forces' in emergency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries' ambition to occupy the Korean peninsula again and reduce the Korean nation into its colonial slaves has reached the phase which can no longer be overlooked.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard fact, the south Korean puppet group, steeped in pro-Japanese flunkeyism, is kowtowing to the Japanese reactionaries, far from protesting against their moves for revival of militarism and reinvasion.

The U.S. ruin is the law that governs the development of history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fully support the statement issued by the spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the KPA."
