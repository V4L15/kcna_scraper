They denounced the U.S. imperialist aggressors for occupying South Korea still now in the new century and scheming to unleash another war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They warned that if the U.S. imperialist aggressors opt for confrontation and war in disregard of the desire of the Korean people, they will be given a stern judgment by history. They strongly demanded the U.S. imperialists face up to the trend of the times and withdraw from South Korea at once, taking nuclear weapons and all other combat equipment along with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Similar rallies were also held in cities and counties.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Ri Hoe Chang's anti-north jargon blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 2 (KCNA) -- South Korean political commentator Mun Song Hyon wrote an article titled \"shedding searchlight on talk about 'transparency about north,'\" according to Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation.\r\n He in the article dismissed South Korean presidential candidate Ri Hoe Chang's jargon about \"transparency about the north\" as a replica of the Bush administration's hostile hard-line policy toward the north and part of the anti-north campaign intended to slander, isolate and stifle the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By \"transparency about the north\" Ri means \"transparency about the north's weapons of mass destruction\" and \"transparency about the north-related undertakings,\" the article says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His talk about \"transparency about the north's weapons of mass destruction\" is nothing but a brigandish demand for the north's meek dismantling of its non-existent nukes, missiles and conventional weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The threat of weapons of mass destruction to peace on the Korean Peninsula comes not from the north but from the south. \r\n There are nearly 40,000 U.S. troops in South Korea and more than 1,000 nuclear weapons, a huge amount of depleted uranium shells, tens of thousands of tons of poisonous substance and chemical bombs are stockpiled there. Moreover, war exercises under the simulated conditions of invasion of the north are being conducted on a daily basis. these facts prove that the weapons of mass destruction of the U.S. forces present in South Korea are not \"war deterrent forces\" to prevent \"invasion from  the north\" but means to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remark about \"transparency about north-related undertakings\" is also no more than anti-DPRK vituperation full of nonsense and jargons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri's assertion that \"aid to the north has been used for increasing the north's military strength\" is a treacherous jargon intended to put a brake on the process for south-north contacts, exchange, reconciliation and cooperation now under way, pursuant to the June 15 joint declaration. This is also anti-reunification behaviour designed to divert the trend of the history toward reunification to that in the cold war era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In reality there is a drain on resources in South Korea for the sake of the United States, not for the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An astronomically huge amount of taxes collected from the South Koreans are going into the pockets of the bosses of the white house and wall street for diverse purposes, for the upkeep of the U.S. forces in South Korea and the purchase of U.S.-made outdated weapons, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His noisy clamor about \"transparency about the north\" is intended to join the U.S. in its efforts to hamstring the process for inter-Korean reconciliation and unity which have been in  good process since the publication of the joint declaration and incite mistrust, antagonism and hostility in a bid to bring these relations back to those in the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By fanning up confrontation between fellow countrymen he also seeks to enlist support from his U.S. master and gratify his greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon the South Koreans from all walks of life to turn out in a struggle to eliminate the pro-U.S. Ri Hoe Chang group keen on stifling fellow countrymen.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"
