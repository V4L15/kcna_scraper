He stressed that as the combat aim of the People's Army is to annihilate the U.S. imperialist aggressors and achieve the cause of national reunification, the army should always invariably hold up this slogan.\r\n   The KPA soldiers, inspired by Kim Jong Il's thorough and resolute will, are levelling guns of revenge at the enemies, with burning hatred.\r\n   The slogan full of the fighting spirit to annihilate the enemies was shouted loudly like a flaming volcano at meetings held across the country to support the statement issued by a spokesman for the KPA general staff to provide against the reckless new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists. \r\n   \r\n  \r\n"

Crying for the socalled \"theory on conquering Korea\" more than 100 years ago, Japan tried to occupy the whole of Korea and make it a colony. The Japanese militarists made full preparations for a war according to the belligerent \"theory on conquering Korea\", created the \"Unyo-Maru\" incident in 1875 and invaded Korea in real earnest. \r\n   Japan illegally occupied Korea in 1905 and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes, disasters and sufferings upon the Korean people during its 40-odd-year colonial rule.\r\n   After its defeat in august Juche 34 (1945), Japan has begun to revive militarism  and gain a foothold for staging a comeback to Korea at the instigation of the United States.\r\n   It gave spurs to the production of ammunitions for the U.S. preparations for a war of aggression on Korea.  During the war (June 1950-July 1953) it left its territory to the mercy of the United States as logistic, sortie and action bases, hurled huge armed forces and equipment into the war and acted as a guide and a shock brigade in many operations.\r\n   Over more than 40 years after the war it has not abandoned its ambition for aggression on Korea but resorted to the heinous anti-DPRK campaign, tailing behind the United States.\r\n   If Japan recklessly joins in the U.S. second war of aggression on Korea, the Korean people will take this opportunity to wreak grudge of more than 100 years upon it.\r\n \r\n"

This is the U.S. trite method.\r\n   In order to break the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and unleash a war against the DPRK, the U.S. raised \"nuclear suspicion\" over an underground facility in the DPRK, thus pushing the situation of the Korean peninsula to the extreme pitch of strain. \r\n   Not content with the racket, it invented another fiction of possible missile launch.\r\n   Its behaviour eloquently shows how much the United States is embarrassed by the DPRK's self-defensive military power capable of eliminating the source of aggression and war on this earth.\r\n   The U.S. had better act with discretion, clearly aware of the DPRK's powerful military strength fully equipped with both offensive and defensive means. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
