Under this situation the country cannot but be reunified by federal formula in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The ardent desire of the nation for reunification will come true if the reunification of the nation is achieved to rejoin the severed blood ties of fellow countrymen though the two differing systems do not become one.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the country is reunified by federal formula, it will not entail any serious aftermath and \"expenses for reunification\" as it happened in the country which had been reunified by way of uniting two systems.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Moreover, this reunification formula will allay the worries of individuals and organisations over losing their material and mental wealth after reunification and provide for the protection of the rights and interests sought by foreign capital invested before it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unique way of reunifying the country by federal formula based on the conception of one nation, one state, two systems and two governments was clearly indicated by the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo announced by the great leader President Kim Il Sung two decades back, the article stresses.     \r\n\r\n"
