Under this situation the country cannot but be reunified by federal formula in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   The ardent desire of the nation for reunification will come true if the reunification of the nation is achieved to rejoin the severed blood ties of fellow countrymen though the two differing systems do not become one.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the country is reunified by federal formula, it will not entail any serious aftermath and \"expenses for reunification\" as it happened in the country which had been reunified by way of uniting two systems.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n   Moreover, this reunification formula will allay the worries of individuals and organisations over losing their material and mental wealth after reunification and provide for the protection of the rights and interests sought by foreign capital invested before it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The unique way of reunifying the country by federal formula based on the conception of one nation, one state, two systems and two governments was clearly indicated by the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo announced by the great leader President Kim Il Sung two decades back, the article stresses.     \r\n\r\n"

He wisely steered the nation's struggle for national reunification, thus escalating the movement for national reunification into a nationwide movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The line of national reunification set forth by him shows the only just way of establishing the sovereignty of the country and the nation, exalting its dignity and honor and achieving its prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Right after liberation he roused the nation to a nationwide struggle to establish  a unified government in Korea and paved the way for dialogue and negotiations between the north and south, bringing thaw in their frozen relations, and led the nation to adopt a joint declaration and agreement, thus opening a new phase in the movement for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He set forth three-point charter of national reunification in which a fundamental principle and way of national reunification were laid down, and thus provided the nation with a guiding principle which should be held fast to in carrying out the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles--independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity--are the cornerstone of national reunification which clarifies the main position and way of solving the reunification issue by the efforts of the nation itself in conformity with the will and interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ten-point programme of great unity of the nation for national reunification is a political programme for achieving the unity of the entire nation and strengthening the driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo serves as a blueprint which offers a picture of the unified state and ways of building it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great leader rallied the entire nation under the banner of the great national unity to prepare the driving force for national reunification and further strengthened  it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He let those with strength dedicate strength, those with knowledge contribute knowledge and those with money donate money and thus enabled all the compatriots from all walks of life in the north, south and abroad to make a tangible contribution to the cause of national reunification out of patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Indeed, the exploits performed by the great leader in the cause of national reunification brilliantly recorded in the history of the nation will be immortal.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
