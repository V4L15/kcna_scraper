He explained the motive of his testimony, saying that he is unable to indemnify for the wrongs but would like to swallow his pride and let people know what he did: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This testimony and confession made by the ex-soldier of the Imperial Japanese Army out of conscience represent the Japanese people's criticism of the unreasonable stance and attitude of the Japanese authorities towards the compensation for Japan's past crimes including the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a war criminal state that invaded Korea and other Asian countries and committed crimes against humanity in the past, something unprecedented in human history. But it has not yet clearly liquidated its past nor honestly repented of nor apologized for its state-sponsored crimes though over half a century has passed after its defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has been persistent in its moves to evade its responsibility for liquidating its past stipulated in the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration, clamoring about the \"issue of abduction\" after the publication of the declaration. It is intolerable as it is the most dastardly behavior from a political and moral point of view. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is pulling up the DPRK over the \"issue of settling the abduction issue\", talking about the \"people's sentiment.\" It is not because it respects the people's conscience but seeks to evade its responsibility to redeem its past wrongs at any cost, the prerequisite to normalizing the relations between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the abduction issue is concerned, it is a product of Japan's crime-woven past and hostile policy towards the DPRK and it has already been solved with the publication of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly pays attention to its people's sentiment and is concerned for it, it should lend an ear to the confession of eyewitnesses of the past history and properly solve the issue of liquidating its past in order to prevent the repetition of its disgraceful crime-woven past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. administration and brasshats made this demand to the south Korean authorities and military through various channels and are now persisting in this coercive demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have never shown concern about nor have any interests in the troop dispatch to Iraq. They were dead set against the U.S. invasion of Iraq itself from the beginning. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is trying to force south Korea to dispatch troops to Iraq, defying the strong protest of the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis clearly reveals once again the robber-like color of the arrogant aggressors and dominationists who only pursue their unilateral interests, paying no heed to the demands and interests of other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Troop dispatch to Iraq would do so harm but not any good to the south Korean people as it would result in damaging national dignity and sovereignty and putting fellow countrymen on the altar for outside forces by offering them as bullet shields in the latter's dirty war of aggression for their interests, bowing to their demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is the very one that gave rise to the issue of additional troop dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
