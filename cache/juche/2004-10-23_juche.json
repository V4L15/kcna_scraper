It consists of a tunnel path and the room of corpses. The tunnel path is 204cm long, 132cm wide and 153cm high and the room is 324cm long, 174cm wide and 170cm high. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the center of the room is a coffin platform on which were found remains of two bodies which appeared to be a couple. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Inside the tomb there were various murals including figure and genre paintings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Painted on the lower part of the northern wall of the corpse room were human legs wearing white puttees and shoes and on pieces of plastered wall that fell off were an unworldly man on a lotus and beautiful lotus-pattern ornaments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Collected in the room were tens of pieces of relics including a guild bronze plate of lotus-pattern ornaments, a bronze ring of a box, a bronze corner ornament, a bronze nail of tack-type, an inkstone, iron nails for the coffin and earthenwares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tomb is attracting the interests of scholars as its structure is the type of earth tomb with an oblong stone-walled room of a plain ceiling like Kumsong-ri Tomb No. 1 and the relics discovered there are typical ones representing the Palhae period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Archaeological Society closely examined the results of the excavation of the mural tomb in Kumsong-ri and confirmed that it is the first mural tomb of Palhae to be known in the Korean territory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The discovery of the tomb is a precious achievement that proves the excellent cultural standard and independence of Palhae, a full-fledged sovereign state in the mediaeval history of Korea, and enhances the national dignity and pride of the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Especially, it was a remarkable event brilliantly decorating the chronicle of this friendship that Kim Jong Il visited China in April and had cordial meetings and talks with the new collective leadership of China, registering an enormous success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The China visit of a DPRK state delegation in the wake of the visit to the DPRK by a party and government delegation of China on the occasion of the 55th anniversary of diplomatic ties between the two countries put fresh vitality into friendship between the two countries and this delighted the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The boosting of bilateral friendly relations is the driving force in creating an international climate favorable for ensuring peace and security in Asia and propelling socialist construction in the two countries.

Paektu in July Juche 26 (1937) and the meeting of military and political cadres of the KPRA in Caoshuitan in August on the same year and led the operation to harass the rear of the enemy to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It tells about how he led the struggle to escalate the anti-Japanese armed struggle deep into the homeland and step up the preparations for all-people resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book deals with the fierce mass anti-Japanese resistance offered by people from all walks of life across the country against the Japanese imperialists' continental war of aggression, their economic plunder and policy for obliterating Korean culture under the guidance of the organizations of the party and the Association for the Restoration of the Fatherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It explains in detail the wise leadership of the President who published the immortal work \"The Tasks of Korean Communists,\" thus fully equipping the members of the KPRA and the Korean revolutionaries with a transparent stance of independence and faith of sure victory at a time when the revolution faced grave difficulties after many revolutionary organizations were destroyed by the Japanese imperialists in the wake of the \"Hyesan Incident\" fabricated by them in the autumn of 1937. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book deals with the immortal feats the President performed by wisely organizing the efforts to train core forces for all-people resistance, develop different armed organizations into powerful ones for an armed uprising and the struggle to frustrate the Japanese imperialists' moves to escalate their continental war of aggression and save the 1st Corps of the Anti-Japanese Allied Forces of Northeast China from the siege of the enemy during its reckless expedition to Rehe.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This left on us the strong impression that he is rather the mouthpiece for some right-wing hardliners of Japan who takes the lead in the hostile policy toward the DPRK than foreign minister. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remarks are a plain violation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is compelled to note that his anti-DPRK remarks are not unrelated to the recent Japan trip of U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Armitage. The increasing crescendo of Machimura's provocative outpourings against the DPRK alludes that he was given a sharp fillip by his American master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An inter-governmental working-level contact is expected between the DPRK and Japan in November. At this momentous juncture, Japan is dancing to the tune of others, while getting on the nerve of its partner in the contact. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Things would be more serious if the hostile intention against the DPRK revealed by Machimura's remarks represented the official stand of the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would result in Japan itself forcing the DPRK to reconsider the matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration laid down the main principle in improving the bilateral relations. All the issues between the two countries can be solved along a smooth course when both the DPRK and Japan remain strictly true to the main principle and spirit of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK is seriously concerned over the possible turns and twists ahead of its relations with Japan in view of the faithless acts of Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Issue of Resuming Six-Party Talks\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry Friday gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA as regards a series of stories spread by the United States recently about the issue of resuming the six-party talks:\r\n On October 15 a spokesman for the U.S. State Department falsified the fact by claiming that the present deadlock is due to the DPRK's failure to respond to the six-party talks and clarified that its Secretary Powel would visit some participating countries to discuss the resumption of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It admits of no argument that the six-party talks for a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue could not be resumed because its groundwork was destroyed by the U.S. and south Korea's nuclear issue surfaced, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the U.S. is talking this or that about the issue of the resumption of the talks, paying no heed to the call of the DPRK for restoring that groundwork of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was proposed by the DPRK before any others as early as in the middle of the 1980s. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As for the six-party talks, they were proposed and translated into reality by the DPRK before any others to seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. So the DPRK is responsible for the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard fact, the U.S. foolishly tries to lay the blame for the delay in the resumption of the six-party talks at the DPRK's door, advertising the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was its invention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is approaching the six-party talks strictly in its interests. In other words, it will attend the talks if they prove helpful to it as it realized them to settle the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFor the DPRK to respond to the talks under the coercion and pressure from someone, though it is well aware that they are of no help to it, has nothing in common with its principled stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Participating countries should face up to the reality before peddling the issue of opening the next round of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is becoming evermore undisguised in its hostile acts against the DPRK as evidenced by PSI exercises staged to blockade and stifle the DPRK and the signing of the \"North Korean Human Rights Act\" by its president. It has gone the lengths of foolishly working to bring up the nuclear issue for discussion at the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everybody that it is hard to open the talks now that the dialogue partner is totally denied and pressurized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peddling this issue despite this hard reality would only invite scoff of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The U.S. oft-repeated call for the resumption of the talks would only glaringly prove that it is playing a piece of sleight of hand in the run-up to the presidential election. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If that is not the real intention of the U.S., the DPRK would like to ask the U.S. whether the groundwork of the talks has been restored as demanded by the DPRK, whether it is ready to drop its hostile policy towards Pyongyang and participate in making \"reward for freeze,\" the first-phase measure of the proposal for a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions and discuss south Korea's nuclear issue before anything else with a view to denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop busying itself to build up public opinion in a bid to cover up its evermore undisguised hostile acts against the DPRK and make good preparations to fully consider all its demands. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the six-party talks depends on whether the U.S. is ready to fully consider the demands raised by the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
