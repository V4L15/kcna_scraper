The U.S. nuke-is-all-powerful theory will never work on any part of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those fond of playing with fire are bound to perish in the flames kindled by themselves, the commentary observes, urging the Bush administration not to forget the lesson taught by history but immediately drop its anachronistic policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
