This is patent proof that the economy of the country decidedly entered upon the road of rejuvenation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fresh progress was noticed in grain production under the wise leadership of the WPK which designated the agricultural front as the main front in socialist economic construction last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 130 major objects of construction and of reconstruction and modernization were successfully completed to put fresh muscles into the nation's economic foundation.\r\n Great efforts were directed to scientific researches and introduction of advanced science and technology last year along the Party's line of attaching importance to science and technology. As a result, over 1,050 plan targets of scientific and technological development including major objects of the state were successfully beaten to satisfactorily solve scientific and technological problems arising in the technological reconstruction and modernization of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Progress was made in educational and cultural building last year to give fuller play to the advantages of the Party's Juche-oriented policy of education and popular policy of health care. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these successes in economic and cultural construction last year, the reporter stated, were brilliant fruits reaped by the experienced and tested political ability of the Party reliably carrying forward and bringing to accomplishment the revolutionary cause of Juche under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter outlined tasks arising in giving full scope to the advantages of Korean-style socialism in all fields of politics, military affairs, economy and culture by putting another spur to the general march for Songun revolution under the militant slogan of the Party \"Let us make a new leap in the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation with the might of Songun!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cabinet will hold fast to the principle of giving top priority to the increase of military capabilities in all fields of socialist construction and ensure with a sense of responsibility material supplies for the development of defense industry as required by the line of economic construction in the era of Songun, upholding the Songun revolutionary leadership of the WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the most important task facing the Cabinet this year to effect  a decisive turn in economic development and people's living by launching an all-out offensive in all fronts of the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main task in the economic work this year is to fully solve the food problem of the people by decisively increasing agricultural production, radically bolster up coal and metal production and make a leap in rebuilding and modernizing the overall national economy and rejuvenating production, thus giving unreserved scope to the might of the socialist self-reliant national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Cabinet will bring a radical turn in implementing the Party's line of attaching importance to science and technology with this SPA session as a momentum.\r\n This year, too, the Cabinet will put great efforts into improving services for the people and bolstering land upbuilding and city management as the householder responsible for the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will pay deep attention to the improvement of external economic activities as required by the changed circumstances and realistic demand so as to consolidate the export bases in all domains of the national economy, steadily increase the items and production of exports, actively explore new foreign markets and make foreign trade diversified and many-sided. And it will engage itself in brisk external economic cooperation including joint venture and collaboration with overseas Korean traders and manufacturers and foreign enterprises on the principle of assimilating advanced technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It will also direct sizable efforts to the accelerated building of socialist culture this year to give free rein to the advantages of socialist culture in the era of Songun.\r\n The tasks facing the Cabinet are vast and difficulties and ordeals are still lying in the way of its activities this year. But there is no difficulty insurmountable and no fortress unconquerable as there are the invincible Songun revolutionary leadership of the Party, the heroic people and the reliable foundation of the self-reliant national economy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The IC (integrated circuit) designing technology was put on a high level, the Korean-style computer-operating system and nanotechnology-based equipment developed and the latest technology developed and introduced into the prospecting of underground resources.\r\n Technology has made rapid progress in various major fields, the ranks of scientists and technicians have grown stronger and the material and technological foundations have been consolidated to develop the nation's science and technology as required by the work to update the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe are faced with the important tasks to develop ultra-modern science and technology rapidly, put the nation's science and technology on an advanced, high level in a short span of time by our own efforts in reliance on the existing foundations and potentials and provide a sure scientific and technological guarantee for the building of a great prosperous powerful nation the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the present, it is important to carry through the existing five-year plan for the development of science and technology and work out well the next five-year plan ending Juche 101 (2012), the 100th birth anniversary of President Kim Il Sung, and make thorough preparations for its implementation. It is also necessary to map out a strategy for scientific and technological development ending Juche 111 (2022) so as to definitely put the nation on a position of a scientific and technological power.\r\n What is important for the scientific and technological field at present is to build up a solid foundation for the latest science and technology and ultra-modern industry, solve the urgent economic problems, including food and energy problems, on a preferential basis and step up the updating of major industrial domains in the direction of strengthening the Juche character of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the field of hardcore basic technology it is urgent to build a nationwide information network and develop programming technology rapidly and thus turn our country into a power in software development. Efforts should be channeled into building a nano material industry and producing good breeds by dint of bio-engineering.\r\n It is important to lay more solid foundations for the development of space technology and oceanography and direct efforts to the basic scientific researches so as to intensively solve the theoretical and methodological problems pending an urgent solution for the development of the latest science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Big efforts should be exerted to build high-tech production bases in the areas where scientific and technological forces are concentrated and the intellectuals training, research and development and production are closely inter-linked. Then this will help set up centres for gradually updating the nation's economy into the one centered on the high-tech industry. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Great efforts will also be directed to the development of technology in important sectors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In agricultural science, it is urgent to cultivate and introduce high-yielding strains suited to the ecological and regional conditions and double-cropping through a brisk drive to bring about a radical turn in seed improvement and solve the scientific and technological problems arising in putting the agricultural production on a scientific basis and realizing the comprehensive mechanization of agriculture.\r\n The field of energy technology is faced with the tasks to develop the nation's fuel and power resources in a big way, speed up the technological modernization of the existing power stations, intensify the research and development of know-how to use such renewable energies as wind power and bio-energy while widely introducing advanced energy-saving technology and put the management of energy on a scientific basis.\r\n Particularly big efforts should be made to industrialize the method of producing iron with locally available raw materials, build a large-scale fertilizer industry based on coal gasification, develop the technology for oil exploration and processing to pave a wide avenue for developing the chemical industry and mine and process on the basis of up-to-date technology such underground resources abundant in the country as lead, zinc, magnesite, graphite, silica and building stone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successful fulfillment of the above-said long-term plan would help rapidly develop the nation's science and technology on a higher level and definitely put the national economy on a fresh scientific and technological basis as required by the IT age.\r\n It is essential to improve the content, quality and method of education in the direction of intensifying the basic education and the education in ultra-modern science and technology as required by the trend of scientific and technological development in the new century and thus produce more highly qualified scientists and technicians. \r\n Scientific and technological research institutions and universities and industrial establishments should actively introduce any advanced science and technology needed for our country, master them and improve them to create science and technology of our own style. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to have bold and wide-ranging scientific and technological exchange and cooperation with other countries, actively organize joint researches with their scientific institutions and boost the creative cooperation with overseas Korean scientists and technicians. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n State budgetary allocations for science and technology should be sharply increased and rationally used. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underlined the need to create a social habit and tendency whereby everyone works hard to learn science and technology and become a scientist and a technician.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Smear Campaign against DPRK and China Debunked\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson Tuesday carries a signed commentary denouncing Japan for slinging mud at the DPRK and China while making a terrific uproar over \"military threat.\"\r\n Shortly ago, the Defense Institute of the Japan Defense Agency in an annual report dubbed 2006 Northeast Asia Strategy Review let loose the far-fetched allegation that the DPRK's \"weapons of mass destruction\", ballistic missiles and nuclear issues and China's steady increase of military capabilities remained \"a factor of regional instability,\" adding that it was necessary to reorganize the U.S. forces in the Pacific intended for \"deterrence and rapid deployment\" and build a highly flexible defense system in the Japan Self-Defense Forces, the commentary notes, and goes on:\r\n Japan's assessment of the DPRK and China as elements harassing peace and stability in Northeast Asia is a gross distortion of reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK and China, both developing countries, have keen interests in regional peace and stability. Therefore, it is illogical to say that they go for harassing peace\r\n As for the issues over which Japan is kicking up a big fuss, they are, to all intents and purposes, means and measures for self-defense adopted to augment their defense potential and safeguard peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, huge military forces stand in confrontation on the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK and the U.S. are still technically at war. It is entirely thanks to the DPRK's powerful self-defensive means including nuclear deterrent that peace has been preserved on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an evil habit peculiar to Japan to draw waters to its own mills at the expense of others. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's claim that the stance of prompt reaction involving the accelerated modernization and beefing up of armaments should be rounded off to cope with \"military threats from north Korea and China\" is a third-rate sophism that can work with nobody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's arms buildup is not aimed to counter threats but to make preparations for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should immediately stop hare-brained plot-breeding, pondering over the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by its policy for military hegemony.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Smashing U.S. Strategy for Preemptive Attack\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 11 (KCNA) -- The Bush administration recently announced a \"national security strategy report\", which outlines its main foreign policy on national security, diplomacy, military affairs, etc. for the present. In the \"report\" the U.S. revealed its intention to mount a preemptive attack on the independent countries and those countries disobedient to its assertion, listing them as \"outposts of tyranny\". \r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed article in this regard:\r\n This is little short of a brigandish document declaring a war as it stated that the U.S. would brand as \"enemies\" without exception those countries refusing to follow the American view on value and would not rule out even a war to overthrow them. \r\n The U.S. strategy for preemptive attack is very dangerous as it will spark a new arms race and threaten and wreck the global peace and security, the article points out, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should not be allowed to threaten and blackmail those anti-imperialist independent countries and list them as targets of its military attack for the mere reason that they refuse to follow its policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the \"report\" the U.S. pulled up China over the increase of military capability in an \"untransparent manner\". It also threatened Russia, claiming that \"democracy is retrograding\" there. \r\n The failure to foil the above-said strategy would not only leave the independence of sovereign states seriously violated on international arena but adversely affect the human cause of independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All peoples aspiring after independence and peace should mount collective attacks on the U.S. imperialists. Defence capability should be increased to smash the U.S. strategy for preemptive attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists in the \"report\" listed the DPRK as the main target of their preemptive attack. It is made the primary target of their preemptive nuclear strike.\r\n However, such strategy can never work on the DPRK equipped with modern offensive and defensive means. The powerful revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK have all countermeasures to cope with any possible preemptive attack from the U.S. imperialists. \r\n The army and people of the DPRK will mercilessly wipe out the U.S. imperialist aggressors if they dare provoke it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more frantic the U.S. imperialists get in their moves for preemptive attack for aggression, the further they will stand rebuffed and isolated worldwide only to meet the fate of self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
