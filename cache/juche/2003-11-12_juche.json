It set up ultra-modern warhead development teams at three nuclear weapons institutes in the U.S. with a view to stepping up the development of new type nuclear warheads and an improved version of warheads under a plan to develop nuclear warheads capable of penetrating underground in three years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The danger of the U.S. moves to develop smaller nukes lies in that it may spark a new arms race and Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. massproduction of smaller nukes would seriously harass peace, escalate military standoff and increase the danger of a nuclear war. Then those countries which do not possess those weapons will be compelled to take self-defensive measures to cope with the nuclear threats to be posed by the U.S. imperialists. This would mean a new arms race and the second Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The gravity of these moves increases as they are timed to coincide with the U.S. worldwide \"war on terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists seek to mount a preemptive attack and contain developing countries going in for independence against imperialism and those countries going against their grain with those smaller nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their plan to deploy those weapons in south Korea and in Japan before any other areas to pressurize the DPRK with nukes and mount preemptive nuclear attacks on its major underground military facilities, economic targets, institutions and enterprises, etc. any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Northeast Asia is the region where the complicated military and strategic interests of big powers are intertwined. This region is therefore, vulnerable to arms race which may aggravate the situation there. The U.S. is going to wage a war in such region. This will easily spark a nuclear war in Asia and other parts of the world. Herein lies the biggest danger of the U.S. imperialists' moves to develop smaller nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. is working hard to develop smaller nukes many countries are paying great attention to increasing national defence capacity and developing modern military science and technology and defence industry. Measures are being taken by various countries to cope with those moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. develops, produces and uses those type nukes at any cost, that will only precipitate its own self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They killed at least one million innocent Koreans and forcibly drafted and abducted at least 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans to drive them as slaves and use them as bullet shields. On top of this, they forced 200,000 Korean women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this is well known to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They did not allow the Koreans to use their spoken and written languages and even deprived them of their Korean names. As if it were enough with this, they did not hesitate to use Koreans as guinea pigs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these crimes committed by Japan are war crimes and the most hideous human rights abuses that deserve punishment regardless of the domestic law at that time or the statute of limitations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international human rights fora should take a proper settlement of this issue as a basis for settling human rights issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous to talk about human rights or international law without its settlement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victims are urging the Japanese authorities to carry out comprehensive investigation into those shuddering crimes, punish war criminals and apologize and compensate the victims and their bereaved families as a separate issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can deny or suppress this claim as it fully conforms with the universal justice of human rights and principles of international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being hard facts, the present Japanese authorities refuse even to admit those crimes against humanity, asserting that there is neither reason to compensate for them in the light of the existing law nor evidence proving the forcible drafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey even went to the lengths of justifying and embellishing those biggest crimes against humanity in disregard of advices of the UN human rights meetings and resolutions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is an intolerable insult to the victims who met deaths due to unspeakable mental and physical pain with grudge against Japan and their bereaved families and survivors and a mockery of the dignity of the entire Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government strongly urges Japan to apologize and compensate all victims of hideous human rights abuses committed during its occupation and rule over Korea including suppression and massacre of Koreans due to their movement for independence and political and other reasons, forcible drafting, sexual slavery, tests on living bodies, forcible migration and deportation and forced change of Korean names into Japanese and their bereaved families.

            "content": "DPRK Not to Allow U.S. to Take out Equipment before Its Payment of Penalty\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) --A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry today gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA as regards the U.S. attempt to raise a new problem, taking issue with the step taken by the DPRK against the U.S. decision to suspend the construction of light water reactors (LWR):\r\n As already reported, we clarified the stand not to allow the U.S. and the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) to take out any equipment, facilities and materials for the LWR construction and technical documents in the Kumho area before compensating for the losses caused by them to us as the U.S. made KEDO to decide on suspending the LWR construction shortly ago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This pertains to our legitimate right we can exercise against the U.S. which has systematically violated the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework (AF). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This notwithstanding, the U.S. is far-fetchedly insisting that it be allowed to take out the equipment, once again trying to create the impression that the DPRK is to blame for the collapse of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The suspended LWR construction is a direct product of the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the Bush administration came to power it listed our country as part of an \"axis of evil\" and a target of a preemptive nuclear attack and has since expressed inveterate rejection of our system. In October 2002 it openly threatened and pressurized the DPRK, groundlessly asserting that it was pushing ahead with its \"enriched uranium program\" for the manufacture of nuclear weapons in violation of the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we have clarified more than once, we only explicitly told the U.S. special envoy that the DPRK is entitled to have not only nuclear weapons but something more powerful than those weapons in order to protect its sovereignty from the increasing U.S. threat to stifle it with nukes. We have never admitted to having any \"enriched uranium program\" so far advertised by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has obstinately spread the story about the \"for enriched uranium program.\" And under that pretext it suspended the supply of heavy fuel oil and put a stop to the construction of light water reactors in a bid to deprive the DPRK of a nuclear power industry for a peaceful use.  All the facts make clear who is to blame for the complete abrogation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and what caused it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now talking about the obligation of someone under the protocol on taking in and out facilities, equipment and materials for the construction of light water reactors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But if the protocol is likened to a twig, our demand is like a main trunk as its is line with the AF and the agreement on the provision of light water reactors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is meaningless to talk about a twig minus a trunk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a party to the AF and the agreement we are to settle all the ensuing matters with the U.S. the party concerned only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., which represents KEDO, is obliged to fully compensate for the huge loss of electricity inflicted upon the DPRK by its deliberate delay and total stop of the LWR construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should pay damages for the breach of contract without delay according to the relevant article of the agreement on the provision of light water reactors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, we will never allow the U.S. to take out facilities, equipment and materials for the LWR construction and technical documents now in the Kumho area unless the U.S. pays a penalty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As our measure has nothing to do with sub-contractors participating in the LWR construction, the U.S. should compensate for all the ensuing financial and material losses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
