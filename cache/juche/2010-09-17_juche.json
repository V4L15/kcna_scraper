Korea's Attempt at Preemptive Attack\r\n Pyongyang, September 17 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet group recently disclosed its reckless scenario for invading the DPRK through a preemptive attack, talking about a \"switchover in its military policy toward the north\" and the like. A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave the following answer to a question raised by KCNA Friday in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t At the recent \"meeting for overall state security review\" the puppet group had a confab on adopting a flexible deterrent strategy calling for preempting an attack on the DPRK in advance when there is a sign of launching nukes and missile or a war from somebody as its \"military policy toward the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a serious military provocation and extremely dangerous war action against the DPRK as it proclaimed to make a switchover from \"defensive strategy\", which it advocated for mere form's sake in the past, to offensive strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent confab clearly proved that the puppet warhawks rounded off the operation for mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK through war exercises and entered the phase of officially adopting it as its \"military strategy toward the north\" on the basis of that move. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is now hell-bent on escalating confrontation and launching a war despite the domestic and foreign public opinion desirous of dialogue and detente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war exercises being staged almost everyday in south Korean and the East and West Sea of Korea show that the puppet group are none other than the warmongers aware of nothing but confrontation and war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When looking back on history, aggressors launched wars through surprise preemptive attacks but they couldn't escape a miserable end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has gone so foolish as to threaten a preemptive attack but it will get nothing but miserable self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is prepared to counter any preemptive attack."

Paektu not taking rest and meal properly, worked until late at night every day for the reunification of the country though it was liberated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that she felt like fighting together with them for the sacred cause of the country's reunification, she requested them to stand in the van of the struggle to reunify the country as wished by the President."
