            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group Can Never Evade Responsibility for Bringing Inter-Korean Relations to Collapse: Spokesman for NDC\r\nPyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group of traitors on May 19 let a guy claiming to be a spokesman for Chongwadae spread rumor that the \"true intention\" reflected in Lee's \"Berlin proposal\" was conveyed to the DPRK side at a secret contact made between the north and the south of Korea in Beijing recently. A spokesman for the DPRK National Defence Commission Wednesday gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA as regards this:\n\t\t\t\t\tThe above-said group is master hands at fabrications as they cook up lies and deny what they have done and hooligans who renege on the promises made to the nation like a pair of old shoes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is clearly evidenced by the \"Cheonan\" sinking case and Yonphyong Island shelling case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a sheer lie that at the Beijing secret contact the south side briefed the DPRK side on the \"real intention\" reflected in the \"Berlin proposal\" made by traitor Lee.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the Lee group let the spokesman for Chongwadae open to public the above-mentioned secret contact first on the basis of fabrications and is busy floating nonsensical stories, the DPRK side has no option but to clarify it as it happened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFinding it hard to evade the responsibility for having driven the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe, the Lee group was aware that the crisis in the closing period of its rule might further deepen due to the situation. Hence, entering April the group made repeated requests to \"hold a secret contact for the 'summit talks,' saying it would no more talk about 'Cheonan' warship sinking case and Yonphyong Island shelling case.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnd it made poor excuses that what matters is that Lee's \"policy towards the north\" is \"misunderstood\" by the north and the south, in fact, stands for the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tKim Chon Sik, chief of the policy room of the puppet ministry of unification, Hong Chang Hwa, director of the intelligence service, and Kim Thae Hyo, senior presidential secretary for foreign strategy of secretariat of Chongwadae, and others came out to the venue of the secret contact that started on May 9. They, however, began playing jugglery to wrest apology from the DPRK side, asserting that the above-said cases were \"mountains to be crossed with wisdom\" for the improvement of the south-north relations. This was a breach of the promise made to the DPRK side earlier.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen it declared that it was preposterous to say the word \"apology\" over the cases with which it had nothing to do and just measures for self-defence, they asked it to put forth \"a compromise proposal\" to be declared before the world, the proposal which cannot be interpreted as apology, when viewed by the north side but as apology when viewed by the south side. They implored the north to \"make a little concession\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the DPRK side told them to go back to Seoul at once, saying it is not necessary to discuss the issue of the summit talks in which unreasonable \"apology\" raised as a pre-condition, they tried hard to keep the contact going on at any cost, saying that it would not be long before Lee Myung Bak's tenure of office would end, the present authorities are hard pressed for time and it is more favorable to push forward the inter-Korean relations by joining hands with the conservative forces, in stead of doing so with the progressive forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that a program for all events for the opening of the \"summit talks\" has already been worked out, they said that depending on the settlement of the issues of the two cases, they expected to open ministerial talks for the \"summit talks\" late in May to announce agreed points, hold the first round of the \"summit talks‚Äù in Panmunjom late in June, the second one in Pyongyang two months later and the third round of the \"summit talks\" during the summit for nuclear security slated to take place in March next year. They earnestly begged the DPRK side to take this embarrassing situation into consideration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the DPRK side clarified its steadfast stand that such summit talks cannot take place as long as the south side insists on the hostile policy towards the DPRK, persistently claiming that the north should \"dismantle its nukes first\" and calling for \"an apology\" for the two cases, they asked it to express at least \"regret\" at the two cases, proposed meeting in Malaysia again to conclude the discussion of this issue and urged it to rapidly push forward the arrangements for opening the \"summit talks\". They went the lengths of showing off enveloped money to lure someone but suffered shame.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group asked the DPRK side to keep secret what was said at the secret contact, saying the situation in south Korea is complicated unlike that in the north and if that is known to the south, it will entail adverse consequences. They repeatedly asked the north side to keep secret the accounts of the contact as nobody knows about this except Hyon In Thaek, minister of Unification, the director of the intelligence service and the presidential secretary-general who looked after the secret contact at the personal instruction of \"President\" Lee and those sent to Beijing for the contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was these guys who first opened to the public the misrepresented accounts of the secret Beijing contact in an attempt to propagandize the \"justice\" of the \"Berlin proposal.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the whole story about the secret contact that the spokesman for Chongwadae claimed the real intention reflected in the proposal was conveyed to the north before and after May 19.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHad the Lee group have the true intention to improve the north-south relations, it should not have let loose such reckless remarks as what it called \"Berlin proposal\" and refrained from perpetrating such perfidy as opening to the public the misrepresented accounts of the secret contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts glaringly show what desperate efforts the Lee is making to shirk the responsibility for having driven the north-south relations to collapse in the closing period of its rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFor all his desperate efforts the traitor cannot evade the responsibility for the crimes committed against the nation and reunification for three years in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK will make every possible effort to ensure peace, reunification and stability on the Korean Peninsula but it will no longer deal with the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors which meanly behaves, uttering incoherent words to achieve its sinister political aim."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary on Japanese Government's Row about \"Issue of Abduction\" \r\n Pyongyang, June 1 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government is recklessly kicking up an anti-DPRK row about abduction. \n\t\t\t\t\t Japan decided to include the \"issue of abduction\" in the contents of education at all schools. Its chief executive during his foreign junkets begged for cooperation in the efforts to solve the \"issue of abduction\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's assertion is that there is no more serious human rights issue than the \"issue of abduction\" for Japan and this is a fundamental issue to be solved to improve the DPRK-Japan relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is ridiculous, indeed. It is a crafty method peculiar to Japan, political dwarf, to attain its sinister political purpose by a despicable and petty trick.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is the world's worst human rights abuser and a war criminal which has no justification to raise \"the issue of abduction\" and human rights issue to the DPRK from the moral and legal viewpoint.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan took away and abducted many Koreans including 200,000 Korean women to suffer slavery. It has not yet redeemed the brutal slavery committed in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the hideous crime for which Japan should be punished unconditionally according to the \"convention on not applying the statute of limitation to the war crimes and the crimes against humanity\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan seeks a sinister political aim in enforcing the education in the \"issue of abduction\" aimed at infusing bitterness towards the DPRK into young Japanese. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its purpose is to cover up unethical crimes committed by it in the past, go without redressing them and escalate the confrontation between the DPRK and Japan in a bid to prolong the remaining days of rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive Japanese rulers behaved so. Not only during the period of the rule of the Liberal Democratic Party represented by Abe and others but also during the rule of the present Democratic Party of Japan the authorities have resorted to such base method to turn Japan into a normal state free from the moral responsibility for the past crimes and bring political crisis at home under control.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Japanese authorities have become crafty to employ it for their old \"abduction\" farce at a time when the international community is getting increasingly assertive for promoting the process of peace and denuclearization on the Korean Peninsula. There are voices of caution among the countries concerned that Japan is revealing its intention to include the \"abduction issue\" in the \"prior measure for the resumption of the six-party talks\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Japan's trick is too poor to fish in troubled waters with the \"abduction issue\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese authorities raised the issue of Megumi Yokoda as the core of the \"abduction issue\". It had been already disclosed that their assertion is like insisting on bringing the dead to life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already reported, even a representative of an anti-DPRK organization of south Korea who was deeply involved in the issue of Megumi Yokoda in August 2006 said that the Japanese government used the \"abduction issue\" for such political purpose as \"employing it as a lever for pressuring north Korea\" though it knew well about the death of Megumi. In Japan the Asahi TV in May 2009 disclosed that the Foreign Ministry of Japan knew that Megumi was not alive, sparking sensation at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community treats Japan as a political dwarf as it employs such base and mean methods. In order to get rid of this position the Japanese authorities should not play sleight of hand but honestly reflect on their past wrongs and properly settle them. Doing so is the fundamental and primary issue arising in the DPRK-Japan relations."

In other words, it is their sinister intention to realize their dream of emerging again a leader of Asia backed by the U.S. at any cost. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is the only country in the world which begs for maintaining and strengthening the alliance even sacrificing the vital interests of the country and its people, although it has alliance with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese reactionaries calculate that they can lead their country to emerge the leader of Asia in return for kowtowing to the U.S. and cooperating with it.

Timed to coincide with this, other U.S. veterans who served in the U.S. forces present in south Korea and south Koreans who worked in the U.S. base also testified one after another to the fact that the U.S. forces buried toxic chemicals in secrecy in various bases including Puchon, Kyonggi Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The burial of toxic materials by the U.S. imperialist aggressors seriously contaminated many areas of south Korea and affected even underground water, having a serious impact on the cultivation of crops and the use of drinking water.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The areas occupied by the U.S. forces present in south Korea are known to be places with the best ecological environment from olden times.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. built military bases for aggression, training, bombing and firing in famous spots and mountains of south Korea for more than half a century in the past. While staging exercises for a war of aggression, its forces let various kinds of oil and toxic materials massive flow, seriously polluting the ecological environment and gravely threatening the life of the south Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. brought to south Korea defoliant and massively sprayed it in the area along the Military Demarcation Line, seriously polluting the natural environment in the area and destroying a large area of land and causing civilians and soldiers who participated in spraying defoliant to die of incurable diseases.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was reported that one out of 10,000 people of south Korea suffered from cancer owing to his or her drinking of polluted underground water.

He testified to the fact that \"when I went to the area near Mt.

Korea's \"Strategic Rigidity\" Obstructive to North-South Dialogue-Chinese Newspaper\r\n Beijing, May 30 (KCNA) -- Huan Qiu Shibao on May 21 carried an article titled \"South Korea's strategic rigidity is obstructive to south-north dialogue.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t The wrong stand taken by south Korea at a time when the international community desires the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula makes it difficult for the people to be optimistic about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Disclosing the injustice of the terms raised by south Korea as preconditions for the north-south dialogue, the paper continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The misjudgment of the situation in Korea led to the \"strategic rigidity\" on the part of south Korea. Its policy has been focused on \"promoting change through pressure while waiting for it to occur.\" It, therefore, could not depart from the passive and old stand on the dialogue and negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea's maintenance of the \"strategic intention\" may deprive it of an opportunity to improve the south-north relations and promote the denuclearization process. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some personages in south Korea and the West are underestimating the capability of the DPRK to exist and the stability of its system while overestimating the effect of the policy of sanctions and pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy towards the DPRK shaped on the misjudgment that it will \"collapse\" does not stand to reason. This is a very dangerous one and it is bound to escalate tension and stand-off.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean side should show \"strategic flexibility\", the paper urged."
