They are openly revealing their ulterior intention, asserting that the relations should be improved on the premise that the north shall make a sincere change in its attitude towards the denuclearization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Policy Department of the NDC of the DPRK in its statement on Jan. 7 notifies the Obama Administration of its following principled stand as it is pushing the DPRK-U.S. relations to the worst phase of confrontation from the outset of the year:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Firstly, the U.S. should lift all unreasonable \"sanctions\" against the DPRK in all fields. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have taken this stand because all \"sanctions\" the U.S. has imposed against the DPRK so far are based on the inveterate hostility and repugnancy towards it and Washington's hostile policy towards it. This is also because \"sanctions\" were invented under absurd pretexts and conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should know that such tragicomedy as issuing the above-said order over the case without any sure ground would only bring bitterer disgrace and shame to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Secondly, the U.S., availing itself of this opportunity, should make a bold decision to unconditionally stop all reckless hostile acts of creating the danger of war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should properly know that its attempt to infringe upon the sovereignty of the DPRK and bring down its dignified social system by force of arms will never come true.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should make a bold decision to stop all hostile actions, if it does not want to follow in the footsteps of preceding U.S. warmongers who confessed after drinking a bitter cup of defeat that they fought a wrong war against a wrong rival at a wrong time and in a wrong place.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thirdly, the U.S. should not forget even a moment that the army and people of the DPRK have already launched the toughest counteraction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have already declared the toughest counteraction against the outrageous hostile acts the U.S. has perpetrated against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. took part in wars of aggression, big and small, including two world wars. But it has never experienced a hail of bullets and shells on its own territory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should roll back its hostile policy towards the DPRK of its own accord if it does not want to suffer a war disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t One is bound to go to ruin if one fails to understand one's rival and one's own position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will closely follow the U.S. policy switchover."

Korea to Clarify Its Stand toward North-South Relations\r\nPyongyang, January 7 (KCNA) -- Undesirable farces persist in south Korea still in the new year against the DPRK's goodwill and generosity for the improved north-south relations and the fellow countrymen's desire for national unity and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t On Jan. 5, human scum of the \"movement for directly helping compatriots in the north\", an organization of \"defectors from the north\", conducted the scattering of over 1.3 million leaflets slandering the dignity and social system of the DPRK toward its area from Cholwon, South Kangwon Province.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such reckless act was done at a time when all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad were eagerly hoping to see the mended north-south relations and opening of a broad avenue for the independent reunification after receiving the patriotic New Year address of supreme leader Kim Jong Un. It is a blatant challenge to the DPRK's sincere stand and appeal for the improved north-south relations and national reunification and a last-ditch effort to obstruct the improvement of north-south relations and spoil an atmosphere of dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This confrontation deed was not committed by some human scum only but the U.S. and the right-wing conservative forces of south Korea are behind it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a well-known fact that the U.S. has funded the human scum, who fled their home after committing all sorts of crimes, to conduct anti-DPRK leaflet scattering operations since its military blackmail, political and diplomatic pressure, economic sanctions and other unprecedented obstructive moves didn't work on the DPRK advancing under the banner of independence, Songun and socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the beginning of the new year the U.S. announced additional sanctions on the DPRK to stand against the improvement of relations and dialogue between the north and the south of Korea. Not content with such measure, it prodded even the human scum into an anti-DPRK confrontation racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those human scum live on the money paid by the U.S. in return for their shock-brigade role in its disgusting anti-DPRK moves, including the leaflet scattering. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean regime, too, has connived at and incited the leaflet scattering by such outlaws, pursuant to the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recent action in the Military Demarcation Line area, the biggest hotspot, would have been checked in advance if the south Korean authorities had done what it should do. But, they remained an onlooker to this reckless leaflet scattering that was strongly opposed even by local inhabitants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities have repressed people of different social strata, critical of them including the chief executive, by invoking various \"laws\" but overlooked the anti-DPRK leaflet scattering by the human scum under the pretext of \"freedom of expression\" and the like. This is a self-contradictory behavior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Conniving at a crime precisely means conspiracy with it. The south Korean regime's attitude towards the recent leaflet-scattering operation clearly proved that it is on the same boat with the human scum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the demand of the DPRK that the north and the south of Korea stop fighting each other and share one purpose and join efforts in order to write a new history of their relations. However, the south Korean regime reacted to this just demand and call with confrontation moves, which fully reveals that \"dialogue\" and \"improved relations\" much touted by it are nothing but empty words.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already declared, the DPRK will never pardon any reckless action of insulting its social system, the life and soul and dignity of its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should not forget the fact that last year the atmosphere of dialogue, created with Inchon visit by the director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army and his party as a momentum, was spoiled due to the human scum's leaflet scattering, consequently driving the north-south relations to an uncontrollable phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south relations can be hardly improved by one side's efforts alone.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should clarify the stand on the north-south relations--whether they will push the relations again to a catastrophic phase by conniving at the reckless acts of a handful of the living corpse or come out with sincerity for their improvement and dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will follow the developments for the future."

The former UK prime minister and foreign secretary were regularly briefed on the operation of the CIA's secret prisons overseas by MI6 and, therefore, they were aware of all details.\n\t\t\t\t\t The former Polish president who strongly denied the existence of CIA's secret prison admitted that he personally allowed its operation under the U.S. pressure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday observes in a commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts irrefutably prove that European countries are behaving mischievously to please the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The EU has long made double talks, depending on time and circumstances in dealing with human rights issues and enforced prejudiced and selective policies, toeing the U.S. line. This finds a vivid expression in Europe's policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Once the EU had a strong say towards the U.S., claiming its crucial role in the world.

For this it has got no reward from the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then there is a question about why the EU is now in such bad shape. This is because the EU has enforced the policy of following the U.S., bereft of its principle and its original position and stand, pressurized by the U.S. high-handed practices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The EU has mistaken the U.S.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is by no means a strong entity.

Impotente de hacerlo, emplea en el lanzamiento de volantes a las escorias humanas que huyeron de la RPDC tras cometer crimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA principios del ano nuevo, EE.UU. publico la medida de sancion adicional contra la RPDC negando abiertamente la mejora de las relaciones intercoreanas y el dialogo N-S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor su parte, la chusma, movilizada en el lanzamiento de volantes, mantienen su sucia vida con el dinero que se le paga por la campana anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambien, las autoridades surcoreanas se suman a la politica hostil a la RPDC de EE.UU. amparando a esa chusma.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ellas hubieran hecho lo que les toca hacer, se habria prevenido el lanzamiento de volantes cometido en las cercanias de la Linea de Demarcacion Militar, zona mas candente, a pesar del fuerte rechazo de los habitantes locales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn virtud de las \"leyes\" de toda indole, las autoridades surcoreanas reprimen a todos los que critican a ellas mismas, inclusive la mandataria. Pero, bajo el pretexto de \"libertad de expresion\" hacen vista gorda del lanzamiento de volantes contra la RPDC, lo que es acto contradictorio y traidor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTolerar el acto criminal es igual a confabularse con el delincuente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl comportamiento de las autoridades surcoreanas, quienes respondieron con las maniobras conflictivas al llamamiento justo de la parte connacional a escribir con las fuerzas unidas la nueva historia de relaciones intercoreanas sin disputas entre ambas partes coreanas, demuestra claramente que el \"dialogo\" y la \"mejora de relaciones\" de que hablan ellas son palabras vacias.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya ha declarado, la RPDC no perdonara jamas el insulto y calumnia a su regimen y sistema, considerados como vida y dignidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas no deben olvidar el hecho de que debido al lanzamiento de volantes cometido el ano pasado, se ha roto la atmosfera del dialogo, preparada dificilmente gracias a la visita a Inchon de la comitiva del jefe de la Direccion Politica General del Ejercito Popular de Corea de la RPDC, y se llevaron las relaciones intercoreanas a la fase irreparable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas con los esfuerzos unilaterales de una parte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben dejar en claro su posicion ante esta disyuntiva: llevar otra vez las relaciones N-S a la fase catastrofica tolerando las locuras de las escorias humanas o proceder sinceramente al mejoramiento de relaciones y al dialogo con el Norte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC observara la situacion posterior."
