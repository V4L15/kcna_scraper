Kumgang signed with the Hyundai Group of south Korea, which calls for granting it monopoly over the tour, because there is no hope of resuming the tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t In a statement of spokesman and a detailed report, they also announced that the DPRK would take charge of the international tour through the areas of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities call for \"repeal of this step\", asserting that it is \"violation of the agreement\" and \"unacceptable.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rejecting such assertion, Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary Tuesday says: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative authorities of south Korea have neither face nor right to talk about \"violation of agreement\" and \"repeal of step\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have persistently hindered the tour of Mt.

It was an important work to reconnect the vein and territory of the nation severed by the foreign forces with burning desire for unity and reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a mistake for the south Korean authorities to think that the DPRK had made efforts to resume the tour for any economic interests. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The highest privilege granted so far by the DPRK to the south side over the tour of Mt.
