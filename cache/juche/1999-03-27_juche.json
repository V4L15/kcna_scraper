            "content": "\"Mysterious ship pursuit case,\" anti-DPRK fiction\r\n      Pyongyang , March 27 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK  released on March 27 a statement denouncing the Japanese reactionaries for anti-DPRK smear campaign following the fabrication of \"mysterious ships pursuit case.\"\r\n    He said:\r\n    On March 24, the Japanese government announced that on March 23 two mysterious ships bearing bogus Japanese fishing boat names were spotted on the sea near Sadogashima, Niigata Prefecture and Nodo peninsula,  Japan, and missed in pursuit.\r\n   It also said that when the \"mysterious ships\" were fleeing, ignoring a  stop signal, an order for \"marine patrol action\" was issued according to article 82 of the \"Law on the Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) of Japan and planes and vessels of the maritime self-defense force were called out to chase and fire warning shots at them.\r\n   The point at issue is the fact that a string of speculations that those ships \"might flee to North Korean waters and that they might be North Korean ships for operations\" were floated by the defense agency and mass media of Japan, getting on the nerves of the DPRK   .\r\n   Synchronising with this, the Japanese government authorities hurriedly called an emergency cabinet meeting and a news conference in a bid to use the case for the revision of the \"Law on SDF\".\r\n   We have no idea of the \"mysterious ships.\"\r\n   At the present juncture, the loud-mouthed \"mysterious ships pursuit case\" cannot be construed otherwise than one more anti-DPRK fiction invented by the Japanese reactionaries on purpose.\r\n   In Japan bills on the \"Guidelines for Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation\" are under consideration at the diet to provide legal justification for reinvasion of the DPRK    and other Asian countries.\r\n   As already known to the world, for their reactionary and dangerous nature those bills spark serious concern and strong opposition at home and abroad.\r\n   With a view to railroad the bills through the diet the Japanese reactionaries needed one more shocking \"incident.\"\r\n   What merits our particular attention is the fact that the \"case\" occurred the day after sources of the defense agency of Japan announced on March 22 that action guidelines would be worked out for the maritime SDF and the Maritime Security Agency to cope with intrusion of foreign warships into Japanese territorial waters.\r\n   Rumours are rife in Japan also that the recent \"case\" seems to be an exercise of action envisaged in the U.S.-Japan defense guidelines and that far beyond a chance occurrence is this case since this was reported when the bills on the defense guidelines  were under deliberation.\r\n   The Japanese right-wing reactionaries also sought in this campaign to worsen the DPRK -U.S., DPRK -Japan relations. \r\n   Whenever an agreement was reached  between the DPRK and the U.S. on a series of issues or some movements took place in Japan to improve the DPRK  -Japan relations, they resorted to a base smear campaign to block them.\r\n   To cite only a few examples, when an agreement of principle on resuming talks for normalizing diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan was reached two years ago, they floated a rumour about the \"suspected kidnapping\" and when the DPRK    launched a  satellite for a peaceful purpose last year, they hysterically cried it was \"a missile launch\".\r\n   History and facts go to clearly prove that as the general situation turned unfavourable to them this time, they orchestrated their clumsy drama of \"mysterious ships pursuit case\" in a bid to justify their militarization moves and break the DPRK -U.S., the DPRK -Japan relations. \r\n   We will never pardon the Japanese right-wing reactionaries encroaching upon the inviolable dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK  by faking up the anti-DPRK    provocative case intended to attain their ulterior political ambition.\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to act with prudence, mindful that they will be wholly responsible for the grave consequence to be entailed by their reckless smear campaign against the DPRK   .    \r\n    \r\n"

He said:\r\n   Korean science and technology have made steady progress in the '90s.\r\n   Solid foundations have been laid in the sector of electronics to automate, robotize and computerize the national economy and great strides have been made in bioengineering and mechanical engineering.\r\n   Some time ago, they made an electron microscope of 300,000 magnifications by their own efforts and technology in a short period and successfully launched satellite \"Kwangmyongsong 1\".\r\n   They exerted enormous efforts to resolve scientific and technical problems in making an effective use of the present economic foundation. By doing so, they succeeded in producing iron in the Korean way by the method of oxygen blowing and put a large-capacity transformer on single winding basis and thus opened a vista for revitalizing the economy and raising the standard of people's living.\r\n   These results are the most precious and proud ones as they were achieved in the severest and fiercest confrontation with imperialists and reactionaries.\r\n   The reporter elaborated on the tasks for the scientists and technicians to fulfil so as to make a revolutionary upsurge in scientific and technical development and pave the way for building a powerful socialist country.\r\n    The 5-year plan for scientific and technical development and main tasks for the development of ultra-modern science and technology should be carried through to revitalize the economy and put the nation's science and technology on the world level.\r\n   For the present, great effort should be directed to solving practical scientific and technological problems arising in effectively utilizing the existing economic foundation and raising  the standard of people's living.\r\n   In particular, they should develop the electronic industry to lift the software production onto the world level and introduce programs in all fields and thus realize the computerization of the national economy.\r\n   The whole country should be pervaded with the spirit of attaching importance to science, and the scientists and technicians should contribute to raising the nation's science and technology as a whole to the world level.\r\n   Many scientists and technicians made speeches at the meeting.    \r\n  \r\n"

Of them the eldest son of the present chief executive and 140 others made a fortune to the tune of more than 100 million won, even nearly 2,080 million won to the maximum, the \"results\" said.\r\n   The information bulletin says:\r\n   This clearly proves that the people's living is deteriorating to the extreme as a result of economic bankruptcy and disasterous lay-offs, while high-ranking bureaucrats are keen on illicit accumulation of wealth.\r\n   The South Korean chief executive tries to fool the workers and people of other social strata whose existence is driven to bay, with honeyed-words of \"pains sharing,\" but the realities show that his words are a sheer lie.\r\n   So long as foreign domination and anti-social misrule of the South Korean authorities remain, the South Korean people can never get rid of the pains and misfortune.    \r\n\r\n"

Their allegation is a dirty propaganda ploy to build up public opinion as if the DPRK  were to blame for the unimproved relations between the two countries.\r\n   Japan's liquidation of the past and rectification of the policy hostile to the DPRK are at the core of the improvement of the bilateral relations.\r\n   The Japanese imperialist occupation of Korea and worst colonial rule spanning more than 40 years inflicted immeasurable misfortune, pains and disasters upon the Korean people. Either in view of international laws or from the moral point of view Japan should have made an apology and compensation for them.\r\n   The successive Japanese authorities tried to isolate and stifle the DPRK  , while pursuing the policy absolutely pro-South Korean and seeking permanent division of Korea.\r\n   Recently alone, the Japanese authorities described the DPRK 's launch of a satellite as \"that of ballistic missile\" and cried for \"cooperation\" with the U.S. And the South Korean authorities in their vicious anti-DPRK campaign.\r\n   So long as they refuse to liquidate the past and persistently pursue the policy hostile to the DPRK , the DPRK will never work towards the improved relations between the two countries.\r\n   They are foolish enough to talk about the \"constructive counteraction\" of the DPRK. They had better perform its obligation by rectifying the policy hostile to the DPRK before anything else.    \r\n  \r\n"
