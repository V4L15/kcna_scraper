            "content": "U.S. Urged to Make Bold Decision to Withdraw Its Troops from South Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- The Korean people have been suffering the tragedy and disgrace of national division and living in instability and uneasiness for nearly 60 years owing to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea and their policy of division and policy to stifle the DPRK.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary on the lapse of 58 years since their military occupation of south Korea on September 8, 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops' occupation of south Korea must no longer be allowed in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Paragraph 60 of Article IV of the Armistice Agreement stipulates that within three months after the AA is signed, a political conference of a higher level of both sides be held to settle through negotiation the question of the withdrawal of all foreign forces from Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n China completely withdrew its troops from the Korean front in 1958 according to the requirement of the AA and no foreign troops stay in the northern half of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fifteen countries of those which had sent their troops to the UN Forces, except the United States, pulled their troops out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification or excuse for the U.S. to keep its troops in south Korea today when the Cold War came to an end and the Soviet Union collapsed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is escalating nuclear pressure on the DPRK under the pretext of \"nuclear threat\" from it and bringing the DPRK-U.S. belligerent relations to an explosive phase. This has carried the situation on the Korean peninsula into an extreme pitch of strain. The situation is very dangerous and the outbreak of the second Korean war is a matter of time. The withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea has not been raised so urgently as now. It is a touchstone judging and verifying whether the U.S. has willingness to sign a non-aggression treaty with the DPRK and drop its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK, or not. It is a historical time the U.S. pulled its troops out of south Korea with \"honor\", not losing its face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants to prevent a war on the Korean peninsula and ensure peace there and improve the DPRK-U.S. relations, it should make a bold decision to withdraw its troops from south Korea at an early date.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Disgraceful Behaviour Assailed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 8 (KCNA) -- Japan impertinently raised the \"issue of abduction\" at the six-way talks on the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., thus marring the nature of the talks and confusing them.\r\n Minju Joson today in a signed commentary assails this disgraceful behaviour. Japan, not pleased with any moves to settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., is making desperate efforts to bar the talks from making any progress in a bid to achieve its political and military aims, the commentary says and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the nuclear issue is settled between the DPRK and the U.S. to ease the tensions on the Korean peninsula, Japan will be deprived of the pretext it has so far used for its moves to emerge a military power, in other words \"threat from north Korea\". This cannot but be a blow to the Japanese reactionaries keen to emerge a military power at an early date to pave the way for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another important aim sought by Japan is to please its U.S. master by zealously participating in the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and thus gain a political profit in return for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries do not hesitate to challenge the aspiration and desire of the international community for the settlement of the nuclear issue in order to meet their political interests. They are no more than political impostors and dwarfs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their act of imprudently handling such a politically sensitive issue to meet their immediate interests is like pricking their own eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better behave themselves, bearing deep in mind that their reckless act would only compel the DPRK to take strong counter-measures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also dealt severe blows to them through the U.S. Escort Ship No. 56 incident in January 1967, U.S. reconnaissance plane EC-121 incident in April 1969 and Panmunjom incident in August 1976. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In March 1993 when the U.S. imperialists' efforts to eliminate the DPRK from the globe reached the extremes, it took such decisive steps as issuing an order of the supreme commander of the Korean People's Army to put the whole country, entire people and all the army on a semi-war footing and declaring the DPRK's withdrawal from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty in order to defend the supreme interests of the country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's prestige in external relations has considerably been enhanced though the imperialists have continued trying to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has ambassadorial-level diplomatic relations with nearly 160 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are absolutely supporting the DPRK, a genuine state of the people that has defended the nation's dignity and sovereignty with credit.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
