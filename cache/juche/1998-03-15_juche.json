It also discussed tasks facing the religionists.\r\n   The reporter and speakers said at the meeting that a way out for the nation can be opened independently only when the north and south collaborate and unite with each other, reject domination and interference by outside forces and promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests. \r\n   What is urgent in achieving the unity of the nation is to abolish legal and institutional mechanisms such as the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\" in South Korea, they said.\r\n   The meeting expressed the willingness to collaborate and unite with South Korean religious organizations and religionists, who value the reunification of the country and the dignity of the nation in the spirit of patriotism, and actively have contact and dialogue with them.\r\n   Attending the meeting were Chairman Jang Jae Chol and members of the Korean religionist association, and members of its secretariat and delegates of various religious organizations.     \r\n      \r\n\r\n"

It is indeed the height of perfidious acts.\r\n   We have something to tell the U.S. as regards the provision of light water reactors (lwr), too.\r\n   Under the agreement, the U.S. is obliged to renounce its hostile policy through the relaxation of embargo on the DPRK and provide two lwrs, each with a million kw generating capacity, to the DPRK by 2003 on a turnkey basis.\r\n   But the U.S. has taken no substantial step to ease sanctions but played on words for years. And it has made no progress in lwr construction, either, for the internal problems of the Korean Peninsula energy development organization including fund sharing.\r\n   If the U.S. continues such perfidious acts, we cannot but go our way. If so, the U.S. should not take issue with the DPRK over the consequences but blame itself.    \r\n \r\n"
