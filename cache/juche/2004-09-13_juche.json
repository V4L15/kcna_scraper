Korean Authorities' Pro-Japanese Humiliating Behavior under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities shun the declassification of the documents related to the south Korea-Japan \"agreement\" adopted in 1965, reading the face of the outsiders though it is the era of giving importance to the nation, the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary carried in this regard terms this attitude a contemporary form of treacherous, pro-Japanese humiliating behavior.\r\n The commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities are taking a double-dealing attitude. While recognizing the necessity to declassify the documents, they assert they cannot be opened to the public until the final ruling by a judicial institution under the pretexts of \"diplomatic practices\" and \"relations with Japan.\" The declassification of the documents is not a matter to be decided upon in consideration of any diplomatic practices or by reading others' face as it pertains to the independent right of the south Korean authorities.\r\n Disclosing the reason why they are taking such a passive approach towards declassification of the documents related to the treacherous \"agreement,\" the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upset by the recent growing demand for the declassification in south Korea, the Japanese authorities threaten the south Korean authorities that if the latter declassify the documents they will also open to the public something not yet disclosed. So the south Korean authorities are now at a loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly reveals the constitutional weakness of the present south Korean authorities who are not in a position to do what they wish, reading the face of outside forces, bereft of independent consciousness and political independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground for the south Korean authorities to shun opening the documents to the public as they are talking about the probe into the truth about past crimes. This issue is one of the basic problems showing whether the south Korean authorities have a will to totally eliminate the leftover of the Japanese imperialists' colonial policy or not. And it will also serve as a yardstick distinguishing the stand of giving importance to the nation from the stand of serving foreign forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is said that as its first phase two Aegis destroyers will be deployed in the East Sea of Korea and three in Hawaii soon on a permanent basis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces made this decision not because of \"missile threat\" from someone. Their aim is to move their armed forces for a war of aggression to their operational areas and then round off at the final phase the preparations to mount a surprise preemptive attack on the DPRK on the entire front of the sea, the sky and the ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea and its vicinity have turned into a rendezvous, an operational base for the U.S. armed forces according to the \"preemptive attack strategy\" dubbed \"Bush doctrine\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has begun the massive shipment of the latest war equipment worth nearly 13 billion U.S. dollars into south Korea under the signboard of \"reduction\" of its troops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is busy with the move to merge the 13th Air Force Command in Guam with the 5th Air Force Command in Yokota Base of Japan and transfer the 1st U.S. Army Corps Command in Washington State to Kanagawa Prefecture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces have recently worked out and opened to the public \"operation plan-5027-04,\" a scenario for the second Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to prove that the Bush administration's talk about the negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is a sheer lie and it is leaving no means untried to round off its preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will neither remain a passive onlooker to the U.S. frantic arms buildup nor wait with folded arms till the U.S. side has occupied its starting position after finishing its preparations for assault. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush bellicose forces ignite a war despite the DPRK's warnings, they will face an unprecedented catastrophe.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And it attacked Iraq in March 2003 with the mobilization of hundreds of thousands of troops equipped with sophisticated weapons, alleging that they would bring \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" to the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to a report released by the U.S. Centre of Strategic and International Studies, more than 11,000 people were killed, at least 40,000 wounded and some 200 civilian facilities destroyed in Iraq as of June 18 this year since the outbreak of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though it unleashed the wars under the pretext of \"fighting terrorism\", the U.S. has still failed to find out Bin Laden's whereabouts and \"weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq but revealed its brigandish nature only, inciting people's uprising in the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"war on terrorism\", in the final analysis, has resulted in a vicious cycle of retaliation and terrorism, and in many countries including U.S. allies turning their back on the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Suffice it to say that demonstrations against the U.S. attempt to invade Iraq took place worldwide on an unprecedented scale last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The demonstrations were participated in by 500,000 people in France, 600,000 in Germany, two million in Britain, three million in Italy and four million in Spain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 200,000-strong demonstration staged in Rome in early June this year against the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" touched off large-scale anti-U.S., anti-war demonstrations and rallies  in west European countries' capitals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Besides, more and more countries' pullout of troops from Iraq has brought Iraq-based allied forces to a head. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become a target of denunciation by world people desirous of peace and justice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This has stirred up a big furor in the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is strong suspicion that the disclosed experiments might be conducted at the instruction of the United States as they assume military nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has applied double standards as regards the nuclear issue. It has transferred nuclear technology to its \"allies\" and connived at their nuclear weapon-related activities and possession of nukes. But it has worked hard to stamp out nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose after faking up \"misinformation\" about the DPRK on account of its ideology and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is whether the U.S. intends to overlook south Korea's development of nuclear weapons as it did that of Israel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea is under U.S. nuclear umbrella. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that the DPRK can never abandon its nuclear program under such situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now employing sleight of hand to hush up the above-said cases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but link these cases to the issue of resuming the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cases should be clarified transparently and thoroughly and necessary measures be taken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will closely follow the expected results of the investigation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community should pay due attention to the disclosed issue of uranium enrichment in south Korea, not the non-existent \"uranium enrichment issue\" in the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the danger to be posed by the nuclear arms race in Northeast Asia is to be prevented, the U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK in practice and opt for seeking an early negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue as justly demanded by the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On September 2 it forced the UNSC to adopt a resolution calling for the withdrawal of Syrian forces from Lebanon as regards the issue of extending the term of the president in Lebanon.\r\n Timed to coincide with this, Israel has openly threatened to militarily strike Syria under the pretext of \"eliminating\" the leaders of the Palestinian resistance forces in Damascus and gone the lengths of \"asking for international support.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the Israeli authorities do not conceal the fact that their anti-Syrian campaign is aimed to take Lebanon, a weak country, from Syria and force Lebanon to conclude a \"peace treaty\" with Israel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and other armed forces of Syria are now getting fully ready for anti-U.S., anti-Israel war of resistance to safeguard the inviolable territory of the country and its national dignity from the U.S. escalating anti-Syria campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pressure and Israel's military threat to Syria are very dangerous moves to disturb the security and stability of Syria and hamstring the efforts to achieve fair and comprehensive peace in Mideast. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation which may trigger off a vicious cycle of ceaseless violence and terrorism in Mideast is arousing profound concern not only among the Mideast Arab countries but among the world peace-loving people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
