            "content": "Japanese Reactionaries' Moves to Establish MD under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 8 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are displaying feverish activities to establish the Missile Defence System (MD) at the earliest date possible while acting separately, not fully depending on cooperation with the United States in this matter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, a Minju Joson analyst Tuesday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's frantic push for the establishment of the MD which the world considers needless is aimed to achieve its long-pursued design to convert the country into a military power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan, a defeated nation, is not allowed to possess more armed forces than needed for self-defence. It is for this reason that the Japanese reactionaries seek to build a military giant and launch overseas expansion by pulling up others. Hence they came out with the MD doctrine allegedly to cope with the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true nature of the MD will never change, no matter how heatedly the Japanese reactionaries may make irrelevant remarks over the missile threat from the DPRK. The MD is considered nowadays to be indispensable requisites to a preemptive attack on a targeted object. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Japanese reactionaries seek is to establish the MD as early as they can and thus hold an unchallenged edge in strategic offensive weaponry and launch a preemptive attack for militarist overseas aggression at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country will allow Japan to freely brandish the sword of aggression just as it did in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to behave with discretion, clearly mindful that its every move is under the close watch of the international community. It should also drop the bad habit of seeking its own interests by pulling up others.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He has exerted his utmost efforts for building the KPA into matchless armed forces over the past several decades. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last more than decade, in particular, witnessed the application of the Songun politics in all fields. It is a period in which the outstanding commanding art of Kim Jong Il has been fully demonstrated, and it has been recorded in the history of Juche-oriented army building as shining annals during which the KPA greeted a heyday in its development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The energetic Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il represents great leadership as it helped the KPA grow to be an army strong in ideology and faith and upgrade the combat capability of the KPA to the highest level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Songun leadership is great because it helped develop our revolutionary armed forces into invincible ones fully backed and supported by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has unshakable faith and constancy as it unfailingly remains true to the sense of obligation towards its leader even in the worst adversity. All its servicepersons are ready to become human bullets and bombs in defence of the headquarters of the revolution. The KPA always adheres to such firm working-class principle as mercilessly punishing any enemies of the people and the revolution. This is the spiritual and moral traits of the KPA which boasts its might as an ideologically strong army. Under the commandership of Kim Jong Il it has been trained into a strong army capable of demonstrating its military and technical capability in any modern war, a war to be fought on the basis of science and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has merciless and deadly striking power firmly guaranteed by mighty national defence industry. This serves as tremendous war deterrent which provides a sure guarantee for the sovereignty and security of the socialist homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Invulnerable is the whole country guarded by the KPA as all the people are ready to fight on the forefront alongside the servicepersons to defend the country in case of emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ideological and moral traits, the fighting spirit and the combat capacity of the KPA, which has demonstrated its might as the strong revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu, are the fruition of the extraordinary disposition and political and military ability of Kim Jong Il.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they should, at the same time, advance the cause of reunification in the strong spirit of self-respect under whatever blatant pressure of foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be neither ready-made \"remedy\" nor good idea except doing so in the efforts to achieve national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to firmly preserve the Juche character and national character in the efforts to achieve national reunification it is necessary to bolster the driving force of the nation in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for preserving the Juche character and national character means a struggle against imperialism and hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a stereotyped trick of imperialists to divide and rule other countries. The division of the Korean nation was a product of the U.S. imperialists' policy of aggression to dominate it. The U.S. remains unchanged in its wild ambition to keep the Korean nation divided indefinitely to dominate it in defiance of the demand of the Korean nation, swimming against the trend of the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans should maintain a high degree of vigilance against the criminal moves of the U.S. based on its policy to dominate Korea and decisively check and foil them by their concerted efforts, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Taesong in Pyongyang, its capital, and set up stones indicating cart-ways and footways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Palhae, Koguryo's successor which existed as a powerful feudal state for hundreds of years, constructed five trunk roads stretching out from the capital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of Ri dynasty, the roads were extended to villages as well as to counties and sub-counties, promoting the national development and regional relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, a large number of mountain passes were paved on the Great Paektu Range. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And bridges and piers were constructed across rivers and streams. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of Koguryo had built a large wooden bridge across the River Taedong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to relics discovered, the 370-odd-metre long bridge was built in front of the Anhak Royal Palace of Koguryo in the early 5th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bridge had its frames built with thick square timbers, rails set up at the entrances and body for security and all joints dovetailed without using iron-nails or cramps.  The bridge shows the high standard of bridge architecture of the Koguryo people.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They truthfully reflect the undying exploits performed by the President for the liberation of the country, political and military might of the KPRA and the great joy of the then people in attending him as the sun of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the works such as \"Kim Il Sung Makes an Appearance in Korea\", \"The Sun of the Korean People\" and \"Mt. Changbai Soaring High in Sky\" are typical hymns mirroring the unanimous ideological emotion of the Korean nation who ardently revered and held the President in high esteem as the lodestar of the fellow-countrymen, the leader of the revolution and the great general in the anti-Japanese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Poems such as \"Snow Flies\", \"Let's Create Plum Tree Woods\" and \"Spring Water Brings up Heroes\" sing in praise of the President with the warmest and purest human love, comradeship and patriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are poems carrying the reverence for the legendary commander of the guerrilla army and the emotion of the then people who were charmed by him, believed him as the God and forged ahead toward the new spring of liberation.  Among them are poems \"Commander Kim Comes\", \"Giant Footprint\", \"Giddap! Let Cow take Mountain Path! \", \"Mother Presents Roe Deer Leather\" and \"Song to Accompaniment of Hand-Clapping\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The poems are widely recited among the People's Army servicepersons and people as they vividly show how ardent and genuine the reverence of the then people for President Kim Il Sung was.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
