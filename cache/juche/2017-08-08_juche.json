            "content": "KAPPC Spokesman Rejects Anti-DPRK \"Sanctions Resolution\"\r\n Pyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued the following statement on Tuesday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., the most shameful gangster-like state in the world, and the riffraff submitting to it blindly deterred by its high-handed practices committed an international crime of cooking up the \"sanctions resolution\" 2371 by abusing the name of the UN Security Council on Sunday.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as the adoption of \"sanctions resolution\" at the UNSC, U.S. President Trump acted as if he achieved a great thing, saying that it would give very big economic shock to the DPRK and he extended thanks to China and Russia for cooperation in adopting the \"resolution\". The U.S. ambassador to the UN and other underlings are talking such nonsense that the \"north's regime would have to pay dearly for persistently developing its nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japanese Prime Minister Abe is talking rhetoric that he highly appreciated the \"resolution\" as one clearly reflecting the will of the international community demanding a higher level of pressure on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Big countries that showed their hands in favor of adopting the \"resolution\", scared by the U.S. sanctions threats to them, are letting loose clumsy excuses, saying that it is necessary to take sanctions against the DPRK but the final target is the settlement of the issue through negotiations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the poor south Korean puppet regime is impudently uttering, urging the DPRK to seriously accept the united warning from the international community and immediately stop the reckless provocation threatening world peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the recent \"sanctions resolution\" cooked up by the U.S. and its followers is an outcome of the horror and uneasiness of the U.S. taken aback by the might and mettle of the DPRK, which towered high as the nuclear power of Juche and a world military power, and the last-ditch efforts of the hostile forces under the pretext of the \"international community\". It is also the label of the weakness and servility of the riffraff who showed their hands in favor of adopting the \"resolution\" as they are scared by the U.S., old wolf, though understanding that it is immoral.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee clarifies the following stand, in reflection of the fixed faith and strong retaliatory will of our army and people who want peace and security in the region and the rest of the world;\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. We totally and resolutely reject the recent \"sanctions resolution\", cooked up by the gangster-like U.S. imperialists in collusion with its blind followers, as hideous terrorism against the dignified DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In any page of UN Charter and international code there can be found no article stipulating that a country's step for military strength to defend its dignity and sovereignty may be called into question.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Like all the past anti-DPRK \"resolutions\" cooked up at the UN, the recent \"sanctions resolution\" is a criminal and illegal document, invented by the gangster-like U.S., the sworn enemy of the Korean people, and passed by the UNSC which has turned into a tool of evil infected with extreme prejudice and injustice, bereft of its inborn mission and duty as a body responsible for global peace and security, and into a puppet acting on the hands of the U.S. and other big powers. We do not regard the \"resolution\" as much as wastepaper and the absurd call for its implementation as much as bark of a dog at the moonlit night.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nothing will be more foolish than to expect that such \"resolution\", little short of a document of crimes, will give a great \"shock\" and result in something.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. Now that gangster-like act has reached its height to ruthlessly violate the sovereignty and rights to existence and development of the DPRK, the substantial action of justice by its army and people will follow to defend them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The times have changed and the world is getting awakened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world political structure is radically changing according to the aspiration of the awakened people. And the overall national strength and strategic position of the DPRK have been remarkably increased.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under such circumstances, packs of wolves are coming in attack to strangle a nation. The Korean army and people will never remain an onlooker to such practice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should be mindful that the DPRK's strategic steps accompanied by physical action will be taken mercilessly with the mobilization of all its national strength.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. Taking this opportunity we call on all countries and peoples to turn out in foiling the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the U.S. and its followers which abused the name of the UN against the world conscience and building a new just and stable world order.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Assertions of big powers are not always right and majority cannot represent justice at all.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the Middle Ages, there were only a few people who advocated the Copernican Theory and the majority opposed and incriminated it. But the truth was proved along with history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those countries, which were thanked by Trump and gained gratitude of the U.S. this time for supporting the illicit \"resolution\", pursuant to its policy, after dropping their creed, conscience and obligation, should feel shame before the world conscience, deeply reflect on their wrongdoings in the stern court of history and mankind and pay dearly for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All countries and peoples in the world opposing war and loving peace should courageously turn out in the struggle against imperialism and the U.S. in order to set right the present unfair international order where injustice lords it over justice and high-handed and ego-driven practice prevails over truth and to build a new righteous and peaceful world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We declare before the world once again our iron will to straightly advance along the road of simultaneously developing the two fronts without a moment's stop or vacillation, keenly realizing how just we were when we decided to take the path of bolstering the nuclear force, now that the U.S.-led hostile forces are running wild to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will resolutely smash by dint of justice the illicit \"sanctions resolution\" cooked up by the brigandish U.S. imperialists."

Neither shall we flinch even an inch from the road to bolstering up the nuclear forces chosen by ourselves, unless the hostile policy and nuclear threat of the U.S. against the DPRK are fundamentally eliminated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This time also, the U.S. fabricated a new \"sanctions resolution\" against the DPRK in the UN Security Council. The DPRK has already made its position clear that it will respond with strong follow-up measures and acts of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK which relies on self-reliance and self-development as its mode of existence can fully counter the hostile policy and acts of the U.S. Should the U.S. pounce upon the DPRK with military force at last, the DPRK is ready to teach the U.S. a severe lesson with its nuclear strategic force it has so far shown in detail."

The south Korean authorities put more than 8 000 progressive persons of culture and arts on the blacklist and suppressed them under the direct instruction and control of traitor Park Geun Hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Seoul Central District Court sentenced to light punishment seven persons responsible for the case, including Kim Ki Chun, former presidential chief of staff of Chongwadae, and Jo Yun Son, former minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism, saying that \"the state administration's keynote of the Park Geun Hye regime calling for removal of the leftists and aid to the rightists has not been recognized as illegality\". Even it set free Jo under the pretext of probation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unfair decision on the top-class criminals who organized and implemented political terror shading the modern witch hunting is an intolerable mockery and wanton challenge to the mindset of the candlelight demonstrators.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the decision, the puppet court revealed once again its true colors as political waiting maid serving the fascist dictatorship forces, the conservative group of traitors.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet judicial authorities staged illegal trials in the whole period of traitor Park Geun Hye's office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Here are typical examples.

Tambien, no pasa de ser una desesperacion agonica de las fuerzas hostiles empaquetada con el nombre de la \"sociedad internacional\" y deviene el estigma dejado en la frente de ONU debido a la debilidad y vileza de los fulanos y menganos que dieron la aprobacion a sabiendas de su caracter injusto por temor a EE.UU, viejo lobo sin dientes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn reflejo de la firme conviccion y la irrefrenable voluntad de represalia del ejercito y pueblo de Corea que desean la paz y la seguridad de la region y el resto del mundo, el CCPAP aclara la siguiente posicion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1.   Condenamos de manera total y dura la presente \"resolucion de sancion\" inventada por la iniciativa de los imperialistas yanquis y por la cooperacion de los viles perseguidores calificandola del peor crimen terrorista de categoria especial contra la digna RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ninguna pagina de la Carta de la ONU y del Codigo Internacional hay un parrafo que permite cuestionar las medidas de fortalecimiento del poderio militar de un pais para defender su dignidad y soberania.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, como lo hicieron en el pasado tambien la presente \"resolucion de sancion\" es el documento criminal inventado por la iniciativa de EE.UU, enemigo jurado del pueblo coreano, y, en particular, el ilegal que la ONU aprobo convirtiendose en el aparato de diablo con el extremo prejuicio y la injusticia y en el titere de EE.UU. y otras potencias abandonando su mision y deber de la organizacion para asegurar la paz y seguridad del mundo. Por tanto, no le atribuimos ningun significado a esa \"resolucion\", ni prestaremos oidos nada a las demandas por su ejecucion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria una gran equivocacion si esperan que esa \"resolucion\", monton de crimenes, diera algun \"impacto\" a alguien y trajera un supuesto resultado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.   Puesto que se llegan al climax los actos gangsteriles para aplastar despiadadamente nuestros derechos a la soberania y la existencia, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea tomaran las reales acciones justas para defenderlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa epoca se cambio y el mundo va a despertar la conciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa estructura politica del mundo se transforma de manera radical segun la aspiracion del pueblo que toma la conciencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl poderio estatal universal y la posicion estrategica de la RPDC se llegaron al plano extraordinariamente alto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn este tiempo el ejercito y pueblo de Corea no pueden dejar intactos a la banda de gangsteres que tratan de arrebatar los derechos a la soberania, la existencia y el desarrollo de un pais y eliminar completamente una nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben olvidar en absoluto que se tomaran las severas medidas estrategicas incluyendo el ejercicio fisico movilizando todo el poderio estatal del pais fortalecido extraordinariamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3.  Aprovechamos esta oportunidad para exhortar a todos los paises y pueblos a levantarse por frustrar el despotismo y la arbitrariedad de EE.UU. y sus fuerzas seguidoras que abusaron del nombre de la ONU ante la conciencia del mundo y construir un nuevo orden mundial justo y estable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo son correctas todas las insistencias de los paises grandes, ni la mayoria puede representar la justicia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Edad Media, solo unas personas insistieron en el  heliocentrismo y fueron muchos que les opusieron y reprimieron. Pero, la veracidad se ha comprobado como victoria con el transcurso de la historia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos paises, que esta vez recibieron el agradecimiento de Trump al dar aprobacion a la \"resolucion\" ilegal abandonando el credo, la conciencia y la obligacion moral y obedeciendo a EE.UU., deben sentirse la verguenza ante la conciencia mundial, reflexionar profundamente sobre sus crimenes en el tribunal de la historia y la humanidad y pagar el alto precio merecido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los paises y pueblos del mundo, que se oponen a la guerra y aman la paz, deben levantarse con valentia en la lucha antiimperialista y antiyanqui para corregir el actual orden internacional muy desigual en que la injusticia sentencia la justicia y reinan la arbitrariedad, el egoismo y la tergiversacion de la verdad, y construir un nuevo mundo justo y pacifico. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos momentos en que EE.UU. y las fuerzas hostiles se desesperan por aplastar a la RPDC, sentimos con nuestro corazon cuan justo es el camino para el fortalecimiento de fuerzas armadas nucleares optado por nosotros. Y volvemos a declarar una vez mas a todo el mundo nuestra ferrea voluntad de seguir marchando rectamente por el camino de desarrollo paralelo sin parar ni un segundo ni dar vueltas ni 1mm. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea frustraran duramente con la fuerza de justicia la ilegal \"resolucion de sancion\" fabricada por el imperialismo norteamericano."
