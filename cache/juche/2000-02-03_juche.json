            "content": "Jo Chang Dok interviewed on serious shortage of electricity \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- Vice-premier Jo Chang Dok of the DPRK cabinet answered a question put by KCNA as regards the recent serious shortage of electricity in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said:\r\n   Today the Korean people are picking up the pace of the general advance for the building of a powerful nation under the wise guidance of the Worker's Party of Korea in the wake of the publication of the joint New Year editorial. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The powerful nation we are building means a thriving socialist nation with strong national power where the people live with nothing to envy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the world acknowledges, our politico-ideological and military potentials are strong enough to become a powerful nation. If we concentrate our efforts on economic construction, we will be able to build an economically powerful nation in a few years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The serious shortage of electricity, however, hampers socialist economic construction in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Electricity is main power for the national economy and lifeline of economic growth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Sufficient supply of electricity makes it possible to boost industry and agriculture and improve the people's standard of living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The serious shortage of electricity keeps us from meeting the growing needs in all sectors of the national economy, greatly hampering production and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There has never been such shortage of electricity as today in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are not to blame for this difficulty in the way of our economic growth. It is entirely attributable to the moves of the U.S.-led imperialist allied forces to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   By nature, the DPRK is rich in resources to generate electricity. It has potentials enough to satisfy the demands for electricity by itself in various domains of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is well known to the world that the DPRK supplied electricity to South Korea out of the compatriotic stand right after the August 15 liberation of Korea from the Japanese colonial rule and repeatedly offered to supply electricity to South Korea after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the economy has gained in scope, the need for electricity has increased. With a view to satisfying the ever-growing need for electricity we put forward the policy of building a Juche-based nuclear power base long ago and went ahead with the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the building of an atomic power plant to be equipped with graphite-moderated reactors relying on locally available abundant fuel had been promoted as scheduled, the problem of electricity would have already been solved successfully and electricity would not have been in such short supply  as today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK's building of nuclear power base was for  peaceful purposes such as economic construction and people's living, not for threatening any one. It had nothing to do with the development of nuclear arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., however, put pressure upon the DPRK, calling for \"sanctions\" and \"punishment\" over the non-existent \"suspected development of nuclear arms.\" When the anti-DPRK campaign did not work, it made a compromise offer to build light water reactors if the DPRK stops building nuclear power base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With a view to relieving concern about \"suspected development of nuclear arms,\" a fiction spread by the U.S.  and demonstrating the will and efforts for denuclearization and peace  the DPRK took a step of freezing the building of nuclear power base, though it had already been under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should have responded to such sincere efforts of the DPRK by pushing ahead as scheduled with the construction of a power plant with two light water reactors and lifting economic sanctions against the DPRK as it had promised under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In fact, it was only  the DPRK that suffered losses due to its unilateral freezing of the building of nuclear power base. The U.S., however, has not honestly fulfilled its commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Due to the unreasonable U.S. delaying tactics the LWR construction is not likely to be completed even in 2010, to say nothing of 2003, the deadline. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. blatant violation of the agreement is a manifestation of a policy of new type to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now that the U.S. fails to honor its commitments in good faith, the DPRK can no longer pin any hope on that construction nor can it remain a passive onlooker to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The frozen building of nuclear power base has already caused a loss of tens of billions of KWH of electricity, bringing immeasurably  adverse effects on the national economy and the people's living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The Korean people and the people's army, greatly infuriated by this, are unanimously pushing for compensation for the loss and strongly asserting that the Juche-based nuclear power building be pressed ahead with as originally scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    Even in view of the international regulations it is a common sense and usage for one to feel responsibility and make compensation for the damage done to the other in violation of the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The U.S. should own responsibility for having caused such acute shortage of electricity in the DPRK and brought enormous economic losses to it and make compensation for them in any form. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is an irreversible principled demand and a legitimate sovereign right  of the DPRK, the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. does not fulfil its commitments but persistently pursues the policy of stifling the DPRK, the DPRK will be left with no option but to go its own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Then, it will be too late for the U.S. to regret for its act. \r\n\r\n"
