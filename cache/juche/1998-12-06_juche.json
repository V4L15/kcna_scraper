Korea's \"NSL\" called for \r\n \r\n   Pyongyang, December 6 (KCNA) -- The Amnesty International on November 30 released an article headlined \"'National Security Law' should be revised in keeping with declaration on human rights\" 50 years after the institution of the \"NSL\" in South Korea.\r\n   The article said:\r\n   The \"NSL\" has been used to violate freedom and rights of people in contradiction to the world's declaration on human rights and arrest, torture and punish numbers of people in the past scores of years. Still, it stamps out people's expression of political views and democracy.\r\n   This year the South Korean authorities  have arrested and put behind bars hundreds of South Korean people on the charge of praising and benefiting North Korea by invoking the evil law that defines the north as \"enemy\". It is hypercritic for them to call for \"exchange\".\r\n   It is another suppression of ideology that the South Korean authorities demand \"political prisoners\" \"write a pledge to observe the law.\"   \r\n   They should set free prisoners who have been kept in solitary cells for scores of years and the South Korean people should struggle for the sake of all rights including the freedom of speech and association.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should revise the \"NSL\" fundamentally. \r\n\r\n"

The right to preemptive strike does not rest entirely with them, said Kim Chol Man, an anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter.\r\n   The statement of the spokesman for the general staff of the Korean People's Army (KPA) is a declaration of Korea's resolution  to shower bombs of revenge on the stronghold of the sworn enemies, he said, and went on:\r\n   Once the enemies dare to unleash a war we will never miss the opportunity to achieve the historic cause of national reunification and build a powerful state in this land.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists will see the Korean people raising their iron fists with wrath.\r\n   They will clearly see how they will meet destruction in the '90s in this land of history where they started downhill in the '50s. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

If the U.S. imperialists finally unleash war they will be made forlorn wandering spirits.\r\n   A letter of indignation was read out at the meeting. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
