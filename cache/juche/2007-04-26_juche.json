Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has given steady continuity to the tradition of Songun and made ceaseless long journeys for Songun in the period of turning-point in the Korean revolution, building an invincible socialist military power which no formidable enemy dare provoke. This is the greatest feat he has performed on behalf of the country and the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is the army strong in ideology and faith as all its servicepersons are intensely loyal to the Supreme Commander, the ever-victorious strongest army capable of doing anything in confrontation with enemies and in socialist construction and an invincible powerful army which has the ties of kinship with the people and enjoys the absolute support from them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for holding fast to the Juche-oriented Songun idea and the Songun leadership feats of Kim Il Sung as an eternal lifeline, the daily stresses that to uphold the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il is a sure guarantee for glorifying the ever-victorious history of the revolution started on Mt.

Esto deviene la maxima proeza del Dirigente acumulada ante la patria y la revolucion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El EPC es el fuerte en la ideologia y la fe que tiene absoluta fidelidad a su Comandante Supremo, no conoce ninguna imposibilidad tanto en la confrontacion con los enemigos como en la construccion socialista y cuenta con el apoyo total del pueblo, con el cual mantiene lazos consanguineos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Es preciso tomar por eterna linea vital la original idea del Songun del Presidente y sus proezas logradas en la direccion basada en este pensamiento. Apoyar con fidelidad la direccion del Songun del Dirigente deviene garantia decisiva para llevar adelante la historia de victorias siempre de la revolucion con las fuerzas armadas, que se inicio en el monte Paektu. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Por su parte, el editorial del periodico Minju Joson subraya que si cuenta con el heroico EPC, que se fundo y crecio en el regazo de los Generales legendarios del monte Paektu, se forjo ferreamente en la enconada batalla de vida o muerte contra los imperialistas y en la construccion socialista y exalta de siglo a siglo su poderio como el ejercito del Presidente Kim Il Sung, no nos hay nada que temer ni existe ninguna meta inalcanzable.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
