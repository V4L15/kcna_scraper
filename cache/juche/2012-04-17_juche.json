This time, the U.S. spearheaded the hostile act of encroaching upon the DPRK's legitimate right to launch satellites by abusing the position as chairman of the UNSC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. finally reneged on its promise that \"it respects the sovereignty of the DPRK and has no hostile intent toward it\" in practice, totally violating the Feb. 29 agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We have thus become able to take necessary retaliatory measures, free from the agreement. The U.S. will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace is very dear for us but the dignity of the nation and the sovereignty of the country are dearer for us."

Fracasada tal maquinacion para encubrir la verdad, el imperio impuso al Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU la demanda bandidesca de que la RPDC no debe lanzar tampoco el satelite con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl mencionado consejo fue y es abusado por el despotismo y arbitrariedades de EE.UU., debido a lo cual la consecuencia catastrofica se engendra diariamente en distintas partes del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas resoluciones no. 1718 y no. 1874 del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU, que las fuerzas hostiles cuestionan el lanzamiento de nuestro satelite como \"fundamento\", devienen el producto de despotismo que hostiliza y oprime a la RPDC, y climax  ilegalidad inventada a su manera menospreciando hasta las elementales leyes internacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa esencia bandidesca de dichas resoluciones es hacer que el pais, que no obedece a EE.UU., no desarrolle el poderio de defensa nacional y para ese efecto le quite hasta el derecho a lanzar los satelites con fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal acto violador de doble pauta se comprendio facilmente en el citado consejo porque conviene a los intereses de los paises que intentan monopolizar las tecnologias sofisticadas como el lanzamiento de satelite.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion de hoy demuestra fehacientemente que es disfraz el principio de igualdad de soberania reflejada en la Carta de la ONU y que la justicia debe ser defendida solo por sus propias fuerzas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn relacion con que fue violado seriamente el derecho del estado soberano al lanzamiento de satelites con fines pacificos, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la RPDC declara como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, Rechazamos tajantemente el proceder injusto del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU que trata de pisotear el legitimo derecho de la RPDC a lanzar los satelites.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo mantienen el invariable principio de no tolerar jamas cualquier intento minimo de burlar y atentar la dignidad de la nacion y la soberania del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, seguiremos ejerciendo el independiente derecho al uso del cosmos reconocido por las universales leyes internacionales, que estan por encima de la resolucion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConforme al plan estatal de desarrollo del cosmos, la RPDC ampliara los organos de desarrollo espacial y seguira lanzando los satelites de usos practicos de diferentes tipos indispensables al desarrollo economico del pais incluyendo el satelite estacionario.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podra detener con nada el camino de la RPDC que conquista con vigor el cosmos para fines pacificos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, la RPDC no estara sujetada por mas tiempo al acuerdo RPDC-EE.UU. del 29 de febrero quebrantado por el abierto acto de hostil del imperio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde el principio, la RPDC aclaro reiteradamente la posicion de ejecutar sinceramente dicho acuerdo ratificando que el lanzamiento de satelite con fines pacificos es el problema aparte con el acuerdo del 29 de febrero y por eso tomo medidas practicas reales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, tan pronto como se publico el plan de la RPDC de lanzar el satelite, EE.UU. interrumpio el proceso de suministro de provisiones conveniente al acuerdo RPDC-EEUU pretextandolo, y atento el justo derecho de lanzamiento de satelite de la RRPDC abusando de la posicion del presidente del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, rompio completamente el acuerdo RPDC-EE.UU. del 29 de febrero revolcando con acciones su promesa de \"respetar la soberania y no tener la voluntad de hostilidad\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, la RPDC llego a tomar a su antojo las contramedidas necesarias libre del acuerdo RPDC-EE.UU., y EE.UU. se responsabilizara totalmente de las consecuencias que se emanen de ello.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la RPDC la paz es valiosa. Pero, la dignidad de la nacion y la soberania del pais son mas valiosas."
