Seeing the training of its soldiers in a training room, he noted with great satisfaction that all the servicemen have been prepared as a-match-for-a hundred brave combatants ready to defeat any formidable enemy at one stroke. And he advanced important tasks that would serve as guidelines in further increasing the unit's combat capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also went round cultural, educational and logistic facilities of the battery, saying that best living conditions should be provided to our precious soldiers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He gave the soldiers of the battery a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle as gifts and posed for a picture with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then, he visited a goat farm newly built by the unit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After going round the farm, he set forth tasks that would serve as guidelines in massively raising grass-eating animals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Flocks of goats can be raised in any part of the country if everyone displays the spirit of absolutely and unconditionally carrying out the WPK policies as the unit's servicemen did, he said, calling for launching a brisk nationwide drive to raise goats, following their example. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accompanying him were officers of WPK and government. \r\n   \r\n"

This lesson of history compels us to more highly praise the great feats of Kim Jong Il who has developed the WPK as an invincible party guided by one idea, the people-centred Juche idea, they stressed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is now taking a new attitude towards the DPRK just because it is led by Kim Jong Il, they said, adding: As long as there is his army-based policy, the DPRK will always remain a military power, a strong country which nobody dares provoke. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A congratulatory message to him was adopted at the seminar. \r\n"

He then told his adjutant to go to Mangyongdae instead of him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adjutant recommended him to pay a short visit to Mangyongdae. But the president left for Kangson to give a field guidance to the steel works, saying he would drop in at his old home another time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAfter exchanging first greetings with the Korean people through his triumphal speech afterwards, he visited his old home he had missed so much for two decades.    \r\n\r\n"
