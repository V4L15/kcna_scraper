Rusia y la India tambien se esfuerzan por desarrollar las armas del mismo tipo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad compraba una vez mas que el desarrollo de armas de exterminio masivo por parte de EE.UU. causa la nueva carrera armamentista en el mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, EE.UU. es el culpable principal que exacerba la carrera armamentista y la tension internacional y perturba la paz y la estabilidad del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se agrava en el mundo la carrera armamentista, EE.UU. sera perjudicado mas que nadie debido a su deplorable situacion financiera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia."
