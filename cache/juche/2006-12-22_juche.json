            "content": "Anachronistic Confrontation Doctrine Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean military authorities some time ago rattled on the reexamination of the \"defense policy\" involving the question of \"principal enemy\", singing duet with the United States taking issue with the self-defensive war deterrent of the DPRK.\r\n Commenting on this, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Thursday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"principal enemy\" doctrine touted by the anti-reunification forces of south Korea is a doctrine of the era of confrontation, which regards the north, the same nation, as the chief \"enemy\" and an \"object of removal\". It never falls in line with the June 15 era of reunification today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans are a homogeneous nation which has inherited one and the same culture and tradition down through history. There is no contradiction and reason that should cause hostile feelings between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The concept of \"principal enemy\" is the left-over of the era of inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The earlier rulers of south Korea clung to moves for confrontation and war against the DPRK in collusion with outside forces after tailoring the inter-Korean relations to hostile relations, institutionally and legally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But, today, all the fellow countrymen are vigorously pushing forward the patriotic movement for reunification, hand in hand, following the idea of \"By our nation itself\" under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no justification to be obsessed with hostile feelings against fellow countrymen today when the two parts of the country promised each other in the joint declaration to join efforts of the nation and advance toward independent reunification and are hastening the fulfillment of this commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To stick to the anachronistic concept of \"principal enemy\" reveals the criminal intention to push the present north-south relations back to the era of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principal enemy of our nation and its common target of toppling is the United States which is wrecking peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the clouds of war there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To declare the DPRK the \"principal enemy\" is, immediately, a negation of the June 15 joint declaration and a declaration of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He dedicated his life to saving comrades. He truly treasured and loved his soldiers, taking the revolutionary comradeship shown by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il as the maxim of his life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The film shows its hero breathing his last before keeping the promise he had made with his family to have a picture taken together. But servicepersons of the unit pose for a photograph together with the members of the family of the departed hero on the day when his daughter was leaving for a revolutionary school. These touching scenes of the film show that though the hero's physical life is over, he is immortal as he will be always remembered by the country and the people.         \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes this in a signed article. \r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The most acute struggle in the revolutionary struggle is the class struggle, i.e. the struggle to defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are perpetrating military intervention and blockade against the socialist countries while whipping together the remnants of the overthrown exploiting class and reactionaries in those countries in a bid to use them for the operations to destroy them from within. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries which had been building socialism in the past slackened the observance of the socialist law. This was one of the reasons why socialism collapsed in those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historical experience teaches the lesson that if a country slackens the observance of the socialist law, ignoring the reality in which the class struggle is going on, this will create confusion in social life and pose a serious danger to the socialist system itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to steadily tighten the abidance of the socialist law as long as the class struggle continues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is essential to strictly control and shatter all sorts of hostile factors by the socialist law, a weapon for waging the class struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist law plays a positive role in rooting out the leftovers of the obsolete ideas in the minds of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A strict observance of the socialist law provides the working people with an important guarantee for working hard for socialist economic and cultural construction, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But we have not provided them with uniforms. Their parents are revolutionaries who courageously fought and fell in battles against the Japanese imperialists. If we put quality clothes on the bereaved children who had been ill-clad and ill-fed in the past, we will feel much easier. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And she drew the design of the uniform, saying that the school uniform should be made in the form of military uniform and put broad red braids to trousers so as to clearly show the deep meaning that they are carrying forward the revolutionary traditions of the anti-Japanese armed struggle as the President taught. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Busy as she was assisting the President, she called at the factory four times after then and solved issues arising in making the school uniforms with parental affection. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Several days before the opening ceremony of the school, she came to the factory with six uniforms. She told officials of the factory that these uniforms did not fit some students and it was not bad to provide the clothes to them as they were but it made her feel regrettable.

Paektu Kim Jong Suk showed warm love for stoutly bringing up with nothing to envy more in the world all the bereaved children of the revolutionary comrades-in-arms who had died in the sacred war for the liberation of the country.
