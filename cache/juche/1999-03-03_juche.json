He blamed the present chief executive for peddling again the \"sunshine policy.\"   He went on to say:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The \"policy\" is a \"defeat communism policy\" pursued with the consent of the U.S., part of confrontation with the north and a campaign against the nation and reunification.   The \"globalization\" of the economy on the lips of the present South Korean chief executive imbued with national nihilism to the marrow is aimed at using the South Korean economy for the purposes of his lifelong stay in power and of anti-reunification.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no way out for those who leave everything to the tender mercy of outsiders.   The South Korean authorities should no longer go against the desire of the nation for reunification, but make a bold decision to find a way out in unconditionally accepting the proposal of the joint meeting of the government, political parties and organisations of the DPRK. \r\n     \r\n"

Kumgang tourism\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 3 (KCNA) -- The South Korean \"Minister of National Defence\", Chon Yong Thaek, in a \"report on defence to the national assembly\" a few days ago, let loose nonsense that \"one can not rule out possibility of the north diverting the payment to it for Mt. Kumgang tourism to a military purpose,\" according to a news report.   Meanwhile, the \"Unification Minister\", Kang In Dok, addressing a recent \"meeting of the National Assembly committee on unification, diplomatic and trade affairs\", said they are \"taking a cautious approach toward the possible use of the funds paid by Hyun Dai to the north for the development of Mt. Kumgang tourism as military spending.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As it is by no means accidental that high-ranking South Korean military and government officials chimed in with each other in clamoring about the \"use of funds as military spending,\" the north can not but consider it a serious matter.   Their blasts represent the ill-intentioned political attempt to stop halfway the Mt. Kumgang tourism now under way thanks to the compatriotic measure taken by the Korean Asia and Pacific Peace Committee in response to the initiative of Jong Ju Yong, Honorary Chairman of the South Korean Hyun Dai Business Group.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now the north can not but have a strong doubt about whether the tourism arranged with so much efforts can go on or not.   In actuality, the north's measure to go ahead with Mt. Kumgang tourism was not motivated by any commercial purpose to earn money.   It is based on the principle of great national unity for national reunification whereby the north and the south can trust, unite and cooperate with each other through Mt. Kumgang tourism.   Nevertheless, the South Korean ruling quarters describe the north's compatriotic measure as a \"money-driven one\" and went the length of even spreading such a sheer rumor as \"use of funds as military spending.\" It is intolerable.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"separation of politics and economy\", \"exchanges\" and \"cooperation\" mouthed by the South Korean rulers whenever an opportunity presents itself are all sheer lies and it is no more than a smokescreen to conceal their anti-national confrontation policy.   The South Korean authorities should stop the ill-intentioned obstructive moves at once, clearly mindful they will be held wholly responsible for all the consequences to be entailed by the suspension of Mt. Kumgang tourism. \r\n  \r\n"

It is a monumental work which  holds a distinguished place in the history of the immortal leadership of Kim Jong Il, who  has firmly defended the socialist cause from the abuses of all enemies.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The work smashed to pieces the sophistry of the renegades of socialism calling socialism \"totalitarian\", \"barracks-like\" and \"administrative and commanding\", and fully proved the unquestioned superiority of socialism.   Kim Jong Il is the great defender of justice who has firmly defended the socialist cause with the most transparent faith in socialism, a signed article of the paper says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is Kim Jong Il's faith that socialism is an absolute truth and is sure to win because it is the people's demand and aspiration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is with this transparent faith that he could see through the absurd sophistry abusing socialism and deal a hard blow to the imperialists and renegades with his well-grounded logic.   The Korean people did not waver when socialism collapsed in some countries, and demonstrated their dignity as a people with strong faith steadily advancing along the road of socialism in defiance of the anti-socialist campaign of the imperialists.  The credit for all this goes to him the supreme incarnation of revolutionary faith.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article refers to the immortal exploits of Kim Jong Il in leading the socialist cause to victory with his distinguished wisdom.   Noting the DPRK, which is crystal of his idea  and leadership, is an invulnerable  fortress of socialism and a beacon of hope for progressive humankind, the article says that whatever sophism of the enemies abusing socialism is smashed by the DPRK. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Misinterpreting the launch of the DPRK's first artificial satellite last August as \"missile launch,\" he argued the U.S. mainland, too, has been exposed to missile threat from the DPRK. Then he stressed the need to set up a joint organization intended for research, development and deployment of ballistic missiles.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is needless to say his argument came from bellicosity  based on fabricated \"North Korean threat.\"   But what cannot be overlooked is that this argument reflected the conservative hard-liner's dominative design to give concrete shape to the U.S. Asia strategy which is to establish an Asian version of \"NATO\" and that it was officially expressed as intention of the congress.    The U.S. administration is these days revitalizing its policy of arms buildup, which was temporarily suspended after the Cold War, and undisguisedly seeking to dodge its obligations under \"ABM\" and other treaties that have been put in force or signed for strategic arms limitations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That being the reality, Gilman's statement cannot but arouse deep apprehension as it is a grave threat and challenge to peace in Asia and the rest of the world.   When the 21st century humankind wishes to make a peaceful one is near at hand, the U.S. hard-liners are insisting on war policy fraught with great danger.   The prevailing situation urgently calls upon the peaceloving people in Asia and the rest of the world to heighten their vigilance against the U.S. scheme for the establishment of the Asian version of \"NATO,\" and reject and check the war policy of the U.S. bellicose elements. \r\n\r\n"

High-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes and patrol planes made about 40 espionage flights.   U-2 high-altitude strategic reconnaissance planes, RC-135 strategic reconnaissance planes and P-3 patrol planes flew over areas along the military demarcation line for photographing and electronic reconnaissance on the northern half of Korea as a whole.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   RC-12, RF-4c and RC-7 tactical spy planes committed espionage on frontline and coastline areas of the North Korea. Involved in espionage were a lot of military planes from Japan and other overseas bases.   All this is a vicious challenge to the unanimous desire of the Korean people and the peaceloving people of the world for detente on the Korean peninsula and its peaceful reunification. \r\n\r\n"
