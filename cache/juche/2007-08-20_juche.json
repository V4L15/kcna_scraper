            "content": "KCNA Censures Outbursts of Those Swimming against Trend of Times\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 18 (KCNA) -- There is a saying that a dog barks at the moon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Kyu Thaek, lawmaker from the Grand National Party of south Korea, behaved in the same manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He in a recent interview with the south Korean Yonhap News dared say this or that about the DPRK top leader's \"return visit to Jeju Island.\" He talked nonsense that if the visit becomes a reality, this is sure to be misused for the \"presidential election.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went the lengths of letting loose reckless remarks that the south and the north of Korea would use all cards for preventing the GNP from seizing power and they might drive the situation to the state of national emergency, if necessary, through \"skirmishes\" in the West or East Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can hardly expect proper remarks from the GNP gentries, a group of anti-reunification gangsters. But the mud-slinging made by Ri Kyu Thaek, a mere political philistine, at the supreme headquarters of the DPRK cannot be construed otherwise than a grave political provocation touching off the indignation of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forthcoming meeting of the top leaders of the north and the south of Korea is an event to be recorded in the national history as it will be of weighty importance in expanding and developing the inter-Korean relations onto a higher stage on the basis of the June 15 joint declaration and in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\" and thus opening up a new phase for peace on the Korean Peninsula, co-prosperity of the nation and the country's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why not only all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad but also world people are warmly hailing and supporting it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, no sooner had the north-south agreement been made public than the GNP, a group of traitors, recklessly voiced opposition to it, thus bringing into bolder relief its anti-reunification and treacherous nature before the world. And it is now working with bloodshot eyes to abuse the inter-Korean summit for attaining its political and strategic purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They blustered that the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises should not be postponed nor their plan be changed and talked nonsense about the \"return visit to Jeju Island\" despite the fact that politicians of insight are demanding the cancellation of the plan for war exercises, aware that saber rattling targeted against the dialogue partner obviously runs counter to the desire of the nation and the trend of the times. Not content with this, they are floating the rumor about \"skirmishes between the south and the north.\" This only indicates their ulterior intention to torpedo the dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those very dangerous remarks can be made only by those preoccupied with fascism and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Kyu Thaek's vituperation is a product of the GNP gentries' desperate plot to throw wet blanket over the important event of the nation with sheer fabrications in a bid to play down the significance of the inter-Korean summit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the GNP gentries that link the announcement of the north-south agreement with the \"presidential election\" and are working hard to use it for their election campaign. Their coming to power precisely means a war. The reality clearly proves it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Neither the important event of the nation nor improved inter-Korean relations nor peace and reunification are thinkable as long as the GNP is at large. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the GNP gentries continue going reckless, swimming against the trend of the times towards peace and reunification they will not be able to escape bitter denunciation and stern judgment from the public at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we would like to warn the Yonhap News and MBC against using misinformation as it is.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The United States and other Western countries are trumpeting that the \"NAM has lost its meaning.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Indian foreign minister strongly refuted and denounced such false claim recently. Noting that the NAM is playing a special role in the development of cooperation among developing countries, south-south cooperation, in particular, he stressed that it has made an important contribution to the struggle against colonialism and apartheid since the end of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are no other forces in the international arena than the NAM that groups many countries of the world and functions as an organized force regarding independence against imperialism as the noble idea of its activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM, a powerful anti-imperialist independent force, has given a powerful impetus to the process of world independence while greatly changing the balance of forces between progressives and reactionaries in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The non-aligned countries have pooled their strength in the struggle for independence against imperialists under the slogan \"Let world people advocating independence unite!\" and countered the imperialists' arbitrary practices with the strategy of unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The position and say of the non-aligned and other developing countries have risen higher than ever before in the international arena including the UN and no issues can be properly settled without their involvement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM is now creditably performing its noble mission as an independent political force by standing up against the imperialist and hegemonic forces and frustrating their moves for aggression and war under the banner of independence against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NAM remains still today a powerful anti-imperialist revolutionary force in our times and a main force for building a new independent world which no one can ignore. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the imperialists are talking a lot that the NAM has \"lost its meaning.\" This is nothing but a revelation of their uneasiness, impatience and fear of the fact that it is steadily performing its noble mission, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the military and strategic aim of the Abe regime to get the SDF ready to cope with a modern war so that it may participate in a war of aggression anytime, taking advantage of the U.S. \"war on terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have aggravated the situation in Northeast Asia by staging all kinds of war exercises from the beginning of the year. They are planning to let the SDF participate in multi-national joint marine military exercise to be held in the Bay of Bengal in Indian Ocean in September. That is why they are zealously participating in the above-said military exercise under the pretext of \"combating terrorism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe forces intend to further increase their support to the U.S.-led war, underlining the need for \"Japan to play the role as expected by the international community.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military operations being conducted by the SDF together with the U.S. forces in the dispute-torn areas can be described as a prelude to the operations to realize the ambition for overseas aggression harbored by the Japanese militarist forces for dozens of years after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are opting for pushing ahead with the establishment of the wartime system and rendering the country more militarist and fascist under the pretext of the above-said role of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  They upgraded the Defense Agency to the ministry, thereby drastically increasing the function and role of the ministry as the highest military mechanism and providing it with preconditions for mobilizing everything of the country as well as armed forces for a war under the command of the prime minister in \"contingency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe forces are also working hard to have strongholds of military strategic importance overseas under the plea of \"military support\" to the U.S. escalating the \"war on terrorism\" worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are deliberately aggravating the situation by sparking off territorial disputes with neighboring countries over the issue of \"dominium.\" These are politically motivated military provocations for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless moves of the Abe forces for reinvasion will only precipitate their ruin.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
