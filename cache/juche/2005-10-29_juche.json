In the last more than one decade during which the DPRK weathered out stern ordeals they sent sincere material and moral support to the Korean people in invariable good faith and with fraternity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the Chinese party and government led by Comrade Hu Jintao has set greatest store by the traditional DPRK-China friendship under the prevailing situation, taken positive measures to boost the cooperative relations between the two countries and made sincere efforts to ensure peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, its close neighbor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We highly estimate this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing myself of this opportunity I would like to extend my profound thanks to the Chinese party, government and people for having always rendered sincere unstinted support to our people in their just cause and provided the modern large glass factory free to us this time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people are very grateful for this unstinted aid given by the fraternal Chinese people and will always remember and value the friendship between the two peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Communist Party of China set forth fresh lines and policies suited to the actual conditions of China at the present times including the \"principle of the people first\", \"scientific view on development\" and the goal of building a harmonious socialist society and has energetically aroused all the people for their materialization and registered many successes in the socialist modernization drive with Chinese characteristics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n China's overall national power has remarkably grown stronger and its role has increased in the international arena with each passing day under the correct leadership of the CPC with Comrade Hu Jintao as general secretary and thanks to the devoted endeavors of the Chinese people.\r\n This is in line with the objective of promoting the multi-polarization of the world and peace and stability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I would like to take this opportunity to offer my hearty congratulations to you on the success made by the recent 5th plenary meeting of the 16th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the successful launch of manned spacecraft \"Shenzhou-6\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party and people are rejoiced over the achievements made in China, a fraternal neighbour, as over their own  and wholeheartedly wish the Chinese people fresh and bigger success in their efforts to build a comprehensively well-off society and achieve the complete reunification of the whole country.\r\n It is the steadfast stand of our party and government to steadily boost generation after generation the DPRK-China friendship that stood all sorts of test of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fraternal friendship with the Chinese people deeply rooted in the hearts of our people will remain unchanged in whatever storm and stress and our party and government will make positive efforts to boost the bilateral friendship which is associated with the noble intention and great devotion of the revolutionary forerunners of both countries and serves as a common boon to the prosperity and happiness of the two peoples.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

I met with you Comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il in Beijing in April last year when the fragrance of spring was strongly felt and discussed with you a far-reaching plan for developing the Sino-DPRK relations. In October in the splendid autumn I and you Comrade General Secretary met with each other again in Pyongyang and are harvesting rich fruits of the Sino-DPRK friendship and cooperation, looking back on the course of the development of the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative relations. We have shared the view that in order to develop the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative relations in depth both China and the DPRK should have more frequent exchange of high-level visits, strengthen the exchange of views, expand the areas of exchange, enrich the content of cooperation, step up the trade and economic cooperation, promote common development, actively help and cooperate with each other and protect the bilateral interests in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some time ago, the Korean people celebrated the 60th anniversary of the WPK foundation in a grand style. Over the last 60 years the glorious WPK has led the heroic Korean people to make achievements in construction despite manifold difficulties, drawing the attention of the whole world. In recent years, in particular, the WPK headed by you Comrade General Secretary has led the Korean people to work hard in the spirit of fortitude, registering fresh successes in the cause of building a great prosperous powerful socialist nation. It is our belief that a rosier future is bound to be in store for the DPRK as long as there are the dynamic leadership of the WPK headed by you Comrade General Secretary and the great might of all the single-mindedly united Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the last long period of time the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China have brought a radical change in the appearance of China and incessantly raised the level of the social productivity, overall national power and the standard of the people's living by preserving independence and sovereignty and maintaining reform and opening, guided by Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong's idea, Deng Xiaoping's theory and the important thought of the \"three represents\", advancing with the times, perfecting the socialist system without let-up, steadily studying and developing the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. Over the last 26 years from 1978 to 2004 the gross domestic output value of China increased 9.4 percent on an annual average, from less 147.3 billion dollars to 1,649.4 billion dollars and the total value of import and export grew at the rate of over 16 percent on an annual average, from 20.6 billion dollars to 1,154.8 billion dollars. The amount of direct foreign investment actually used by China up to the end of 2004 totaled 562.1 billion dollars. As proved in practice, the path of socialism with Chinese characteristics is a correct way of leading China to prosperity, democracy, civilization and harmony and the way to be held fast to with certainty and steadfastness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, at the same time, are well aware that being the largest developing country in the world, China has big population, a weak foundation, its development is very uneven and it is still beset with not a few distinct contradictions and problems. We have to still work hard in order to attain the goal of building a comprehensively well-off society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The 5th Plenary Meeting of the 16th Central Committee of the CPC held in some days ago laid down a strategy for economic and social development of China during the 11th Five-Year Plan.  Various nationalities in China are now pushing forward with redoubled efforts the reform and opening and the modernization drive and striving hard to attain the grand goal of building a comprehensively well-off society and steadily bring about a new phase in the socialist cause with Chinese characteristics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Chinese party, government and people set greatest store by the Sino-DPRK friendship and it is our steadfast strategic policy to consolidate and develop this friendship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Permit me to take this opportunity to reaffirm that we, together with the Korean party, government and people, will inherit the tradition, face up to the future, advance with the times, support and closely cooperate with each other to steadily enrich the content of the Sino-DPRK friendly and cooperative relations and continuously record a new page in the history of the Sino-DPRK friendship and cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Papers Welcome Goodwill Envoy of Chinese People\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 28 (KCNA) -- Pyongyang-based newspapers today editorially welcome Hu Jintao, general secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and president of the People's Republic of China, paying an official goodwill visit to the DPRK at the invitation of Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK.\r\n In an editorial titled \"Traditional DPRK-China friendship will steadily grow stronger\" Rodong Sinmun says that the current DPRK visit by Hu Jintao which is of weighty significance in view of the historic period and political weight will mark a landmark occasion in putting the DPRK-China friendship onto a new higher stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bilateral friendly relations were forged and deepened by President Kim Il Sung and Mao Zedong, Zhou Enlai and Deng Xiaoping, the leaders of the elder generation of China, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great tradition of the DPRK-China friendship has been steadily carried forward under the particular care of the top leaders of the two countries. Kim Jong Il visited China three times in recent years, thus opening a brilliant chapter in the annals of the DPRK-China friendship. The unerasable footsteps left by him and his undying feats performed during his visit to China are recorded in the history of the DPRK-China friendship.\r\n The new collective leadership of China with Hu Jintao as general secretary has made energetic efforts to boost the bilateral friendship. The Chinese party and government set it as an unshakable strategic policy to strengthen this friendship. China's free provision of the modern Taean Friendship Glass Factory to the DPRK is the most vivid expression of the unstinted material and moral support of the Chinese party, government and people and their spirit of true and comradely cooperation with the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties, governments and peoples are an excellent example of international friendship, cooperation and solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Chinese people are waging a dynamic struggle to build a comprehensively well-off society, a task set forth at the 16th Congress of the CPC under the leadership of the CPC with Hu Jintao as general secretary. Everything is going well in China. The Korean people are sincerely rejoiced over this as over their own and extending firm support and solidarity to the Chinese people in their just struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the steadfast stand of the WPK and the DPRK government to boost this friendship generation after generation. The DPRK-China friendship that has grown strong generation after generation will be evergreen.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On this basis, they have also confirmed the four kinds of human constitutions theoretically. And it has been clarified theoretically and practically that the treatment by the Koryo medical theory is superior to that by the neurohumoral theory of the modern medicine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The theory on the treatment with acupuncture and moxa has been formulated anew. And it has been found out that their curative effect differs according to seasons and time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Medical scientists have developed treatment methods according to diseases, thus making it possible to cure various diseases which have been known as \"incurable ones\". Such diseases as irregular pulsation, angina pectoris, hypertension, thrombocytopenia and allergic and amblyopic diseases have become no longer \"incurable\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many medical books have been published to synthesize classical theories of the old medical classics of Korea including Hyangyakjibsongbang (a medical encyclopedia) dealing with 10,700 acupuncture and traditional therapies, Uibangryuchi and Tonguibogam (the complete collection of traditional Korean medicine) published between the 15th and 17th. Some books deal with their application in clinical practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
