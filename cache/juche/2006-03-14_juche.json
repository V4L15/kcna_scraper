            "content": "U.S. Denounced for Aggravating Tensions \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- Unless the U.S. gives up its double-dealing attitude toward the six-party talks and hostile policy toward the DPRK, the resumption of the talks and the settlement of the nuclear issue cannot be expected.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is the main obstacle to the resumption of the six-party talks and the settlement of the nuclear issue. The U.S., persistently evading its obligatory implementation, has laid artificial difficulties in the process of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever a sign of progress was seen at the six-party talks, the U.S. put obstacles to their progress under the pretexts of non-existent \"human rights, counterfeit notes and drug smuggling issues\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after the 3rd round of the six-party talks in June 2004 agreed on the principle of \"words for words\" and \"action for action\" and the principle of \"compensation for freeze\", a measure of the first phase for the settlement of the nuclear issue, and reached the joint common cognition that the U.S. should change its hostile policy toward the DPRK, thus laying a foundation for the progress of the talks, the U.S. betrayed the principles. Less than a month after the end of the talks, the U.S. totally negated the principle of \"compensation for freeze\" and, at the same time, rigged up a \"north Korean human rights act\" to halt the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Just before the 2nd stage of the 4th round of the six-party talks, the U.S. made public a \"report\" to designate the DPRK as a \"violator of the international arms control conventions\". It also alleged that the DPRK has pursued the \"uranium enrichment program\" in secret, \"violating\" the Joint Declaration on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. When last year witnessed the Sept. 19 joint statement and positive moves for the settlement of the nuclear issue, the U.S. again fabricated \"counterfeit notes\" and \"illegal traffic\" to disturb the implementation of the joint statement, thus blocking the resumption of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the logic of the U.S. hard-line conservative forces and the U.S. stance toward the six-party talks to allege that \"dialogue\" is no more than a \"gesture\" to captivate its opponent and the U.S. will for action is \"strength\". With nothing can the U.S. evade its responsibility for blocking the progress of the six-party talks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Nuclear arms buildup is the hardcore of the U.S. drive for the implementation of this strategy by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is its pet theory that it can stand at a decisive advantage over other  nuclear weapons states and dominate the world only when it develops more powerful nuclear weapons and possesses them in greater number than other countries.\r\n The U.S. has spent a staggering amount of fund to massively develop and produce all types of nuclear weapons including strategic and tactical nuclear weapons in the past. Stockpiled in its nuclear arsenal are more than 20,000 nuclear weapons including nuclear bombs, nuclear warheads of inter-continental ballistic missiles and cruise missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has constantly supplemented and renewed its nuclear arsenal through the replacement of old ones and improvement of weapons' performance. What remains to be done by it now in keeping its unchallenged nuclear edge is to rationalize the production processes of new-type nuclear weapons under development and increase their production. To this end, it has buckled down to modernizing their production bases, putting the main stress on the development of \"new-type nuclear warheads\" which was carried by Congress last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the modernization of the production bases of nuclear weapons of new generation the U.S. seeks to significantly increase the speed of production of nuclear weapons and improve their quality and quantity, deploy more of them as quickly as possible and thus ensure its unchallenged nuclear predominance and realize its ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. modernization plan is, explicitly speaking, an extremely adventurous nuclear war plan to bring a horrible nuclear disaster to humankind. It is self-evident that this would spark off a nuclear arms race in the international arena.\r\n The reality clearly proves that the U.S. is a nuclear fanatic and a rogue state threatening peace and stability of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is letting loose sophism that the modernization of nuclear weapons does not pose any problem, unlike the development of new- type nuclear weapon, and that the NPT does not ban the modernization of nuclear combat capability while loudly crying for the modernization of the production bases of nuclear weapons of new generation.\r\n It is pressurizing other countries not to possess nuclear weapons while framing sheer lies and breeding plots to justify its stepped-up development of new-type nuclear weapons and modernization of their production bases. This is the height of effrontery.\r\n The DPRK, a target of the U.S. preemptive nuclear attack, cannot but keep the sharpest vigilance against its spurred preparations to put its doctrine of this attack into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. feverish development of smaller nukes of new types and modernization of nuclear weapons production bases targeted against the DPRK convinces the latter once again that its possession and increase of nuclear deterrent is an entirely just self-defensive measure.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Dismisses U.S. False Propaganda against DPRK\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- The United States, a past master at lies and deception, is now suffering bitter shame before the international community for a series of conspiratorial plots hatched by it recently. \r\n This is proved by the recently announced results of the final investigation into the case of the ship \"Pongsu\", a trading cargo ship of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the U.S. hard-line conservatives who launched an invasion of Iraq under the pretext of \"eliminating weapons of mass destruction (WMD)\" in March 2003 kicked off an anti-DPRK smear campaign over the \"issue of drug trafficking\" in April of the same year. As part of the campaign they instigated some dishonest forces of Australia to commit such a piratical act as impounding the ship \"Pongsu\" and its crew engaged in normal trade on the groundless charge that they were directly involved in the \"drug trafficking\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even before an investigation into the case began, the U.S. instigated reptile media to build public opinion critical of the DPRK, charging that the north Korean authorities were involved in the case, pursuant to its policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the U.S. Department of State in an annual \"international narcotics control and strategy report\" described the case of the ship \"Pongsu\" as a \"state-sponsored drug trafficking case\" which drew world attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It published such a \"report\" on March 1, too, in a bid to restart the campaign of criticism and pressure against the DPRK, asserting that there was possible state involvement in the drug trafficking and a trial of the master and other senior crewmen would be held soon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But on March 5, a few days later, the High Court of Australia declared the crewmen of the ship not guilty and set all of them free. This brought to light the deceptive nature of the U.S. and the true picture of its burlesque against the DPRK.\r\n As the results of the case of the ship \"Pongsu\" showed, truth is bound to be discerned from a lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had this case occurred than the DPRK strongly protested against the fabrication of the case, stating that it is not a simple drug matter but a political plot hatched by the U.S. and its allies in a premeditated and deliberate manner to do harm to the DPRK and stifle it over its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, has escalated its smear campaign to label the DPRK a \"criminal state\". This is evidenced by the U.S. loudmouthed story about the DPRK's \"issue of counterfeit notes\", \"fake cigarette smuggling\" and the like. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the U.S. may try to label the DPRK an \"illegal state\" under this or that charge, it can never deceive the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The socialist system in the DPRK which aspires after justice and truth and holds man dearest strictly bans misuse of narcotics and their trafficking and such things as \"the issue of counterfeit notes\", prompted by its intrinsic nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fiction of \"the development of weapons of mass destruction\" in Iraq and the case of the ship \"Pongsu\" convinced the international community that all the \"criminal cases\" much touted by the U.S. were nothing but charades aimed to hoodwink the world.\r\n Misuse of narcotics and their trafficking, the issue of counterfeit notes and other crimes are chronic evils that have long plagued the American society.\r\n The DPRK remains unfazed at the U.S. base smear campaign as the DPRK's line and policies are very just and it is upright in everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is sure to triumph just as truth is bound to prevail over a lie. \r\n The above-said case inflicted not small damage upon the DPRK's ship and its crewmen. The U.S. should make a formal apology and compensation for its piratical act and political swindle. And it should stop at once all its farces intended to mislead the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the only right way of getting rid of the deplorable situation where it is censured by the international community.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Projected RSOI and Foal Eagle Exercises under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 13 (KCNA) -- the south Korea-U.S. \"Combined Forces Command\" officially announced on Mar. 10 that it would stage \"RSOI\" and \"Foal Eagle\" in south Korea under the simulated conditions of an emergency on the Korean Peninsula from Mar. 25 to 31. \r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Monday assailing its plan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The plan of the U.S. and the south Korean bellicose forces to stage large-scale joint military maneuvers targeted against the north despite its repeated warnings and the unanimous opposition and condemnation by the public opinion at home and abroad is an extremely grave criminal move to bedevil the present inter-Korean relations and bring the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of war, the statement notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This once again clearly indicates that the U.S. loudmouthed \"talks\" and the like are nothing but hypocrisy to mislead the public opinion at home and abroad and it is pursuing stand-off and war only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can not but take note of the fact that despite our repeated strong demand the U.S. announced its plan to start the provocative war exercises to invade the north at a time when the 18th inter-Korean ministerial talks were about to open. \r\n The U.S. should know that the projected saber rattling will becloud the prospect of a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue and the six-party talks and drive the inter-Korean relations to a more serious phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is the spirit and mettle of the army and people in the DPRK advancing under the uplifted banner of Songun to respond to force in kind and to react to any provocation with merciless telling blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should ponder over the serious consequences to be entailed by the war maneuvers targeted against the north and unconditionally cancel its very dangerous plan for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, at the same time, serve a strong warning to the south Korean bellicose forces involved in the U.S. moves to invade the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities truly wish to improve the inter-Korean relations and preserve the peace on the peninsula, they should neither toe the policy of outside forces for aggression nor become an accomplice in executing it but give up the plan to stage the joint military exercises with the outside forces and make an option for national independence, peace against war and great national unity. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
