It was also disclosed that it is treating in a harsh and insulting way refugees and asylum seekers at refugee camps it set up on an island in Papua New Guinea and in Nauru.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report strongly denounced Australia for not acknowledging its human rights abuses and not abolishing refugee camps as it had promised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The human rights abuses committed by Australia are modern-day human rights crimes putting the crimes committed by the Hitler hangmen in Oswiecim concentration camp into the shade, and they deserve denunciation by all people and countries of the world valuing human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Australia should not try to hide its human rights abuses but lend an ear to the world criticism and reveal the situation of the refugee camps before the world and make those responsible for it face justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Australia is finding fault with \"human rights abuses\" of other countries on the international arena and calling for sanctions and pressure. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is an insult to the international conventions on human rights and an act of disgracing the UN for such human rights abuser as Australia to try to become a member of the UN Human Rights Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Australia has to immediately stop horrible human rights abuses before faulting \"human rights issue\" of others and delivering admonition on them."
