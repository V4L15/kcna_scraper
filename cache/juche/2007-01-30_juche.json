But it is an inexorable law of historical development that the historic cause of achieving national independence is sure to be crowned with a final victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an inevitable trend of the national history and a legitimate requirement for national development that the Korean nation who had been divided into two by the outsiders is sure to become one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the defeat of the Japanese imperialists the U.S. imperialists occupied south Korea and have since imposed upon the Koreans the tragedy resulting from national division and infringed upon their sovereignty. However, this can never quell the desire and will of the Koreans to put an end to the history of division and achieve national reunification and thus realize independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The June 15 era of reunification had to undergo hardships and trials due to the desperate efforts of the outsiders and anti-reunification forces. But it has been preserved and advanced along the orbit of independent reunification thanks to the strong desire of all the Koreans and their staunch struggle for reunification. \"By our nation itself\", the idea guiding the era, has served as a banner guiding the national movement for independent reunification despite difficulties and hardships. All the Koreans are waging a dynamic movement for independent reunification, while frustrating the moves of the outsiders and sycophantic and treacherous forces for a war and their anti-reunification campaign. This reality goes to prove that the history of the Korean nation is making dynamic progress toward independent reunification despite blatant challenge and test of history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed commentary.\r\n Citing the crime-woven history of the U.S. imperialists in which they have used Koreans as targets of their biological and chemical warfare since the period of the past Korean war in a bid to carry out their policy of domination over Korea, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists started the horrible biological and chemical warfare against the Korean people on Jan. 28, 1952 on a full scale to recover from their setbacks in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From that day to March 25 of the same year, the U.S. imperialists dropped different types of germ bombs containing bacteria of cholera, typhus and pest in more than 400 areas in the northern half of Korea over 700 times. In the subsequent period, too, they used toxic gas bombs and poisonous chemical weapons, massacring Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They shipped defoliant into south Korea in the 1960s and then built at least 10 toxic gas factories to mass-produce various types of chemical weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. scenario for biological and chemical warfare became evermore undisguised after the appearance of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that a large laboratory covering an area of 27,000 square feet is now under construction in Maryland which is expected to kick off experiments for germ warfare by use of such malignant germs as bacillus anthraces and Yesinia pestis from late this year or from the next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that the U.S. has always included chemical warfare exercises in all the large-scale war exercises including \"Ulji Focus Lens\" military exercise in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is the increasing danger of the outbreak of the second Korean war to be accompanied by biochemical warfare on the Korean Peninsula due to the U.S. imperialists' war moves. This cannot but be a grave menace to the very existence and security of the Korean people and the rest of humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Then, the youth shock brigade members and working people of Nyongbyon County devotedly saved the dam from the torrential water by carrying earth-packed bags on their back, thus making a decisive breakthrough in the construction of the power station. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The builders, with this spirit, excavated earth for the foundations of the generating room and the sluiceway in the biting cold water in the depth of the winter and ran some 40 kilometers a day to carry gravels, sand and concrete mixture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Workers of the machine-building plants in Rakwon, Kusong and other areas of the province manufactured facilities needed for the power station in time under manifold difficulties, thus contributing to completing the construction ahead of the set-time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dam built across the broad Taeryong River, the large artificial lake, generating room and power distribution room are the fruition of the devoted efforts bent by the constructors to build the power station as a grand monumental edifice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days, \"The River Taeryong Tells\", the collection of works written by them has seen the light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent completion following to the Thaechon Youth Power Stations Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 5 makes it possible to effectively use the water resources abundant in the north-western area of the country in producing electricity and supplying ample irrigation water to the west coast area. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While looking round the Thaechon Youth Power Station No. 4 some time ago, Kim Jong Il highly appreciated the heroic feats performed by the constructors in building the great edifice which would shine long in history, saying that it was the spirit and mettle of Thaechon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
