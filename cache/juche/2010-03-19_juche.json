Kumgang and the Kaesong area.\n\t\t\t\t\t Accusing the south Korean puppet clique of making outcry, asserting the \"incident of a tourist in Mt. Kumgang\" which occurred in July 2008 was \"an excessive retaliation\" and \"a bullet was fired at the defenseless tourist,\" the report says this was as preposterous and brazen-faced sophism as patting a stray dog on the back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the accountability for the \"incident,\" it took place due to the carelessness of the victim in every respect and the responsibility for it rests with the south Korean authorities who failed to properly take care and control the tourists, the report says. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It gives a detailed account of the truth about the incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group of south Korea put the \"probe into the truth\" behind the \"above-said incident,\" \"guarantee of safety of tourists\" and measures for the \"prevention of recurrence of similar incident\" as \"three preconditions\" and asserted that the tour cannot be resumed unless they are met and that the \"government remains unchanged in this stand,\" the report points out, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but deliberate efforts to scotch the tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the safety of tourists and measures for the prevention of recurrence of similar incidents, the north and the south reached an agreement on them after having an exhaustive discussion and the north side assured the south side of them on several occasions as separate issues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group including the \"Ministry of Unification\" is standing in the way of resuming the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the Kaesong area, citing the \"three preconditions\" as pretext, not prompted by its true concern about the safety of south Korean tourists or worry about the recurrence of the tourist incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Citing facts to prove this, the report goes on to say:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature the puppet regime has never been concerned about the safety and lives of people as it has regarded sycophancy, treachery and fascist dictatorship as its physiology, kowtowing to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Delegates of the south side, sitting at the negotiating table with the north side, staged such charade as \"paying silent tribute\" to the deceased tourist and raised a hue and cry over \"personal safety\" and the like in a desperate bid to block the above-said tour. The ulterior aim sought by them through this behavior is to escalate the row of nuclear confrontation with the DPRK and tighten the \"sanctions\" against it, pursuant to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Also lurking behind the attitude of the conservative group is a sinister aim to drive the inter-Korean relations to catastrophe in violation of the north-south joint declaration and build a higher barrier of division and confrontation, going against national reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as a pikestaff that it is impossible to settle the issue of resuming the tour no matter how many times the north and south sides may sit at the negotiating table unless the south Korean authorities roll back their policy of confrontation against reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The denial of the resumption of the tour means a denial of the inter-Korean relations and that of the north-south joint declaration and reconciliation, unity and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet conservative group is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can gain something by blocking the above-said tour.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would be well advised to properly understand the gravity of the situation and behave themselves."

            "content": "DDILF acusa a titeres surcoreanos de impedir la reanudacion del turismo\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 19 de marzo (ATCC) -- La Direccion de Desarrollo Integral de Lugares Famosos (DDILF) de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia 19 una informacion detallada condenando las maniobras criminales de la banda conservadora surcoreana que interrumpio el turismo al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\tSu texto resumido sigue abajo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl cuestionar el \"incidente de la turista surcoreana del monte Kumgang\" ocurrido en julio de 2008, la banda de titeres surcoreanos arma escandalo describiendolo como la supuesta \"reaccion excesiva\" y el \"fusilamiento a la turista indefensa\", lo cual deviene una absurda y descarada sofisteria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad de ese caso esta en el descuido de la turista y en las autoridades surcoreanas que no controlaron debidamente a los turistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl presentar como \"3 condiciones\" la \"aclaracion de los verdaderos aspectos\" del incidente, el \"aseguramiento de seguridad personal\" y las medidas por la \"prevencion de la repeticion de tal incidente\", los conservadores surcoreanos insisten en que no pueden reiniciar el turismo antes de que sean cumplidas esas condiciones diciendo que es \"invariable esta posicion del gobierno\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no pasa de ser una provocacion malintencionada para llevar al fracaso el turismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa seguridad personal y la medida de prevencion de la repeticion de tal incidente fueron consultadas, resueltas y acordadas suficientemente entre ambas partes coreanas y garantizadas aparte varias veces a la parte surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de los titeres conservadores, inclusive el \"Ministerio de Reunificacion\", se opone a la reanudacion del turismo al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong planteando las \"3 condiciones\" no por su preocupacion de la seguridad personal de los turistas surcoreanos ni por el temor a la repeticion del citado incidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs que el poder titere surcoreano, que tiene como su atributo fisiologico servir a grandes potencias, especialmente a EE.UU., y practicar acciones vendepatrias y dictadura fascista, no ha tomado en consideracion desde el principio la seguridad ni la vida de los habitantes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPartiendo de su intencion de endurecer la campana de confrontacion nuclear y la \"sancion\" anti-RPDC siguiendo a EE.UU., los titeres surcoreanos impiden tan siniestramente el reinicio del turismo al monte Kumgang y la zona de Kaesong escenificando en la mesa de negociaciones N-S la payasada de \"guardar un momento de silencio\" por el caso de una turista surcoreana muerta y hablando de la supuesta \"seguridad personal\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, abrigan otra siniestra intencion de violar y suprimir la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur, llevar a la catastrofe las relaciones intercoreanas y reforzar la barrera de division y confrontacion en desafio a la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResulta obvio que mientras no sea revocada la politica conflictiva y anti-reunificacion de las autoridades surcoreanas, no sera resuelto el problema de reinicio del turismo aunque tengan lugar cien veces las conversaciones con la parte surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl no al reinicio del turismo significa la negativa a las relaciones intercoreanas, a la Declaracion Conjunta N-S y a la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria tan estupido e imbecil que la camarilla de los titeres conservadores surcoreanos pensara que podria conseguir algo impidiendo la reanudacion del turismo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben portarse con prudencia viendo correctamente la gravedad de la situacion."
