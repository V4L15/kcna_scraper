He said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t President Kim Il Sung founded the Korean People's Revolutionary Army, the first revolutionary armed forces of Juche type on April 25, Juche 21 (1932). This made it possible for the Korean people to have their genuine army for the first time in history and since then there started a new history of the Korean revolution which was hewed out with arms and has won victory and advanced with arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He trained the KPRA into the powerful main force of the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle in the flames of the anti-Japanese revolution, defeated Japanese imperialism and liberated Korea. In the complicated situation of building a new country he realized the cause of building the regular armed forces without delay, led the Fatherland Liberation War to victory and developed the KPA into a heroic army which shattered to smithereens the myth of the U.S. imperialists' \"mightiness\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based cause of army-building developed in depth onto a new higher stage thanks to the outstanding Songun revolutionary leadership and Songun politics of general secretary Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He established the Songun politics as the basic political mode under socialism as required by the changed reality and developing revolution in the 1990s. He put forward the KPA as the main force for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche on the principle of giving priority to the army over the working class for the first time in history, and put its position and role on the highest level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean revolutionary armed forces have grown to be the army of the leader, the party and the people under the care of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, demonstrating its invincible might. They are the greatest patriotic legacy left by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today the KPA is ushering in greatest heyday of its development as it is led by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He set forth the line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and building of nuclear force at the historic March, 2013 plenary meeting of the C.C., the Workers' Party of Korea. This is a special great event which provided the immortal banner for final victory of the Songun revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reporter called for concluding the nuclear showdown with the U.S. with the arms of Paektusan, reunifying the country and winning a final victory in building a thriving socialist nation and accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the puppet south Korea are bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the Korean Peninsula despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK, he said, stressing that if another undesired war breaks out due to the unpardonable behaviors of the U.S. imperialists and their followers, the army and people of the DPRK will put an end to the long-standing history of confrontation with the U.S. and bring a bright day of national reunification without fail."

They even opened to media those exercises, fanning up the atmosphere for a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The joint landing drill now under way in Phohang, North Kyongsang Province activated marines belonging to the U.S. 3rd marines division based in Okinawa, the U.S. 76th task force, the marine corps of the puppet army and combat troops of Australia which took part in the last Korean war and lots more other aggression troops as well as ultra-modern attack hardware such as rapid vertical take-off and landing helicopter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The emergency runway take-off and landing drill due in Yongju, North Kyongsang Province on April 25 with the involvement of F-15K, KF-16 and other warplanes is said to be the first in 22 years since it was last staged in 1991.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In another development, the U.S. declared its sending of nuclear-powered carrier Nimitz to the Western Pacific on April 22, saying that it will replace carrier John C Stennis to carry out the duties of deterring \"provocative acts\" such as the north's missile launch and of guarding and monitoring while keeping in touch with Aegis warships deployed in the Western Pacific and nuclear submarines in waters off Guam.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only recently that the U.S. and puppet south Korean group claimed \"dwindling the scope of military exercises\", \"adjusting the level\" and \"dialogue\".

It is also a wanton violation of the DPRK's dignity and sovereignty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Through the madcap war exercises the U.S. and the south Korean group seek to make the show of \"armed forces\", browbeat the DPRK and step up pressure on it but such an act will only reveal their nature as a provoker and aggressor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have staged exercises for nuclear attack on the DPRK with the involvement of three nuclear strategic forces in the U.S. mainland and on Hawaii and Guam. They even brought to south Korea the U.S. marines in Okinawa, pronoun of overseas aggression, and staged huge landing operational exercises together with the south Korean puppet marine corps under the simulated conditions of the DPRK. These can never be called \"defensive exercises\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and puppet south Korea's war drills against the DPRK clearly reveal the shameless and deceptive nature of their call for \"dialogue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As their deceptive farce of \"dialogue\" did not work on the DPRK, the U.S. and puppet south Korea, by way of revenge, made public to media the war exercises in a desperate bid to step up the pressure on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts prove that it is none other than the U.S. and the puppet warmongers who are escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula and increasing the danger of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are seriously mistaken if they think they can get something from their reckless war frenzy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This will instead touch off greater indignation and anger of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will resolutely counter the enemies, not remaining an on-looker to their anti-DPRK war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are maintaining a high alert posture and getting themselves fully ready to make merciless retaliatory blows at the enemies if they make even the slightest provocation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If even a spark is shot up in the territorial land, air and sea of the DPRK, the base of provocation will turn into a sea of fire and the provokers and aggressors will be wiped out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean forces have to make clear their attitude, whether they stand for dialogue or confrontation, peace or war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should stop the DPRK-targeted war exercises at once and discontinue all hostile acts and provocations against the DPRK if they do not want self-destruction."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Censures Japan's Moves to Revive Militarism \r\n Pyongyang, April 24 (KCNA) -- An increasing number of right-wing reactionaries are visiting Yasukuni Shrine against the backdrop of the trend of Japanese society's extreme lurch to the Right.\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that Prime Minister Abe donated a tree called Bitsugi to the shrine since the start of the spring festival on Apr. 21. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Deputy Prime Minister Aso, the Minister of General Affairs, the Minister in charge of \"Abduction Issue\", the Deputy Chief Cabinet Secretary and other high-ranking officials paid a group visit to the shrine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe's tree donation, to say nothing of the ministers' visits, sparked off strong criticism at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was Abe who openly revealed his intention to re-examine the statements made by Murayama and Kono who admitted Japan's past crimes early in February last. It was again Abe who jabbered that he deeply regretted for failing to visit the shrine during his previous office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Observers said that Abe donated the tree to the shrine just as he did in 2007 when he was in the office, shelving his visit to it in consideration of public opinion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Abe did is now touching off bitterer resentment than his visit to the shrine in the light of the place to which the donation was made, the timing for it and its poisonous meaning despite his cunning artifice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Abe's approach to Yasukuni Shrine which keeps mortuary tablets of top-class Japanese criminals who got ill fames in their aggression against Asian countries and mass-killings in the past constitutes a crucial issue concerning the attitude towards those people of the countries which fell victim to Japan and its crimes in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why the international community is very sensitive to the issues related to the shrine.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spring festival at the shrine and an endless donation of such tree is not a simple issue concerning the donation of the tree during spring tree planting season. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This brought into bolder relief the black-hearted intention of the Abe Cabinet to make the roots of militarization struck invariably and more deeply in all fabrics of Japan's society with Yasukuni Shrine, symbol of aggression and massacre, as a base.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Everything from education to details of traditional etiquette, to say nothing of the prime minister's activities and operation of the cabinet and the Diet, is geared to embellishing Japan's past crimes and inciting militarization. This is the present reality of Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To zealously spread the fascist culture in Japan through visits to the shrine is a reckless action to embark again upon the road of reinvasion by calling back the departed soul of the militarists.  This is an intolerable insult and a wanton challenge to Korea and other Asian countries. It is little short of driving Japan into a historic misfortune.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The culture of war and fascism forced on Japan is leaving it further isolated and marginalized by other Asian countries and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Personages of different social standings of Japan including the representative of the New Komeito Party expressed dissatisfaction that \"it is impossible to escape adverse diplomatic impact no matter how hard Abe may explain.\" They urged his cabinet to make a cautious response, holding that \"it is an important factor in politics to pursue diplomacy not to hurt the process for improving relations with neighboring countries.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The way to Yasukuni Shrine leads to militarization and this will push Japan to self-destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The venomous roots of militarism struck at Yasukuni Shrine will stretch out like a serpent to the whole Japanese society and swallow it up."

            "content": "ACNC estigmatiza visita al santuario Yasukuni de insulto a Corea y otros paises asiaticos\r\n Pyongyang, 24 de abril (ACNC) -- En estos dias, en la sociedad japonesa se hace frecuente la visita de los reaccionarios derechistas al santuario Yasukuni.\n\t\t\t\t\t Con motivo de la ceremonia primaveral en memoria de difuntos, iniciada el pasado dia 21, el premier japones Abe entrego regalos al santuario Yasukuni y lo visitaron en grupos el vicepremier Aso y otros funcionarios de alto rango, provocando gran preocupacion de los nacionales y extranjeros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A principios de febrero, Abe expreso abiertamente el intento de revisar las declaraciones de Murayama y Kono que reconocieron los crimenes del pasado de Japon y dijo que \"es muy lamentable que no haya visitado el santuario Yasukuni en su primer mandato al frente del gabinete\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tomando en consideracion la opinion publica, los medios interesados transmitieron que como lo hizo en el periodo de su primer mandato, Abe dejo de visitar el santuario y entrego solo el arbol de Bitsugi. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La posicion sobre el santuario Yasukuni, donde estan conservados los restos morales de los criminales de guerra de grado especial que ganaron mala fama en las masacres y las agresiones a los paises asiaticos, es una cuestion de actitud y punto de vista sobre los pueblos de los paises victimas y la criminalidad cometida en el pasado, razon por la cual la sociedad internacional trata con seriedad la visita al santuario Yasukuni. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t En fin de cuentas, la ceremonia primaveral en el santuario Yasukuni y la entrega de Bitsugi no son una simple donacion de un arbol para la plantacion primaveral, sino revelan la malsana intencion del gabinete de Abe de infundir mas el ambiente de militarizacion en toda la sociedad japonesa tomando por base el santuario Yasukuni, simbolo de agresion y asesinato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hoy en dia, en el pais isleno desde las actividades del premier y la gestion del gabinete y la dieta hasta la educacion y las costumbres tradicionales se han convertido en un espacio para embellecer la historia criminal e inculcar el militarismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La implantacion de la cultura fascista en Japon a traves de la visita al santuario Yasukuni es una imprudencia tendente a rehabilitar el militarismo y emprender la nueva agresion y resulta un insulto intolerable y provocacion a Corea y otros paises asiaticos y un crimen que acarrea las desgracias historicas al pais isleno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Por la difusion de la cultura de guerra y la fascista, Japon se ve aislado por los paises asiaticos y la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es por eso que el representante del Partido Komeito y otras personalidades de distintos estratos de Japon urgieron al gabinete de Abe a tomar las medidas serias diciendo con descontento que \"de ninguna manera podra eludir la influencia diplomatica negativa\" y que \"el beneficio favorable a la mejora de las relaciones\" con los paises vecinos es \"un importante elemento de la politica\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La visita al santuario Yasukuni llevara a Japon a la militarizacion y a la autodestruccion."
