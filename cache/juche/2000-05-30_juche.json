Kim Jong Il thus provided the Korean nation with a great program, an efficient treasured sword for realizing national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three-point charter of national reunification carries strong spirit of national independence and reflects the noble patriotic will to reunify the country peacefully through the reconciliation between the north and south and the great unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three principles of independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity represent a cornerstone of national reunification as they clarify the fundamental stand and basic ways of solving the issue of national reunification by the efforts of the nation in conformity with its will and interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 10-point program of the great unity of the whole nation for national reunification is a political program to unite the whole nation and strengthen the driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal for founding the DCRK serves as a blueprint visualizing the future of a reunified country and indicating ways of building it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three-point charter of national reunification is fully supported and accepted by the 70 million fellow countrymen as it shows the most fair and aboveboard and reasonable ways of reunifying the country in conformity with the specific conditions of Korea where the differing ideologies and systems have long existed in the north and south and the unanimous desire of the entire nation for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il formulated the three-point charter of national reunification in which the President's idea and line on national reunification and his undying feats made in its cause are comprehensively expounded and thus provided the Korean nation with an unshakable mainstay for reunification. This is his one more great exploit to shine long in the nation's history of the movement for national reunification. \r\n\r\n"
