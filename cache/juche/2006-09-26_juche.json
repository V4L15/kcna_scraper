            "content": "Japan's \"Financial Sanctions\" against DPRK Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday ridicules Japan's application of \"financial sanctions\" against the DPRK as a farce of a jester of a circus troupe.\r\n The Japanese authorities, bereft of reason, are foolishly performing short-sighted and senseless buffoonery reminding us of a rural vendor, regarding \"financial sanctions\" as \"a panacea,\" says a Rodong Sinmun commentary Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's \"financial sanctions\" do not surprise the DPRK at all. But the DPRK has to say a caustic word about Japan's mean racket of \"financial sanctions.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dancing to other's tune, Japan is attempting to pressurize and strangle the DPRK with such \"financial sanctions\" to drive it somewhere. It is, however, a poor, third-rate diplomacy of bat-blind philistines. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is whipping itself into senseless frenzy to please the whim of its American master. It is acting flippantly not to fall behind the U.S. in the racket of sanctions against the DPRK. It does not warrant surprise, considering that Japan has made it its physical quality to lick the boots of the American master and tail behind the U.S. It is unseemly for Japan, styling itself \"a big power,\" to behave like this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's noisy row of \"financial sanctions\" against the DPRK is a disgusting behavior of a slovenly political charlatan bent on refurbishing his public image by ingratiating himself with his American master and feathering his own nest by following the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's clumsy and wicked act is a perfidy trampling upon the spirit and requirements of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an utterly unreasonable sophism to describe the application of the \"financial sanctions\" as \"a catalyzer\" for \"dialogue.\" It is a folly rendering the problem more complicated and carrying the DPRK-Japan confrontation to extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is justifiable and natural for the DPRK to put up a tough rebuff to Japan's desperate political provocation. The situation is very serious and the consequences are unpredictable. Japan would be well advised to behave with discretion, pondering over the serious consequences to be entailed by its harebrained act against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
