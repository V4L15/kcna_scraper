It is the greatest tragedy in the history of the nation and a shame on it for Korea to remain partitioned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The concrete wall was built as a symbol of division and showdown on the peninsula.

He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The emergence of the DPRK, not a big country, as a world military power clearly demonstrates the invincible vitality and validity of the Songun idea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Songun idea serves as a banner of the anti-imperialist struggle to be held aloft by all progressives of the world as guidelines.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Revolutionaries of Britain extend full support to the Songun idea and Songun line of the DPRK."
