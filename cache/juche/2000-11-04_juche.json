So the method of treatment should be variant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the course of his study, he divided the persons' constitutions into four types - Taeyangin, Soyangin, Taeumin and Soumin - and on analysis of their formal and functional and temperamental characteristics such as external appearance, size of viscera, mentality, symptoms and reaction to drugs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On this basis, the administration of medicine was decided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to confirm physical constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Je Ma's medical theory gives a detailed explanation to physical make, form and personal appearance, the state of physiological function and mentality. It also explains the diseases of viscera and symptoms according to physical types and medicines to be applied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His four methods of medical examination include the classification of physical conditions by looking hearing, asking and pressing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experts and doctors at the General Hospital of Koryo Medicine, who developed the subjective and sentimental theory of classics into the objective and scientific method of classification, classified people in classical and morphological ways and by function diagnosis, blood-group examination and reaction to medicines. As a result, the rate of the successful diagnosis showed 90 per cent and the efficiency of administered medicines rose to 85 per cent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Based on such methods, the doctors diagnosed the diseases caused by the weak viscera and administered medicines to patients, which have resulted in the reduction of the period of recovery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the basis of such success, the doctors work hard to develop four-physical condition-based medicine on a mass scale and make deep study of how to eliminate the sources of diseases. \r\n\r\n"
