            "content": "G.S. Kim Jong Il gives on-site guidance to Songjin Steel Complex \r\nPyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave on-site guidance to the Songjin Steel Complex to light a signal fire of a fresh great upsurge.\r\n   He was accompanied by Chief Secretary of the north Hamgyong provincial committee of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) Ri Kun Mo, secretaries of the C.C., WPK Choe Thae Bok, Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Ki Nam, Chairman of the State Transport Commission Ri Yong Mu and first vice department directors of the C.C., WPK Pak Song Bong and Jang Song Thaek.\r\n   After seeing a monument to President Kim Il Sung's on-the-spot guidance, General Kim Jong Il made the rounds of the steel shop, the pressure tube shop and other shops, learning about how production was going on.\r\n   He convened a consultative meeting of officials concerned at the complex and discussed measures to attain a high and steady rate of steel production. He then gave highly important tasks for launching a fresh great upsurge at the complex.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction at tremendous contributions made by the complex's workers for many years to the building of an independent national economy and the industrialization of the country. \r\n   He said the Korean people including the workers who had created a brilliant history of struggle with singlehearted unity were advancing forward full of the conviction of sure victory and optimism, undaunted by the unprecedented hardships and trials.\r\n   He said steel production was still important in economic construction, so it should be given priority. He called on the steelmakers of the complex, who had upheld the WPK with steel production in every hard time, to take the lead in effecting a great upsurge again in the spirit of Chollima.\r\n   He stressed that in order to keel production going on at a high and steady rate, it was necessary to widely introduce the Juche-based steel-making process.\r\n   He also voiced great satisfaction at many crucial problems concerning steel production solved by the complex in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. He said the complex should make efforts to produce more with materials and equipment it had.\r\n   He noted that deep concern should always be paid to the supply service for the workers and that they should be supplied with larger quantities of vegetable, meat, fish and other non-staple foods and fully provided with modern dwelling houses and cultural and welfare facilities.\r\n   He said that as north Hamgyong Province had such leading steel and iron producers of the nation as the Songjin Steel Complex and the Kim Chaek Iron and Steel Complex and many related enterprises, the provincial party committee should strengthen leadership over them.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"

And ill-boding signs have been seen in the vicinity of the DPRK, exerting grave influence on the general situation.\r\n   To cope with the acute situation, we have decided to reduce and readjust missions abroad some by 30 percent until the food and economic problems are solved.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they never beg for peace.\r\n   If the U.S. warmaniacs dare ignite a war, misjudging the revolutionary will and preparedness of our army and people to answer dialogue with dialogue, war with war, they will suffer a thousandfold retaliation.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "\"Crusade\" to attain world domination\r\nPyongyang, March 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comes out with a signed article laying bare the new \"crusade\"  of the imperialists.\r\n   The author of the article says:\r\n   The imperialists are inventing new means and methods to attain their design to make the whole world a neo-colony and thus bring it under their control. One of them is the socalled \"liberalisation\" of religion on the lips of the United States.\r\n   The campaign for \"liberalisation\" is precisely a new \"crusade\"  to attain its dominationist design.\r\n   \"Crusade\" of west feudal lords and warriors in the period between the late 11th century and 13th century was a brigandish aggression for colonial domination and plunder of the east, which was committed under the deceptive religious slogan of liberating jerusalem, the \"holy land.\"\r\n   The United States intends to launch a \"crusade\"  into the political life, ideological and cultural life of other countries and nations.\r\n   What it seeks in this is to eradicate their anti-imperialist, anti-American feelings which could not be stifled by military force and make them neo-colonies  without shedding blood.\r\n   The immediate purpose of its \"crusade\"  being conducted under the signboard of \"liberalisation\" of religion is to make a breakthrough for infiltrating the western way of thinking in the political system of \"obstinate\" countries and nations.\r\n   By including \"liberalisation\" of religion in the human rights issue, the U.S. intends to freely interfere in the internal affairs of other countries including those nations that go against the grain with it and, furthermore, reorganise their political systems in the western style.\r\n   This is a vicious attempt to deprive anti-imperialist, anti-American countries of their Juche character and national identity.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
