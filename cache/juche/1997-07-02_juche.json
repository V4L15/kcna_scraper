So when the Juche character and national character are preserved there will be no room for the imperialists to step in.\r\n   Only when the struggle against the dominationist moves of the imperialists is strengthened can the independent development of the country and the nation be ensured, the lot of colonial slavery not be forced again and, furthermore, the advance and victory of the movement for global independence be made.\r\n   One of the important requirments in the struggle against imperialism and dominationism is to remove illusions about and fear of imperialism and not to pin a hope on \"prescription\" and \"assistance\" of the imperialists.\r\n   One should establish lines and policies according to his own view and judgement and apply his own way, revolutionary and national, in all spheres of the life of the state and society.\r\n   The world progressive people's intensified international unity and cooperation is urgently needed for checking and frustrating the imperialists' divide-and-strike strategy, achieving the national independence and the prosperity and development of the country and successfully building an indepenent new world. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Indeed, this is the culmination of respect for the leader, ethics and morality.\r\n   The General saw to it that the funeral ceremony in Pyongyang on July 19, 1994, was not the last parting, but an event which showed the eternal harmonious whole of the leader and his people. He also made sure that all people cherished the image and love of the tender-hearted President. This made the people keenly feel the height of loyalty and filial piety of a human being.\r\n   It was the General who led the people overwhelmed by the heart-breaking sadness at the president's death to turn the sadness into strength and courage.\r\n   We would have performed neither our duty as soldiers and disciples of the President, nor our mission as members of Kim Il Sung's nation, were it not for the energentic guidance of the General, who led the Workers' Party of Korea and the people to implement the last instructions of the President, saying that it was their most sacred task.\r\n   The General armed the Korean people with the revolutionary spirit of soldiers, the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and the indomitable spirit of the red flag. \r\nThe people, therefore, built monumental edifices and brought about great changes in a matter of three years, which would have taken scores of years at an ordinary speed.\r\n    It was also the General, the iron-willed brilliant commander, who took the lead in the decisive struggle to defend the destiny of socialism at a time when there was a sharp confrontation between socialism and capitalism in the world arena.\r\n   The General, the Supreme Commander, put forward the army as the driving force of the revolution, directed great Efforts to the military affairs and increased defence capabilities in every way, pulling through economic difficulties. His correct and principled policies and superb guidance made it possible to firmly defend the fortress of socialism as well as world peace and security.\r\n   The past three years stand out in the 55-year-long revolutionary history of the general and in the life of all Koreans, as years replete with unforgettable events.\r\n   The President and the General still work together for the welfare of the people, encouraging and leading the Workers' Party and people of Korea to a bright future.\r\n   The feats the General performed in immortalizing the President, achieving the prosperity of the country and nation and fighting for socialism and the future of humankind are common wealth of not only the Korean people but also the international communist movement and humankind= they will be immortal for all ages. \r\n\r\n"
