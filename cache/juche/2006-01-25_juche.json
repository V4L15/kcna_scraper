The U.S. is contemplating the handover of reserve war supplies stockpiled in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. for a war against the DPRK are intended to tide over the ever-worsening crisis at home and abroad. \r\n The army and people of the DPRK do not want a war but are ready to wipe out the aggressors at a single stroke if they invade even an inch of the sky, the land and the sea of their country.

This is clearly evidenced by the recent remarks made by the director-general of the Japan Defense Agency that Japan's possession of two Aegis equipped with \"standard-3 interceptor missiles\" would make it possible to defend its archipelago. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is the fact that Japan is citing \"threat from China\" as a pretext for further strengthening the system of its military cooperation with the U.S. in a bid to expand its sphere of military activities without limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of Japan to offer its military facilities including ports and airfields to the U.S., considering even a dispute to occur not only on the Korean Peninsula but in the far away  Taiwan Straits as an \"emergency in areas surrounding Japan.\" It has already begun laying a legal groundwork for doing so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to prove that Japan is keen to acquire an unchallenged position in the Asia-Pacific region by realizing a military nexus and cooperation with the U.S. and, furthermore, dominate this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's policy for military supremacy aimed at conquering Asia and putting it under its control should be checked and frustrated without fail, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It says in an appealing melody that he continues his inspection tour of frontline units in spite of the rain or snow and shows ardent love and comradeship, sharing roast potatoes with darling soldiers on a steep mountain pass.\r\n The song \"View of Snow-covered Jong Il Peak\" lyrically describes that the beautiful frostwork on the trees of Jong Il Peak capped with snow in February when the people auspiciously celebrate his birthday, is the pride of Korea and the people bearing the scenery in their minds look up to and follow the great man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Song of General Onward March of Songun Revolution\" reflects the will of the soldiers and people of the DPRK to advance forward vigorously along the road of the Songun revolution, going through all trials and difficulties  under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.

It is by no means fortuitous that they are recklessly whetting a sword for aggression on the DPRK, timing to coincide with the racket of sanctions against it after reneging on the September 19 joint statement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a judgment by public opinion at home and abroad that the U.S. imperialists will not bother to preempt an attack on the DPRK as they have thrown away even international agreement like a pair of old shoes to realize their ambition for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a proverb saying \"Return fire for fire and favor for favor\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean army and people are sharply following the moves of the U.S imperialists, keeping themselves fully ready to beat back the enemies' attack at a single stroke.

They, at the same time, serve as a great programme for reunification common to the nation, which the north and the south confirmed in the July 4 joint statement and solemnly declared internally and externally, the article says, and goes on:\r\n The patriotic movement for independent reunification represents a practical action to thoroughly preserve and embody the principle of national independence. As stressed in the joint editorial, the patriotic movement for independent reunification calls for solving all problems arising in accomplishing the cause of reunification by putting the dignity and the interests of the nation above all as guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\", making the Korean nation-first spirit of attaching importance to the nation prevail wherever Koreans reside and letting the strong hurricane of independent reunification rage across the land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for peace against war represents a struggle to create a precondition for peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The validity of this movement lies in that it calls on all the Koreans to turn out in the struggle to resolutely foil the U.S. imperialists' moves to provoke a new war, reliably defend peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and completely remove the root cause of war from this land through a nationwide struggle for the pullback of the U.S. forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" has become an idea dominating the era, the movement for national reunification is being converted into a nationwide movement pushed forward by all the Koreans irrespective of ideology, system, political faction and affiliation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic movement for overall national unity serves as an effective means of injecting vitality into the cause of national reunification that has entered a new stage. Koreans can surely solve any problem arising in the cause of reunification when they turn out as one, steadily stoke the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity and boost the unity and solidarity among the organizations of the reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Specific ways of achieving national reunification may alter according to the changing situation. But its fundamental principle will never change and the Korean nation will surely accomplish the cause of national reunification on that basis.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
