His journey was a \"250-mile journey for learning\" which made him experience the misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean nation deprived of their state by the Japanese imperialists.\r\n   He, studying in the motherland, heard the news that his father Kim Hyong Jik had been arrested by the Japanese police, before he set out on a 250-mile journey again from Mangyongdae to Badaogou on January 22, Juche 14 (1925).

Therefore, the moves of the present South Korean ruling quarters pursuing the anti-reunification policy against the trend of the times and the aspiration of the nation cannot be pardoned in any case, says Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today.\r\n   It continues:\r\n   Contrary to the nation's desire and aspiration for reunification, the South Korean rulers persist in taking the road of confrontation and war against North Korea where the fellow countrymen live.\r\n   For the Korean nation, nothing is more important than national reunification and no task is more urgent than it.\r\n   Division is the road to subordination and self-ruin. Only reunification is the road to independence, prosperity and a way out for the nation.\r\n   Korea is the same as an organism that can keep up its life only when it is united but cannot exist once it is separated.\r\n   Any Koreans who are anxious about the nation's destiny can not turn blind eyes to the call of history and the nation for reunification. This is high time that all Koreans at home and abroad closely united irrespective of differences in ideology, religious belief, political view, class and social standing and intensified  the struggle to save the destiny of the country and the nation and reunify the fatherland.\r\n   As for the Korean nation, nothing is more honourable and worthwhile than to devote itself to national reunification. \r\nTo reunify the fatherland is precisely patriotism and the struggle for national reunification is a most praiseworthy patriotic one.\r\n   Those who contribute to the struggle for national reunification will enjoy love and respect from the nation and will be recorded in national history as pro-reunification patriots. \r\n\r\n"

Such a hellish dog has appeared in Seoul, striking terror and uneasiness into the hearts of people.\r\n   This dog is now roaming about \"Chongwadae\".\r\n   It is none other than Hwang Jang Yop who defected from the north to the south.\r\n   A few days ago, he gave a \"lecture\" at a joint meeting of permanent directors and directors of the central council of the students' military training corps.\r\n   In the \"lecture,\" he praised the present \"government's policy of engagement with the north\" as \"effective\" and then cried that economic assistance to the north must be stopped because it would result in \"replenishing\" the north's strength and weakening the \"strength\" of the south. And he alleged that the north's slogan of building a powerful nation is aimed at getting \"economic assistance\" by \"threatening\" someone.\r\n   Worse still, he slandered the rewritten constitution of the north as undemocratic.\r\n   His rigmarole that he had never seen any constitution in the north cannot be construed otherwise than the height of folly. It is because he had acted as chairman of the legislative body of the north.\r\n   He went so far as to say, \"the essence of the north's government is to wage a war\" and \"the north has the capacity and willingness to develop nuclear weapons. This is an absurd utterance which can be made only by Hwang.\r\n   In the \"lecture,\" he branded the north as an \"out-and-out principal enemy\" and let loose the hokum that \"it is imperative to overpower the north as early as possible to prevent a war.\"\r\n   The \"Agency for National Security Planning\" is wirepulling Hwang who is now in hiding at its secret room. It is said that a bad-natured dog must be bound with a short tether.\r\n   The act of the \"people's government\" in letting Hwang make a string of venomous remarks will only precipitate its own destruction.\r\n   Hwang is the very dog that leads the \"people's government\" to the hell.\r\n   Conducted by him, the \"Agency for National Security Planning,\" \"Chongwadae\" and South Korea are going to the hell of ruin. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
