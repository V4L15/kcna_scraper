            "content": "Japan's nuclear arming\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- The Japanese Foreign Minister again pulled up the DPRK over \"possible development of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons\" at the recent meeting of the foreign affairs committee of the House of Representatives,  according to a report.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We cannot but take a serious view of such an ill-gotten behaviour of the Japanese reactionaries.   At the meeting  he said there is \"possibility that North Korea might manufacture and possess nuclear weapons before the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework was published in 1994. Herein lie the sinister political purpose sought by the Japanese reactionaries and its danger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an unbiased international opinion that the DPRK has faithfully implemented the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework since it was published. Accordingly, \"suspected nuclear development\" does not work with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As they failed to attain their ulterior intention to accuse the DPRK of \"nuclear development,\" the Japanese reactionaries, in an attempt to hurt the DPRK, raised again the abortive argument that the DPRK might \"possess nuclear weapons\" prior to the publication of the agreed framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is all the more intolerable is their groundless insistence that \"DPRK possesses biological and chemical weapons.\"   Their noisy talk about \"nuclear and missile threats from the DPRK\" and \"its possession of biological and chemical weapons\" is a continual revelation of their vicious moves to isolate the DPRK on the international arena, tighten sanctions against the DPRK and intensify the scheme to stifle it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such a brigandish logic is nothing but a third-rate smokescreen to cover up their criminal nature and push ahead with their nuclear arming.\r\n   It is well known a fact that Japan, not content with having stockpiled a colossal amount of plutonium, is scheming to import more plutonium from other country. It is not accidental that \"Greenpeace\"  urged the Japanese government to cancel its dangerous plutonium transport plan at once.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how zealously the Japanese reactionaries may vociferate about the non-existent \"threats\" from the DPRK, their argument will not work with anyone in the present world. World public is following with sharpened vigilance Japan's ever more undisguised moves to arm itself with nuclear weapons and realize its overseas expansion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are fully preparing ourselves to cope with repeated provocation moves of the Japanese reactionaries, considering them to be a declaration of frontal confrontation with us.   If they finally take the road of reinvasion of the DPRK under the legislation related to the \"Japan-U.S. Defense Cooperation Guidelines\" which was adopted at the diet some time ago, they will be doomed to destruction in face of our strong self-defensive measure. \r\n \r\n"

The politics enforced by Kim Jong Il is vital because it is the politics of love and trust in the workers, farmers and all other people who love the country and defend its freedom and independence.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While in Korea I saw the people who are boundlessly loyal to their country and their ideology and they rely on their own efforts.   Referring to fresh achievements made by the Korean people advancing along the road chosen by themselves, despite the imperialists' isolation and suffocation moves and natural disasters, she stressed: This proves the possibility of building socialism in one country.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Much depends on who leads the state and the party. Kim Jong Il pays deep attention to the strengthening of the national defence and visits everywhere such as factories, coal mines, cooperative farms and colleges.   If someone asks me where freedom is, I will answer it is in Korea, where the people do not worry about their future and their children, she added. \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 14 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on the moves of the United States to boost the military ties with some Asian countries and regions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the U.S. decided to provide a large number of missiles to Taiwan and signed a military agreement with Philippines, the paper notes, and says:   Such moves are intended to lay a strong military foundation in the Asia-pacific region, contain and blockade other big powers relying on it and thus realize the U.S. exclusive domination over the region.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is seeking to forward-deploy its troops in Asia and pacific and put areas and countries which are in key points of Asia, under its military strategic system.\r\n   The U.S.-Japan-South Korea military alliance has been strengthened, which can be called, in fact, \"Asian version of NATO.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States tries to expand the alliance by involving other vassal forces in it so that it can play in the Asia-pacific region the same role as that of NATO in Europe. In other words, it seeks to dominate the region through \"Asian version of NATO\" while trying to rule the whole area of Europe, taking the initiative in NATO.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The main target of the U.S. strategy for domination over Asia is none other than the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n   The United States is scheming to contain, blockade and invade the DPRK by strengthening the triangular military alliance and putting its satellite forces in its military sphere.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A danger of possible outbreak of new war is increasing in Asia due to such moves of the U.S.    Asian countries should heighten their vigilance against the U.S. strategy for military domination. \r\n\r\n"

The article goes on:   The capitalist way of life that paralyzes the people's sound consciousness and noble spiritual and moral trait is,  above all, like narcotics which makes them mental  cripples.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Swindle, fraud, robbery, theft and murder are typical evils in the capitalist society.   A clear proof of this is that children's murder of their parents for a petty amount of money is common place in the United States and other western countries and in east European countries where capitalism has revived.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Another danger of poisoning to be posed by the capitalist way of life, the American way of life is that it stimulates people's vulgar taste and instinct, luring them into a dissolute life, and thus reduces them to loafers and idlers.   It is also the ideological poison of the capitalist way of life that it makes people deformed and benighted.   Particularly, the bourgeois way of life makes people an animal-like being who knows nothing but himself and acts as he pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Confusion, disorder and abnormal way of life rampant under the slogans of \"liberty of individual\" and \"freedom of choice\" lead people to sexual passion, degeneration, despair, sorrow and dissolute life. \r\n\r\n"

The camping is going on under the warm care of General Secretary  Kim Jong Il though the country is hard pressed for everything due to the imperialists' moves to isolate and stifle the country and repeated natural disasters for the last several consecutive years.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il, who personified the President Kim Il Sung's noble view on posterity, has bestowed boundless love and benefit upon the younger generation, saying we carry out revolution and construction for the sake of the rising generation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that best things should be given to children, he saw to it that schoolchildren's palaces and halls were built in beauty spots in the capital and local areas.   He also made sure that branch schools were set up in islets for a few children and sent commuter trains and buses for schoolchildren in remote mountain villages.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In March, Juche 82 (1993), when Korea was on the brink of war because of the \"nuclear inspection\" row of the imperialists, he visited newly arranged Songdowon international children's camp to take fatherly care of the children who were going to camp there.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He also sent his personal letters to children after receiving their humble letters and provided them with modern teaching, experiment and practice equipment to improve the educational facilities.\r\n   His fatherly love, indeed, serves as a source of successfully bringing up all the children to be reliable pillars of the country. \r\n \r\n\r\n"
