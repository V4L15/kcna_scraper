And they are distributed to three provinces in northeast china and overseas areas to intensify the anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This evidently proves that the present rulers of South Korea are anti-national elements seeking confrontation with the north more viciously than their predecessors, the bulletin says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their frantic anti-DPRK smear campaign is intended to get out of the serious ruling crisis and put down the growing yearning of South Korean students and people for the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will never allow in any case such moves as disparaging our dignity and system and launching smear campaigns. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the groups of the present South Korean \"people's government\" continue the vicious anti-north smear campaign to incite tensions and confrontation between the north and the south, they will be held entirely responsible for all the ensuing consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean rulers should be mindful that their more vicious anti-DPRK moves will only invite bitterer denunciation at home and abroad and accelerate their doom. \r\n\r\n"

However, the country was hard hit by drought occured from January to May, heat and cold weather in June and July and downpour and typhoon in late July and early August which seriously affected the growth of crops. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, crops could not sturdily grow in summer, and in autumn, too, they were affected by the damp heat accompanied by humidity and cold weather. As a result, all domains of agriculture failed to reap estimated yields of crops as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Natural disasters have hindered production and construction in different sectors of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This year large hydraulic power stations and hundreds of minor hydraulic power stations could not keep electricity production going as the country had little rain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Consequently, the supply of electricity is not properly made for production, construction and people's living. Thermal power plants are not operating their generators at full capacity owing to the shortage of coal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the coal industrial domain, at least 30 large coal mines were totally inundated and some 180 pits submerged last year owing to the natural disasters.  And over 1,000 compressors, pumps and other coal mining equipment were damaged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   When these consequences were not totally eradicated  the country was hit by downpours in late July and early August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a result, coal production was decreased and business activities of power and all other industrial domains are seriously affected. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Abnormal climatic conditions are seriously affecting mines, forestry,  railway transport, land and environment protection and other domains. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Though natural disasters are serious and the food problem remains difficult, the Korean people are making every possible effort to clear away their aftereffects under the revolutionary slogan \"Let's always be cheerful though our path is thorny \"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
