            "content": "KJC Indicts U.S. for Escalating Tension on Korean Peninsula\r\n Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The Korean Jurists Committee (KJC) Sunday released an indictment 70 years since the U.S. forces landed in south Korea. It accused them of escalating tension on the Korean Peninsula, bringing the danger of a nuclear war to it and laying a stumbling block in the way of achieving peace and reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is a product of the U.S. Korea policy for aggression, it said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., well aware of the geopolitical, military and strategic importance of the Korean Peninsula in Asia, stretched tentacles of aggression to Korea more than a century ago and employed every crafty and vicious plot to swallow it up. It got ever more undisguised in its moves in the closing years of the Second World War, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the liberation of Korea was coming true thanks to the heroic anti-Japanese war of the Korean people, the U.S. worked hard to divide it into two parts with the 38th Parallel as a demarcation line in a bid to occupy the southern part of the peninsula at least before the Korean People's Revolutionary Army and the Soviet Army expanded their operational theater there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. crafted this with the calculation that it could have a say concerning the Korean issue when it seized even a half of the territory of Korea and occupy the whole of Korea and, furthermore, attain its goal for dominating Asia and the whole world with the southern part of Korea as a springboard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by this purpose, the U.S. occupied south Korea on September 8, 1945 without even a single gunshot under the pretext of disarming the Japanese Army in the area south of the 38th Parallel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the very day the U.S. troops landed in south Korea under the mask of \"liberator\" they pursued a brutal military fascist rule to turn south Korea into a colony, behaving themselves as occupation forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. illegal military occupation of south Korea meant the beginning of history of split of the Korean nation spanning 5,000 years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the unreasonable U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK, the indictment went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since its occupation of south Korea the U.S. has perpetrated most vicious acts against the Korean people all out to build a new society for the purpose of carrying out its aggressive scenario to swallow up the whole of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the Second World War the U.S. proclaimed the Cold War and ignited the brigandish war of aggression against the DPRK as a recourse to arms for realizing its anti-socialist strategy. It even illegally abused the name of the UN to realize its ambition for seizing the DPRK at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Armistice Agreement concluded on July 27, 1953 was neither an agreement that ended the war nor a peace agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the U.S. deliberately opted for perpetuating truce on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has systematically scrapped key articles of the AA by introducing weaponry including nuclear weapons into south Koreas and escalating various war drills for aggression and steadily ratcheted up the tension on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK finds its vivid manifestation in the fact that it not only has posed military threat and staged madcap drills for provoking a nuclear war but employed every possible means and method to isolate and stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the past the U.S. established diplomatic ties with the former Soviet Union and East European countries having differing ideologies and social systems but refused to properly call the DPRK by its nomenclature, to say nothing of opening diplomatic relations with it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Styling itself the world's \"only superpower\" after the demise of the Cold War, the U.S. let loose a whole gamut of invectives against the DPRK, calling it \"part of the axis of evil,\" \"a rogue state\" and \"an outpost of tyranny,\" for the mere reason that the latter followed an independent policy, refusing to meekly obey to it. It has spread anti-DPRK rumor internationally and staged a racket for isolating and stifling the DPRK by abusing the names of the UN and other international bodies while pulling the DPRK up over \"nuclear issue\" and \"human rights issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government has made consistent efforts to put an end to the U.S. persistent hostile policy that has escalated tension and the danger of a war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even under the situation where the U.S. escalation of military tensions and threat of war entered a more serious phase, the DPRK government made strenuous efforts to replace the AA by a peace treaty from its sincere stand to avert a war on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Third Session of the 5th Supreme People's Assembly of the DPRK in 1974 proposed talks between and the DPRK and the U.S. In 1984 a proposal was made for holding three-party talks involving the DPRK, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities and in 1998 the DPRK-U.S. military negotiations for establishing new peace-keeping mechanism were initiated for putting under control the serious situation that was created due to the U.S. act of playing havoc with the armistice system and the issue of knocking into shape three-party joint military organization was raised once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the historic north-south summit in 2007, the north and the south shared understanding of the need to put an end to the present armistice mechanism and build a durable peace mechanism and adopted the October 4 declaration calling on the heads of three or four parties directly related to it to cooperate in the efforts to promote the issue of making public the end of the war on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has waged a relentless struggle to defuse the nuclear threat of the U.S. as regards the fact that the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK leads to the reckless threat of nuclear attack upon the DPRK and its sovereignty and the nation's fate are exposed to a serious danger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's military muscle built under the banner of Songun in the DPRK-U.S. confrontation over the past seven decades has reached such high phase that it is ready to cope with any form of war desired by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government remains steadfast in its stand to protect the sovereignty of the country and socialism and achieve peace and security on the peninsula by bolstering up its nuclear deterrent both in quality and quantity as long as the U.S. presence in south Korea and its hostile policy toward the DPRK persist."

Korea\r\nPyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- The history of seven decades of the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea is the crime-woven history as they imposed pain of separation upon the Korean nation that lived as a homogeneous nation for thousands of years and brought disaster of war and obstructed the unified development of the Korean nation, Minju Joson Sunday says in a commentary. \n\t\t\t\t\tThe commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. paints its forces in south Korea as \"liberators\" saying that it is \"sacrificing itself to peace and security\" on the Korean Peninsula. However, it is nothing but sophism to cover up the despicable nature as aggressor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat is more serious is that the U.S. imperialists ceaselessly run amuck in the moves for a new war in order to militarily stifle the DPRK and expand the sphere of aggression to the Asian Continent. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the urgent political task to defuse the tension, create a peaceful atmosphere and remove the military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK and withdraw all its troops from south Korea.

This is a formula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHerein lies the reason why the DPRK, desirous of peace and stability of the peninsula and unified development of the nation, demands an end to the U.S. hostile policy to the DPRK and the withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe strategic structure has changed in Northeast Asia and the force between the U.S. and the DPRK has been balanced.

Conservative forces launch confrontation rackets as if they were offered a golden opportunity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities would have not done such confrontation acts if they truly had taken the stand for promoting the national reconciliation and unity and improving the north-south relations through dialogue and negotiations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present reality shows that the hard-won north-south agreement may be an empty paper owing to the confrontation moves of the south Korean authorities. Then the inter-Korean relations will be driven into the catastrophic phase of confrontation and danger of a new nuclear war will increase."
