It was built by reflecting the uppermost desire of the Korean people for national reunification. Hence the name Thongil (reunification) Street.\r\n   The street, about six kilometres long from the Raknang Bridge to the East Pyongyang Thermal Power Station and with the central avenue 120 metres wide running, is lined with apartment complexes for 36,000 family units, public buildings and pleasure parks.\r\n   Massive apartment blocks of different types consist of 18, 20, 25, 30, and 40-storied buildings, presenting a wonderful ensemble.\r\n    Tower-type apartment blocks give cubic effect. The left side of the street is dotted with folding screen-type apartment blocks 600 metres long which consist of 14 to 18-storied buildings and can house 1,500 families. The houses are arranged in keeping with the magnificent physical features of the street and each home is comfortably designed.\r\n   In the central part of the street, a 300-metre-wide promenade stretches out to the riverside of the Taedong. \r\n   Various species of luxuriant trees and flowers are found in green belts and sculptures representing animals such as bear, deer and tiger are placed here and there.\r\n   There is a sculptural group which symbolizes the aspiration of the Korean people for reunification. Two girls are coming from the north and south, with their hairs fluttering in the breeze and their two arms spreading, to embrace each other.\r\n   In the riverside there is the Pyongyang Mullet Soup House built on natural rocks.     This restaurant of traditional Korean architectural style is well knit with the picturesque scenery of the River Taedong and has seating accommodations for 630.\r\n   In addition, there are Pyongyang Noodle House built on a complex of 17,500 square metres, which affords accommodation for 5,000 guests, and other service facilities.\r\n   Each residential quarter is furnished with nurseries, kindergartens, primary and senior middle schools, hospitals and medical posts.\r\n   Thongil Street is the first gateway to the capital from the south.

It was equipped with devices of steering wings and causing, storing and emitting wind. \r\n   It took off with the flexible wings and the jet propulsion by stored air and flew with flap and steering of the wings. The appearance of the car was far earlier than 1783 when a man is said to have flown with a balloon for the first time in the world. \r\n   According to master O Myong Ho, a researcher of the history institute of the academy of social sciences, this clearly shows that Korean ancestors greatly contributed to the development of planes. They used flying cars in battles against the foreign aggressors.\r\n   In 1592 when the Imjin Patriotic War was going on, a Korean army unit encircled by Japanese aggression troops in Jinju Castle in South Kyongsang Province. At that time the unit let a flying car fly 12 km for contact with another unit.\r\n   In 1374, a year of the Koryo Dynasty (918-1392), Koryo army soldiers flew onto Jeju Island from boats with balloons and defeated the Japanese enemy.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry spokesman on resumption of DPRK-Japan talks\r\n Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was interviewed by KCNA today over the issue of resuming full-fledged talks between the DPRK and Japanese governments.\r\n   The spokesman told KCNA:\r\n   Negotiations between Foreign Ministry working-level officials of the two countries which started last year continued in Beijing in January.\r\n   As was already reported, preliminary talks between vice department directors for the normalization of diplomatic relations between the two countries took place in August last year. At the talks both sides agreed to restart the full-fledged talks without preconditions as early as possible within the year. They reached a complete identity of views on the venue and other technical matters concerning the full-fledged talks and agreed to set the date of the talks through a diplomatic channel.\r\n   What remained to be done was only to agree to the date of the resumption of the talks. At the ensuing rounds of the working-level negotiations, however, the Japanese side overruled the agreement between the two sides and raised the groundless \"missing person\" issue as a precondition for the resumption of the talks, intentionally creating difficulties in restarting the talks at an early date.\r\n   At the latest round the DPRK side accused the Japanese side of violating the agreement reached at the previous rounds and preliminary talks held last year. But the Japanese delegate said he was not responsible for it because the agreement was what his predecessor made.\r\n   Such behavior of the Japanese side, which violates an agreement between the two states is really a despicable act that mocks diplomatic confidence.\r\n   The Japanese side's behavior makes us consider how to treat the Japanese delegate and what the Japanese government's position concerning the talks is.\r\n   In diplomacy, mutual confidence should be treasured and agreement implemented without fail.\r\n   If one side unilaterally turns down the agreement without discussion with the other side, such an act will only hurt its country's reputation. Of course, we are invariably seeking the normalization of the DPRK-Japan ties in conformity with the desire of the two peoples.\r\n   If Japan has no intention to restart the talks, however, we will stop seeking the resumption of the talks. And if Japan has not yet finished preparations for the talks, we will wait until it does.\r\n   If the Japanese side continues such a despicable act, we will no longer have dealings with it.\r\n   The Japanese side should be prudent, repenting of its double-faced diplomatic stand and insincere act.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
