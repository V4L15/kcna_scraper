He noted with great satisfaction that art served politics in such a way.\r\n   The steadfast spirit of all the Korean people to defend the leader with their lives, the idea of the red flag, the absolute faith in socialism and the revolutionary spirit of soldiers and the noble feelings of loyalty and filial piety are fully reflected by the songs of the choir. They also mirror the iron will of the great brilliant commander and his matchless grit, strong spirit and deep love for the people.\r\n   \"Let us hold high the red flag\", \"We will defend the headquarters of revolution with our lives\", \"Thunder on Jong Il Peak\" and other songs are imposing, majestic, combatant and vigorous enough to stir up the hearts of all the people. The choir sings well folk songs, too.\r\n   The choir's artistic talent is excellent. Particularly, its high-pitched tone cannot be matched by any foreign choirs.\r\n   The choir performed in many countries. \r\n   It comprises veteran singers as well as singers in their twenties.\r\n   They are now busy selecting and singing other world-famous songs.\r\n   The choir, which is demonstrating its might as a choir of General Kim Jong Il, a matchlessly brilliant commander, is a pride of Korea.    \r\n\r\n"
