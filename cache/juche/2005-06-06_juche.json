The U.S. vociferation about the \"abduction issue\" of someone only sparks off public criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no \"abduction issue\" touted by the U.S. It was none other than the Japanese reactionaries that invented and peddled the \"adduction issue\" while zealously backing the U.S. in its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The smear campaign the U.S. has renewed against the DPRK over its \"abduction issue\", a ridiculous fiction, brought to light its invariable black-hearted intention to isolate and suffocate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this indicates that the U.S. claim that it is not hostile toward the DPRK is no more than a red herring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The obstacle lying in the way of solving the nuclear issue cannot be removed nor can the stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. ever be defused as long as the U.S. clings only to its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK as now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and improved relations with the DPRK, it should not stick to its hostile policy toward the DPRK, a leftover of the old era, any longer.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. deployment of Stealth fighter bombers in south Korea against this backdrop suggests that the outbreak of a war against the DPRK is just a matter of time.\r\n Minju Joson Saturday says this in a signed commentary denouncing the U.S. introduction of 15 \"F-117\" Stealth fighter bombers and 250 maintenance personnel into south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the U.S. has already worked out plans for preemptive nuclear attacks upon the DPRK including \"CONPLAN 8022-02\" and \"OPLAN 5029-05\" and blustered that the Korean war to be launched would be very fierce and destructive and it would break out without any warning, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. deployment of those type bombers in south Korea on the threshold of the 5th anniversary of the June 15 joint declaration is a deliberate criminal move to scuttle the grand festival for reunification and bedevil the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These criminal moves of the U.S. have created a situation making it hard to hold June 15 functions for reunification as a significant grand festival for reunification common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should withdraw its military hardware including the Stealth fighter bombers and its forces from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities would be well advised to behave themselves, bearing in mind that they will never escape from a severe punishment of the Korean nation if they conspire with the U.S. in its moves to provoke a war against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu.\r\n The Combined Expeditionary Group for the Study of Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu recently netted a rare terrapin belonging to the tortoise family in five meter-deep water around the small basin at the foot of Chongsok Peak while studying living things under water of Lake Chon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The terrapin weighs 1.7kg and has 21cm long shell of peculiar beautiful color. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its appearance in Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu, the coldest part of Korea, is drawing the great attention of biologists because terrapins are usually found in the area south of the central part of Korea and the southern regions of China and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the survey and confirmation made by the expeditionary group up to now, there are nearly 250 species of stationary or seasonal animals including birds and insects in the lake and on its shores. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the lake appeared as result of a volcano eruption, it was believed to be unfit for animal habitation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the fact that the expeditionary group succeeded in breeding a shoal of chars in the lake in the 1980s proved that the ecological environment of the lake provides a good habitat for fauna. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group has since deepened the ecological study of the lake, finding more animals.\r\n A Rana temporaria was caught in a pool on the shore of the lake near the small basin at the foot of Paekam Peak in June, Juche 80 (1991). This confirmed the habitation of amphibian animals in the lake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From late in the 1980s when a shoal of chars began increasing in number, gulls could be seen flying in the sky above the lake. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Members of the expeditionary group saw a bear moving around the lake several times. Later on September 18 last year they witnessed a brown bear swimming in the lake towards the shore at the foot of Paekam Peak, after crossing the ridge between Hyangdo Peak and Ssangmujigae Peak. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ceaseless finding of a variety of animals shows that living things in Lake Chon on Mt. Paektu are becoming more diverse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to diverse living things in the lake, Mt. Paektu, a holy mountain of the revolution, is demonstrating its unique spectacular scenic beauty of Juche Korea, heightening the national pride of the Koreans.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has developed smaller nukes, withheld the implementation of its commitment to guarantee security and laid down the doctrine of preemptive nuclear attack in breach of the NPT, while deliberately falling short of fulfilling its commitment as nuclear weapons state to cut down nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been badly disgraced under a barrage of criticism and censure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven by the whole course of the conference, the U.S. has been blamed as an author of nuclear issues currently under dispute worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should take the lead in the implementation of the NPT as it is the world's biggest nuclear developer and possessor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, it has put spurs to the spread of nuclear weapons, far from honoring the treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has thus far denied to ratify the CTBT and stepped up the development and production of new type nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its nuclear policy has spawned more nuclear issues and crises as it has applied double standards as regards the nuclear issue and threatened the anti-American states that it would preempt nuclear attacks on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a hard fact, the U.S. at the conference worked hard to justify its nuclear policy and pointed accusing fingers at other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A particular mention should be made of the fact that it busied itself to build up public opinion critical of the DPRK's \"nuclear ambition.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are just part of the examples of the arrogant attitude and brazen-faced actions taken by the U.S. as regards nuclear issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent conference clearly indicated what is a stumbling block lying in the way of solving the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the very day the issue surfaced the DPRK has demanded from the U.S. the solution to the elementary issues which a nuclear weapons state should have naturally guaranteed a non-nuclear state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had the U.S. respected the NPT from the outset and given the non-nuclear states unconditional assurances against the use of nukes and refrained from pursuing the development of smaller nukes for preemptive attack, the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue would not have surfaced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should also have respected the legitimate right of non-nuclear states to use nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Closely following the conference, the DPRK expected that the U.S. would honestly repent of its past wrongdoings, though belatedly. But it behaved quite contrary to the expectation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Things will not change as long as the U.S. keeps pursuing its strategy to dominate the world based on its nuclear stick policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outcome of the conference left a question mark: Even in case of the DPRK's return to the six-party talks will the U.S. truly give the DPRK exceptional assurances which it has never done to any other non-nuclear states? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the DPRK proposed to discuss the nuclear disarmament issue at the six-party talks on an equal standing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the DPRK's judgment that it would be hard to expect any good results from the six-party talks should the U.S. stick to its self-justified nuclear policy and assertions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

There Kim Il Sung issued detailed combat orders to the guerrillas and, after the battle, took a rest for a while and conducted political activities among people in the homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A monument \"May Konjang Hill shine for ever\" was erected there on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the victory in the battle of Pochonbo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are in the command post the then poplar tree kept in a glass tube and the machine gun which was deployed by the side of the post to defend the headquarters.\r\n Standing in front of the forest conservation office building is the zelkova with one side burned when the building was engulfed in flame during the battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to hand down the immortal exploits performed by Kim Il Sung, his statue was built on June 4, 1955 on the very place where he made a speech at that time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are in the battle site the Monument to Comrade Kim Il Sung's Revolutionary Activities and Pochonbo Revolutionary Museum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Pochonbo Revolutionary Battle Site has served as a center for the education of the working people in the revolutionary traditions.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
