It is now on the verge of \"state bankruptcy.\"\r\n   South Korea and the IMF reached a compromise on the implementation of terms of the IMF's financial aid in December last year. However, this was reduced to a mere sheet of paper by the united states, which complained that the compromise failed to fully reflect its demands. And it forced South Korea to fully open its capital and financial markets including widely opening its stock market and allowing foreigners and foreign enterprises to freely take over and annex local financial institutions and enterprises.\r\n   Yielding to these coercive demands, South Korea has taken anti-national measures in favour of the United States. \r\n   U.S. financial circles and \"business hunters\" are vying with each other in making their way into South Korean enterprises at a time when values of enterprises and banks have been dropped to the lowest level owing to the economic failure.\r\n   Japan also attained its purpose by urging South Korea to abrogate its diversification policy in imports.\r\n   Pressurized by the United States, Japan and other fund donators, South Korea is being driven deeper into the abyss of economic subjugation and destruction.    \r\n   \r\n"

            "content": "Great efforts made in reconstruction of King Tangun's mausoleum\r\n  Pyongyang, February  10 (KCNA) -- The mausoleum of King Tangun, the ancestral father of the Korean nation, is at the foot of Mt. Taebak, Kangdong county, Pyongyang.     With an area of 45 hectares, it is carefully preserved as a nation's precious cultural treasure.\r\n   Five years ago, President Kim Il Sung gave instructions on how the tomb of King Tangun should be excavated and how it should be preserved as a national treasure.\r\n   A 22-metre-high quadrilateral stone pyramid tomb, stone sculptures and other ornaments give the visitors a feeling of royal majesty.\r\n   The full view of the mausoleum which has been reconstructed as a national monument reminds the visitors of great efforts made by President Kim Il Sung and General Kim Jong Il in order to prove the 5,000-year-long history of the Korean nation.\r\n    President Kim Il Sung instructed many times to excavate the tomb of King Tangun, stressing the need to put the history of ancient Korea, the first Korean state, on the correct order, which had been distorted by Japanese cringing historians.\r\n   At the beginning of 1993, he again set important tasks to be fulfilled in excavating the tomb. Thus the excavation work of the tomb progressed actively. In the course of this, the bones of Tangun and the remains of the dead were unearthed.\r\n   A scientific analysis proved that Tangun was not a legendary figure, but an actual figure who was born more than 5,000 years ago. It enabled the Korean people to regain the ancestral father of their nation and restore their 5,000-year-long history.\r\n   The 80-year-old President visited the tomb in Kangdong and called for reconstructing the tomb magnificently as befits one of the ancestral father of the Korean nation. He also gave dozens of instructions later on how the reconstruction work of the tomb should be carried out.\r\n   On July 6, 1994, two days before he died, while presiding over a consultative meeting of the senior economic officials, he examined the final layout of the mausoleum and urged the officials to accelerate reconstruction work.\r\n   True to the intentions of the President, General Kim Jong Il corrected mistakes in redressing the Korean history and provided archaeologists with all conditions for the reconstruction projects.  He then formed a committee for reconstruction of the tomb and ensured that fund, materials and manpower were invested in the project in great profusion and all difficult problems were settled.\r\n   Thanks to his meticulous guidance the tomb was reconstructed in a short time.\r\n   General Kim Jong Il visited the reconstructed mausoleum in October 1994 and noted with great satisfaction that it was reconstructed magnificently as a national monument, as wished by the president. He also referred to the problems to be tackled in preserving and managing the mausoleum.\r\n   Great efforts exerted by the two leaders will remain in the memory of the nation for ever.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
