            "content": "Kim Jong Un Guides Strategic Submarine Underwater Ballistic Missile Test-fire\r\n Pyongyang, August 25 (KCNA) -- A test-fire of strategic submarine-launched ballistic missile was successfully conducted under the guidance of supreme commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA) Kim Jong Un, chairman of the Workers' Party of Korea (WPK) and chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t At the observation post he was briefed on the plan for the test-fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as he issued an order to start the test-fire, the strategic submarine submerged up to a depth for firing the ballistic missile and rapidly launched the ballistic missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test-fire which was conducted under a high-angle fire system in the maximum launching depth reconfirmed the stability of the underwater ballistic launching system, the starting character of the high power solid fuel engine and phased flying kinetic feature after coming up to the surface of the water. It proved that the core technical indexes of the ballistic missile including the reliability of the phased heat separation and the control and guidance system and the working accuracy of the warhead in the re-entry section perfectly met all requirements for operation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The SLBM test-fire was successfully carried out without any adverse impact on neighboring countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the trajectory of the ballistic missile Pukguksong, he said with pleasure that it was a great manifestation and demonstration of the tremendous power and inexhaustible muscle of the DPRK and he felt enormous energy was welling out.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He appreciated the test-fire as the greatest success and victory and highly praised the officials, scientists and technicians in the field of national defence science and munitions factories for having perfectly acquired the technology of SLBM in a short span of time and extended special thanks to them in the name of the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the WPK and the supreme commander of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted with pride that the results of the test-fire proved in actuality that the DPRK joined the front rank of the military powers fully equipped with nuclear attack capability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. vicious nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK only resulted in bolstering up its nuclear attack capability hour by hour and the U.S. mainland and the operational theatre in the Pacific are now within the striking range of the KPA, no matter how hard the U.S. tries to deny it, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Strongly warning the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet group staging the joint military exercise aiming at a preemptive nuclear strike at the DPRK with huge nuclear strategic assets involved and thereby seriously rattling its nerves, he said the Korean people would deal merciless blows at them with nuclear hammers of justice so that nails of injustice may not come out again, once an opportunity is given, now that the DPRK has in place all substantial means capable of standing up against the U.S. nuclear hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted: \"I do not guess what ridiculous remarks the U.S. and its followers will make about this test-fire, but I can say their rash acts will only precipitate their self-destruction.  The best way of escaping the deadly strike of the infuriated KPA is to refrain from hurting the dignity and security of the DPRK with prudence and self-control.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Warning the enemies not to underestimate the might of the DPRK, he said it would clearly show the world how it would proudly tower, after breaking the chains of sanctions, blockade and pressure of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need for the field of national defence science to put increased spurs to mounting nuclear warheads on ballistic missiles in order to cope with the unpredicted total war and nuclear war with the U.S. imperialists and, at the same time, focus all efforts on the development of means of their delivery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed officials to take a series of all eventful actions to demonstrate the DPRK's muscle as a full-fledged military power if the enemies try to threaten its dignity and the right to existence even a bit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He warmly greeted the national defence scientists and service personnel of the navy returning to the port after the successful test-fire and warmly congratulated them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with them."

Y se confirmo que llegaron perfectamente a la demanda operacional los indicies tecnicos medulares del proyectil inclusive la confiabilidad del sistema de separacion termica por etapas, el de control y teledireccion y la exactitud de acertamiento de la ojiva combativa para la reentrada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente lanzamiento se ejecuto exitosamente sin dar ninguna influencia negativa a la seguridad de los paises contornos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tContemplando el cohete balistico \"Pukkuksong\", el Mariscal dijo con alegria que este lanzamiento es la gran explosion y plena manifestacion del inagotable poderio estatal y la fuerza condensada de Corea y le da el animo y la fuerza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl presente lanzamiento deviene exito de los exitos y victoria de las victorias, acoto y evaluo altamente a los funcionarios, cientificos y tecnicos de la rama de ciencias de defensa nacional y las fabricas de materiales belicos quienes perfeccionaron completamente en un corto tiempo la tecnica de lanzamiento de SLBM. Y les dio el agradecimiento especial en nombre del Comite Central y la Comision Militar Central, del PTC, y el Comandante Supremo del EPC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo con orgullo y dignidad que a traves del resultado de ensayo del proyectil balistico lanzado hoy se confirmo realmente el hecho de que la RPDC entro dignamente en la plena fila de las potencias militares dotadas perfectamente de la capacidad de ataque nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos perversos amenaza y chantaje nuclear de los Estados Unidos trajeron solo el resultado de fortalecer momento a momento nuestra capacidad de ofensiva nuclear, asevero y anadio que por mas que niegue EE.UU. ya estan indudablemente en nuestra mano el territorio principal norteamericano y la zona operacional del Pacifico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdvirtio seriamente sobre el hecho de que los imperialistas yanquis y los titeres surcoreanos nos incitan gravemente introduciendo ante nuestra vista un sinnumero de las propiedades estrategicas nucleares y realizando el entrenamiento militar conjunto para dar ataque sorpresivo nuclear a la RPDC. Puesto que hemos dotado de todos los medios reales para hacer frente a la hegemonia nuclear de EE.UU., senalo y subrayo que si nos toca la oportunidad el pueblo coreano golpeara sin piedad con el martillo nuclear de justicia a los medios nucleares de injusticia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo nos importan los disparates que EE.UU. y sus fuerzas seguidoras soltaran en cuanto al presente lanzamiento de prueba, agrego y enfatizo que tales imprudencias aceleraran solo su autodestruccion. Advirtio que el mejor remedio para evadir nuestro ataque aniquilador es que ellos mantengan calma sin atentar a nuestra dignidad y seguridad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos enemigos no deben menospreciar en absoluto nuestra capacidad, acentuo y continuo que mostraremos claramente a todo el mundo como nos levantamos majestuosamente rompiendo las cadenas de sancion, bloqueo y presion de los enemigos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara hacer frente a la guerra total, la nuclear, con EE.UU. que puede estallar en cualquier momento, el dominio de ciencia de defensa nacional debe dar mas acicate a la fabricacion de los armamentos nucleares, y al mismo tiempo, concentrar todas las fuerzas en el desarrollo de los medios de su transporte, enfatizo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY ordeno seguir demostrando de manera escalonada todas las medidas practicas que puede mostrar la digna potencia militar en caso de que los enemigos se atrevan a amenazar nuestra dignidad y derecho a existencia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecibio fervorosamente en el puerto a los trabajadores del sector cientifico de defensa nacional y los oficiales y soldados de fuerzas navales quienes regresan tras lanzar con exito el SLBM, les dio calurosa felicitacion y se fotografio junto con ellos."
