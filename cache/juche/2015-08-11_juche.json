But the U.S. answered the DPRK's sincere proposal with war maneuvers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tensions persist on the Korean peninsula without dialogue. This is attributable to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and joint military exercises for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. is persistently pulling up the DPRK, a shameless scheme to cover up its true colors as the wrecker of peace and shift the blame for it on to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can it conceal its true colors as disturber of dialogue and peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it truly wants dialogue, it should stop the old ballad for dialogue and halt the joint military exercise to show its sincere will for dialogue."

This proves that the gun-related crimes are a chronic cancer which can never be treated in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Tuesday says this in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither Obama nor his successor can put an end to gun-related crimes in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even congressmen are helpless before the powerful influence of the U.S. Gun Association called as the largest lobby organization in the country and it is, therefore, quite  impossible to see the adoption of any gun control act there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t So, Americans cannot escape death due to shooting spree taking place anytime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is under the sway of all sorts of social evils including gun-related crimes, racism, violence and abuse of women and children.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This being a hard reality, the U.S. politicians should mind their own business before meddling in issues of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they are busy interfering in affairs of other countries, remaining utterly indifferent to the uneasiness and horror of their people and death of innocent inhabitants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are behaving as if they were \"human rights judges,\" while releasing \"human rights report\" every year to pull up other countries over their \"human rights records\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the U.S. hide its worst human rights abuses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, indeed, the world's worst tundra of human rights and veritable hell, notes the commentary."
