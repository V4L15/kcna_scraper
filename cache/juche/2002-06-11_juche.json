They participated in the fifth servicemen's family art circle contest of the KPA.\r\nThe performers' repertoire included colorful numbers of diverse genres including chorus \"our everlasting day of the sun\" and poem and five women's chorus \"general's care represents our cradle\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The performance was highly acclaimed by the audience for its high ideological and artistic value. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il was greatly pleased with their successful performance in which the servicemen's family art circle members made a vivid and truthful depiction of their life and feelings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Praising the servicemen's families placing the interests of the country and revolution above their own as truly proud women revolutionaries who have courageously emerged from difficulties and trials, he called on all the people to earnestly learn from their noble spiritual world, their militant spirit and way of life so that a revolutionary spirit may prevail throughout the society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the servicemen's family art circle contest of the KPA whose organization has become a tradition has helped radically raise the cultural attainments of the servicemen's families and create a new style of culture in the army-based era, he put forward highly important tasks which would serve as a guideline in further developing the art circles activities of weighty importance in the revolutionary education of the party members and other working people.    \r\n\r\n"

This only doubles or trebles its crimes committed in the past. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's evasion of its responsibility to settle its past only deepens the mistrust and antagonism among countries and renders the international community uneasy. This is clearly evidenced by the present DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are becoming increasingly assertive that if Japan does not redeem its past crimes they should force Japan to pay for them come what may. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attitude can be interpreted, in the final analysis, as a deliberate act to spark an armed clash between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This behaviour adversely affects the peaceful progress in the region, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan committed so hideous and enormous crimes in the past that they can never be settled by a few glossy words \"regret\" or \"apology.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue can be solved only when Japan makes a state confession of its crimes and apology and full compensation for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to face up to the trend of the times toward independence and the requirement of the world mindset, stop adding to its past crimes and make a political decision to redress its past at an earliest possible date.     \r\n\r\n"
