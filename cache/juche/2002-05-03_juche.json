The establishment of a new and just international information order should be the main target of the international information service in the new century, he noted, and went on:\r\n All information services should not be used as a lever to encroach upon the sovereignty of other countries and interfere in their internal affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is most important for the un to provide developing countries with more opportunities to take an active part in the international information service aimed at establishing the new and just international information order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the developing countries should increase their information capability and lift their voices through cooperation in the information field. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He underscored the need for the U.N. to ensure impartiality and objectivity in its information service.     \r\n\r\n"
