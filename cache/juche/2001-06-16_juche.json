Kumgang yesterday to mark the 1st anniversary of the June 15 Joint Declaration adopted a joint communique on the seminar and a joint statement denouncing the Japanese authorities for working hard to distort history in textbooks.\r\n The joint communique said that the seminar was attended by representatives of various political parties and organizations of the north and the south, over 200 from each side, 20 representatives of overseas compatriots from various regions, and more than 250 personages as observers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The communique said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the seminar that took place on the theme \"June 15 Joint Declaration and Nation's Task\" were unanimous in saying that the declaration is one for independence, peaceful reunification and great national unity and a joint programme and a joint landmark for the country's reunification which the Korean nation should hold fast to in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They said that in order to implement the June 15 Joint Declaration to the letter all the fellow countrymen should closely unite transcending the differences in ideology, idea and system from a firm stand to independently solve the reunification issue by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation and all the organizations and personages in the north and the south and abroad should work hard to achieve solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They underscored the need to activate the multi-faceted cooperation and exchanges and settle humanitarian issues in conformity with the desire of the nation between the north and the south to consolidate national reconciliation and confidence among compatriots. They also called for holding multifarious campaigns and events one after another in the \"period of June 15-August 15 movement for the promotion of national reunification\" to make a positive contribution to glorifying this year as a year of opening the door of reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The joint statement strongly condemned the Japanese right-wing conservatives' moves to tamper with history as an unpardonable criminal move to justify the past crimes committed against the Korean nation and revive militarism and thus realize their ambition for reinvasion. \r\n Noting that with nothing can Japan justify its aggression and plunder, it said that the only way out for it is to make honest apology and due compensation for them.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. to blame for delay in lwr project, says KCNA \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- The executive of the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organization (KEDO) is taking an improper attitude toward the compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delay in the lwr project.\r\n Executive director of the KEDO Kartman said at a recent press conference in Seoul that the Pyongyang side is also responsible for the delay in the lwr project and that compensation for the loss of electricity caused by the delayed project is unacceptable because there is no provision calling for compensation in the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His remark is very short-sighted and irresponsible given KEDO's mission to handle technical matters related to the construction of two LWRs, each 1,000 mw (e), by the year 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His shameless assertion is intended to evade the U.S. responsibility for the delay in the LWR project and force the DPRK to observe the agreed framework unilaterally.\r\n The DPRK nuclear freeze and the U.S. LWR provision are stipulated as simultaneous actions in the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK had developed its nuclear power industry independently, not bound to the agreed framework, it would not have suffered any power shortage but have created an atomic energy generating capacity of 2,000 mw(e) by the year 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Respecting the agreement with the U.S. and taking into consideration a letter from the u.s. president assuring the DPRK that lwr power plants with a capacity of 2,000 mw (e) would be completed by the year 2003, the DPRK sacrificed its nuclear power industry, sustaining a huge economic loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not secret that the U.S. deliberately delayed the project from its outset putting up a number of unreasonable conditions and laid one artificial obstacle after another, instituting even a regulation at the congress calling for putting the brake on the LWR project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. insincere attitude and obstructive moves that it is hard to guess when the lwr project will be completed though it is nearly seven years since the agreed framework was signed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then who should compensate for the huge economic loss caused by the delayed project? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the universally recognized norm in the international relations that the loss caused by the non-compliance with an agreement should be compensated by the side which failed to observe it. The same is true of the sensitive politico-economic issue of the u.s. provision of LWRs to the DPRK in return for its freeze of nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KEDO executive director with a long political career must know it very well.   He, however, is falsifying the stark fact in a bid to help the U.S. evade its responsibility to compensate for the electricity loss. this is little short of an act of damaging the confidence in the U.S. in the inter-state relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given the agreed framework and the U.S. President's letter of assurance, the U.S. is certain to fail to fulfil its commitment. Under this situation the U.S. should unconditionally compensate for the electricity loss. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard, the DPRK clarified more than once its resolute position on this matter after releasing a detailed report on the too much delay in the lwr project. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK explicitly states once again that it can no longer suffer an enormous loss of electricity, unilaterally bound to the agreed framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KEDO executive should clarify its position toward the issue of compensation resulting from the failure to fulfil the commitment.    \r\n\r\n"

Their remarks proved that the U.S. \"concern\" was groundless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. pulled up the DPRK over \"proliferation of nuclear capacity\" in a bid to  shift the responsibility for unilaterally delaying the implementation of the agreed framework onto the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, the agreed framework is now facing such a serious crisis that should no longer be over looked with 2003 at hand and the U.S. is entirely to blame for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has not taken any substantial urgent measure, failing to adopt a self-examining and responsible attitude and stand toward the destiny of the agreed framework, but has pursued a sinister aim to turn the world public in its favour at any cost under the pretext of \"nuclear suspicion\" in the DPRK and elevate its negotiating position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should act with discrection, pondering over what consequenses its sinister plot will bring to the DPRK-U.S. relations and international relations as a whole.    \r\n\r\n"
