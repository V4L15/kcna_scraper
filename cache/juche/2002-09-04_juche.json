Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 4 (KCNA) -- The sixth all-people rally was reportedly held in Seoul on August 31 to condemn GIs' killing of south Korean schoolgirls.\r\n Attending the rally, sponsored by the all-people measure committee for Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son, schoolgirls killed by U.S. armored car, were over 2,000 members of the measure committee. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the rally the representative of the anti-Chosun Ilbo citizens' solidarity recalled the fact that Chosun Ilbo, a newspaper of south Korea, reported about the murder of those schoolgirls one month after the case occurred, saying that the citizens' movement should not be turned into an anti-U.S. action. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expressing anger at such pro-U.S. stand, he said that a campaign to eradicate this newspaper should be conducted simultaneously for the victory of the citizens' movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An open letter to Bush was read out at the rally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter said that the attitude of Bush, who has refused to meet the south Korean people's demand for an apology in disregard of their indignation, is as good as regarding them as colonial slaves whose fate is at the mercy of the masters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the south Koreans, ranging from primary schoolers to the old, are condemning GI criminals, it noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter urged an open apology of bush, an overall reinvestigation and probe into the incident, the U.S. Forces' renunciation of criminal jurisdiction and a total revision of the south Korea-U.S. status of forces agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the rally the participants marched along streets, conducting information activities for citizens.    \r\n   \r\n"

People's illusion about imperialism and war phobia lead them to death. This is proved by what happened in Iraq and the Afghan war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-imperialist forces for independence and the world peace-loving people are urgently called upon to heighten vigilance against the U.S. imperialists' moves to escalate the \"war against terrorism\" and put up a joint struggle to check and frustrate their new arms buildup and policy of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries aspiring after independence and peace should under no circumstances help the U.S. imperialists in their moves for aggression or get involved in them.     They should intensify their struggle to get the U.S. aggressive military bases dismantled in other countries and regions and their aggressor forces withdrawn from there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is of particular importance for all the progressive and peace forces to deal blows and put pressure upon the imperialists in unity in order to achieve peace through a struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only when all the progressive forces and anti-imperialist forces go united can they deal collective blows at the imperialists and put pressure upon them by an unchallenged force and thus bind them hand and foot so that they may not act recklessly.     \r\n\r\n"

Herein lie universality and eternal viability of the idea and its world-historic significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fully advocating independence of the popular masses, the Juche idea enjoys great sympathy of the world people for its originality and truthfulness. The idea is also contributing to the ideological development and liberation of humankind as it gives the genuine revolutionary outlook on the world in the present times, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter to Kim Jong Il was adopted at the seminar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The seminar adopted a resolution, which said they would deepen the study of the Juche idea and its originality and truthfulness to contribute to building an independent and prosperous guinea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution also said they would unite with peoples of all countries on the principle of independence and support the progressive movement for independence.    \r\n\r\n"
