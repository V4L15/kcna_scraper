Korean Research Worker Calls for Building Structure of Korea-U.S. Confrontation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 27 (KCNA) -- Jang Chang Jun, researcher of the south Korean Civil Rights Institute, reportedly made public an article headlined \"The 17th-term National Assembly should be political position of building structure of confrontation between our nation and the U.S. through practical actions\".\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the recent general election the old-time political forces were given a grave judgment and the U.S. moves to poke its nose into the election to create a favorable phase for the coup forces were also fully foiled. The mature consciousness shown by the people will play a greater role in building the structure of confrontation between our nation and the U.S. through practical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Calling for giving fuller play to the strength of the nation, the strength of the people who want progress and reform and aspire after independence and reunification, he referred to tasks ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He stressed the need to accelerate the struggle for nullification of the \"motion on impeachment\" in real earnest, to demand the 17th-term \"National Assembly\" withdraw the motion on \"impeachment\" and the Constitutional Court make a decision branding the motion as unconstitutional and to wage the struggle to remove the Cold War forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He called for waging a powerful struggle for the withdrawal of the decision on the troop dispatch to Iraq, meeting the national demand for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue in the Korean peninsula and totally denying the negotiations on the redeployment of the U.S. troops stationed in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is clearly evidenced by the fact that the U.S. in the \"recommendation\" openly branded some countries including the DPRK as \"countries posing a nuclear threat\" and enumerated specific ways of preemptive nuclear attack upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. evermore undisguised moves to mount a preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK eloquently prove the justice of the tough measures so far taken by the DPRK against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"new security strategy initiative\" will only precipitate its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

However, a big stumbling block still remains in the way of achieving the reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pro-reunification movement organizations including the South Korean Federation of University Student Councils are being suppressed on absurd charges of being \"enemy-benefiting organizations\" and those who had been engaged in righteous activities for independence, democracy and reunification are put behind bars on charges of violating the SL. This is a grim reality today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be impossible to smoothly implement the joint declaration, vitalize the patriotic movement for reunification and satisfactorily solve the issue of the inter-Korean relations as long as the SL remains in force in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One should not hesitate to repeal such anti-national and anti-reunification legal and institutional mechanism as the SL if one stands for the joint declaration and wishes the reconciliation, unity and reunification of the nation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
