The proposal was put forward at a joint meeting of the DPRK government,  political parties and organizations held early this month. The meeting called for adhering to the three principles of national reunification and realising a wide-range dialogue between the north and south under the uplifted banner of national independence and great unity this year.   A letter containing the reunification-oriented proposal was sent to the South Korean authorities, political parties, organizations and people of all walks of life.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such positive measures were taken out of the noble desire and will to  remove the danger of war this year, the last year of '90s, by pooling strength and resourcefulness of the nation, and greet the 2000s of reunification and prosperity.    No sooner had the proposal been reported than it aroused support and great repercussions at home and abroad. Foreign governments, political parties, organizations, mass media and peace-loving figures hailed the new proposal as  \"a realistic proposal to open up a new phase of Korea's reunification\", \"constructive and positive proposal\" and \"reasonable and practical measure\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  An enlarged meeting of the executive committee of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea was held in Brussels on Feb. 6 three days after the joint meeting was held in Pyongyang.   An appeal and a special resolution adopted at the meeting expressed full support to the patriotic proposal of the DPRK and called upon the governments, public and political forces of the world and international organizations to urge the South Korean authorities to accept this proposal.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Political parties and organizations of many countries including 11 of Nepal, 17 of Madagascar and 9 political parties of Peru in their joint and separate statements noted that the Pyongyang proposal was the most just and correct measures.

Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His revolutionary leadership giving priority to military affairs means training the revolutionary armed forces to be pillars of revolution and enhancing their role to the maximum and leading  the socialist cause as a whole to a steady upswing, the article says, and goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; his revolutionary leadership is a brilliant inheritance of the revolutionary leadership of the great leader Kim Il Sung who had pioneered and advanced the revolution by force of arms.   His revolutionary leadership proves to be great and just in defending Korean socialism firmly and bringing a new revolutionary turn in the struggle of the Korean people to build a powerful nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The situation prevailing in Korea eloquently proves that when military power is mighty, it is possible to defend socialism from the aggression moves of the imperialists.    It is the lofty intention of General Secretary Kim Jong Il that the People's Army should serve not only as defender of the country and revolution but also as shock brigade for socialist construction and creator of the people's happiness.    Always reposing deep trust in the People's Army, he has wisely led it to materialize the party's plan for socialist construction in the van.    He has led all the people to positively follow the spirit, morality and culture created by the army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spirit of Kwanggye was created, the flames of Songgang  flared up and the second grand Chollima march was stepped up in the difficult period of \"arduous march\" and the forced march, because the indomitable revolutionary spirit and trait of the People's Army are prevailing in the whole country.   His leadership also proves to be just in vigorously encouraging the struggle of the revolutionary people of the world, who aspire after socialism.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The revolutionary parties and people of the world find a way of accomplishing the socialist cause in his revolutionary leadership giving priority to military affairs.
