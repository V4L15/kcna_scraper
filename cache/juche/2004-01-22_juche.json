Dismissing this as a ridiculous act of ill-natured ones, Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary today says:\r\n The south Korean authorities are pushing for a \"special amnesty\" for those involved in the socalled \"case of remittance to the north\" with the lapse of one year after the assumption of office by the present chief executive. In this connection the GNP is now raising a hue and cry, contending that the \"special amnesty must never be tolerated\" as it is \"an abuse of the right of amnesty that disturbs state discipline\" and \"strategy of Chongwadae for the National Assembly election.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is showing its bad habit of blocking at every step anything good for inter-Korean reconciliation and cooperation. Truth to tell, the \"case of remittance to the north\" was an off-spring of an anti-reunification plot of those who do not want inter-Korean contact, reconciliation and cooperation, mortified by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the GNP that took issue with the \"case\" that posed no problem and cooked up the \"act of special inspection,\" malignantly criminalizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Giving vent to jealousy and indignation at the June 15 event, having been shut out of it, the GNP was dastardly enough to throw a snag in the way of reconciliation and cooperation between the fellow countrymen in the north and the south by means of the \"special inspection\" of the economic dealings between the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Hyundai Business Group and impudently tried to tarnish the image of the historic Pyongyang meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no room for doubt that the GNP is, indeed, a habitat of those who have got into the incurable habit of slandering and obstructing anything contrary to their narrow-minded, short-sighted and traitorous mode of thinking, absolutizing it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Abusing the \"special amnesty\" as something in the nature of causing illness and administering medicine is no more than an irresponsible and imprudent act of encouraging the GNP in its treacheries.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Assails Japan's Moves to Go Nuclear\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- Remarks calling for the nuclear weaponization of Japan are heard from the outset of this year against the backdrop of its escalated moves for militarization. This is rubbing the international community up the wrong way.\r\n Former Prime Minister Nakasone recently asserted that it is possible for Japan to possess nuclear weapons under a certain condition and it is in accord with the constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is not a personal remark made by a former politician but clearly reflects Japan's stand and ambition to emerge a new nuclear force in the 21st century. It is clearly evidenced by Japan's stepped-up moves for nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that Dietman Nishimura, who once called for examining the issue of Japan's possession of nuclear weapons a few years ago, again clarified his view on it and a professor at a Japanese university argued that Japan should move to have access to nukes from this moment. He even claimed for a country to completely abandon nuclear weapons is like promising not to hook his opponent in a boxing match.\r\n The ever-mounting zeal for nuclear weaponization in Japan can not but arouse vigilance of the Asian people aspiring after a peaceful new world free from a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now rounding off its nuclear weaponization at its final phase. Japan is capable of producing thousands of nuclear warheads overnight once it is determined and has their delivery means in place and possesses its independent spy satellites and their guide system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the Japanese reactionaries are making much ado about the fictitious \"nuclear and missile threats\" from the DPRK in a bid to justify their moves for nuclear weaponization. Through this they seek to mislead the public opinion in Japan and fool the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government recently made a final decision to introduce the Missile Defence System at the meeting of the National Security Council and a ministerial meeting citing the DPRK as a pretext and is now pushing ahead with its deployment in real earnest. This can not be construed otherwise than part of its plan to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK keenly realizes the justice of the steps taken by it to build a strong nuclear deterrent force to cope with the nuclear threat from the U.S. and Japan's moves for nuclear weaponization.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

What remains to be done is to provide legal conditions for Japan's possession of nukes. But a scrutiny into Japan's present legal circumstances suggests that it only ostensively negates nuclear weaponization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Displeased with this, the Japanese reactionaries are set to buckle down to realizing their ambition for nuclear weaponization, regarding the present situation as a golden opportunity to do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, seized by its wild ambition for world supremacy, worked out a new nuclear strategy to realize it and is getting desperate in its efforts to produce smaller nukes whose use it considers quite possible. It is the ulterior intention of the Japanese reactionaries to start the production of smaller nukes, taking advantage of the U.S. move, and, on this basis, revise its constitution to emerge a nuclear weapons state overnight. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is self-evident that when Japan goes nuclear, seized by the ambition for overseas expansion and militaristic overseas invasion,it will bring worldwide disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove the justice of the measures taken by the DPRK to build a nuclear deterrent force to cope with the U.S. nuclear threat and Japan's moves for nuclear weaponization.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kumgang and suspend the construction of the Kaesong industrial zone. Rodong Sinmun in a signed article today dismisses this is an unreasonable interferencein the internal affairs of the Korean nation and a premeditated act to block reconciliation and reunification process on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national reunification to establish the sovereignty of the nation all over the country, reconnect its bisected blood ties and achieve reconciliation and unity is entirely an internal issue of the Korean nation. No outside force has the right and excuse to interfere in its reunification issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is itching to upset other's apple cart with outrageous interference and pressure by getting its hand on the issues of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification on the Korean peninsula. This impudent and shameless act is motivated by its criminal policy to dominate Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To carry this policy into practice, the U.S. is framing plots to bring the holocaust of a nuclear war upon the Korean nation without hesitation. For this criminal design, it is intensifying interference and pressure against reunification, dismayed by the adoption of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and growing fervor for independence and reunification on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation should deal a merciless sledge hammer blow to the U.S. interference and pressure insulting it which is desirous of achieving independence and reunification. All the Koreans, be they in the north, south or overseas, should turn out as one in the anti-U.S. showdown to bring into shape the Korean nation-U.S. confrontation by fully cooperating under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit. The south Korean people should resolutely oppose the U.S. unreasonable pressure and interference running counter to the dignity and interests of the nation and raise a fiercer flame of struggle for independence against the U.S. South Korea should not yield to the U.S. pressure for the \"adjustment\" of the progress of inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities would be well advised to correctly judge and deal with all the matters from the national stand to suit the era of national independence and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
