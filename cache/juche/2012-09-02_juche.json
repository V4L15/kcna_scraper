General Pak Jong Chon, Hwang Pyong So, vice department director of the C.C., the WPK, and KPA service personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Put on the stage were wind music \"Let Our Party Flag Flutter Vigorously,\" \"The General Is the Banner of Victory\" and \"Song of the Korean People's Army,\" \"Advance,\" \"Song of Coastal Artillerymen\" and \"Leader, Just Give Us Your Order\" and foreign songs \"On Waves\" and \"Sword Dance.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The performers represented with great pride the militant spirit and invincible might of the heroic KPA, which is devotedly defending the party and the leader, the country and its people by inheriting the brilliant traditions of the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle with solemn echo and cheerful and appealing melody.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the end of the concert, the performers and the audience enthusiastically cheered the Supreme Commander.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth the tasks facing the brass band and gave precious instructions on implementing them, saying that the revolutionary and militant brass band instills the conviction of sure victory in the revolution, optimism, burning hatred for the enemies and the will to annihilate them into all service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when the brass band arranges and plays dynamic and cheerful songs as melodies played by it are marches, can it stir up the spirit of the army and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a contest among the brass bands of the KPA is organized, it will help swap good experience in playing and creative activities and raise the rendition skill in that course, he said, giving an instruction to hold a contest every year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KPA brass band is a symbol and face of the powerful revolutionary army of Mt. Paektu, he noted, underscoring the need to further develop the rendition skill and style in a Korean way and provide it with better uniforms so that it may play military music replete with mental power and spirit of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hearing the mere words of military music makes one feel strength surging up and wherever military music is heard, courage is displayed and feats are performed, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When listening to wind music \"Song of the Korean People's Army,\" in particular, one cannot but be excited, he said, adding when the day of the great war for national reunification comes in the future, the KPA will advance to the tune of the revolutionary military music played by the KPA brass band.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the creators and musicians of the KPA brass band would conduct activities for creation and playing, deeply aware of their honorable tasks, and thus further develop the KPA brass band into a world-class one and powerfully encourage the service personnel and people in a worthwhile advance toward a final victory."

It has now become undisguised in its moves to ignite a war against the DPRK as its office is nearing its end.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a bylined article. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the necessity of history that the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces obsessed with aggression and war are bound to meet final destruction, it says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article cites facts to prove this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the last Korean War, the U.S. imperialists perpetrated a surprise armed invasion against the young DPRK by mobilizing the Syngman Rhee puppet clique and mercenaries of satellite countries. However, the aggressors suffered a miserable defeat in face of the heroic struggle waged by the army and the people of the DPRK all out in the sacred war of justice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" incident and large spy plane \"EC-121\" incident which took place against the backdrop of ceaseless armed provocations of warmongers at home and abroad in the post-war period ended in the surrender of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 1990s, the U.S. and the south Korean puppet forces worked hard to ignite an all-out war against the DPRK while talking about \"nuclear inspection\". But the enemies were hard hit by the DPRK's solemn proclamation of a semi-war state and its statement declaring the withdrawal from the NPT.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the U.S. signed the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the U.S. president sent even a message of assurances to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the new century, too, the DPRK has won victory after victory in the ceaseless confrontation and the U.S. and the puppet forces suffered bitter setbacks one after another. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the enemies fire even a single shell on the territory of the DPRK, this will not be confined to a local war but lead to a sacred war for the country's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chance of provocation sought by the U.S. imperialists and the puppet warmongers will only prove to be a time to meet self-destruction as it will precipitate their final end."
