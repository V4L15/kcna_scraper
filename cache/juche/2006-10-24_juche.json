            "content": "Abe Warned Not to Play Petty Trick: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 23 (KCNA) -- Recently Japanese Prime Minister Abe said that Japan inflicted wounds upon various Asian countries in the past and uttered words of remorse for this. He added he would accept the criticism of his misunderstanding of history.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary terms his remarks an ostrich policy, warning Abe not to play a petty trick over the issue of visit to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disclosing Abe's ulterior intention to avoid any comment on the issue although he made it clear that he would \"inherit\" the view of the preceding regime on Japan's past crimes of aggression, the commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everybody that his petty trick can never be understandable to the neighboring countries as even Japanese media criticized it as red herring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For all his efforts to maintain an ambiguous attitude, his real intention has already been brought to light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even before holding premiership, he supported the predecessor's visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" and made a secret visit to the shrine in April. Recently 84 members of the \"Dietmen's Association for Inviting All to Visit the 'Yasukuni Shrine'\" including an advisor to the prime minister and a vice-minister of Public Management, Home Affairs, Post and Telecommunications made a group visit to the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By avoiding for the time being any mention about the visit to the shrine, a very sensitive political issue and an international problem, Abe seeks to escape international criticism. As a matter of fact, he has not abandoned the idea of visiting the shrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese authorities felt remorseful of the crime-woven past even a bit, there would be no reason for them to refuse to clarify their stand not to visit the \"Yasukuni Shrine\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are disturbing moves in Japan at present to operate the \"Yasukuni Shrine,\" a centre for spreading the militaristic idea, as a national cemetery for the purpose of openly conducting national and international official functions there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to make a right option, bearing in mind that it is the only way for it to restore the confidence of the international community to settle its past crimes as early as possible.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The mineral substances are essential to the formation and function of insulin hormone, which is basic for glycolmetabolism. Therefore, the capsule helps pancreas form insulin and promotes the recovery of its function. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The capsule is also efficacious for cerebral thrombosis, arteriosclerosis and cancer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mineral yeast is essential to fat metabolism and cholesterol metabolism. It reduces hyperlipemia and thrombosis, promotes dissolution and evacuation of cholesterol and thus prevents arteriosclerosis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Medical institutions have applied the capsule to 120 type-2 diabetics. The test shows a remarkable improvement of their sugar and fat metabolism, decrease of cholesterol content, relaxation of arteriosclerosis and the return of most symptoms to normalcy. The efficacy of the mineral yeast is 77 percent.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
