And the progressive parties across the world put forward him as their honorary chairman.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his outstanding ideology and seasoned leadership, the WPK could be developed into a model party while demonstrating its prestige and dignity the world over.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The undying feats performed by Kim Jong Il in party building is being creditably carried forward by supreme leader Kim Jong Un."

Its final purpose is to launch a war against the DPRK once an opportunity presents itself and put the DPRK under its control by force of arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ever more desperate efforts to mount a preemptive attack upon the DPRK would only harden its will to bolster up its war deterrence in every way."
