A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK warned this in an answer given to the question put by KCNA Tuesday in connection with the joint military exercises launched by the U.S. in south Korea against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He went on: The U.S. kicked off the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises together with the south Korean military from August 20 despite the concern of the international community and the repeated warnings of the DPRK. These war maneuvers are a product of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK as they are targeted against the DPRK, to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceaseless saber-rattling being staged by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities against the DPRK, turning aside from their commitments to realize the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and peace there, compels the DPRK to suspect the real aim sought by them in their much-touted \"negotiated settlement of the issue\" and \"confidence-building\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready both for dialogue and confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a grave challenge to the DPRK, its dialogue partner, and war moves to bar the situation on the Korean Peninsula from improving and escalate military confrontation and tension. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The warmongers are keen to cover up the danger and provocative nature of the war exercises, asserting that they are \"computer mock exercises\" and \"annual drills.\" But these exercises are, to all intents and purposes, maneuvers for a war of aggression against the DPRK in the light of the background against which they were kicked off and the contents of the operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the U.S. seeks through the \"Ulji Focus Lens\" is to verify the effectiveness of the moves it has so far stepped up to bolster its aggression forces and reorganize them in terms of operation and round off combat command and operation system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is staging madcap \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises with huge forces and up-to-date war hardware involved though the DPRK and the U.S. are in the process of the six-party talks. This is clear evidence that the U.S. is making the start of a war against the north an established fact and working hard to carry out its scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. can never evade the responsibility for having strained the situation on the peninsula, swimming against the trend of the times quite contrary to its promise and deliberately thrown obstacles in the way of finding a solution to the nuclear issue and developing the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's participation in the exercises is an anachronistic behavior as it runs counter to the demand and interests common to the nation and requirements of the June 15 era of reunification and adversely affects the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace-loving DPRK will never remain a passive onlooker to the reckless moves of the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces to threaten peace on the peninsula and ignite a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to pay heed to the DPRK's warning and behave with discretion and stop at once the ongoing war exercises targeted against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Esto es una grave maniobra de guerra que frena la corriente de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana en rumbo favorable y agrava la confrontacion y tension militares, siendo un gran desafio a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Senala asi el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este martes y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los belicistas tratan de ocultar el caracter peligroso y provocativo de la citada maniobra militar pintandola de \"simulacro por computadora\" y \"entrenamiento anual\". Pero, tanto en su curso de comienzo como en su contenido operacional, \"Ulji Focus Lens\" apunta evidentemente a la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   El objetivo de ese ejercicio reside en revisar la efectividad del aumento y la reorganizacion operacional de las fuerzas agresoras, impulsados hasta la fecha, y perfeccionar el sistema de mando de combate y de operacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aunque EE.UU. dialoga con la RPDC en la cita a 6 bandas, no vacilo en desarrollar el simulacro \"Ulji Focus Lens\" movilizando a sus colosales fuerzas armadas y equipos belicos ultramodernos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Esto comprueba evidentemente que la provocacion de la guerra contra el Norte de Corea es un hecho consumado para el imperio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. nunca puede evadir la responsabilidad de haber agravado la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y frenado intencionalmente la solucion del problema nuclear y el desarrollo de las relaciones intercoreanas actuando con dos caras a contrapelo de la tendencia de la epoca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De otro lado, la adhesion del Sur de Corea a \"Ulji Focus Lens\" contraviene a la demanda y los intereses comunes de la nacion y a la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de junio y deviene un gesto anacronico que perjudica las relaciones Norte-Sur. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  La RPDC, que ama y aprecia la paz, no se quedara con brazos cruzados ante las imprudentes maniobras de EE.UU. y las fuerzas belicistas surcoreanas que amenazan la paz de la Peninsula Coreana y pretenden atizar el fuego de una guerra nuclear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe escuchar atentamente la advertencia de la RPDC y parar de inmediato ese ejercicio belico contra la segunda.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
