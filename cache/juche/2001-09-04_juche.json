Party of China and President of the People's Republic of China, made a speech at the banquet.\r\n We felt overwhelmed by warm feelings of Sino-DPRK friendship, accorded warm welcome by comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il, senior officials of the Korean party, government and army and many Pyongyangites as soon as we set our feet on the land of Korea, Jiang said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the afternoon I had excellent talks with comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This evening comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il gave a grand banquet here and made an enthusiastic speech replete with profound sentiment of the Korean party and people toward the Chinese party and people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Allow me to express here sincere thanks to comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il and the Korean party, government and people on behalf of the Chinese party, government and people and on my own behalf. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 11 years ago I visited your country at the invitation of comrade President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The visit left me unforgettable impressions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the last 11 years the Sino-DPRK friendship with a solid foundation has demonstrated strong vitality, standing ordeals of times and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the important juncture when humankind greeted the new century we are pleased to see that the Sino-DPRK friendship personally provided and developed by Chairman Mao Zedong, premier Zhou Enlai, comrade Deng Xiaoping and comrade President KimIil Sung is in fuller bloom thanks to the concerted efforts of the two sides of China and the DPRK and the cause of this friendship is being carried forward and further developed under the new historic conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peoples of China and Korea are delighted at this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the peace-loving countries and peoples of the world will hail this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the prosperity and development of the two countries and peace and stability in this region and the rest of the world in the new century the Chinese party, government and people, together with the Korean party, government and people, will promote the friendly and cooperative relations between the two parties and the two countries onto a new stage of development in the new century in the spirit of carrying forward the traditions, looking into the future, maintaining good neighborliness and friendship and strengthening cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n China will steadily develop the relations of good neighborliness and friendship and mutually beneficial cooperation not only with Korea, our friendly neighbor, but with all surrounding countries and achieve common prosperity and progress with them on the five principles of peaceful co-existence and other publicly recognized rules of international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The heroic Korean people are vigorously advancing along the road of Korean-style socialism confidently hewed by comrade President Kim Il Sung, overcoming difficulties in their way in the staunch fighting spirit under the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are very pleased to note that in recent years you have made fresh and excellent achievements in rehabilitating and developing the national economy, expanding external relations, improving inter-Korean relations and promoting the cause of the independent and peaceful reunification of the country and enjoyed ever deeper sympathy and understanding and ever warmer support and praise from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, your achievements were not easily made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are convinced that the industrious, courageous and resourceful Korean people will go along the road of development suited to the specific conditions of the country and continue to make fresh and greater success despite all difficulties in their advance, by displaying the spirit of self-reliance and hard work under the correct leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea headed by comrade General Secretary Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The future of Korea will surely be rosier and the Korean peninsula will certainly become more stable and prosperous. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Communist Party of China has covered the road of struggle spanning 80 years and has more than 64 million members. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history proves that without the CPC there would have been no new china nor great development and progress in 50 odd years in China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the new century china has entered the new stage of development to build a rich society on a full scale and accelerate the socialist modernization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party is faced with the three historic tasks to be fulfilled to continue to push ahead with the modernization, accomplish the cause of national reunification, defend global peace and promote joint development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If our party is to lead the times, always enjoying sincere support from the people of all ethnic groups across the country, and have its eternally solid foundation, it should consistently represent the development trend of China's advanced productive force, the orientation of China's advanced culture, and the fundamental interests of the overwhelming majority of the people in China. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is the fundamental requirement for us to ensure a continued innovation in theory, system and science and technology and achieve victory after victory in the building of socialism with Chinese characteristics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our party will work to pave its way and create things swimming with the trend of the times, rally and lead the people of all ethnic groups across the country, achieve the great prosperity of the Chinese nation, accomplish the sacred cause of the reunification of the country, and promote the noble cause of humankind for peace and development.    \r\n\r\n"

The U.S. is still watching for a chance to invade the DPRK with an ambition to dominate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a sisyphean effort for the U.S. with such history of wars of aggression to try to fish in troubled waters by taking advantage of Japan's distortion of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. acts of instigating and defending the Japanese reactionaries' moves to tamper with history only self-expose that it is a partner in the distortion of history.    \r\n\r\n"

It also reflects love as ardent as faith moving a mountain and unchangeable sense of obligation as he is fully responsible for their destiny and future.\r\n He showed unbounded trust and love for the unconverted long-term prisoners and took every possible measure for their repatriation.\r\n His noble comradeship became the source of their strength and courage and consolidated their faith and will a thousand times.\r\n The comradeship between the leader and his soldiers is the most beautiful, noblest and unchangeable love.\r\n The former unconverted long-term prisoners are true revolutionaries and comrades of Kim Jong Il as they have been loyal to him with conscience and sense of moral obligation.\r\n They, therefore, considered it as the highest morality and the noblest obligation to live up to the trust and love of the party and the leader with indomitable faith and conscience.\r\n They are possessors of the noble personality as they braved death to preserve their conscience and sense of obligation and thus remain loyal to Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\r\n Noting that comradeship serves as a slogan of faith and a banner of victory that should be held aloft forever, the article calls for cherishing absolute worship of Kim Jong Il and further strengthening the relations of revolutionary comradeship.\r\n We should struggle, deeming it as our primary duty to devotedly defend the leader like former unconverted long-term prisoners who protected Kim Jong Il's authority and dignity with their indomitable thought and faith and remain fighters in devotedly implementing his idea and intention, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
