It is their trite method to turn to a violent military attack if they fail to achieve their aim of aggression politically and diplomatically. Neither international law nor the UN can stop them. The imperialists regard small countries with weak armies as their targets of aggression. It is, therefore, the only way to cope with it to strengthen one's own army. Armed attack should be countered with arms. This alone can prevent one from being reduced to a slave and defend one's independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries with weak armies should strengthen them, the article says, calling on them to build independent national defence industry and develop it and build up modern defensive and offensive means.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n"
