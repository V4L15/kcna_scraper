This proved that it was nothing but a farce. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a true nature peculiar to the U.S. to spread sheer lies and interfere in the internal affairs of other countries and realize its attempt at aggression on their basis.\r\n A clear proof of this was the brigandish armed invasion launched by the Bush administration against Iraq on the basis of its false information. \r\n That was why the unbiased international public opinion dismissed the stories about \"smuggling of fake cigarettes\" and \"drug smuggling\" and the like spread by U.S. media as a stereo-typed lie faked up by the U.S. ruling quarters and is demanding the U.S. immediately lift sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. gimmick to mislead the public opinion by spreading more lies while defying such demand will never convince the international community.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Observes Day of Iranian People's Victory in Islamic Revolution\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 11 (KCNA) -- February 11 marks the 27th anniversary of the victory the Iranian people won in the Islamic revolution by overthrowing the pro-U.S. dictatorial regime through a nationwide uprising.\r\n On this occasion Rodong Sinmun Saturday carries a signed article.\r\n Recalling the fact that the Iranian people have defended the gains of the Islamic revolution under the uplifted banner of independence against imperialism and advanced along the road chosen by them, the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Iranian people's drive to carve out a new life is now facing the vicious obstruction of the imperialists to stifle the Islamic revolution in Iran. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and other Western forces are escalating their interference in the internal affairs of Iran and pressure upon it as never before, taking issue with its activities for the peaceful use of nuclear energy aiming at the socio-economic development of the country. Iran, however, is strongly reacting to them, not yielding to such moves.\r\n The Iranian president in a recent statement said that Iran would continue to maintain its line for acquiring nuclear technology for a peaceful purpose despite any threat and blackmail. Noting that international law and agreements have granted Iran the right to use nuclear technology for a peaceful purpose, he stated that Iran would never concede this right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., much upset by Iran's tough stand, has become undisguised in revealing its attempt to invade Iran by force of arms. To cope with it, Iran is bolstering its military capability for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The efforts of the Iranian government and people to defend the sovereignty of the country and national interests and develop economy and culture are commanding international support.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
