            "content": "Timely humanitarian appeal = KCNA commentary =\r\n Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- The World Food Program on July 2 appealed to the international community to render food assistance to the Democratic People's Republic of Korea before the harvesting season. Earlier, on June 22, U.S. civic relief organizations strongly urged the U.S. Government to immediately lift \"economic sanctions\" against the DPRK in mainly food, agricultural and health domains.\r\n   This is a timely humanitarian appeal based on a deep consideration of the DPRK's food and health conditions.\r\n   As was already reported, the WFP and the UN Food and Agriculture Organization sent a joint fact-finding group to the DPRK in June to get first-hand knowledge of its food problem.\r\n   The group toured the DPRK from June 2 to 12 and voiced deep concern that the total stock of food had exhausted and the country's food shortage would be further deteriorated in coming two months.\r\n   The U.S. civic organizations, through supply of humanitarian materials on several occasions, have learnt that the DPRK's food shortage is serious.\r\n   Suffering from years of natural disasters, many of the Korean people have lived with substitute food.\r\n   To make matters worse, agricultural production was heavily damaged by tidal waves on the east coast in early June and by a long spell of cold weather. And low temperature which persisted in the country from early spring made it hard to expect a harvest of wheat, barley and other early crops in the whole of the DPRK.\r\n   The appeal of the WFP and the U.S. civic organizations stemmed from such a serious situation and implies that the international community should pay deep concern to offering of humanitarian assistance to the DPRK.\r\n   The United States should, in  response to their humanitarian appeal, lift the unreasonable ban on the DPRK as early as possible for a wide-ranging assistance.\r\n   For the United States, to lift the ban on the DPRK is not only a humanitarian issue but what it is obliged to do under the DPRK-U.S. framework agreement.\r\n   The United States should show the international community its sincerity for the implementation of the framework agreement, thus making a tangible contribution to ensuring humanitarian food supply on a wider scale. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
