This is little short of a declaration of a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A military commentator declared this in his article entitled \"South Korean military authorities should behave with discretion\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We do not interpret the above-said outbursts as an accidental slip of tongue, the article noted, adding that what he cried out for fully represents the new policy of the present south Korean authorities towards the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The threat that the south Korean forces will make a \"preemptive strike\" at the nuclear bases of the compatriots is a manifestation of the political immaturity and military ignorance as he does not know how our nuclear weapons were manufactured and at what they are targeted. What he uttered is nothing but a servile attitude betraying the sycophancy and submission towards his master as the guy echoed his brigandish assertion in a bid to put it into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the light of the position of the south Korean military authorities the above-said outbursts are nothing but sheer nonsense and nothing surprising to us but the Korean People's Army cannot but clarify its principled stand as regards them as they represent the present south Korean authorities' new policy of the confrontation towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we have clarified more than once, a preemptive strike is by no means a monopoly of the one party on the Korean Peninsula where there goes on the state of neither war nor peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our revolutionary armed forces always keep themselves battle ready as they have followed all military moves of the south Korean forces with vigilance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will counter any slightest move for \"preemptive strikes\" at their nuclear bases with more rapid and more powerful preemptive strikes of their own mode. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the traditional method of counteraction and militant mettle peculiar to our revolutionary armed forces to return fire for fire and counter any hard-line step with the toughest measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army whose mission is to defend the socialist country under the banner of Songun will not remain an onlooker till the warmongers make a \"preemptive strike\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should bear in mind that once the more powerful preemptive strike of our own mode be launched, it will not merely plunge everything into flames but reduce it to ashes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the expected north-south dialogues will be totally suspended unless the south Korean military authorities clarify their stand to retract the outbursts calling for \"preemptive strike\" and apologize for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our consistent avowed stand that dialogue and war cannot go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is illogical to sit at the negotiating table with the party which unhesitatingly called for preemptive strikes after beefing up its aggressor forces for the provocation of a war and staging large- scale joint military exercises with outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing grave situation compels our revolutionary armed forces to take such a strong measure as strictly banning the passage of the south Korean authorities including military personnel through the Military Demarcation Line as an immediate step. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA has so far allowed the passage through the MDL which has remained tightly closed for the last more than half a century irrespective of persons from the stand to promote reconciliation and unity between compatriots and prosperity and interests common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But there is a limit to our tolerance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nothing is more foolish than to continue allowing those trigger-happy elements to enter our territory as they threaten to make no scruple of mounting a preemptive attack on us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities will be held wholly accountable for the serious impact the above-mentioned outbursts will have on the development of the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History showed more than once what a miserable end those who defied the demand of the times and the desire of the nation met. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities had better face up to the situation and behave with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a politically-motivated document as it is full of sheer lies and fabrications. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the anti-DPRK \"resolution\", the most vivid manifestation of the act of politicizing human rights, selectivity and double-standards, is to serve the political purpose of tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK and eliminating  its ideology and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"resolution\" is little short of paralyzing the universally accepted deliberation function of the council to handle the human rights situation in all countries on an equal footing as it calls for retaining the post of special rapporteur for an individual country, a leftover of the already defunct UN Human Rights Commission. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n 25 countries out of the 47 member nations of the council said no to the \"resolution.\" This fact goes to prove that the \"resolution\" lacks both impartiality and objectivity and its objective is also questionable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the human rights are concerned, blame should be laid on the U.S., the worst human rights abuser, as it has unhesitatingly committed aggression against sovereign states and massacred civilians there, on Japan which has evaded its responsibility for the past hideous crimes against humanity and on other Western countries plagued with all kinds of human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights precisely represent sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights are firmly guaranteed legally and institutionally in the Korean-style socialist society centered on popular masses, and its people fully enjoy genuine freedom and rights in all fabrics of social life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK sternly refutes the \"resolution\" as it is a product of the anti-DPRK political plot hatched by the EU and Japan at the prodding of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"resolution\" will only result in scuttling the cooperation between the UN Human Rights Council and the DPRK and aggravating their mistrust and confrontation and the U.S., the EU and Japan will be held fully accountable for all the unpredictable consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is set to increase the \"aid\" to this field in the future. This is, in actuality, nothing but a crafty trick to put military aggression on a par with economic plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through its active involvement in the African issues Japan seeks to increase its influence on the international arena and, furthermore, create an atmosphere favorable for its bid to sit on the UN Security Council. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan worked out a plan to open more embassies in Africa and is busy with the diplomatic offensive to win favor of its countries. This is prompted by its calculation that it would be impossible to attain its purpose without garnering support from those countries which have major votes in the UN. It is precisely for this reason that Japan is playing a sleight of hand to paint itself as a \"partner\" and \"helper\" of the African countries and win popularity among them under the signboards of \"scientific and technological diplomacy\" and \"economic aid.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
