The DPRK, therefore, never recognizes the \"office\" set up, pursuant to the \"resolution.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The DPRK vehemently condemns the ruckus of setting up the \"office\" in Seoul as another form of the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign launched by the hostile forces seized with the inveterate repugnance towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities have turned south Korea into a tundra of human rights by invoking the \"Security Law\" and other evil laws. It is the height of impudence for them to have taken the lead in setting up such \"office\", talking volumes about the \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey allowed the setting up of the \"office\" in Seoul though no country in the world dared do so. This is an anachronistic behavior and a grave provocation pushing the inter-Korean confrontation to an extreme phase contrary to the desire of all Koreans for improved inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that the \"office\" is no more than a center for gathering misinformation cooked up by \"defectors from the north\" and other riff-raffs to earn money as it is set to implement the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK from A to Z.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous, indeed, for the U.S. and other hostile forces to work hard to save the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign from bankruptcy by patronizing the human scum who eke out their living through false propaganda.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is no more than a daydream for them to try to do harm to the DPRK standing highly dignified for its independence and Songun by employing such base means and methods as setting up the \"office\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will decisively foil the reckless \"human rights\" racket against the DPRK through resolute toughest counteractions."
