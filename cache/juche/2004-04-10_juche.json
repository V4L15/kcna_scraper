            "content": "KCNA on U.S. Criminal Moves to Escalate Nuclear Stand-off\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The Korean Central News Agency Thursday issued an indictment accusing the U.S. of driving the military situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of a nuclear war by escalating the nuclear stand-off behind the scene of dialogue and pushing forward the \"strategy of preemptive nuclear attack\" at the phase of its implementation.\r\n The indictment cited historical facts that the DPRK has made every effort to solve the nuclear issue by singling out the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula as a general goal, taking the initiative of proposing constructive dialogue to realize it and putting forth the most fair and aboveboard proposals. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the Bush administration came to power in January 2001 it completely suspended the DPRK-U.S. dialogue that started in the period of the Clinton administration, deepening the nuclear crisis and extremely escalating the tensions on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the Bush administration insisted on the multiparty talks prompted by a sinister political purpose, dead-set against the DPRK-U.S. direct talks, the DPRK broadmindedly accepted its proposal to have the tripartite talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even when the U.S. proposed to have the six-way talks the DPRK expressed the readiness to accept it if the offer was prompted by the intention to express the will to make a switchover in its policy towards the DPRK and co-exist with it in peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the most important of the reasonable proposals the DPRK advanced for a solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue is a package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The head of the DPRK side at the first round of the six-way talks clarified the principle of implementing the measures to solve the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through simultaneous actions and set forth detailed formula for a package solution and rder for simultaneous actions to observe the principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side at the second round of the six-way talks held in Beijing from February 25 to 28 advanced a flexible proposal calling upon the U.S. to commit itself to\" drop its hostile policy towards the DPRK in return for its abandonment of the nuclear weapon rogram\" as a first-phase action and appealing to the parties concerned to make a due compensation by way of simultaneous actions in return for the DPRK's dismantlement of its nuclear weapon program on the principle of \"action for action\" as there was still no onfidence between the DPRK and the U.S. and it was impossible to agree upon the package solution based on the principle of simultaneous actions at one time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dialogue and negotiations for the solution to the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue suffered repeated setbacks due to the U.S. adamant insistence that the DPRK should abandon its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nOn June 6, 2001 Bush released a \"statement on the policy towards north Korea\" unilaterally demanding it \"accept an early nuclear inspection and reduce its conventional weapons,\" declaring the U.S. attempt to disarm the DPRK by forcing it to abandon its nuclear program first as a policy at last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. official moves to pressurize the DPRK to abandon its nuclear program first and its hostile acts to bring down its system have become more undisguised since Kelly, a special envoy of the U.S. president, visited the DPRK in early October 2002. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dispatched \"special envoys\" and \"delegations\" one after another to European and Asian countries according to its pre-arranged scenario in a bid to \"persuade\" the governments of the countries to bring the DPRK's \"nuclear issue\" to the UNSC. And it did not hesitate to perpetrate such an arrogant act as asking south Korea and other Northeast Asian countries not to improve relations with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. instigated the International Atomic Energy Agency to adopt two \"resolutions\" demanding the DPRK scrap its \"nuclear program\" in a verifiable manner on November 29, 2002, and on January 6, 2003. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first is the main obstacle in the way of solving the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. This was clearly proved by three rounds of talks held in Beijing last year and this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And even when the DPRK showed greatest magnanimity, advancing a broad-minded proposal for a simultaneous package solution to the nuclear issue at the tripartite talks and the first round of the six-way talks in Beijing last year, the U.S. demanded it disclose and abandon the non-existent \"enriched uranium program,\" pushing the talks to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well-known fact that the second round of the six-way talks held in Beijing last February proved fruitless due to the U.S. demand that the DPRK dismantle its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks the U.S. side did not show any will to make a switchover in its policy but repeated its assertion that the DPRK should abandon its nuclear program first, which had been rejected in the last talks. Furthermore, it made a senseless and far-fetched assertion that it may discuss other issues only after the DPRK completely scraps its nuclear program in a verifiable and irreversible manner, thus deliberately creating obstacles to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., which is technically at war with the DPRK, is accelerating the development of nukes, speeding up the moves to put the strategy of nuclear attack into practice and asking it to come out for negotiations only after scrapping its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is nothing but a brigandish demand that the DPRK unconditionally surrender to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be sadly mistaken if it, turning aside from the just demand of the DPRK, .thinks it will allow itself to be disarmed and gives up its system like Iraq, yielding to Washington's demand that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts proving the U.S. frantic moves to put the \"strategy of preemptive nuclear attack\" into practice in a bid to contain the DPRK with nukes, the indictment stressed: Now that the U.S. has completely scrapped the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework banning the use of nukes and the threat with them and steadily escalated its nuclear threat to the DPRK in a bid to provoke a nuclear war it is left with no option but to increase its deterrent force for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the DPRK's deterrent force to cope with the U.S. \"policy of strength,\" \"nuclear policy,\" a nuclear war would have already broken out on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Its powerful deterrent force guarantees peace on the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will bolster its deterrent force for self-defence unless the U.S. abandons its hostile policy towards the DPRK and stops escalating the nuclear stand-off behind the curtain of dialogue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Assails Japan's Moves to Establish MD\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Japan is zealously joining the U.S. in its moves to establish the missile defense system (MD), arousing concern among the international community and increasing the threat to peace and stability around the Korean peninsula and in the Asia-Pacific region.\r\n The Japan Defense Agency is busy with preparations for MD. It began its work to revise the \"law on the Self-Defense Forces\" after setting up a missile defense section in it. It is planning to submit the amendment to a plenary session of the Diet next year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then why Japan is getting so frantic in its moves to establish MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One can find here the inveterate bad habit of Japanese politicians. Their appearance is quite different from their real intention and they are adamant in justifying their wrong views and assertions and crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On December 19 last year when Japan decided to introduce MD, Chief Cabinet Secretary Fukuda made public a statement to the effect that MD is \"the only means without any alternative for defending the lives and properties of the people\" and conforms with \"the idea of exclusive security\" and \"does not pose any threat to neighbouring countries.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign Minister Kawaguchi, referring to the decision, said \"Japan intended to explain it to different countries around Japan\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is the need to explain it to neighbouring countries with so much zeal if MD is so vital and only means to defend Japan? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kyodo News reported that the chief executive of Japan said Japan should give other countries an impression that it is too weak to yield to a threat or lacks measures against aggression so that they may not think otherwise. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tells that the Japanese reactionaries' moves to establish MD are not aimed to defend the life of the people but assumes offensive and aggressive nature as they are designed to put surrounding countries under their control by force of arms under the pretext of a \"threat\" from someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their sophism intended to justify the unreasonable moves to establish MD is nothing but brigandish logic based on an anachronistic illusion as an assailant is painted as a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was no need to establish MD in Japan in the past and there is no need today, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the era of the East-West Cold War Japan steadily increased its military muscle while talking about the \"threat of the Soviet Union\" and was keen on \"economic growth\", styling itself an \"unsinkable aircraft carrier\" under the nuclear umbrella of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn those days modern military equipment such as missiles were deployed in surrounding countries but Japan did not openly talk about the establishment of MD to cope with the threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The real crisis in the Japanese society was not caused by any \"missile threat\" from outside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's reactionary and unpopular domestic and foreign policies including its policy of blindly toeing the U.S. line, its ultra-right politics, its moves to turn Japan into a military giant and its overseas expansion are posing a threat to its socio-political reality and future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's stepped-up moves to establish MD is chiefly aimed to seize the golden opportunity of realizing its ambition to turn itself into a military giant and overseas expansion at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, after the appearance of the Bush administration the U.S. unilaterally withdrew from the ABM treaty and is pushing forward the establishment of MD at a phase of implementation and plugging Japan into it. By availing itself of this opportunity, Japan seeks to establish MD and secure an unchallenged position as a military giant through the application of the U.S. \"preemptive attack\" doctrine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An immediate chief aim of Japan's moves to establish MD is to reduce to a dead document the present constitution, the largest hurdle in legalizing the policy of turning itself into a military giant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years Japan enacted a variety of laws related to war including the unconstitutional \"law on emergency\" in a bid to reduce the \"no-war article\" of the constitution to a dead document with the establishment of MD as a momentum. The right-wing reactionary forces of Japan took this as the golden opportunity of justifying the revival of militarism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan which drenched Korea and other Asian countries with blood, crying out for \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\", is resorting to such dangerous political and military adventure to become the \"leader in Asia\" with the U.S. backing once again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n History proves that there is no limit to Japan's ambition for aggression and recklessness as well as shamelessness and craftiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are pushing forward the introduction of MD under the pretext of defending \"peace and stability,\" clamouring for the protection of \"people's lives and properties\". This can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If peace and security of humankind are to be preserved, all the people of not only Korea and other Asian countries, victims of the war of aggression committed by Japan, but Japanese and the peace-loving peoples of other countries should never tolerate the moves of Japan to turn itself into a military power and its ambition for oversea expansion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an unpardonable challenge to the DPRK as it is another trick to cover up their crimes and their serious human rights situation and fan up the confrontation with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-DPRK smear campaign of the U.S. and the pro-U.S. conservative forces in south Korea over its non-existent \"human rights issue\" is intended to find fault with it in various aspects in a bid to stifle the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop at once such racket, bearing deep in mind that this will only reveal their despicable colors.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Kim Hyok, Cha Kwang Su and other young vanguard remained true to their leader with the undisputed confidence in him. Their transparent spirit of devotedly defending the leader shines more in the era of Songun through the annals of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogan \"Let us defend the headquarters of the revolution headed by the great Comrade Kim Jong Il at the cost of our lives!\" which has become the faith of the people across the country and the song \"We will defend the headquarters of revolution with our lives\" loudly reverberating throughout the country are run through with the spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As they regarded the noble spirit as the maxim of their life and struggle, the servicepersons and people could emerge victors in the confrontation to protect socialism, a war without gun reports, and work great miracles in the efforts to build a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution is based on the transparent viewpoint and stand that the destinies of the country and the revolution depend on the headquarters of the revolution and the revolutionary conscience and sense of obligation to repay the loving care and trust of their leader to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their faith, will and grit precisely are those based on their spirit of devotedly defending the headquarters of the revolution. No force on earth can match the strength of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK who are fighting with the fixed faith, will and grit, come what may.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With them, he started the twenty-year war against Japanese imperialism to achieve the historic cause of national liberation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He humbled the pride of the U.S. imperialists who had boasted of being victorious in their 110-odd big and small wars, safeguarded the dignity and sovereignty of the nation with honor and established a powerful socialist system centered on the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He had adhered to the army-first line all his life, basing himself on the truth that independence is unthinkable without arms, the state power and national pride are guaranteed by force of army and weakened national power results in people reducing into slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His arms-first idea has been carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has led the Korean revolution successfully with his unique Songun politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is fully displaying its might as the powerful nation of Juche and the fortress of socialism though the U.S. imperialists are pursuing the policy of strength, backed by military force, while overtly committing military terrorism against legitimate sovereign states and trying hard to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the rifles of revolution held fast by Kim Jong Il the Korean people are pushing ahead with the general march for building a great powerful socialist nation, overcoming all trials and difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The servicemen and people of the DPRK, firmly seizing rifles of justice, the symbol of victory provided by the Supreme Commander, will firmly defend the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
