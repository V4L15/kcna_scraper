Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' strong-arm policy is, in essence, an important part of their foreign policy for aggression aimed to dominate and put under their control the progressive countries, those countries not obedient to them, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are so shameless as to justify such aggression and intervention as encroaching upon and violating the sovereignty and vital rights of other countries under the pretext of \"justice of the international community\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The undisguised hegemonic and strong-arm policy pursued by them is causing such grave consequences as escalating the confrontation and tension in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their high-handed and strong-arm policy is strongly censured by the world for its reactionary nature and danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is paying a high price for having resorted to high-handed and arbitrary practices, assuming an air of importance in the international arena. Nobody but the U.S. is to blame for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an anachronistic dream for the U.S. to try to bring to its knees and dominate other countries through high-handed practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking back on history, all those who tried to conquer other countries through high-handed practices met a miserable end without exception. It was evidenced by the miserable end fascist Germany, Italy and Japan met for committing brutal aggression and war in the past century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same lot awaits the modern imperialists who are following in the footsteps of the aggressors in the past, oblivious of the lesson taught by history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Urged to Stop Seeking Cooperation in Pressurizing DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 5 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are these days becoming increasingly vociferous that the results of the \"elections\" in south Korea made it possible for Japan to exercise a great \"influence\" in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese political dwarfs seem to contend that the results of the \"elections\" in south Korea created an environment for increasing the pressure on the DPRK in cooperation with south Korea. This is, however, nothing but a narrow-minded way of thinking and a despicable behavior. Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the Japanese militarists to reinvade and dominate the Korean Peninsula and the Japanese reactionaries are preoccupied with this ambition, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogans of \"security\" and \"prosperity\" put up by the Japanese reactionaries are nothing but ones for aggression and plunder. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is imprudent for the Japanese reactionaries to rave that they would \"coordinate the six-party talks\" while talking about \"cooperation\" with south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"exercise of influence\" on their lips is no more than outcries that they would direct all efforts to increasing \"international pressure\" upon the DPRK in a bid to disturb the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are foolish enough to calculate that they can attain their sinister purpose by making U.S.-Japan-south Korea tri-angular system for cooperation in pressurizing the DPRK more realistic and workable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such poor scenario of the Japanese reactionaries would get them nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care who comes to power in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The persistent efforts on the part of Japan to realize cooperation in pressurizing the DPRK would only compel it to react to it more strongly.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "MINREX se refiere al proceso de ejecucion del acuerdo de 3 de octubre\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 5 de enero (ATCC) -- En relacion con la dilacion del proceso de implementacion del acuerdo logrado el 3 de octubre en las conversaciones a 6 bandas, el portavoz de la cancilleria de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea publico el dia 4 la siguiente declaracion: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya paso el 31 de diciembre de 2007, dia de vencimiento del plazo para el cumplimiento del acuerdo del 3 de octubre de las conversaciones a 6 partes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lamentablemente, esta pendiente la implementacion de los articulos acordados de dicho documento, excepto la neutralizacion de las instalaciones nucleares de nuestro pais. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esta labor comenzo a principios de noviembre del ano pasado y, como lo acordado, se llevaron a cabo hasta el 31 de diciembre los trabajos en la \"medida tecnicamente posible\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Como el ultimo proceso de ella, actualmente esta en marcha la extraccion de barras de combustible usadas, programada para casi 100 dias. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sin embargo, los demas paises participantes en la cita a 6 bandas no cumplieron ni a la mitad sus compromisos como el suministro a la RPDC de aceite pesado, equipos energeticos y materiales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Sigue demorandose el programa de entrega de aceite pesado para cada mes y sucede lo mismo en los procesos de trabajo para el ofrecimiento de equipos energeticos y materiales. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas no fue cumplido tampoco el compromiso de EE.UU. de tachar a la RPDC de la \"lista de los paises que apoyan al terrorismo\" y poner fin a la aplicacion contra ella de la \"ley de comercio con los paises hostiles\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En resumidas cuentas, entre las 6 bandas, la RPDC es la abanderada en el cumplimiento de los respectivos compromisos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nuestro pais tambien ha hecho efectivamente todo lo que tocaba hacer en cuanto al problema del aviso nuclear, del cual ultimamente se derivan comentarios erroneos en algunas partes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya en noviembre del ano pasado, elaboramos una nota de aviso nuclear y notificamos su contenido a la parte norteamericana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  A instancia de EE.UU., realizamos con este pais debates suficientes sobre el contenido del aviso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Puesto que la parte norteamericana planteo las \"sospechas\" de concentracion de uranio, a peticion de los estadounidenses, les dimos la prerrogativa de visitar algunas instalaciones militares en que se emplearon los tubos de aluminio importados y les facilitamos las muestras. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  De esta manera, les explicamos con sinceridad que los polemicos tubos de aluminio no tienen nada que ver con la concentracion de uranio. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En cuanto al rumor de cooperacion nuclear con Siria, dimos una respuesta al concretar ya en el texto del acuerdo del 3 de octubre nuestra promesa de \"no transferir las armas nucleares, las tecnologias y los conocimientos sobre esta esfera\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto fue tambien la medida que hemos tomado segun el consenso de un debate previo con la parte norteamericana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Todos los hechos muestran evidentemente donde estan ahora las causas de la dilacion del proceso de implementacion del acuerdo del 3 de octubre. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  En todos los acuerdos contraidos en las conversaciones a 6 bandas, inclusive la declaracion conjunta del 19 de septiembre, esta penetrado el principio de \"accion vs. accion\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ya que se demora el cumplimiento de los compromisos de los demas paises participantes, ultimamente, de acuerdo con el principio de \"accion vs. accion\", entra obligadamente en moderacion la velocidad de los trabajos de neutralizacion de nuestras instalaciones nucleares. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Nuestro pais sigue abrigando esperanza en que se cumplira satisfactoriamente el contencioso acuerdo si todos los paises hacen en conjunto sinceros esfuerzos ateniendose al principio de actuar simultaneamente.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
