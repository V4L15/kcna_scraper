The two countries are, accordingly, near-yet-distant countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Warming the DPRK-Japan relations would turn the century-long hostile ties between the two countries into those of reconciliation and cooperation. This process is in the interests of the two peoples and in favour of the development of the international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this point of view, the DPRK has consistently paid attention to improving the relations with Japan and worked hard to settle the humanitarian issues raised by Japan, prompted by the intention to make Japan a close and friendly neighbor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The two peoples and the fair world opinion deem it fortunate to see the resumption of the DPRK-Japan talks after many twists and turns and hope they will prove substantial and constructive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks should make progress and yield fruits to meet the expectation of the two peoples and the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Improving the DPRK-Japan relations means, in essence, developing new good-neighborly relations in the interests of the two peoples and in line with the need of the times on the basis of Japan's adequate settlement of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last decade saw various forms of talks held between the DPRK and Japan to establish diplomatic relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But these dialogues reached deadlock as they failed to focus on the issue of liquidation of past, the main issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The settlement of the past is a starting point and a master key to putting an end to the unhappy history of the relationship between the DPRK and Japan and warming the bilateral ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The solution of this issue would lead to a smooth settlement of other issues.\r\n The DPRK values good faith and keeps the promise once made. \r\n\r\n"
