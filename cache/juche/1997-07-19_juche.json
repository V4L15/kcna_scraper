Kim Jong Il sees art performance of sailors\r\n  Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) - Secretary Kim Jong Il, Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army (KPA), saw an art performance given by sailors of submarine no. 8003 of the KPA navy who had participated in the company art circle contest of the 26th KPA Art Festival.\r\n   The audience included KPA Vice Marshal Ri Ha Il, KPA generals Hyon Chol Hae and Pak Jae Gyong and other generals of the KPA.\r\n   The performers vividly represented the worthy life of sailors who defend the seas of the country reliably.\r\n   After seeing the art performance of valiant and courageous sailors, Secretary Kim Jong Il noted with great satisfaction that all the sailors of the submarine had grown to be invincible combatants and acquired high qualities of culture. He expressed high appreciation for their successful art performance.\r\n   He said that like the sailors of the submarine all the soldiers of the KPA had been fully prepared in military technique and politico-ideologically and equipped with strong ideology and faith. No force on earth can match the KPA soldiers, who readily go through thick and thin for the sake of the Party and leader, country and people, he added.\r\n   Vigorous cultural and art activities among soldiers are instrumental in increasing the combat capabilities of the units, he said, and gave important tasks to intensify art activities at platoons, companies and all other units.\r\n\r\n"

Koreans call for dissolution of \"ANSP\"\r\n Pyongyang, July 19 (KCNA) -- South Korean people criticise the defector Hwang Jang Yop for making anti-DPRK, anti-reunification remarks, the Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation reported.\r\n   Prof. Ri Jong Sik of Korea University was quoted as saying:\r\n   \"The defector Hwang Jang Yop at a 'press conference' July 10 made remarks getting on the nerves of the north and calling for inter-Korean confrontation on the script written by the 'Agency for National Security Planning' (ANSP), \"in his statement, Hwang said he had been crazy. He is more than crazy.\r\n   \"That is why as soon as he defected from north Korea, we south Korean people branded him as a trouble-maker who is harmful to inter-Korean relations and reunification and strongly urged the government authorities not to abuse his defection for Government security and inter-Korean confrontation.\r\n   \"Although the civilian-veiled regime of Kim Young Sam is using Hwang for Government security and confrontation with the north, it can never get rid of the crisis nor can it block the nation's desire for reunification. If the inter-Korean relations are to be improved and reunification to be promoted, such a trouble-maker as Hwang Jang Yop must be removed at an early date and the 'ANSP', the headquarters of conspiracy against the north, must be dissolved.\"\r\n   Ri Kyong Ho, a worker in Inchon city, had this to say:\r\n   \"Watching Hwang's 'press conference,' I could hardly repress resentment.\r\n   \"The 'ANSP' manipulated Hwang to say he had defected in the hope of preventing the north from invading the south. \r\nThis does not make any sense. What exists on the Korean Peninsula is not threat from the north but the danger of war against the north.\r\n   \"The Kim Young Sam regime is continuously importing sophisticated military hardware and holding large-scale military maneuvers every day to put into effect the war scenario against the north it has worked out with the United States.\r\n   \"We workers will never pardon not only Hwang but also Kim Young Sam and the 'ANSP' trying to unleash war after a smear campaign against the north.\"\r\n   Ri Yong Chol, a farmer in Ansong county, Kyonggi Province, after watching Hwang's \"press conference\" on television, said:\r\n   \"He slandered the north over food shortage and added he felt pity for the north, which he defected from. If he had been so worried about the people's livelihood, he would not have fled to south Korea, embezzling much public money.\r\n   \"He ceased to be a human being by betraying the fellow countrymen who were suffering from temporary difficulties caused by repeated floods.\r\n   \"I am told he had an affair with a girl in an alien country. He is disgusting, indeed.\r\n   \"We farmers regard Hwang's words as sophism of a dotard. \r\n   We have more hatred for Kim Young Sam, who is politically abusing Hwang for Government security. Both Hwang Jang Yop and Kim Young Sam are stray dogs we have to kill with sickles.\"\r\n   A third-year student surnamed son of Kyunghee University under the influence of the Seoul area federation of university student councils said:\r\n   \"The 'press conference' was very poor, though it was staged on the script and direction of the 'ANSP' after Hwang had been brainwashed at a secret place of the 'ANSP.\r\n   \"It had been prepared for two months, drawing attention at home and abroad, but it was like the dirge played by a dotard.\r\n   \"However long he had been prepared, he stammered and answered irrelevantly. He was disgusting to all.   \"He looked like an old parrot in a cage of the 'ANSP.'\r\n   \"We students will never pardon the 'ANSP,' which agitates for confrontation with the north on every occasion.\r\n   \"We have already declared war with the 'ANSP' and will explode it without fail.\r\n   \"We will continue our struggle until the 'ANSP' has been blasted.\" \r\n\r\n"
