Paektu area, is winning a great popularity among readers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The collection contains more than 100 poems out of many works created by shock brigade members in the days of construction. The poems reflect well their voices full of faith reverberated throughout the sacred land of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the lyric poems \"Native home in Mt. Paektu,\" \"Blizzards of four kilometer-long way\" and \"I am also youth of Mt. Paektu in the new generation\", one can read the boundless reverence of the shock brigade members for Kim Jong Il, the destiny of the country and the nation, and their unswerving faith to hold him in high esteem for ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the lyric \"Elder sisters, only ten minutes, please!\" touches the heartstrings of the readers. It impressively depicts the strong yearning of a young girl for the fatherly leader by ardently calling upon elder sisters not to wake her up only for ten minutes so that she may meet him at her working site even in dream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given in the collection are the poems \"We were born in the bosom of Paektu,\" \"March from Mt. Paektu continues,\" \"I am proud of my days in Mt. Paektu\" and \"Hymn of young people of Mt. Paektu\". They sing about the pride and self-confidence of the shock brigade members who are devoting themselves to building the sacred land of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They fully show the glory and happiness of the shock brigade members who have accumulated experience most precious in their life while working in the historical land of Mt. Paektu where the undying spirit and priceless traditions of the Kim Il Sung's nation have been established and are growing to be people of new type in the great Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are also the poem \"I am a 'sledge-hammer girl'\" depicting the joy of a girl, once a famous actress, who has become a widely-known innovator with a sledge-hammer and a poem \"Don't worry\" on the eldest \"uncle\" who does not make no concession in difficult work. These poems reflect mental state and experience of the shock brigade members with varied career, occupation and educational background. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The collection will convey long the immortal exploits of Kim Jong Il who has brought up all the servicepersons and people to be stalwarts with firm confidence and will, the makers of the great change and miracles and creators and enjoyers of the socialist culture. It thus becomes a genuine companion of the readers.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
