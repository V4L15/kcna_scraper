But he suddenly made a U-turn this year. He is running helter-skelter to gain public support, asserting \"economy and people's living constitute a top priority task\" and calling for \"people's unity and integration\" at various meetings such as \"meeting to start new year work\" chaired by him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He has worked hard to rally the conservative forces and win over more forces supportive of the regime by hyping \"security crisis.\" At the same time, he kept himself busy with diplomacy towards the U.S. as evidenced by his zealous support for the U.S. THAAD deployment and a phone conversation with the new U.S. president to please his master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Against this backdrop, the conservative forces seek to realize their stay in power at any cost by putting forward the guy seized with his wild ambition for power, calling for helping Hwang run for the \"presidency.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, Hwang, an arch criminal who deserves punishment by history, is running amuck to make the second Park Geun Hye regime appear by taking advantage of the impeachment trial in south Korea, not content with the office of the acting president.

He is a leading accomplice in the \"Park Geun Hye-Choe Sun Sil Scandal.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While working as a public prosecutor of the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office, section chief of the Supreme Prosecutor's Office and chief public prosecutor at the Pusan High Public Prosecutor's Office for 30 odd years, he had mercilessly suppressed the progressive pro-reunification forces by invoking the ill-famed \"Security Law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, Hwang took the lead in cooking up hideous conspiratorial cases at the instructions of Park when he was minister of Justice. It is well illustrated by the fact that he masterminded the operations to sweep under carpet the case of Intelligence Service's interference in the election and the case of Jong Yun Hoe's interference in \"state affairs\", cook up the spy case of a public worker in Seoul City, forcibly dissolve the Unified Progressive Party and check the probe into the truth behind the ferry \"Sewol\" disaster.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also took the lead in enforcing Park's country-selling policies like introduction of \"state-compiled history textbooks\", decision on THAAD deployment and the agreement on sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese army, which brought unbearable disgrace and humiliation to south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is natural that opposition parties and civic organizations of south Korea are strongly urging Hwang to make an apology and step down as early as possible, branding him as \"servant of Park's regime\" and the \"guy akin to Park.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Foolhardy are the conservatives of south Korea who have gone so foolish as to try to stay in power by pinning hope even on the top class accomplice forsaken by the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hwang would be well advised to go to jail with Park, aware of where he is standing."

She employs \"tactics\" of delaying the decision on her impeachment, running the whole gamut of sleight hand to overturn the trial and special investigation through dozens of witnesses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park was loud-mouthed about \"plots,\" jabbering that \"it seemed somebody planned it from long ago\" and \"the scandal is a high mountain of lies,\" far from making any reflection and apology for the extra-large political scandal. Meanwhile, Choe Sun Sil went the lengths of behaving so inanely as asserting \"false charge.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These ridiculous behaviors only touch off bitterer resentment among south Korean people from all walks of life at Park Geun Hye as they are nothing but last-ditch efforts of those criminals fear-stricken by the fast approaching severe punishment by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present no one can pardon or overlook the disgusting behavior of Park, disgrace and tragedy of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ruin of the Park Geun Hye group is the deserved punishment meted out to the top-class traitors by the people for having committed the thrice-cursed crimes against the people, the nation and reunification during their office.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Depending on outside forces, this group of traitors sold out the dignity and interests of the nation and brought the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse and blocked democratization of the south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In collusion with outsiders, they monopolized vested rights of the south Korean society and held privileged position and accumulated huge wealth by pursuing all sorts of unpopular policies. Owing to these pro-U.S. conservative forces, the whole society in south Korea has been thrown into unprecedented terror, instability and chaos and it is torn with such social and political disputes and violence as the \"system of introducing state-compiled history textbooks\" aiming at the revival of \"yusin\" dictatorship. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tragic end of the Park Geun Hye regime is the inevitable product of the corrupt political system of south Korea, the only U.S. colony of modern version on the earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prolongation of traitor Park's life would only deepen the social chaos and further deteriorate the people's living and bring unbearable pain to the south Korean people and all other Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The time to oust Park from Chongwadae is close at hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people from all walks of life out in the struggle to eliminate all social evils with candlelight of justice will never cease their actions till they attain their goals."
