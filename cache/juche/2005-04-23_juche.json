The Japanese reactionaries, therefore, attach great importance to their operation to grab Tok Islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves have rendered the situation on the Korean Peninsula tenser and resulted in building a structure of confrontation between the whole of Korea and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation requires all Koreans in the north and the south to shatter the Japanese militarists' moves for reinvasion through national cooperation. If all Koreans in the north, the south and overseas pool their ardent patriotic will, they can deal a deadly blow at the Japanese militarists who run amuck like a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger and force them to stop coveting Korea again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK take a serious view of the Japanese reactionaries' moves to grab Tok Islet as part of invasion of the inviolable land of Korea. If they dare spark a war of reinvasion against Korea the army and people of the DPRK will mobilize all military potentials built up so far and deal deadly blows at them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves to seize the islet will only drive Japan to a final ruin. They should keep this in mind and stop at once the robber-like moves to grab Tok Islet.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
