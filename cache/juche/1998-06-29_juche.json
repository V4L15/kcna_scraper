Korea's call for \"attraction of foreign capital\"\r\n Pyongyang, June 29 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today lays bare the true nature of the South Korean authorities' treacherous call for \"attraction of foreign capital.\"\r\n   In an article the daily says:\r\n   They are calling for \"globalization and internationalization\" of the economy. But their call is a sophism negating nation-state and national economy and a concept of treachery and dependence of modern version which will put the national economy and all other things belonging to the nation at the disposal of outsiders.\r\n   Obvious is the purpose of their call for \"globalization of the economy\" and \"removal of economic borders.\" They intend to cover up with rigmaroles such indelible crimes of theirs as reducing South Korea, a colonial military base of outsiders, also to their economic colony. Dependence on foreign countries is treachery which leads to national ruin.\r\n   Without eradication of treacherous acts in South Korea, its economy can never emerge from the serious crisis.\r\n   \"Attraction of foreign capital\" is what only those seeking dependence on foreign countries can talk about for the sake of their own interests.\r\n   Due to the introduction of foreign capital, the South Korean economy has gone to ruin and the people bled white. \r\n   In actuality, the bailout loan by the international financial bodies is not for relief but for exploitation.\r\n   \"Attraction of foreign capital\" will result in reducing South Korea to a complete economic colony, giving profits only to outsiders and deteriorating the political and economic confusion and crisis of South Korean society. \r\n   The South Korean puppets must stop resorting to the deceptive, foolish and treacherous call for \"attraction of foreign capital\" and refrain from such flunkeyist and treacherous acts as sacrificing the South Korean economy to outsiders' interest.    \r\n\r\n        \r\n\r\n"

It is also that the Korean issue can never be settled by military force though the United States and its junior allies are making desperate efforts.\r\n   The United States and the South Korean puppet clique must renounce their design for another war and show sincerity to the DPRK-proposed negotiations.\r\n   Korea's reunification will surely be achieved as planned by Kim Il Sung and as intended by Kim Jong Il.\r\n   Marshal of the former Soviet Union Dmitry Yazov, at the meeting, praised the Korean people's efforts for the building of socialism and national reunification and called for lifting up voices of support and solidarity for them.\r\n   A letter to General Kim Jong Il was adopted at the meeting.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

They built offensive positions in areas along the 38th parallel and amassed South Korean puppet army soldiers there.\r\n   On the U.S. order, the South Korean puppets moved divisions and regiments to the areas along the 38th parallel in May and June, 1950.\r\n   Thus, five divisions were deployed along the Military Demarcation Line as the first echelon and three divisions near Seoul as operational reserves.\r\n   The U.S. imperialists put their forces on  offensive footing so that they could be quickly hurled into the Korean War.\r\n   And they moved the Japan-based U.S. 24th and 7th divisions around port and airport and put them on the alert.\r\n   They also built naval and air force bases in Japan and on islands in the pacific, taking it into consideration that the U.S. mainland  is far off from the Korean peninsula.\r\n   They deployed many military planes and vessels on islands in the pacific.  \r\n   Besides, in February 1950, they attached an aircraft carrier, cruisers and destroyers to the U.S. 7th fleet, thus increasing the number of naval ships in the far east.\r\n   Concentrically deployed  in this region  were upwards of 12 flying wings including three wings of B-26s, B-29s and other bombers, six wings of fighter planes, two wings of transport planes and other military planes.\r\n   Having deployed aggression forces to attack the northern half of the DPRK, they blared that if they unleashed the Korean War, they could easily carry it out.\r\n   However, their attack was frustrated by the counteroffensive of the Korean People's Army from the very beginning of the Korean War.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
