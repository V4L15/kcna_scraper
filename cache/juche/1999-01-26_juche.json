            "content": "\"Method of strength\" is not almighty \r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 26 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of Defense William Cohen said on Jan. 20 that the U.S. mainland is exposed to \"missile threat from North Korea\" and that appropriation three times as much as the previous one would be allowed to the U.S. \"national missile defense\" program.\r\n   This shows that the moves of bellicose forces of the U.S. military to establish military domination over the whole world on the pretext of the DPRK's \"missile threat\" and stifle it with strength have reached the extreme pitch.\r\n   The U.S. \"national missile defense\" program has been braked by  the  Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty  signed with Russia. Thus, the treaty has been a nuisance to the U.S. bellicose forces who are seeking unlimited arms buildup.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They needed an excuse for killing the treaty and investing a colossal amount of military spending in preparations for a second Korean War. That is why they are spreading the rumour about the DPRK's \"missile threat.\"\r\n   It can not go unnoticed that such movements of the U.S. military  are timed to coincide with the fact that the danger of a nuclear war is rising on the Korean peninsula and that the formation of the U.S.-Japan-South Korea triangular military alliance is being completed.\r\n   As already reported, the U.S. military bosses flew to Japan and South Korea from the beginning of the year and busied themselves with building the military defense posture in the Asia-Pacific region on the basis of the triangular military alliance and finalizing a new \"security strategy\". \r\nDuring his stay, Cohen went so far as to openly declare that the second Korean war is a nuclear war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All facts show that the United States, having worked out a plan for the second Korean war, has entered the full-dressed practical stage. But the U.S. is mistaken. The U.S. bellicose elements think that if they establish the monopolistic domination militarily and wield nuclear weapons, everything will go as they intend, but theirs is a gross miscalculation.\r\n   We have made full preparations for any incident for scores of years.\r\n   If a war breaks out, the U.S. bellicose elements will not  defend themselves with anything, to say nothing of the \"missile defense\" program.\r\n\r\n"

And she urged the DPRK to stop missile production and export, laying stress on \"confidence\" in maintaining the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework. Her remarks are ridiculous and shameless.\r\n   It is evident that she is still foolishly judging that the trite method of \"the carrot and the stick\" may go down with the DPRK. It is also clear that the United States is still lost in the old dream of destroying the Korean socialist system with such a political weapon as \"appeasement and toughness\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We make clear our position once again. \r\n   We want peace but never beg for it, and do not want war,  but never fear it nor evade it.\r\n   If the United States imposes a war in this land again, we will never miss the opportunity to accomplish the cause of national reunification and remove the source of war totally.\r\n   The Korean people regard the socialist system they chose and have defended at the cost of their blood as life and soul and the DPRK will never allow any moves of encroaching upon its political sovereignty.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United states is shamelessly raising unilateral demands as to the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the issue of missile production and export. We regard it as a wanton violation of the independence of a sovereign state. \r\nConfidence is not kept unilaterally.\r\n   If the United States is truly interested in improved DPRK-U.S. relations and world peace, it should respect the DPRK's sovereignty and abandon its wild ambition to destroy the Korean socialist system. \r\n   \r\n"
