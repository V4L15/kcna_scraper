Instead, it hatched such plots as a \"Cheonan\" warship sinking case under the patronage of the U.S. imperialists to drive the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter how recklessly the Lee regime may try, it can never stem the trend of the history towards the reunification of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Ecuador－Guaranda Institute for Friendship and Cultural Solidarity with the Korean People in a statement on Oct. 3 said that the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration serve as the great programme for national reunification, indicative of the noble patriotic intention and devotion of leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said that the October 4 declaration is being fully supported by not only all the Korean people but the international community as it is an action programme for the June 15 joint declaration that reaffirms the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and clarifies concrete ways of achieving the lasting peace on the Korean Peninsula and developing the exchange and cooperation between the north and the south in all fields."
