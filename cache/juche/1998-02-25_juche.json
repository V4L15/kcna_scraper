Korea\r\n Pyongyang, February 25 (KCNA) -- The Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) on February 21 issued information about colorful functions held in South Korea on the occasion of the 56th birthday of General Secretary Kim Jong Il, according to the Seoul-based radio voice of national salvation.\r\n   The information said:\r\n   The NDFSK and other patriotic fighting organisations set a celebration period from February 5 to 20 and organised colorful functions in this period.\r\n   Meetings were held by the NDFSK organisations at all levels and patriotic fighting organisations.\r\n   The meeting sponsored by the NDFSK Central Committee on February 15 stressed that since he rose as the lodestar of Mt. Paektu, General Kim Jong Il has performed tremendous exploits and undying feats, which any other great men in the world could not, in the course of the Juche revolution to accomplish the cause of President Kim Il Sung, the sun of the nation.\r\n   Symposiums, lecture meetings, works and photo exhibitions and video shows on the greatness and undying exploits of the General were held in all parts of South Korea.\r\n   The speakers at the meetings said that in view of disparity between the north, a powerful and strong state with the Juche character and national character established, and the south, a colony, they more keenly realized only the General is the genuine leader whom the nation should look up to and follow and only his bosom will embrace all the members of the nation.\r\n   Missions of the NDFSK overseas sent congratulatory letters to the general, made public statements and held press conferences, lecture sessions and meetings with foreign political parties and organisations in celebration of the holiday of February.\r\n   The patriotic fighting organisations including the sun society, the February 16 fellowship society and the Paektu society pasted up wallpapers, wall newspapers, streamers and placards with the content of \"Congratulations to February 16, the greatest holiday of the nation,\" \"Long live General Kim Jong Il, glory and pride of the nation\" and so on in many places and distributed or scattered memorial postcards and leaflets with images of the three generals of Mt. Paektu.\r\n   The radio voice of national salvation and the newspaper Kuguk Jonson (National Salvation Front) reported special programs and carried special writeups and song societies including the north star and Meari gave performances with songs praising the General.\r\n   The significant celebrations of the General's 56th birthday as the greatest festival of the nation fully demonstrated the determination of the NDFSK and people from all walks of life to revere and follow him as the saviour of the nation.    \r\n  \r\n"

Their life was created in the period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle organized by President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   In the arduous period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle, the guerrillas lived optimistically with songs and dances around fire made with twigs and fallen leaves during the break in march and camping at night.\r\n   In the grim period of the fatherland liberation war, heroic soldiers of the Korean People's Army held even concerts on heights with musical instruments they made by themselves.\r\n   Inheriting this precious tradition, the Korean people live optimistically with confidence in victory of socialism.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

This is a brazenfaced lie. \r\n   The United States is trying to carry a \"two wars scenario\" into practice. The strategy seeks to unleash wars in the Persian Gulf and on the Korean Peninsula simultaneously. It is for the execution of the strategy that the United States is reinforcing its military presence in South Korea. \r\n   The reinforcement, however, is aggravating the situation on the peninsula and escalating the danger of war. So, we cannot but keep ourselves fully ready to cope with the dangerous military acts of the United States.\r\n   The United States must discontinue the criminal moves to reinforce its armed forces in south korea and unleash a new war by taking issue with us groundlessly.    \r\n\r\n"

He spoke highly of the workers and other people in the province who built many minor power stations to solve the electricity problem for themselves. He went on to say that electrification means the use of electricity for household utensils including lighting, heating and cooking. He called upon the province to take the lead in the powerful struggle for electrification of the country.\r\n   When he dropped in at a factory, he was told that the workers of the factory made an automatic assembly line by their own efforts. He said the factory had nothing foreign-made, the assembly line is a product of self-reliance and automation was very nice.\r\n   Going round some factories and enterprises and electricity-heated houses in the province, he said that from now on Jagang Province would make a happy march, not \"the arduous march\".\r\n   Chief Secretary Yon Hyong Muk of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK said the province would complete the building of 58 minor power stations this year and  many counties would attain self-sufficiency in electricity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
