            "content": "Dangerous U.S.-Japan military nexus flailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- Japan and the United States reiterated the importance of strengthening \"Japan-U.S. Security Alliance\" at recent talks held between the Japanese senior diplomat and the President and the State Secretary of the U.S. the Japan Defense Agency is trying to establish a \"working officials consultative council\" under the military authorities of Japan and the U.S. while underscoring the \"need for closer coordination\" with the U.S. Defense  Department.\r\n Describing this as a highly disturbing development, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says that the strengthened Japan-U.S. alliance called for by the U.S. and Japan means tightening the military nexus between the two countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that by strengthening the military tie-up with the U.S. Japan seeks to emerge as a military power with the backing of the U.S. and openly embark upon overseas aggression, the commentary continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is employing a crafty trick to increase the combat capability of its \"self-defense forces\" and lay a legal \"groundwork\" for overseas aggression, while talking about strengthened alliance and \"defence cooperation\" with the U.S. these can not be construed otherwise than very dangerous military moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are taking great pains to realise their ambition to become a military power backed by the U.S. and realise their old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.\" It is the U.S. intention to realise its aggressive strategy toward Asia with Japan as a war servant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The military nexus between Japan and the U.S. is primarily targeted against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their sinister intention to invade other Asian countries with the Korean peninsula as a springboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nexus is very detrimental to peace, security and prosperity of the Asia-Pacific region. \r\n The Asian people should be vigilant against the U.S.-Japan military nexus aimed at aggression and war and make efforts to curb it so as to prevent horrible disasters.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Kim Jong Il's political career praised in Russia \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- The 25th issue of theRrussian newspaper Duel carried an article entitled \"Leader Kim Jong Il's Century\".\r\n In the article the paper said that Kim Jong Il, leader of the DPRK, has rich political experience equivalent to that gained by any other country in one century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Praising him as the most experienced statesman ever in the world, the article further said: \r\n He was in his twenties when he graduated from Kim Il Sung University. This means that he has been totally dedicated to his service at several posts of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During his political career he acquired such rich political experience as gained by other countries in one whole country because none of them experienced such total economic blockade, aggression and constant military and political provocation as the DPRK did. It is by no means an overstated expression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Especially, the years of his revolutionary activities were the days of so grim political struggle that no slightest  mistake was allowed to happen as was the case with the great President Kim Il Sung of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If he had once made a mistake, big or small, socialist Korea today would have already ceased to exist. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the middle of the 1970s the DPRK built socialism guided by the Juche idea, following an ideologically independent line, not pursuant to the line of the central committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union which styled itself a leader of the international socialist movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those countries which did not depend on their own strength, scoffing at the DPRK's independent political line, collapsed with the CPSU, but the DPRK is still standing up and growing stronger politically and economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Putting many achievements made in scores of years of Kim Jong Il's political activity together, one can say that he established in Korea an innovative political system whereby to unite the leader, the party and the people as one socio-political organism and thus the DPRK is advancing forward.    \r\n\r\n"
