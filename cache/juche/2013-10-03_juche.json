All-Korean Committee will give strong impetus to the\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\treunification movement of Koreans at home and abroad and further increase its responsibility and role in the struggle for paving a wide avenue for peace and reunification of the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All-Korean Committee will firmly join hands with all political parties, organizations and personages supporting the north-south joint declarations and vigorously press ahead with the nationwide movement for implementing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All-Korean Committee will resume contacts and pro-reunification events between people of various strata including workers, farmers, youth and students and women and organizations in various fields to make the fervor to implement the joint declarations grow strong wherever Koreans live."

Ademas, en su discurso de la ocasion pronuncio disparates calumniantes a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecificamente, dijo que el \"Norte comprendera por si solo que no le serviran mas las armas nucleares y misiles\" y que \"procurara el fuerte disuasivo anti-Norte hasta que este deponga sus armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn otra parte del discurso, \"prometio conducir al Norte de Corea al camino de verdadero cambio\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, en su \"discurso conmemorativo\" del 60o aniversario de la alianza con Estados Unidos pronunciado un dia antes, dijo que es una \"ilusion\" el esfuerzo del Norte por fortalecer las fuerzas armadas nucleares y el \"cambio y apertura constituyen la unica via de supervivencia\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos dichos de ella y las palabras similares, que pronuncian estos dias por turno las cabecillas de la camarilla conservadora surcoreana, constituyen una intolerable provocacion a la RPDC y desafio frontal a los esfuerzos de esta por el dialogo y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa mandataria surcoreana cuestiona unicamente el disuasivo nuclear de la RPDC para la autodefensa haciendo vista gorda de las armas nucleares norteamericanas para la agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste hecho deja conocer que ella es sirvienta de EE.UU. y fanatica de enfrentamiento fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSus disparates parten de su estupida intencion de lograr el desarme del Norte y agredirlo en connivencia con el imperio yanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tElla menciona tambien el \"cambio\" de la RPDC con la intencion de lograr la \"unificacion mediante la absorcion\" suprimiendo la idea y regimen de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio norteamericano y la horda titere son los que deben cambiarse y ser condenados hoy por el problema nuclear de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn vez de hablar de esa manera, ella debe portarse con juicio conociendo por que la RPDC llego a poseer las armas nucleares y como el pueblo coreano se esfuerza para cumplir su grandioso proyecto y meta bajo la direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY debe parar su necia jugada para obtener algo mediante la confrontacion fratricida y la campana de guerra de agresion al Norte en complicidad de su amo gringo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi ella sigue hablando en tono provocativo desoyendo la advertencia de la RPDC, correra el destino vergonzoso al igual que su antecesor, el traidor Lee Myung Bak."
