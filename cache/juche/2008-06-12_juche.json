This has bedeviled the inter-Korean relations that have so far favorably developed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The traitorous group is working hard to bring back the old confrontational era while negating the June 15 joint declaration under the watchword of \"no nukes, opening and 3,000 dollars\" based on \"pragmatism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They raved that reunification based on June 15 joint declaration should never be allowed while terming the idea of \"By our nation itself\" \"narrow-minded nationalism\" and \"exclusionist nationalism.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group made public a \"2008 basic plan for education in the issue of unification\" and decided to use anti-reunification teaching materials, saying that \"education in the issue of unification\" in the past embellished the north and weakened the concept of principal enemy because it was based on the joint declaration. They even arrested progressive pro-reunification educationists on charges of giving the \"June 15 joint lecture\" and illegally searched their houses and school. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In early May they pressurized the Press Headquarters of the South Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration to sign a \"paper\" giving assurances that it \"would not make any speech or conduct any act of favoring the north's political agitation and assertions\" before attending the conference of representatives of mediapersons from the north and the south, thus sparking off big public furor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee group has harshly suppressed the south Koreans from all walks of life in their struggle for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They invoked the \"National Security Law\" to prevent the representatives of youth organizations of south Korea from participating in the conference of representatives of youth and students organizations in the north and the south held in Mt. Kumgang resort, thus scuttling the inter-Korean joint event for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  This is the true colors of the Lee group of traitors keen on inciting confrontation, not seeking national reconciliation and unity, displeased with the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the true intention of the traitor to scrap the June 15 joint declaration and bedevil the north-south relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The negation of the June 15 joint declaration which replaced the north-south confrontational era that lasted for more than half a century after the national division by the era of national reconciliation and unity and independent reunification is little short of a treacherous and anti-reunification act of bringing a new confrontational era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The uniform development of the nation can never be expected as long as such traitor as Lee remains in office.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a legal and moral commitment Japan should fulfill before the times and history to redress its crime-woven past, as it inflicted immeasurable misfortune and pain upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's crime-woven past history should be settled and the Korean nation should force Japan to pay for its past crimes at any cost with towering hatred against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle of the Korean nation to force Japan to settle its past crimes is a just patriotic struggle to defend the national dignity and sovereignty and disallow the shameful history to repeat itself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will neither allow the Japanese reactionaries to realize their anachronistic ambition for reinvasion nor tolerate any move of the Lee Myung Bak group subservient to them but surely usher in the new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity through the nationwide struggle for independence against outsiders.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, at the same time, a manifestation of their strong will to regain the sovereignty and the right to existence usurped by foreign forces by the efforts of the people at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration called on the people to intensify the candlelight actions till the regime yields to them and thus trigger off the second June popular resistance and bring traitor Lee Myung Bak to final ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unless an end is put to the U.S. domination and interference in south Korean affairs it is impossible for the people to get rid of the tragic reality in which such pro-U.S. traitors as the Lee Myung Bak group are strutting about and selling off the interests of the nation and the people, the declaration said, calling on the people in various parts of south Korea to raise angry voices condemning the U.S. reckless war exercises for invasion of the north and demanding the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea and removal of the U.S. military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also appealed to the people to vehemently condemn the Lee group for their dastardly perfidious act of negating the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and usher in a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
