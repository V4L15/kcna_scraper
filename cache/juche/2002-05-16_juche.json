It is because the present U.S. administration is a political swindler in service of big munition monopolies and all of the U.S. foreign and domestic policies have been worked out and carried out to meet their interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration seeks to bring huge profits to those monopolies through the establishment of the multi-purpose missile defence system, the development of new types of nuclear weapons and the massive production of arms and expects them to create an environment favorable for its stay in power and provide a huge amount of political fund to it in reward. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this reason the U.S. ruling quarters made no scruple of listing other countries as \"rogue states,\" \"sponsors of terrorism\" and the \"axis of evil\" while committing armed sparking intervention in different parts of the world after deliberately sparking regional crises and rendering the international political and military situation tense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n this clearly proves that the u.s. loudmouthed \"global peace and stability\" are nothing but sheer lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also prompted by its aggressive nature that it is instigating the South Korean hawkish forces to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula and forcing South Korea to buy a lot of F-15K fighters and other military hardware by persistently spreading the rumor of \"military threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts go to eloquently prove that the global peace and stability are seriously threatened by none other than the U.S.\r\n"

The white house has won ill-fame as a headquarters for terrorism, the defense department and the central intelligence agency as institutions carrying out terrorism and munition monopolies as a base for the production of weapons for terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The true nature of the U.S. as the kingpin of terrorism has been brought into bolder relief in state-sponsored terrorism and military terrorism committed by it on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than one million civilians were mercilessly killed in South Korea by the U.S. in the period from September 1945 to June 25, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period of the June 25 war millions of civilians were killed as victims of military terrorism in the south alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mass killings committed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors in the northern part in the period of temporary occupation were most hideous in the method and scale involved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They brought ship no. \"1091\" for bacteriological experiment to the waters near Koje Island and conducted experiments on human bodies of pows of the Korean People's Army more than 3,000 times every day. This was the most monstrous military terrorism in history in its method and scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. frantically perpetrated unprecedented terrorism including military coups and mass killings in a bid to keep the colonial rule over South Korea after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. foreign policy is characterized by brutal state-sponsored terrorism and military terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has been engrossed in assassinations, military coups and acts of military aggression to overthrow and dominate independent and developing countries. It is the kingpin of international terrorism as it has committed ceaseless armed invasion to dominate the countries that go against the grain with it and the countries of strategic importance which it considers necessary for dominating any region and meeting its interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the strongest supporter to terrorism in the world as it provides strong patronage and backing to international terrorists. The U.S. is well advised to admit its existence as a kingpin of terrorism and stop all forms of terrorism at once.\r\n\r\n"
