As a result, it turned into a huge modern and comprehensive chemical producer having inorganic and organic, high polymer and precision organic chemistry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A dramatic change in the vinalon industry is the shining fruition of the wise leadership of the great Workers' Party of Korea and the drive of the working people in South Hamgyong Province who regard the party's decision as immutable truth and devotedly implement it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t General Secretary Kim Jong Il's field guidance to the complex in the hottest period of summer in 2007 marked an event of historic turning point as it injected energy into the Juche vinalon industry. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An all-out drive was waged to update the processes of vinalon intermediate products and on this basis newly build processes for the production of vinalon and chemical products at the complex which had been at standstill during the Arduous March, forced march. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The updating of the processes for vinalon intermediate products including aldehyde, acetic acid and plasticizer processes was completed in a matter of a little over six months. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The vinalon production process, which would have taken more than a decade, was newly built on the basis of latest science and technology in a matter of two years. It again began the vinalon production from February of 2010, 16 years later. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the wake of the completion of the modern vinalon factory last year, the complex kicked off another all-out drive to increase the production capacity while hastening the vinalon production since March last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The production capacity of horizontal spinning process is several times higher than that of the already completed vertical spinning process. The complex built a horizontal spinning process and the production process of short fiber and pushed ahead with the project for rounding off the leading vinalon production processes including Korean-style cyclic boiler, air-tight carbide electric furnace and the rod-coal production process. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The old production sites covering a large area are no longer to be seen and there appeared instead the horizontal spinning shop and fiber shop production processes and buildings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There also sprang up cyclic boilers which no longer require complicated pulverizing system and ensure high combustion efficiency under any fuel conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The construction of the air-tight carbide electric furnace, the production process of rod-coal and the lime kiln went full steam ahead. Successes were made in the researches to update overall production processes including the improvement of the quality of vinalon at a high level. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rapid progress made in the construction of settling ponds helped satisfactorily solve the issue of industrial water. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These signal changes prove that the potential of the self-supporting socialist economy is tremendous and the building of an economic power is sure to succeed despite all the moves of the imperialists to stifle the DPRK and the ideal of its people to come true."

It was again in that province that Kim Jong Il, destiny of the country, wore a safety helmet and went down twice to the pit where water was dropping from its ceiling.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of the province with pure and strong hearts were united to uphold Kim Jong Il, launching an indefatigable labor drive. This developed into raging flames hotter than lava. This unusual loyalty and the inexhaustible might of single-minded unity of the population of the province stirred up the whole country in October.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The centenary of birth of President Kim Il Sung, a great auspicious event in the nation's history, is close at hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let's fling open at a breath the gate to victory in the spirit, work style and fighting traits of the people of the above-said province!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the call of the party and country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the response of all the people to emerge victorious as befitting the descendants of Kim Il Sung's nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The people of South Hamgyong Province never yield to any trial but make persevering efforts to unconditionally carry out whatever difficult work. This spirit and executive ability are their traits and mettle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They demonstrated in practice that Korea does what it determines to do and proved that this represents the national identity and traits of Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is on the track of sure victory and even this hour witnesses fresh fruits of creativity and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will steadily advance and always emerge victorious according to its timetable no matter what difficulties lie before it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Let the flames in the province flare up with greater force!"
