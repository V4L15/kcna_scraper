            "content": "DPRK FM Clarifies Principled Stand on Int'l Law \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- DPRK Foreign Minister Ri Su Yong made a speech at the 53rd Session of the Asian African Legal Consultative Organization (AALCO) on September 15. \n\t\t\t\t\t He said AALCO has made untiring devotion to the work for representing the interests of its member nations and establishing a fair international legitimate order in the international law arena. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his speech he clarified the principled stand of the DPRK Government on some major issues tabled to the 53rd Session as deliberated item:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the DPR of Korea considers that invoking one's national legislation to impose sanctions on and blockade against a few select states which have different social system is a gross violation running against universal principles of international law which stipulated respect for sovereignty and non-interference in the internal affairs, equality and mutual benefits and guarantee of the freedom of nations in selecting a social system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the last several decades, the U.S. has applied different kinds of sanctions to my country invoking tens of acts of sanctions. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such an immoral conduct is rooted in pursuing its political aim to stamp out our idea and social system being fueled by sickening feelings of negation and physical antipathy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, the DPR of Korea maintains its stand that the UN Security Council resolutions should not be used as a basis for a legislation meant for extraterritorial application by a certain state against another state which has a differing ideology and social system. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has abused the Security Council resolutions and, basing itself on it, applied sanctions against my country and let third countries follow the resolutions, thus negating outrageously the right of our people to development. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All this vividly illustrates that Security Council resolutions catering only for the interests of some big powers in disregard of those of the states concerned are neither in conformity with the demand of the present era for peace and freedom, progress and development nor in line with the UN Charter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the DPR of Korea maintains consistently the stand of opposing with all vehemence all kinds of violent extremism and terrorism as well as any other support for them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We fully support the efforts to create a comprehensive international legal system to oppose violent extremism and terrorism and would actively cooperate for an effective measure."

            "content": "Guinean Organization Discloses U.S. Aim at Permanent Presence of Its Forces in S. Korea\r\n Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- The Guinea-Korea Friendship Association released a bulletin on Sept. 8, 69 years since the U.S. forces occupied south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t The bulletin in an article titled \"Why are the U.S. forces present in south Korea\" said that the U.S. forces illegally occupied south Korea on Sept. 8, 1945, nearly seven decades ago and they still remain in south Korea, querying why do they stay in south Korea though it is not their land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In articles subtitled \"Results of hegemonic ambition\", \"Illegal occupation\" the bulletin cited facts that after illegally hurling its troops into south Korea under the pretext of \"disarming\" the defeated Japanese army, the U.S. long eyed the Korean peninsula, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another article sub-titled \"Trick for permanent troop presence\" said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. used the puppet government of Syngman Rhee of south Korea to justify the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the ceasefire in the last Korean War the U.S. has steadily reinforced its troops present in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has not implemented the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly calling for disbanding the \"UN Command\" and forcing all foreign forces present in south Korea under the UN flag to withdraw from it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the justification for the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea worked no longer after the demise of the Cold War era and the collapse of the Soviet Union, the U.S. began noisily talking about \"threat from north Korea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ceaselessly stages an adventurous test nuclear war and preliminary war against the DPRK, rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula extremely tense. This is aimed at the permanent presence of its troops in south Korea."
