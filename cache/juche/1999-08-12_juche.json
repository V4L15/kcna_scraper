He put forward a task to build the integrated farm into a model farm in a short period where a comprehensive mechanization has been fully realized. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Going round the research rooms and experimental plots of the potato institute of the Academy of Agricultural Science, he underscored the need for the scientists to breed more high-quality seeds suited to the climatic and topographical conditions of the country and give in time solutions to all the technical problems in potato cultivation.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called at houses of discharged soldiers of the branch farm and took warm care of their living. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He extended his warm greetings to all of the 1,000 discharged soldiers who volunteered to work in Taehongdan, saying that they are true revolutionaries and ardent patriots who performed brilliant feats at the posts for defending the country yesterday and are now devoting themselves to realizing the party's intention in the countryside. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He then gave on-site guidance to the Mubong workers district in Samjiyon county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After acquainting himself in detail with the community electrification the workers district has realized by building minor power stations by its own efforts, he called upon all the units to follow the example of the district. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He was accompanied by Kim Kuk Thae and Kim Yong Sun, secretaries of the WPK Central Committee, and Jang Song Thaek, first vice department director of the party central committee. \r\n\r\n"

If they tell us they are ready to discuss the U.S. troop pullout and the conclusion of a peace agreement between the DPRK and the U.S., we will readily respond irrespective of place and time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   At the talks, our side proposed discussing the U.S. troop pullout from South Korea and the conclusion of a peace agreement between the two countries. The U.S. side, however, paid a deaf ear to our fair and aboveboard demand and pursued sinister purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   And the U.S., stepping backward far from its former position, insisted that the U.S. troop pullout cannot be discussed at the talks and that the peace agreement should be concluded between the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent and previous rounds of talks convinced us that the U.S. is not willing to preserve peace and security on the Korean peninsula and is trying to use the four-way talks as an expedient for executing its policy of stifling the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This time, the DPRK and the U.S. had a bilateral meeting to exchange views on pending issues. At the meeting, we reiterated our position that the launch of a satellite or a missile belongs to the sovereignty of an independent state and can never be a matter of discussion with anyone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no change in our principled position to achieve peace and security on the Korean peninsula through dialogue and negotiation. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Reports at international forum\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, August 12 (KCNA) -- A keynote report and supplementary report were made at the \"international forum calling for the demolition of the concrete wall\" which was open here today.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Paulette Pierson, vice-chairperson  of the International Liaison Committee for Reunification and Peace in Korea, in her keynote report mentioned the political background against which the concrete wall  was built in the area south of the military demarcation line on the Korean peninsula and the concrete tasks to demolish it at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After the publication of the July 4 north-south joint statement in Korea, the United States brought forward the so-called \"cross recognition\" concept intended to fix the existence of \"two Koreas\" on world arena and worked hard to justify the division of Korea internationally, she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   She continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities did not conceal from the very beginning of the building of the concrete wall that it was aimed at perpetuating the division of the peninsula and escalating the confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the outset of its project it became a target of protest and denunciation from all the Korean people and broad public circles for its criminal nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Laying bare the reason why the South Korean authorities have not pulled down the concrete wall so far, the reporter stressed: this is because their \"two Koreas\" policy remains unchanged and they have no willingness for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Clear is that neither improvement of inter-Korean relations nor  progress in the reunification cause can be expected  as long as all the political and legal barriers blocking the reunification including the concrete wall are left intact.  In view of the present state of the reunification cause, the new proposal for dialogue  advanced by the joint meeting of the government, political parties and organizations of the DPRK last February carries weighty significance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This reasonable proposal calls for abrogating the \"cooperation\" of the South Korean authorities with outside forces, stopping their joint military exercises, abolishing the anti-reunification \"National Security Law\", ensuring the free reunification movement and activities of the pro-reunification patriotic organizations and figures and, on this basis, holding the inter-Korean high-level political talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The overture on implementing the priorities to remove a obstacle block in the way of dialogue has evoked  sympathy inside and outside Korea as it fully reflected the stand to make the inter-Korean dialogue a fruitful one for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean authorities truly want to hold a dialogue for reunification, there is neither pretext nor conditions for them to refuse to implement the priorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut their attitude toward this greatly disappointed the world public aspiring after the reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is an urgent task of the times facing the world's peace- and justice-loving progressive public and peaceloving people today to extend positive support and solidarity to the sincere efforts of the DPRK to prevent an outbreak of a new war in Korea and create a favourable atmosphere for peace and reunification . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of great national unity put forward by the great leaders of the Korean people President Kim Il Sung and Marshal Kim Jong Il are a  most realistic, reasonable  and just program to achieve the reunification of Korea most smoothly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should  undertake a more widespread and more dynamic international solidarity movement to support the Korean people in their struggle to reunify the country in accordance with the three charters of national reunification and the five-point policy of great national unity and, at the same time, launch more vigorous international activities to expose and denounce the criminal moves of the outside forces and the South Korean authorities to perpetuate the division of Korea and aggravate the confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Mun Jae Chol, chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with World People, made a supplementary report at the forum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He said that the crime the South Korean authorities  committed by building  the concrete wall rare to be seen in the world under the patronage of the outside forces and bisecting the territory of the country into two can never be justified and tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They not only  built a physical barrier  to keep Korea divided into the north and south but have ruthlessly cracked down upon the struggle of the South Korean people for independence, democracy and reunification by invoking the \"National Security Law\" and many other fascist laws and mechanism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If they truly value the destiny of the country and the nation, they should stop peddling such empty words as \"sunshine\" and \"engagement\" and going against the South Korean people's will for reunification and remove all the political, legal and physical barriers and make a policy switchover to reunification and patriotism, alliance and reconciliation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States is wholly to blame for the policy of division and confrontation invariably pursued by the South Korean authorities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. truly respects the desire of the Korean nation for reunification and wants peace on the Korean peninsula, it should discard the old concept in the era of the cold war, drop the anachronistic Korea policy, withdraw its forces from South Korea and  refrain from doing anything obstructive to the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialist and dominationist act of sacrificing the interests of other countries and nations for the sake of one's own interests should no longer be tolerated but be strongly condemned by the international community.  \r\n\r\n"
