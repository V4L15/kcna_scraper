Since July 13 it has escalated the ground forces' attack. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Israeli military attacks have so far claimed about 1 000 lives of Palestinians in Gaza Strip and leveled hundreds of public buildings and dwelling houses to the ground.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We bitterly denounce Israel's brutal killings of many defenseless Palestinians through indiscriminate military attacks on peaceable residential areas in Palestine as they are unpardonable crimes against humanity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upbeat under the patronage of the U.S., Israel is working hard to contain the resistance forces and create difficulties in the activities of the unified national government of Palestine through reckless military attacks, copying the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the U.S. in the international arena. But this is nothing but a pipe dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Israel should immediately stop all illegal military actions against Palestine and respond to the demand of the world peace-loving people including the Arab people for a comprehensive and fair solution to the Mid-east issue."

            "content": "U.S. Can Never Evade Responsibility for Tension on Korean Peninsula: KCNA Commentary \r\n Pyongyang, July 15 (KCNA) -- These days the president and heavyweights of the U.S. administration are noisily crying out for the DPRK's \"dismantlement of its nukes\", taking issue with its drills for launching missiles for self-defense, etc. \n\t\t\t\t\t They talk about advance measures for denuclearization and \"strong international countermeasures\", asserting in the international arena that the nuclear threats from the north and its missile development are attributable to the irresponsible policy and provocative attitude of its government and they do not recognize its access to nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is nothing but a cynical ploy to lay the blame for the daily escalating tension on the Korean peninsula at the door of the DPRK, and mockery of the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is clear to everybody that the reckless military moves of the U.S. and south Korea for a nuclear war are the main factor of the tension on the peninsula. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 11 the U.S. suddenly hurled the flotilla of the nuclear carrier George Washington into Pusan Port of south Korea and the group of Aegis destroyer Kidd under the Third Fleet of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces into Tonghae Port of south Korea. It was reported that those groups would stage a \"drill to intercept planes\" accompanied by naval maneuvers targeted against the DPRK together with the south Korean naval force in the South and East seas of Korea from July 16. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Posing constant nuclear threat to the DPRK and making high-handed nuclear blackmail against it, the U.S. is busy spreading the rumor that the responsibility for the escalating tension on the peninsula rests with the former and letting loose a whole string of sheer sophism that the world peace and security are threatened by the former's self-defensive nuclear deterrence and it should be, therefore, dismantled. As proved by the above-said facts, this behavior is like putting the cart before the horse.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has neither justification nor right to blame the nuclear deterrence of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Due to the U.S. moves for a nuclear war, south Korea and its vicinity have turned into the biggest nuclear arsenal in the Far East and the advanced nuclear base for realizing the Asia strategy for aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But for the U.S. deployment of nukes in south Korea and its nuclear threat to the DPRK, the Korean peninsula would have been nuclear free already long ago. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was the only zone of nuclear vacuum in Korean peninsula and its vicinity in which the U.S. stockpiled nuclear weapons enough to reduce the earth to nuclear debris dozens of times and its forces were always ready to invade it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was the final conclusion made by the DPRK that it could counter those who wield nukes against it with nukes only. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK was compelled to have access to nukes to foil the U.S. adventurous moves for a nuclear war and protect the security of the nation and peace on the peninsula and in the rest of Asia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is wholly to blame for the danger of a nuclear war posed to the peninsula unprecedented in history, blinded by its ambition for world domination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the steadfast stand of the army and people of the DPRK on the U.S. hostile policy towards it to counter the U.S. nuclear blackmail with a merciless nuclear attack, the war of aggression with a just total war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should think twice with reason and make a bold decision to find a fundamental solution."

Al vincular este caso con Palestina sin motivos justos, Israel lanzo el ataque aereo contra la zona de Gaza movilizando decenas de aviones de combate y helicopteros y a partir del dia 13, intensifica el ataque incorporando hasta las fuerzas terrestres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del inicio de ataque hasta la fecha, reportaron en Gaza mas de mil palestinos muertos y lesionados y se redujeron a cenizas cientos de edificios publicos y viviendas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalificando de intolerable crimen de lesa humanidad, denunciamos fuertemente el indiscriminado ataque militar de Israel contra los poblados pacificos de Palestina, el cual causo la muerte de numerosos civiles inermes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIsrael, envanecido bajo el amparo de EE.UU., intenta doblegar a las fuerzas insurgentes con el imprudente ataque militar imitando al imperio, que practica el despotismo y arbitrariedades en la arena internacional, y generar dificultades en las actividades del gobierno unido nacional de Palestina.
