They claim that the DPRK is beset with \"issue of missile development and export\" and \"it refuses to accept the verification and inspection by the international atomic energy agency\" as regards the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are no such \"issues\" in the DPRK and it is exposed to Japan's threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the Japanese reactionaries seek in ridiculously peddling the \"threat of terrorism\" from the DPRK is as clear as noon day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are going to cite the \"threat of terrorism\" from the DPRK to divert elsewhere the watchful eyes of the world focused on Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Another aim is to fan up anti-DPRK hostile feelings in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having designated the DPRK as the first target of their overseas aggression, the Japanese reactionaries are working hard to attain it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to behave with decorum, pondering over the serious consequences of their anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, a solid foundation has been laid to boost the production of freshwater fish including rainbow-trout, crucian carp and carp. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n North Hwanghae Province has also placed the method of breeding fish by natural food and food processing on a scientific and technological basis. In this way it has opened up a new vista of developing the fish breeding although the country's conditions still remain difficult. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work of breeding sea fish together with freshwater fish is now making brisk headway on various fish farms in North Phyongan Province and other areas of the west coastal tideland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Modern stock breeding farms and spawning ponds have also been built in each province, city and county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Modern catfish farms have also appeared in different parts of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Fish production is on a steady increase at the modern catfish farms built in various areas including Songhwa, Samchon, Pukchang and Tongsin counties.    \r\n\r\n"
