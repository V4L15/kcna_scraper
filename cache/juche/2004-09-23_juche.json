            "content": "Sophism of War Criminal - KCNA News Analyst's Article - \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush, addressing presidential election campaign rallies, has tried to justify the U.S. invasion of Iraq and even described it as an \"exceptional success\".\r\n He, in the hope of pulling up his popularity even a little, is portraying the internationally recognized crime of war as an \"exceptional success\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clearly proved by the horrible consequences caused by the war that the invasion was, in the long run, a war of aggression and plunder and an undisguised state terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main reason of the U.S. invasion of Iraq was to \"eliminate weapons of mass destruction\" which had been non-existent in the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., which has stockpiled the largest arsenal of weapons of mass destruction in the world and is still developing and using such weapons, attacked Iraq, a sovereign state, allegedly to \"eliminate WMD\". This is a grave challenge to world peace. It is more serious that the U.S. attacked Iraq, ignoring the United Nations and the international community standing against the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is for Iraq's oil and the domination of the Middle East that the U.S. killed tens of thousands of civilians and destroyed peaceful towns and villages in Iraq with an intensive missile strike and indiscriminate bombing. The U.S. forces even used some 1,700 tons of depleted uranium bullets during the war, causing radioactive pollution in the whole of the country and incurable diseases among people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. abuses of Iraqi detainees astonished the international community as they are the worst violation of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen Bush was busy with the election campaign, the U.S. occupation troops bombed towns of Iraq and killed a large number of civilians under the pretext of quelling \"riot forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invaders have deserved punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 1,000 U.S. troops have been killed and some 5,000 wounded by attacks of Iraqi resistance forces. The number of suicides, mattoids and deserters has steadily increased among the U.S. troops mobilized in the unethical war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Foreign media say that the U.S. has sunk into the abyss of the \"second Vietnamese War\" where the \"door of the hell is always open\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Murder, arson, destruction, plunder and ceaseless bloodshed -- that is just the \"exceptional success\" brought by Bush from the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public brands the Bush administration wrecking world peace with the homicidal policy of aggression and hegemony as a group of war criminals.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He extended sincerest salute to all the Korean people who are triumphantly advancing under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. \"War against Terrorism\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- The \"war against terrorism\" launched by the United States after the Sept. 11 incident is a horrible criminal act of sparking a vicious cycle of terrorism and retaliation and driving the world into war, disorder and disaster. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article . It goes on:\r\n The Afghan war launched by the U.S. under the pretext of \"retaliation\" against the Sept. 11 incident was a war to conquer the world in the 21st century and a prelude to the contemporary form of \"crusade.\" The Bush forces' much publicized \"war against terrorism\" is not aimed at U.S. security and world peace as claimed by them but a war of aggression to seize areas of strategic importance in the world and establish military domination over them.  The Iraq war ignited by the U.S. in the wake of the start of the Afghan war was a war that crudely violated the independence of a sovereign state and a war to plunder strategic resources as it laid bare the aggressive, bestial and predatory nature of U.S. imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A vicious cycle of terrorism and retaliation is going on in Iraq, Afghanistan and other regions of the world as a consequence of the U.S. \"war against terrorism.\" This is causing bloodshed and leaving the world uneasy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group is working hard to round off its brigandish \"strategy of preemptive attack\" for escalating this war and speeding up the reorganization and redeployment of its armed forces according to the strategy, far from owning great responsibility for the above-mentioned consequences. It was so arrogant as to divide the world into a group standing on the side of the U.S. and the other group siding with \"terrorism\" as they pleased. It threatens that it does not rule out even the use of nuclear weapons against the anti-U.S. independent countries. The Bush warlike forces had already revealed their sinister intention to escalate their \"anti-terrorist war\" worldwide by listing the DPRK, Iran and Iraq as an \"axis of evil.\" They are stepping up the preparations for the second Korean war at the last phase after singling out the DPRK as the next target of their attack after the Iraqi war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIncreasing the national defence capability provides the best way of frustrating the U.S. moves for aggression and war and defending the sovereignty and security of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Ending U.S. Imperialists' Occupation of S. Korea Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 22 (KCNA) -- The Korean nation should put an end to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea and it is the only way to get rid of the misfortunes and disgrace of the nation, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. forces crawled into south Korea with the defeat of Japanese imperialism in 1945. It sought to rule the whole of Korea. But, failing in this attempt, they placed south Korea under its military occupation in a brigandish way. This was an illegal act of aggression which can never be justified with any subterfuge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea is the root cause of all the misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean people. It led to a war of aggression that brought mass killings and indiscriminate destruction in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n During the occupation, the U.S. imperialists committed murder, looting and anti-human crimes previously unknown against the south Korean people. With south Korea left under the U.S. imperialists' occupation, the people there can never be freed from the misfortunes, sufferings and death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces present in south Korea are the main obstacle to the Korean nation's cause of independent reunification. \r\n It is because of the obstructions of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces that the turning phase of reunification opened by the publication of the historic July 4 joint declaration was reversed and the inter-Korean agreement and joint declaration of denuclearization adopted with so much efforts became dead letters as soon as they came into effect. It is nobody's secrecy that the desire of the participants in the April 19 popular uprising was dashed and the popular uprising in Kwangju was brutally suppressed by the U.S. imperialist aggressors. It was again those aggression forces that put a block on the way of reunification by staging such massive joint military exercises as \"Team Spirit\", \"Foal Eagle\", \"RUSOI\" and \"Ulji Focus Lens\" whenever the spirit of Koreans for reunification rose to a new tide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the Korean people's advance toward independent reunification to implement the June 15 joint declaration under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit has stumbled upon trials and difficulties. And this is also attributable to the U.S. imperialists' occupation of south Korea and their anti-reunification acts of interference.       \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
