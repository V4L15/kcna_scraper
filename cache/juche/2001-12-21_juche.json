This can be explained by the facts that the KPA has taken on an appearance as a full-fledged army of the leader, the army of the supreme commander and held the firm position as the pillar of the Korean revolution, the main force for accomplishing the socialist cause and that the KPA has played its increased role as the defender of the socialist land and creator of people's happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-centered policy of the WPK is a powerful political mode deeply rooted in the life of our people and treasured by them as their faith and it is vital to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea, which once suffered an eclipse on the world map and always fell victim to big powers in the past, has emerged a powerful socialist fortress and become a focus of the world politics and new world political relations have been established with Pyongyang as an axis. This is thanks to the original army-centered policy of Kim Jong Il and his independent policy.    \r\n\r\n"

It tells that the army-based policy of the WPK proceeds from the Juche idea and the policy is a unique political mode based on the idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy pursued by the WPK is a full embodiment of the idea of giving importance to the army to meet the requirements of the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This policy provided a flawless political system, a full embodiment of the Juche idea-based principle of giving priority to the army. Herein lies the source of its tremendous vitality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is a revolutionary political mode that makes it possible to defend and realize independence of the popular masses to the full. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The invincible socialist policy is very instrumental in defending the independence of the popular masses from the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary practice in the present era proves that independence of the popular masses would have been unthinkable without a strong army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy of the WPK embodies the Juche idea, the revolutionary doctrine for the defence and realization of the independence of the popular masses, and mirrors the lawful demands for the accomplishment of the socialist cause that is launched and pushed forward in a fierce confrontation with imperialists. Indeed, it is a political mode that makes it possible to carry to completion the cause of independence of the popular masses, the cause of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is an invincible political mode that makes it possible to strengthen the driving force of the revolution in every way and enhance its role remarkably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important in building up the driving force of the revolution is the issue of its main force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary army should be a main force of the revolution today when a fierce anti-imperialist, class struggle is under way. Only when the leading role of the revolutionary army is further enhanced is it possible to build the revolutionary ranks as a strong army, an elite force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy of the WPK is the unique political mode created by leader Kim Jong Il in the process of leading the cause of socialism his own way, proceeding from the stand of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy has proved to be an all-powerful treasured sword as it has made a history of certain victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole course of the Korean revolution is a proud history in which the army-based idea has been fully embodied to bring about great realities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based idea has resulted in working such miracles as a certain victory at every stage of the Korean revolutionary struggle. The army greatly contributed to the Korean revolution by defeating the two most outrageous imperialisms and defending the socialist system and dignity of the country with credit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The WPK's army-based political mode demonstrated the invincible potentials and vitality in defending the cause of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy has been vital to the defense of the sovereignty of the country and the nation despite manifold difficulties, served as a treasured sword that paved the way for the building of a prosperous nation in the worst adversity, significantly raised the international authority of the DPRK and demonstrated the dignity of Kim Il Sung's nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article underscores the need to accelerate the revolutionary advance in the new century, true to the army-based guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls for putting on a new higher stage the efforts to implement the army-based policy in conformity with the developing reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also underlines the need to direct sustained great efforts to the work to steadily glorify Kim Jong Il's army-based leadership exploits and increase the nation's military potential. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of army-based policy is a revolutionary banner with which the best socialism has been built on this land, the banner of victory with which socialism has been defended in rigorous adversity and an everlasting banner of struggle with which to carry to completion the cause of socialism, it adds.    \r\n\r\n"
