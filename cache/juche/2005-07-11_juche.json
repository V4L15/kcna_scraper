            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK FM on Contact between Heads of DPRK and U.S. Dels \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Sunday as regards the contact made between the heads of the DPRK and the U.S. delegations to the six-party talks.\r\n As already reported, the contact between the heads of the DPRK and the U.S. delegations to the six-party talks was made in Beijing and an agreement on the resumption of the talks was reached there on July 9. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the six-party talks that have remained deadlocked for over one year is entirely thanks to the sincere efforts made by the DPRK for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK repeatedly clarified, it is the ultimate goal of the DPRK to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and it is its consistent stand to attain the goal through dialogue and negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Proceeding from this stand, the DPRK actively initiated the six-party talks and set forth realistic and constructive proposals at the last three rounds of talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has neither opposed nor given up the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks have been deadlocked till now because the U.S. refused to recognize its dialogue partner and destroyed their groundwork. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the meantime, the DPRK has clarified more than once through a series of contacts made between the DPRK and the U.S in New York that the talks can be resumed if the U.S. rebuilds their groundwork by recognizing the sovereignty of the DPRK and making clear its will for non-aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special mention should be made of the fact that delegates of the DPRK Foreign Ministry and the U.S. Department of State met in New York from June 30 to July 1 and exhaustively negotiated the issue of providing the DPRK with a justification for returning to the six-party talks and reached a consensus of views on the matter in the main. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Accordingly, the U.S. side at the contact made between the heads of both delegations in Beijing Saturday clarified that it would recognize the DPRK as a sovereign state, not to invade it and hold bilateral talks within the framework of the six-party talks and the DPRK side interpreted it as a retraction of its remark designating the former as an \"outpost of tyranny\" and decided to return to the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the resumption of the talks has been possible only thanks to the principled and independent stand and tireless and sincere efforts of the DPRK side for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The outcome of the DPRK-U.S. contact clearly proves that it is possible to settle any problem when the parties concerned directly come out to solve it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The neighboring countries supporting the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and those related to it have also made efforts for the resumption of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan has done nothing for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resumption of the talks itself is important but the most essential thing is for the talks to have an in-depth discussion on ways of denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula to make substantial progress in the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will do its utmost for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Stronger Unity in Songun Revolution Called for\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 9 (KCNA) -- The present era in which leader Kim Jong Il's Songun politics has been pursued in all fields marks a golden era in the history of the unity in the Korean revolution. The unity in the Songun revolution serves as a banner for winning eternal victory in the revolutionary cause of Juche. Rodong Sinmun Saturday says this in a signed article.\r\n The unity in the Songun revolution constitutes the highest form of the unity in thinking and purpose, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity in the Songun revolution is a fundamental factor of speeding up the new revolutionary advance in all fields of the revolution and construction in the 21st century and serves as a source of strength making it possible to win one victory after another in the fierce battle without a gun report to defend socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This unity is characterized by solid unbreakable unity and perfect one in thinking and purpose because all the servicepersons and people are united close in thinking and purpose on the basis of the monolithic revolutionary idea of their leader and it is based on the Songun idea of Juche, the great revolutionary idea in our era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity in the Songun revolution has become the strongest unity because the monolithic and pure Songun idea prevails throughout the party and the society.\r\n The revolutionary ranks of Songun are replete with the revolutionary idea of Kim Jong Il, the Songun idea of Juche. \"Let's share the will with our General to the last!\" This has become the unanimous desire of the army and people of the DPRK dynamically stepping up the general march for Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No force on earth can break the unity in the Songun revolution. It has become noble comradely unity and perfectly organized unity and represents a community linked with the same destiny in which the leader and the entire army and people share destiny to the last thanks to this perfect ideological purity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity achieved by the DPRK under the banner of the Songun idea is the most solid comradely unity and represents the perfectly organized entity in which all the soldiers and people move as one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great revolutionary trait prevalent in the society, the trait of helping and leading each other forward under the slogan \"One for all and all for one!\" is unthinkable apart from the community of thinking, purpose and desire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Comradely unity is as dear as life and soul to the servicepersons and people in the DPRK. Though they cannot live as affluently as others, they will not barter their worthwhile life for anything because they live amidst the mutual trust and love as Songun revolutionary comrades who share the same idea and intention with their leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people move as one, prompted by the common desire as they share the same idea and intention in the society. Once an appeal is made by the leader, they will rise as one to respond to it and once the Party determines, they will flatten even a mountain. This is the revolutionary stamina of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The single-minded unity of the DPRK is the broadest-based revolutionary unity of the entire society and all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The leader and all the people in the DPRK form an integral whole based on the single-minded unity and an unbreakable community linked with the same destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how desperately the U.S. imperialists and the reactionaries may try to separate the headquarters of the revolution from the Korean people, they can never break the single-minded unity of the DPRK as solid as an invulnerable fortress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article underscores the need to steadily inherit the history and tradition of the great single-minded unity of the Workers' Party of Korea, which has considered ideology as a lifeline, in the march under the banner of Songun in the new century, and goes on:\r\n The history of unity of the Korean revolution teaches a precious truth that ideological work should not be allowed to abate under whatever conditions and environment. Unshakable is the stand of the WPK to give priority to the ideological revolution no matter how the situation may change and no matter what others may say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The banner of the unity in the Songun revolution is the banner which should be invariably upheld on the road of revolution rain or shine. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean revolution is sure to always triumph now that Kim Jong Il clearly indicates the road to be followed in the new century and there is the unity in the Songun revolution in which all the servicepersons and people are rallied rock-solid around the leader with the monolithic idea and purpose.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

While trying to find out a way for developing anew the anti-Japanese national liberation movement, he was strongly convinced that only the proletarian revolution, an armed struggle of the popular masses, was a way for achieving the independence of the country and the freedom and emancipation of the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, basing himself on a deep-going analysis of the changing situation and the lesson drawn from the failure in the March First Popular Uprising, convened the Chongsudong meeting in July 1919 and proved the historical inevitability of the proletarian revolution. At the Kuandian meeting held in August that year, he set forth a new policy on developing the anti-Japanese national liberation movement from the nationalist movement into the proletarian revolution and expounded tasks and ways for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The switchover was a historic event in the development of the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desire of Kim Hyong Jik for national liberation was realized successfully by President Kim Il Sung.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
