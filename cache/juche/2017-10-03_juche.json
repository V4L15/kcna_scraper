Korean Puppet Authorities for Their Pro-U.S. Acts\r\n Pyongyang, October 3 (KCNA) -- The south Korean chief executive who participated in the UN General Assembly shortly ago cowardly went to see his U.S. and Japanese masters, saying that he \"highly appreciated\" Trump's remarks and \"they will prove very effective\". What should not be overlooked is that as soon as the statement of the chairman of the State Affairs Commission of the DPRK was announced, he made coteries of the ministry of Unification and the foreign ministry dare to challenge it with such reckless remarks that \"it is a provocation to other country and threatening rhetoric escalating tension\". He discussed the \"plan for deterring the north's additional provocation\" at a security council meeting on September 24.\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the fact, Minju Joson Tuesday denounces their deeds as another anti-national crime that can never be tolerated as they are a hideous provocation hurting the supreme leadership of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet authorities are colonial stooges in every aspect as they patronized Trump's insane remarks and slandered the DPRK's stand for toughest counteraction, it says, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such behaviors fully revealed once again the true colors of the present south Korean regime as a miserable pro-U.S. stooge who can not live without dependence on its U.S. master. And they clearly proved that the south Korean chief executive's assertion that \"disaster of war should not be repeated on this land\" was a deceptive advertisement to cover up his true nature as a pro-American traitor keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen and mislead the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet authorities' deeds servile to the U.S. are a crime of further heightening the tension in the Korean Peninsula and the region by inciting the U.S. war moves against the DPRK and a foolish act of precipitating their own destruction."

Accordingly, the U.S. Department of Treasury additionally included banks of the DPRK and relevant officials in the sanctions list. In the meantime, the House of Representatives of the U.S. passed \"north Korean human rights reauthorization act\" in order to undermine the DPRK from inside.\n\t\t\t\t\t Timed to coincide with this, the U.S. military sent two B-1B strategic bombers and six F-15C fighters to the sky above the open sea in the East Sea of Korea to commit a military provocation threatening the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on the facts, Minju Joson Tuesday brands this as a product of stop-gap measure taken by the mentally deranged to save their face which has been put in disgrace in the face of the high spirit of the army and people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Terming the hysteric acts of Trump and his group as a suicidal act of digging deeper their own grave, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is making senseless remarks, being lost to reason and is opting for military challenge. This is just a last-ditch effort to get rid of extreme uneasiness over the DPRK's state nuclear force that has been bolstered in the final stage of completion and avoid the shuddering horror over the toughest countermeasure unprecedented in history now under serious consideration by the headquarters of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whatever means the Trump group may use, they can never undermine the tremendous overall state might of the DPRK and its strategic position nor check the DPRK making dynamic advance in the spirit of self-reliance and self-development."
