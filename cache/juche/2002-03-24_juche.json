            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on revolutionary stand of Korean people \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- To maintain a transparent revolutionary stand toward the imperialists' war of aggression is an urgent requirement of the prevailing situation and provides a sure guarantee for upholding the army-based policy of leader Kim Jong Il with loyalty.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today stresses this in a bylined article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary war for a war of aggression and fire for fire. This is at the core of the Juche-based outlook of the Workers' Party of Korea on war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The transparent revolutionary stand of the army and people of Korea on the imperialists' war of aggression has proved firm in the crucible of the two hard-fought anti-imperialist wars and a fierce confrontation with the outrageous U.S. imperialists that has lasted for nearly half a century. It serves as the spirit of socialist Korea that no force on earth can quell and a source of mental power with which to emerge ever-victorious in any showdown with enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This revolutionary stand finds an expression in their full preparedness to mercilessly defeat those who dare encroach upon the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary stand of the Korean people on war represents a faith that the Korean army and people who have Kim Jong Il as the supreme commander are sure to win. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Juche-based military idea and theories centered upon the servicepersons, outstanding leadership ability to encourage tens of millions of people to turn out as one in a struggle to defeat the enemy, the revolutionary faith and indomitable will unshakable in any adversity, the firm resolution and stratagem to turn any unfavorable tide of war in his favor in a moment and warm love for the soldiers and people are the most striking example of the personality and quality of the famous generals of the era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary stand of the Korean people also finds expression in their firm will to remain true to his army-based policy anywhere and any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army-based policy is an all-powerful treasured sword and the most powerful socialist political mode of the era with which to contain the imperialists politically, ideologically and militarily and push ahead with the cause of socialism triumphantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The politico-ideological and military might is put on the highest level under his army-based revolutionary leadership. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Final victory always belongs to the army and people of the DPRK.\r\n"

This betrays their criminal intention to prolong their remaining days with the backing of outsiders in return for their anti-reunification treacheries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are seriously mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people hardly repress their surging indignation at the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean bellicose elements. If the aggressors dare unleash a nuclear war in this land, outsiders and those who follow them will have to pay a deserved price for their treacheries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a by-lined commentary says that the Korean people in the northern half of Korea will never allow the Yankees and the South Korean bellicose elements to stifle the DPRK and socialist system, but wipe them out.     \r\n\r\n"
