            "content": "KCNA Raps U.S. Despicable Psychological Warfare against DPRK  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 22 (KCNA) -- The United States reportedly decided to allocate more funds for the broadcasting services engaged in the anti-DPRK propaganda out of its budget for fiscal 2008 and extend the broadcasting time for this purpose. \"Radio Free Asia\" decided to air medium-wave broadcasting programs beside short-wave broadcasting ones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This indicates that the U.S. has become evermore undisguised in its moves to tarnish the DPRK's image in the international arena and destroy the socialist system in the DPRK since the outset of the year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said actions taken for such reptile broadcasting services as \"Radio Free Asia\" and VOA are part of the U.S. campaign against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now focusing its efforts on the false propaganda by use of reptile broadcasting services in a bid to bring about what it called \"changes\" in the DPRK and other countries that refuse to meekly obey it or incur its displeasure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this regard the south Korean magazine Sin-Dong-A said as follows: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"The Korean language broadcasting of RFA is not aimed at the south but at the north, to all intents and purposes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. considers it as a lever for pressure to extend the time for RFA broadcasting in the language in the very country against which it is targeted in case U.S. conflict with the country mounts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RFA, the anti-north broadcasting service, is functioning as a valuable entity for which the U.S. does not spare unequivocal assistance in a bid to bring about a change there.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n RFA mainly tasked to conduct smear propaganda against Asian countries started its Korean broadcasting programs early in March of 1997. The U.S. has steadily increased funds for broadcasting programs and systematically lengthened the time for anti-DPRK programs. It allocated two million dollars for this broadcasting in fiscal 1998 and decided to spend a stupendous amount of funds till 2008 according to the North Korean Human Rights Act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent decision made by the U.S. suffices to guess what phase its dangerous hostile policy toward the DPRK has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that spokesmen for American policy makers are blustering that that the draft budget for escalating broadcasting propaganda would play a pivotal role in spreading freedom and democracy in the important region and it has become possible for the U.S. to produce a draft budget to address most urgent and crucial threat to security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates that such propaganda machines would help spread freedom and democracy and bring down the socio-political system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ours is a politically stable and rock-solid system as it guarantees all members of the society genuine freedom and democracy. No force can destroy this system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Such despicable psychological warfare launched by the U.S. to bring about a sort of \"change\" in the DPRK's dignified and inviolable system and society is nothing but the last-ditch efforts made by those who know nothing about the single-minded unity that exists in the DPRK where the leader, the party and the people have formed a harmonious whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. psychological warfare will get it nowhere. It will only reinforce the Korean people's will and faith to consolidate in every way socialism and the one-minded unity, a precious gain and eternal cornerstone of the revolution.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
