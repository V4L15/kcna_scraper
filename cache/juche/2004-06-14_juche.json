It is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. decided to dispatch some of its armed forces in south Korea to Iraq under the pretext of the \"urgent Iraqi situation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the redeployment of the U.S. armed forces is not just an adjustment or replacement of armed forces but it pursues a very sinister aim which should never be overlooked. It is part of the U.S. vicious moves for a war of aggression to realize its invariable wild ambition for world domination at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. strategy for world domination, Asia-Pacific strategy, to dominate the whole world by holding a grip on the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. primary target in implementing the strategy is to establish military domination over Northeast Asia including the Korean peninsula. It is clear from this fact that the redeployment of the U.S. armed forces in and around the Korean peninsula is aimed at military domination over the Asia-Pacific region. Even the U.S. itself does not hide this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is desperately working to militarily stifle the DPRK, accelerating the redeployment of its armed forces in and around the Korean peninsula under the pretext of \"reexamining\" someone's \"military strategy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality requires everyone to be vigilant against the U.S. adventurous moves for the redeployment of armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. wild ambition for world domination is nothing but a daydream. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is well advised to behave itself, though belatedly, bearing in mind that its moves to realize its invariable wild ambition for aggression are only driving the U.S. to thorough isolation. This would do the U.S. good.    \r\n\r\n\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "CPRF Secretariat Indicts U.S. for Hamstringing North-South�@Cooperation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued an indictment Friday on the occasion of the 4th anniversary of the publication of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration condemning the U.S. for having totally ignored the joint declaration and worked hard to prevent the north-south relations from improving.\r\n Accusing the U.S. of fostering distrust and confrontation between the north and the south, the indictment said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The adoption of the joint declaration at the historic Pyongyang meeting in June 2000 marked a significant occasion as it opened up a turning phase in improving the north-south relations and achieving the peace and reunification of the country. \r\n However, the U.S. has totally ignored the joint declaration and hamstrung its implementation overtly and covertly from the very outset. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has become more undisguised in its moves to bring the inter-Korean relations back to the era of distrust and confrontation since the emergence of the Bush regime in January 2001, in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"north Korea policy initiative\" announced by Bush on June 6, 2001 was a political stick he used for forcing the south Korean authorities to cooperate with the U.S. in executing its hard-line policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whenever an opportunity presented itself, the U.S. pressurized and blackmailed the south Korean authorities to cooperate with Washington in implementing the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In March 2001 Bush summoned the then south Korean chief executive to Washington and wrested from him assurances that he would advance the south-north relations depending on the progress made in the north Korea-U.S. relations, adjust the tempo in the implementation of his north Korea policy as requested by the U.S. and that he would consult with the U.S each phase of its progress. In May last year, too, the Bush ruling quarters called the new chief executive of south Korea to Washington in a bid to pressurize him to support its attempt to apply economic sanctions and mount military attacks on the DPRK under the pretext of the nuclear issue. They had this stipulated in the south Korea-U.S. joint statement as an \"additional measure,\" thus pushing the north-south relations to the phase of distrust and confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group in a \"state of the union address\" made at Congress early in 2002, two years after it came to power, let loose malignant vituperation against the DPRK, terming it part of an \"axis of evil\". In February he flew into Seoul and toured areas along the Military Demarcation Line, egging the south Korean authorities on to incite confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The skirmish that took place in the West Sea in June 2002 was a typical example of the military provocations the U.S. orchestrated to block the north-south relations from improving. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment blamed the U.S. for disturbing the inter-Korean dialogue and contacts. It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the June 15 joint declaration been published than the U.S. forced the south Korean authorities to get U.S. approval of every move to go ahead with their north Korea policy including government-level aid to the north, to say nothing of political and military negotiations, saying that the south's contact with the north without the knowledge of the U.S. is a very serious development which should no longer be allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the U.S. that barred the north and the south from holding the fifth and the sixth north-south ministerial talks and the second meeting of the North-South Committee for the Promotion of Economic Cooperation and the second round of the talks between authorities of the north and the south for the revitalization of Mt. Kumgang tour as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Panel for the North-South Cooperation in Power Industry could not meet any more after its first session held in Pyongyang under an agreement reached at the 4th north-south ministerial talks. It was also directly attributable to the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK with nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. prevented the north-south dialogue and contacts from taking place and instigated pro-U.S. conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea to hinder dialogue and contacts between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On March 12 last, the U.S. wirepulled the right-wing conservative forces in south Korea including the Grand National Party to stage a political coup called a \"motion on impeachment against the president\" and conducted large joint military exercises targeted against the north together with bellicose forces in south Korea. This rendered it impossible to hold the north-south working meeting of the Panel for the Settlement of Accounts, the north-south meeting of the Panel for the Flood Control in the River Rimjin, a north-south working contact for the reconnection of rail and road links as scheduled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The indictment also accused the U.S. of hamstringing cooperation and exchange between the north and the south. It went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. dropped a check-bar on the overall inter-Korean economic cooperation undertakings, saying that 386 type computers may be used for a military purpose when several of them are linked together, chemical fertilizers should not be allowed as they may be used for producing conventional explosives and there should be a verification of food delivery as it may go to the army. It even reproached south Korea, asserting that it is hard to cooperate with Seoul if it goes ahead of Washington, draining resources for north Korea when Washington is keen to contain Pyongyang and stop it from developing nukes and missiles on the principle of mutual aid and verification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has hamstrung the project of reconnecting the rail and road links between the north and the south, arrogantly interfering in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the project of demining areas along the Demilitarized Zone for the reconnection of rail and road links between the north and the south was making progress at its final phase in November 2002, the U.S. put the brake on the project, asking the north to submit a list of members of the verification team to the \"UN Command\" all of a sudden. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It even scotched the tour of Mt. Kumgang, an undertaking symbolic of reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This obstruction has got more pronounced since the appearance of the Bush administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those south Koreans related to the Pyongyang meeting were punished though they had contributed to the righteous undertakings for national unity and reunification and a businessman who played a pace-setter's role in north-south cooperation met a tragic death due to the case of \"remittance to the north.\" This was also invented and hyped up by the U.S. to serve its purpose of plot-breeding and smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is due to the U.S. obstructions that the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone has been at a standstill for four years since the first agreement was reached between the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and south sides at several rounds of ministerial talks and talks and contacts at all levels including meetings of the committee for the promotion of economic cooperation discussed issues related to the construction of the zone and reached agreements on important issues ranging from principled matters to details. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has put increased pressure on south Korea as regards this construction. In consequence, only a large number of persons and vehicles from the south side visited the area of Kaesong, not doing anything to speak of. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for hamstringing the north-south cooperation for the common prosperity of the Korean nation as it has impertinently poked its nose in the Korean nation's business.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is little short of admission by the Bush administration itself that Iraq's \"possession of weapons of mass destruction\" propagandized by it to justify its war against Iraq was a sheer lie. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Judging from this, crystal clear is the purpose of the Bush administration in contriving a string of false information against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no artifice can the Bush administration conceal the aggressive nature of the false information forged by it. It rather rips away the curtain to bring into bolder relief the ugly colors of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation calls upon the DPRK to decisively cope with the false information cooked up by the Bush administration against the DPRK. We have made it clear more than once that we will never tolerate any attempt, however trifling it may be, to do harm to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Bush administration, ignoring this stand of the DPRK, went on spreading false information and seeking to realize its invariable foolish designs to stifle the DPRK with it as a pretext, it would face a corresponding tough step.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But such brigandish demand failed to be accepted and the negotiations collapsed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the chief delegate of the U.S. side in an interview with Chosun Ilbo, a pro-U.S. conservative daily which is a target of the denunciation and criticism of the south Korean public, openly gave vent to compliant, shouting himself hoarse that what must be understood is the danger that would follow the failure of an early agreement, if an agreement on the transfer of the U.S. military base in south Korea failed to be reached, additional deployment of latest Patriot missiles and other designs and plans might not be put into practice and, eventually, it would be the south Koreans who would suffer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes without saying that this is a political threat of the U.S. to throw a wet blanket on the unanimous desire of the south Korean people to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through national cooperation and struggle against the U.S. and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No wonder the south Korean people of all walks of life are lifting up the voice: \"This is a threat to our people.\" \"We bitterly denounce the U.S. robber-like act in forcing a humiliating negotiation and making no bones about threatening us.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should act with discretion, looking straight into the trend of the times toward the implementation of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
