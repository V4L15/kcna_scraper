As a result, it has emerged a war force to reckon with. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is citing the non-existent \"threat\" from the DPRK as a pretext for realizing its dangerous goal for turning itself into a military power by taking advantage of the unstable situation on the Korean Peninsula \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The keynote of Japan's \"proposal for defence\" for shaping new \"defense programme guidelines\" calls for exercising the right to collective self-defense, founding a national defense army and acquiring capability for striking missile launching bases. It also calls for studying nuclear deterrence under the pretext of \"threat\" from the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan insists on the above-said assertion because the regional situation remains complicated due to other countries. But, the situation is quite contrary to this assertion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, the U.S.-Japan-south Korea joint military drills with the nuclear powered carrier Nimitz involved took place in waters west of Kyushu of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK and the U.S. are technically at war. Japan's regular involvement in the U.S-south Korea military drills clearly indicates that the exercise of the right to collective self-defence and attack on the enemy's bases touted by Japan are aimed at staging a comeback to Korea according to the joint operations with its allies. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The \"threat\" from the DPRK is what Japan requires for realizing its scenario for overseas expansion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's moves to emerge a military giant not only threaten regional peace but are fraught with a serious danger to itself."

            "content": "ACNC denuncia artimana de Japon de justificar campana de militarizacion\r\nPyongyang, 11 de junio (ACNC) -- En la reunion de seguridad de Asia, recien efectuada en Singapur, el ministro de Defensa de Japon dijo que \"el desarrollo de armas nucleares y misiles del Norte de Corea amenaza gravemente la paz y seguridad de la sociedad internacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, insiste en que el movimiento por fortalecer la capacidad de defensa nacional y ejercer el derecho a la autodefensa colectiva de Japon, que provoca gran preocupacion internacional, \"contribuye a la estabilidad de la region\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es la expresion de la acostumbrada conciencia hostil anti-RPDC y deviene la artimana para justificar la campana de militarizacion en etapa crucial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde su derrota en la segunda guerra mundial hasta la fecha el pais isleno no ha abandonado ni un dia la ambicion de agresion a ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara ese fin, vino impulsando incesantemente la conversion de su pais en la potencia militar y ya se ha formado como una fuerza de guerra nunca despreciable. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHabla tanto de la \"amenaza\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea para lograr su meta de conversion en la potencia militar aprovechando la situacion inestable de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl llamado \"proyecto sobre la defensa\" para aprobar el nuevo \"programa de defensa\" contiene el ejercicio del derecho a la autodefensa colectiva, la fundacion del ejercito de defensa nacional y la posesion de la capacidad de ataque a las bases de lanzamiento de misil, segun la \"enmienda de la constitucion\". Tambien incluye la investigacion de la estrategia del disuasivo nuclear pretextando la \"amenaza\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon insiste en que todo esto es imprescindible para \"defender\" a si mismo en medio de la situacion complicada de su contorno creada por otros paises, pero la realidad es totalmente opuesta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, en la zona maritima al oeste de Kyushu, Japon, se desplego el simulacro conjunto tripartita EE.UU.-Japon-Sur de Corea con la participacion del portaaviones nuclear Nimitz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon participa regularmente en los ejercicios militares EE.UU.-Sur de Corea, que estan en estado beligerante con la RPDC, lo cual insinua que el derecho a la autodefensa colectiva y el ataque a las bases enemigas de que habla tanto el pais isleno tienen en cuenta la nueva agresion a la RPDC segun las operaciones combinadas con los paises aliados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"amenaza\" de alguien es necesaria para Japon que se entrega con frenesi a la realizacion de su ambicion de agresion a ultramar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conversion de Japon en potencia militar pondra en peligro la paz  regional y  llevara a si mismo muchos peligros"
