The mine debated on the matter over and over again but failed to find a wonderful way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After thinking for a while, the president told them to carry the compressor into the pit, saying that a few pipes would be needed and its installment easy. At the moment officials were struck with admiration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day of August, Juche 46 (1957) he went to the pisciculture institute situated on the outskirts of Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He asked a research worker if he had ever seen a carp eating grass. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The research worker answered that he saw a carp eating grass seeds but not grass. the president said that at his own residence he observed carp eating crabgrass and water caltrop. He told the research worker to try to feed fish on grass. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Afterwards, the institute verified that bean cake, rice bran and other artificial fodder can be mixed with grass to feed fish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The institute made public the results of their research work in a magazine of the international society of ichthyology and hydrobiology, which evoked a great sensation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n One day of October, Juche 47 (1958) the president visited the Kiyang Farm Machine works (at that time). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The works was making a trial product of a tractor for the first time in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He dropped in at the trial products workshop and took a jet among many accessory parts scattered in the place, saying that this would be a bottleneck. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Technicians and workers of the factory were very surprised at the moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was because it was very difficult to single out a jet from more than 1,800 accessory parts and a technician could hardly realise that the jet was the hardest part for the production of tractors.     \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "NRC on abortion of inter-Korean working-level contact in Mt. Kumgang \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the National Reconciliation Council in a statement today said that the authorities of the south side are entirely to blame for the abortion of the working-level contact between organizations of the north and the south in Mt. Kumgang to consult and decide on the events for reunification this year including a grand festival for national reunification to commemorate the 2nd anniversary of the publication of the june 15 north-south joint declaration.\r\n The contact was scheduled to take place in Mt. Kumgang on May 14 and 15 but it could not be made as scheduled owing to the failure of the delegates of the south side to come there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now there are some reports in South Korea claiming that the working level contact could not be made as the north did not send invitations to the delegates of the south side. this is a whooping lie and distortion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The South Korean ministry of unification prevented the delegates of the south side from going to Mt. Kumgang under the absurd pretext that it could not recognize the official invitations sent by the north, arguing about the \"channel\" through which they were sent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Although the historic June 15 joint declaration for national reconciliation, unity and reunification was published, the South Korean authorities are still persisting in staging such farces as \"screening\" and putting \"restrictions\" as regards contacts and reunification events of north and south non-governmental organizations on the strength of the \"security law\", branding the north as the \"principal enemy.\" They are thus laying obstacles in the way of the reunification movement and blocking the reunification-oriented contacts and dialogues between the north and south organizations. The national reconciliation council denounces these anti-reunification moves of the South Korean authorities and demands an immediate end to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the South Korean authorities have a will to implement the joint declaration it should approach on the basis of impartiality all the South Korean organizations which support and are willing to implement it, and opt to positively back their reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will make all sincere efforts to successfully hold various reunification events, including the June 15 grand festival for national reunification, this year as already agreed upon between the north and south organizations.     \r\n\r\n"
