            "content": "AJDC condena a la banda surcoreana por su decision de disolver el PPU\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 23 de diciembre (ACNC) -- Las autoridades titeres surcoreanas cometieron hace poco el acto fascista de disolver por la fuerza el legitimo Partido Progresista Unido (PPU) del Sur de Corea y descalificar a los diputados a la \"Asamblea Nacional\" por el mismo partido.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su declaracion publicada ayer, el vocero de la Asociacion de Juristas Democraticos de Corea recuerda que aquellas desintegraron el PPU tildandolo de \"agrupacion inconstitucional y seguidora al Norte de Corea\" y relacionando absurdamente su programa con la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es una violacion flagrante de la democracia y los DDHH y el terrorismo politico sin precedentes, apunta la nota y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalificamos esa decision de la banda de Park Geun-hye de ilegal acto fascista que desprecia totalmente hasta las elementales demandas juridicas y de barbaridad medieval que violo la libertad de expresion y asociacion y convirtio el suelo surcoreano en un infierno politico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa disolucion forzada del PPU se llevo a cabo justamente en el siglo XXI que no es igual al siglo pasado cuando recorrian las olas de McCarthyism anticomunista y el fascismo. Ese crimen de lesa humanidad contraviene a la corriente de la epoca y a los derechos humanos universales de la humanidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs el climax de cinismo que esos tiranos, que violan flagrantemente la elemental libertad politica del ser humano y sus derechos democraticos, cuestionaran tanto el inexistente \"problema de DDHH\" de alguien.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, la actual gobernante surcoreana aplaude ese acto fascista como una \"decision historica\", lo cual deja conocer que su mano esta detras del presente caso y ella resucita en el territorio surcoreano el fantasma de la dictadura de \"Yusin\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon la disolucion del PPU, la banda conservadora surcoreana persigue su malsano objetivo de descomponer las fuerzas progresistas y democraticas, reprimir la lucha de los partidos opositores e impedir su retoma del poder levantando la oleada contra las supuestas \"fuerzas seguidoras al Norte\". Tambien trata de salir de la crisis de gobernacion al calmar la opinion critica interna y externa dirigida a ellos mismos debido al caso de intervencion de Jong Yun Hoe en las gestiones estatales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta claro que si se dejan intactos a esos fascistas enloquecidos por mantenerse largo tiempo en el poder y enfrentarse con la connacional RPDC, el suelo surcoreano se convertira en la tierra privada de derechos humanos y democracia y seran victimas del fascismo todos los partidos y entidades que le caen mal a la banda traidora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa leccion de historia ensena que los que tratan de mantener su vida con la gobernacion fascista, seran arruinados tragicamente."
