            "content": "KCNA Slams Outbursts of IAEA Director General \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- El Baradei, director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency, recently blustered that the DPRK is the primary threat to the nuclear non-proliferation system and has breached the NPT beyond the IAEA control for 12 years.\r\n His remarks go to prove how he busied himself backing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK as he wantonly interfered in the issue outside his mandate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is not a member nation of the NPT and had already withdrawn from the IAEA. It has nothing to do with the IAEA. Yet, he is still pulling up the DPRK over this or that. This is an undisguised provocation and an imprudent act exceeding his authority. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We can hardly understand how he still remains in the office as director general of the IAEA as he does not know why and how the nuclear issue surfaced between the DPRK and the U.S. and the well known fact that the DPRK is no longer a member nation of the IAEA and NPT. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is known to have busied himself implementing the policies of the U.S. administration as its henchman and changed his stand without difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed a \"serious concern\" over the nuclear issue of south Korea when it was disclosed. But no sooner had voices patronizing Seoul come out from Washington than he made a volte-face at once. He asserted that the DPRK is to blame for the delayed settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula, blustering that now is the time for the UNSC to move. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He is now doing his best to please the U.S. in his reckless bid to serve another term as IAEA director general. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He behaved discarding even the principle of objectivity, impartiality and neutrality which the IAEA should regard as its life and soul just to please the U.S., his master. But he is now out of favor with the U.S. due to the differences over various matters related to Iran, Iraq and some other Mideast countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has already expressed its stand more than once that it is opposed to his serving another term as IAEA director general at the end of his second term. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Washington Post reported that officials of the U.S. administration wiretapped scores of phone calls between El Baradei and Iranian diplomats, which was aimed to gather evidence unfavorable to him and unseat him. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that he, who has acted under the pulls and pressures of the superpower, will stoop to any infamy just to court the U.S. favour as he is tight-cornered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This time he succeeded in improving his image talking about the so-called \"authority\" of the IAEA. He asserted that the IAEA has sufficient modern technological means to verify even nuclear activities in any \"closed facility\" and as was the case with the elimination of nuclear weapons in South Africa., the IAEA can take charge of the job once an agreement is reached. This betrays his political greed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous of him to poke his nose into internal affairs of the country outside the IAEA though he has failed to solve its own problems at a time when the secret nuclear experiments conducted by its member nations are disclosed one after another. \r\n If he truly wants to discharge the mission and role as the IAEA chief, he is well advised to mind P's and Q's and stick to the principle of impartiality, though belatedly, so that the IAEA may not become a plaything of anyone.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This seriously polluted the local environment and exposed the people's lives to a constant threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The damage inflicted upon the Maehyang-ri people could be compensated with nothing. What was open to question was that the U.S. forces which caused the enormous loss evaded their responsibility altogether, though even a hundred-fold compensation would not have been enough. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States again stands stark naked as a regular rogue state which lacks elementary conscience and morality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The compensation should be paid by the U.S. forces as the damage to the Maehyang-ri people was caused by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. forces stay in south Korea, the second and third Maehyang-ri tragedies will be inevitable. The U.S. forces present in south Korea are a caner-like existence which imposes only misfortunes and sufferings upon the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Needless to say, the DPRK would immediately take a proper and tough countermeasure, if the Japanese authorities dared apply sanctions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to keep this in mind and refrain from impudent acts.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was attributable to the U.S. vicious obstructions. \r\n Its criminal moves to bar the inter-Korean ties from improving and chill the atmosphere of peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula reached their height last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is evidenced by the fact that the U.S. deliberately meddled in the issue of the inter-Korean ties and carried matters with a high hand, acting a \"gendarme.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year the U.S. intervened in the internal affairs of south Korea in a bid to orchestrate grave political events. This was aimed to block progress and reforms in south Korea and stem the trend of warming up the inter-Korean ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The circumstances under which the movement for national reunification was waged last year once again taught a serious lesson that if the U.S. interference is not terminated, it is quite impossible to achieve the reconciliation between compatriots and their cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the Korean nation should reject the aggressor foreign forces opposed to Korea's reunification and get united as one in the struggle for harmony and reunification under the uplifted slogan of three forms of cooperation--cooperation for national independence, cooperation for peace against war and cooperation for reunification and patriotism--put up by the joint New Year editorial.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Therefore, the line has become a strategic line that should be always held fast to as long as imperialism remains on our planet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The thorough implementation of the above-mentioned line provides a sure guarantee for defending the sovereignty and dignity of the country and giving full play to the advantages and might of socialism    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
