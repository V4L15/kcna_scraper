Nevertheless, the U.S. is becoming all the more undisguised in its hostile policy toward the DPRK, keeping it on the list of \"sponsors of terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite nonsensical for the u.s. to talk about cooperation with the DPRK in its anti-terrorism operation after labeling the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The building of the light water reactors due to be provided to the DPRK by the U.S. by 2003 under the 1994 agreed framework is being indefinitely delayed. The U.S. is unreasonably demanding the DPRK receive an \"inspection\" just as a thief turns on the master with a club, instead of feeling responsible for this and complying with the DPRK's just demand for the compensation for the loss of electricity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts indicate that the prospect of the negotiated settlement of the issue has, in fact, become gloomy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under this situation the DPRK cannot sit idle but is left with no option but to take necessary counter-measures.    \r\n\r\n"

After Korea's liberation from Japanese colonial rule, under the wise guidance of the Workers' Party of Korea, Korean history was smoothed out into a proper system and a multitude of distortions or omissions were straightened out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pictorial cycle shows the course of history from the reign of Tangun (founder king of Korea's first state in the early 30th century bc) to the early 20th century, through superbly illustrated accounts of state-founding myths, great events, historical figures, the rise and fall of successive dynasties and episodes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its vocabulary and plots are so legible and instructive as to give an insight of 5,000-year-long Korean history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was compiled by Choe Hong Sik, a writer well versed in history, after years of information gathering and research, and illustrated by such famous merited artists as Cha Hyong Sam and Kim Yong Gwang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The printing of the pictorial will be completed by April Juche 91 (2002).    \r\n\r\n"

On the contrary, innumerable requests have been made by our people to let them know about the whereabouts of their family members who were kidnapped and taken away during the Japanese imperialists' occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reckless campaign in Japan is intended to awaken Japanese to damage allegedly done to them and thus shift the blame for the deadlocked DPRK-Japan talks onto the DPRK and, furthermore, dodge the just judgement to be meted out to Japan for its past crimes and go without apologizing to and compensating the Korean people for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the issue of kidnapping is to be fairly settled, it is necessary to look into the whereabouts of over six million young and middle-aged Koreans Japan kidnapped and took away in broad daylight and nearly 200,000 Korean women it forced into sexual slavery from the \"Meiji restoration\" of Japan in 1868 to the period of its colonial military occupation of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not forget that it is the legitimate right of the DPRK, a victim, to get apology and compensation from it but bear in mind that the DPRK has the will and capability to exercise the right. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before styling itself a \"peaceloving state\" Japan should know that it committed war crimes in the 20th century and remains the only enemy state in the world which greeted the 21st century without settling them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Democratic Lawyers Association bitterly condemns the recent racket kicked up at the tacit connivance and manipulation of the Japanese authorities as an illegal act of mocking at the dignified DPRK and the world's justice and conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to face up to the trend of the times and act with discretion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
