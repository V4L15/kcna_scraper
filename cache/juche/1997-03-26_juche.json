It has been proved by testimonies of former \"comfort women.\" No one can deny the fact.\r\n   Hirabayashi even said the government was not directly involved in the issue. His remark shows how shamelessly the Japanese reactionaries try to shirk the blame for this criminal issue. \r\n   Although they intend to settle this issue by giving some money collected from the Japanese people to the surviving \"comfort women\" through a \"private fund,\" this can never settle the issue.\r\n   Japan must admit government responsibility and apologize for this crime and make state compensation as demanded by the times. \r\n\r\n"
