The history of leadership and exploits of Kim Il Sung who established the tradition of press media of our Party in the fierce flames of the anti-Japanese war were the proud course in which the might of the revolutionary idea of putting importance to writing-brush was demonstrated and the valuable wherewithal which brought the birth of a new era of Juche-oriented press media even under the complicated and difficult circumstances after the liberation of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of the President many press media such as the newspaper of the Party, the Korean Central News Agency and the Radio and TV Broadcasting Committee of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea were founded in a short period after the liberation, so that the regular press system has been established and the Party and the people might step up the building of a new society with a powerful ideological weapon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our press media have experienced the heyday of its development under the leadership of Kim Jong Il who is successfully carrying forward the history of the press media pioneered by the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of his leadership over the press media work of the Party is consistent with the days when he has defended the President's idea of the press and exploits with loyalty. And it is shining as the glorious revolutionary record which brought about a great surge in all fields of newspapers, news service, broadcasting and the press and roused the whole party and the army and all the people to the building of a great prosperous powerful nation under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is, therefore, a fundamental issue the solution of which requires primary efforts to bolster the driving force for reunification in the efforts to achieve the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If all Koreans in the north and the south and abroad pool their will and, on this basis, achieve the great national unity, they can settle the essential issue in accomplishing national reunification and then this will help solve the remaining matters with ease. It is in this context that the great national unity precisely means national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The tremendous vitality of the great national unity has been proved by the successes made in the efforts to improve the inter-Korean relations and in the movement for reunification in recent years. To strengthen the great national unity presents itself as a more urgent issue in the present struggle to implement the June 15 joint declaration, taking it as a landmark of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the political parties and organizations and people of different social standings in the north and the south and abroad should support each other and take joint actions in the efforts to achieve the peace of the country and accomplish the cause of national reunification. The primary task facing them is to check and frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war and their attempt to perpetuate their presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence, reconciliation and the great unity of the Korean nation are what all Koreans unanimously desire and ardently wish. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans desirous of peace and independent reunification of the country should go united to achieve independence and great national unity. This is the only way for the Korean nation to survive and achieve reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
