The U.S. troops should unconditionally be pulled out of South Korea. If the U.S. continues obstructing Korea's reunification with argument about its permanent military presence in South Korea, going against the trend of the times and demands of humankind, it will face bitterer condemnation and rejection by the Korean people and the world people.    \r\n\r\n"

It is an outstanding issue to be discussed at the negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. without delay.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
