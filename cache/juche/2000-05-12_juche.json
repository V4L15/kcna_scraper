An ideal place for breeding, feeding, rest and sleep of herons, it is an annual habitat for hundreds of pairs of breeding herons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The heron is a migratory bird which breeds in Korea from early March to the late autumn, when it leaves for the winter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It feeds mainly on fish and crabs in aquatic fields, swamps, tidal flats, at lake shores, in reed fields and the lower reaches of rivers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Between early May and mid-June, it lays eggs, normally one every other day, a total of three to five or rarely four to six in one birth. The eggs are oval-shaped and azure-colored. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During egg-laying, the hen stays in the nest protecting the eggs while the cock goes out to rice fields and lake shores to collect food. After egg-laying, they take turns brooding on the eggs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The hatched young grow to maturity in 40 to 45 days and leave the nest to venture out for food in a family group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhen their family mixes with other families, they become independent of their parents. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   After breeding, the place is used for sleep or rest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under state protection, an increasing number of herons frequent the Sahyon-ri rookery. \r\n\r\n"

There is no need to comment on it as it is an annual report. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, what cannot go unnoticed is that the ministry in this report raised again the \"missile issue\" of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd it said Japan would stick  to its policy of \"dialogue and deterrence\" in dealing with the DPRK, while sustaining its efforts to establish diplomatic ties with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such disgusting argument was prompted by Japan's sinister intention to use the DPRK's \"missile issue\" as a bargaining chip in a bid to get a sort of \"concession\" at the ongoing DPRK-Japan talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As for the DPRK's \"missile issue,\" it is a matter pertaining to our sovereignty from A to Z which does not allow Japan to go overboard about it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan truly hopes for the establishment of diplomatic ties and good-neighborly relations with the DPRK, it should not raise that issue but honestly repent of and fully liquidate its past crimes against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Calling for the establishment of bilateral relations, Japan refuses to do what it should do, but raises the issue which has nothing in common with it. It is self-evident that this will bring Japan to nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Dialogue\" and \"deterrence can never go together. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a mockery and an insult to the dialogue partner to call for talks while slandering it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan should abandon its wrong position and attitude.

Much larger in measuring scope than the previous ones, these meters ensure several times more accurate measure of density of different kinds of liquid than others. They fully guarantee scientific accuracy and correctness in measuring including meteorological observation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Devices for examining watt-hour meters have also reached the level of prototype meters.
