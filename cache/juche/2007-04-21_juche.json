But, the independent reunification desired by the valiant participants in the popular uprising has not yet come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has brought unbearable colonial disgrace and misfortune to the south Korean people for several generations, occupying south Korea for over six decades, and frantically pursued confrontation and war moves against the north, swimming against the trend of the June 15 era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., in particular, is whipping together pro-American conservative forces forsaken by history in a desperate bid to help them wrest \"power\" through the forthcoming \"presidential election\" at any cost and thus tide over the crisis of its colonial rule and revive the rotten politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people can never be free from the yoke of colonialism nor can their desire for peace and reunification come true as long as the U.S. military presence and colonial rule over south Korea go on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people from all walks of life should intensify their struggle against the U.S. and war and for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces in the same spirit as displayed by the participants in the April 19 uprising. They should, at the same time, wage a bold struggle to decisively smash the moves of the pro-American conservative forces including the \"Grand National Party\" to return to power and thus bring back the dark era of fascism, dictatorship and division.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
