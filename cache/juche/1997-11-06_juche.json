            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on questions in improving DPRK-Japan relations\r\n  Pyongyang, November 6 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a commentator's article headlined \"normalisation of DPRK-Japan ties is urgent requirement of two peoples and times\" as regards questions in improving the DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n    The paper says:\r\n    A series of positive changes, including an agreement on the resumption of talks between the governments of the DPRK and Japan, have recently been witnessed in the relationship between the two countries.\r\n   The point is from what point of view and with what attitude and stand you approach the improvement of the DPRK-Japan relations. \r\n   Establishment of diplomatic ties between the two countries is a requirement of the external policy of the DPRK government based on the idea of independence, peace and friendship and firm will of the Korean people.\r\n   In the past Japan inflicted measureless sufferings and misfortune on the Korean people.\r\n   If Japan sincerely shows remorse for the past and refrains from pursuing the policy hostile towards the DPRK and from obstructing the reunification of Korea, the Korean people will treat Japan with friendly feelings. The abnormal relations between the two countries will be improved as well.\r\n   This is the invariable stand and policy of the DPRK government.\r\n   Some people in Japan now argue that the DPRK seeks to resume the DPRK-Japan talks in a bid to overcome economic difficulties.\r\n   From the historical point of view and in view of the implementation of the external policy, the argument is  a short-sighted judgement based on misunderstanding of the DPRK and political ignorance. \r\n   We make no secret of our suffering from economic difficulties. The ecomomic difficulties are temporary, though. \r\n   Looking far into the Asia-Pacific era, the government of the DPRK has always shaped its policy towards Japan and worked hard to carry it into practice for the purpose of promoting a durable peace, co-existence and co-prosperity in Asia.\r\n   Now that the two governments of the DPRK and Japan reached agreement on the resumption of talks and made up their minds to establish diplomatic ties between the two countries, the two governments are responsible for the settlement of the issue.\r\n   Whether the talks will be successful or not depends on how the two governments discharge their responsibility as the parties concerned.\r\n   What is most important in solving the problems arising in the establishment of diplomatic ties between the DPRK and Japan in responsible manner is for the two sides to approach the talks with their own judgement and viewpoint.\r\n   The talks are designed to establish diplomatic ties between the DPRK and Japan.           So, the talks should be held for the improvement of the relations on the basis of the interests of the two peoples and the two countries and not for the settlement of any other issue. Only then is it possible to focus on the matters both sides are determined to solve and to achieve the desired success.\r\n   The DPRK-Japan talks held in the past clearly show that the talks which lack independent judgement and viewpoint bring about nothing.\r\n   Japan is proud of being an economic power and hopes to become a political power.   So, there is no reason why Japan cannot deal with the issue concerning the DPRK-Japan relations, in keeping with its position as such.\r\n   The Japanese authorities had better be mindful of the old diplomatic saying that there are neither eternal friends nor eternal enemies. They must shape the policy toward the DPRK with far-sighted insight and judgement lest they should suffer a great deal while following others.\r\n   The resumption of talks and their success depend entirely on Japan's stand and attitude.    \r\n\r\n"

Today irregularities are common in the ruling quarters of south Korea but the west does not pay attention to this problem.\r\n   The white paper under the subtitle \"reunification is essential for promoting human rights\" said that all the Korean people are willing to reunify the country but the 50 odd year-long division hinders democracy and development of Korea. If Korea had been reunified, the difficult problems in the economy of the north and the south would have been settled easily, it noted.\r\n   It continued:\r\n   Korea can be reunified when a Confederal State is built and the two systems cooperate with each other, as proposed by President Kim Il Sung long ago. The reunification through confederacy formula can be achieved when the disarmament including nuclear weapons on the Korean Peninsula is carried out.\r\n   Under the subtitle \"inseparable character of political freedom and socio-economic rights\" the white paper said that the successive rulers of south Korea from Syngman Rhee to Kim Young Sam have used every conceivable means to block the requirements of social and political rights.   Most brutal crackdown on peaceful demonstrations, unreasonable arrest, terrible torture, assassination and the conversion of the opposition parties into \"support forces\" through bribery --these are features of south Korean society.\r\n   The white paper under the subtitle \"development of repressive steps in civil and political rights\" said that the \"constitution\" and \"election law\" of south Korea are not solid. \r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime is continuing to enforce the anachronistic and repressive \"national security law\" and punishing the patriots calling for reunification by invoking this law, the white paper said, exposing in detail the dangerous nature of the law.\r\n   The process of reunification will begin and the human rights violation in south Korea will disappear only when dialogues are held between all the political parties, public and cultural organisations of the north and the south and detente is achieved, the white paper concluded.    \r\n\r\n"
