This is absolutely illogical.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will not recognize all sorts of unreasonable resolutions on sanctions cooked up by the hostile forces to infringe upon its sovereignty and will never be bound to them in the future, too. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is sadly mistaken if it calculates it can bring the Korean people who regard independence as their life and soul to their knees through sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pressure will not help solve any issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever comes in attack, ignorant of his rival, is bound to suffer a big setback. The U.S. would be well advised to properly understand its rival and approach it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No vicious and sinister trick and method can ever work on the DPRK as it has the great Songun politics and such powerful weapon as single-minded unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better make a bold policy switchover, not clinging to its reckless hostile policy toward the DPRK."
