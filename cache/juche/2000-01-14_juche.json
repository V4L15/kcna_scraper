            "content": "U.S.-Japan moves for military cooperation denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- Some time ago, a foreign policy aide to bush, a republican candidate for the presidency of the United States, said that Japan, together with the U.S. and its allies, should be more responsible for security in East Asia, adding Japan's armed forces should be closely coordinated with the U.S. troops to support the latter in Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Commenting on his argument, Minju Joson today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This betrays once again the unchanged intention of the United States to use Japan as a shock brigade for the implementation of its policy of hostility toward Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. final aim is to stifle the DPRK by force of arms and hold supremacy over East Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It intends to make full use of geographical features and military potentials of Japan and its militaristic ambition for reinvasion to realize its Asia strategy without difficulty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What cannot be overlooked is that Japan has shown affirmative response to such intention and military demand of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The director general of the Japan Defense Agency flew to the United States a few days ago to have a war confab with American warhawks for aggression on the DPRK. And he discussed with them the issue of acquiring high-tech warships equipped with necessary electronic information devices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the intention of the Japanese reactionaries to turn the \"Self-Defense Forces\" into an army equipped with the latest war equipment and realize their design for overseas expansion, with the backing of the U.S.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States should know that its policy of strength to stifle the DPRK will never bring good results to it and the Japanese reactionaries should stop such foolish moves hastening their own destruction. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Gigantic waterway project progresses apace \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 14 (KCNA) -- The Kaechon Lake Thaesong waterway project is in full gear in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a gigantic nature-harnessing project aimed at constructing a lock gate on the Taedong River flowing through the western area of the country to divert scores of tons of water per second and store hundreds of millions of cubic meters of water in reservoirs found in areas from several cities and counties of South Phyongan Province to Lake Thaesong. It is, in fact, the largest project in the nation's history of irrigation as it involves digging of some 160 km-long waterway, construction of scores of water tunnels and many structures, removal of at least 15 million cubic metres of earth, tamping of more than 400,000 cubic metres of concrete and paving of dikes with over 110,000 square metres of stones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK intends to complete this project, one of the major construction objects, in a brief span of time through a movement involving the entire party and army and all the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The builders are hard pressed for everything and the conditions remain difficult. But, they are accelerating the project from the outset of the year, breaking through bottlenecks and difficulties, full of confidence and optimism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The completion of the project would make it possible to supply a sufficient amount of water from the taedong river to 99,000 hectares of farmland in 15 cities, counties and districts in South Phyongan Province, Pyongyang and Nampho under any conditions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Fed with water of the river taedong, more than 20 reservoirs will no longer need the operation of the existing 380-odd water pumping stations and more than 530 water pumps. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A sufficient supply of industrial and drinking water to Nampho and large and small reservoirs always full of water would make the landscape of the country more beautiful and greatly help develop fish farming and improve the standard of people's living. \r\n\r\n"

Towns, rural villages and other places have been built into a fortress strong enough to repel any surprise attack and strike by the enemy. The DPRK has turned into an impregnable fortress reminiscent of a guerrilla base built in Xiaowangqing in the period of the anti-Japanese armed struggle led by the President Kim Il Sung. In those days the people in the guerrilla base and guerrillas turned out to defend the base from the unabated \"punitive operations\" of the Japanese imperialists who outnumbered them scores of times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Long ago, General Secretary Kim Jong Il said it was a plan of the President and his own resolution to equip all the people with arms, turn the whole country into an impregnable fortress like the base in Xiaowangqing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spirit displayed in the defence of the Xiaowangqing base has been conveyed down through generations in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was in that spirit that the people's army soldiers and people defended height 1211 during the last Korean War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The recently-published joint new year editorial calls upon all the people to push ahead with production and construction, a rifle in one hand and a hammer or sickle in the other, keeping an alert and standing posture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Members of the worker-peasant red guards defend their hometowns and working places in full combat readiness to cope with new war moves of the U.S. and their stooges, which have recently gotten all the more pronounced. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
