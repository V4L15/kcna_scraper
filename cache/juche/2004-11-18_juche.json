They are swimming against the trend of the times by attacking progressive and pro-reform forces over the issue of abolishing the NSL. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NSL has in fact lost any justification to remain in force any longer in south Korea as it designates fellow countrymen in the north as its enemy and incriminates any visit, contact and dialogue with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no visit, contact, reconciliation and cooperation between the north and the south in the true sense of the word nor the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration is possible as long as the NSL remains in force in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, floor leader of the GNP Kim Tok Ryong and national assemblymen from the same party Kim Yong Gap and a few other anti-reunification elements keen on inciting confrontation are dead-set against the repeal of the NSL, considering it as supreme. They went the lengths of crying that they would quit the National Assembly membership and opt for the struggle to defend the NSL if the law is repealed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the ultra-right conservative forces of the GNP who have fanned up confrontation with their fellow countrymen in the north, complaining that the present \"government\" is pursuing a flexible and positive policy toward the north and describing national cooperation as an illusion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the defeat of the corrupt conservative forces in the last general election new progressive forces emerged in south Korea calling for reforms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHowever, the 17th-term National Assembly has wasted time due to conflicts and scramble between the ruling and opposition parties since its very start quite contrary to the expectation of the people. The ultra-right conservative forces in the GNP are accountable for this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is seeking to attain its criminal purpose to use the row over the revision of the NSL for taking the initiative in addressing the political situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ultra-right conservative forces of the GNP have so far desperately opposed the abolition of the law, staking their lot on its preservation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are now talking about its revision in a bid to keep the evil law in force at any cost and prevent the traitorous party from its collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The desperate moves of the GNP and other ultra-right conservative forces are, in the long run, aimed to scuttle the reform in south Korea and grab power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP coteries are bound to be condemned for their treacherous acts of going against the trend of the times as they have not yet gotten rid of their old bad habit of satisfying their greed for power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to expect neither genuine reform nor any progress in the inter-Korean relations so much desired by the south Koreans unless such conservative and reactionary group as the GNP is eliminated from south Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Branding it as an illegal and invalid treaty which was fabricated and unilaterally announced by the Japanese imperialists in wanton violation of the requirements and principle of the international law, the author of the article says:\r\n The original text of the \"treaty\" was written by the Japanese imperialists and force was used in making Korean ministers consent to it, the approval of it by the ministers was falsehood, affixing the seal on it was robber-like and its promulgation was unilateral. Therefore, the \"treaty\" was not a treaty, which could never be regarded as a pact in view of the provisions of the international law. It was nothing but a mere sheet of paper which had no binding force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese samurai broke into the royal palace of other country, a sovereign state, and behaved like tyrants, barked orders and threatened ministers with death. This gangsterism was a robber's act of rigging up an \"international treaty\" surpassing imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists did not shrink from stealing the seal of the foreign minister of the feudal government of the Ri Dynasty and affixing it on the \"treaty\" in an effort to give the semblance of legality to it. This was a mean act beyond common knowledge and diplomatic usage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"treaty\" was an illegal false document devoid even of the form of a treaty. It was not a document of international law. It did not have even its title, lacked the signature of the king and sealing of the state, important procedures of its effectuation, and the credentials of the representative. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese imperialists could not get the signature of King Ko Jong, the supreme representative of the state, and the sealing of the state on it, as the feudal government and King Ko Jong persistently opposed it. King Ko Jong categorically rejected the impudent demand of Hirobumi Ito that the full power be given to the foreign minister to immediately sign the \"treaty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThus, the Japanese imperialists could not get the signature of the king and the sealing of the state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On the strength of this sheet of paper, the Japanese imperialists imposed a colonial occupation rule over Korea for over 40 years and inflicted immeasurable misfortunes, sufferings, and mental and material losses upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The times and century have changed, but the Korean people have not forgotten even a moment the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will not fail to force them to pay for their past crimes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All this is aimed to lay an international siege to the DPRK under the pretext of the \"nuclear issue\" and unleash a nuclear war against it in the long-run. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has increased its national defense capability and built a powerful nuclear deterrent force as it has been exposed to the constant nuclear threat posed by the U.S. No one can find fault with this as it is an exercise of its legitimate right to self-defense to protect the country and its people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Absolutely intolerable are the U.S. imperialists' anti-reunification and anti-DPRK moves going against the desire of the nation and the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has the unbreakable unity in mind more powerful than any nuclear weapon and tremendous self-defense power strong enough to meet any challenge of the U.S. imperialists.

It had a vast land extending from Liaohe, the River Amur area and the Maritime region of Russia to the area south of the River Taedong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many relics have already been unearthed in the place where the mural tomb was discovered. Among them are Kumsong-ri Tomb No. 1 (a stone chamber tomb mounded with earth), mountain and earthen castles, 24 stone relics, temple and tower sites that belong to the Palhae period. There is also a 300,000-year-old human fossil called \"Hwadae man\", a Paleolithic man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The newly-found mural tomb was mounded with earth. It has a corridor and a stone chamber. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The entrance to the chamber from the corridor was found blocked by a large flat rock. Also found in the centre of the chamber was a coffin pedestal with two sets of human bones, believed to be a couple's, on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mural paintings are figure and genre paintings. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Discovered in the tomb were several dozen pieces of relics such as gilded bronze plate patterned with lotus, bronze rings and edge decorations of a chest, tack-shaped bronze nails and an ink slab, pieces of earthenware, iron nails for the coffin and writing brush. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The round ink slab is one of typical relics belonging to Palhae. It is just the same with the ink slabs found in Sanggyongryongchonbu, the capital of Palhae. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jang Hyon Ho, a researcher of the Archaeological Institute of the Academy of Social Sciences, told KCNA that the mural tomb shows well the cultural development and originality   of Palhae, a prosperous and sovereign state in the Middle Ages of Korea, and that it will draw great attention of the world historical and archaeological circles.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the mid-slope north of the peak there are a 90 m-long jumping ground and 2.4 km-long skiing courses for visitors and tourists on its left side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ski-lift service is available along the 800 meter slope from the foot to the top of the peak. It is capable of carrying hundreds of players, visitors and tourists an hour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The construction of the sports village which was started by volunteer teams of Party information workers from across the country on June 21, Juche 91 (2002) is progressing at its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lodging quarters have already been occupied by sportspersons from various parts of the country.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
