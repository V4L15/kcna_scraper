It asked the U.S. ambassador to Japan to send to U.S. President Bush a message to the effect that the on-going DPRK-U.S. negotiations over the nuclear issue might adversely affect the U.S.-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a reckless move to prevent the six-party talks from making any progress, much upset by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a rash act of going against the trend of the times for Japan to throw a stumbling block in the way of the six-party talks whose main purpose is to solve the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. related to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is as foolish an act as pricking its own eyes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world public is jeering at Japan, saying that it has been thrown into a tight corner by the progress made in the efforts to settle the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula though it has made so much fuss over the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, in fact, has lost every sense of decency to talk about the \"abduction issue\" as it has not yet redeemed the hideous human rights abuses it committed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has brought into bolder relief Japan's political and moral vulgarity on the international arena as it is no more than a trouble maker and bete noire. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, is behaving like a cowboy, not knowing where it stands now. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan goes on like this, it will not only be rebuffed at the six-party talks but be marginalized in the international community in the end.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They put the production on a normal stage by tapping all internal reserves. In this course they created the Kanggye spirit to be applied throughout the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In those days, the spirit of Songgang and Ranam was created and good examples of creation and construction set to ensure that people could leap higher and advance faster. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people had built power stations, rezoned fields suited to the appearance of socialist Korea and constructed salterns in the east coastal area, goat farms, Youth Hero Motorway and other monumental edifices of eternal value, tightening their belts. These creations reflect unswerving faith and will of the army and people of Korea to bring about the rosy morrow of the rich and prosperous country by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of \"Arduous March\" is a precious asset of the Korean revolution that cannot be bartered for anything, and it serves as an ideological and mental power for the army and people to emerge victorious at all times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The reality today requires them to firmly preserve the advantageous character of the Koreans as a resourceful homogenous nation which boasts its history spanning 5,000 years and tradition and brilliant national culture. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation still remains divided into two due to outside forces and its purity is fading away in the southern half of Korea under the foreign cultural domination. This deploring reality proves that preserving the history and tradition of the nation and adding shine to the national character provide a right way of achieving national unity and reunification as they instill national pride and self-esteem into the Koreans and help overcome the heterogeneity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It presents itself as a more important issue than ever before for the Koreans to preserve their history and culture and patriotic tradition in which they have not yielded to outside aggressor forces as they are responsible for achieving the historic cause of national reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation free from outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National character serves as a foundation for national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Temporary differences resulting from the national division can never stand above the common denominator of the nation which has been formed and consolidated throughout a long history. They can never be a factor of altering the national characteristics peculiar to Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that there is a bright prospect of achieving national unity and reunification, all Koreans are called upon to set store by their advantageous national character and project and glorify it with patriotic will and thus promote national unity and bring about a fresh turn in the movement for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is fully capable of carrying out any military operations overseas, single-handed. It, therefore, wishes to exercise unchallenged influence in handling international issues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why Japan seeks to bring its political position to the level commensurate with that of a war state and claims a \"right\" and capability to ignite even a war to become the leader of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind this is the true intention of the Japanese reactionaries to adopt the \"bill\" in a bid to achieve the above-said objective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are working hard to boost the military tie-up with the U.S. and massively dispatch military forces overseas, while talking about \"Japan-U.S. alliance.\" This behavior of Japan arouses the concern of its neighboring countries and the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No country in the world would wish to see Japan emerging a dangerous state for aggression and war while rushing headlong into militarist overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
