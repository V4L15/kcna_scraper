This is a product of his sinister plot to stamp out the KCTU which has displayed great might in the south Korean people' actions for the right to existence and democracy. \n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday observes this in a signed commentary.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ever since the puppets opened the south Korean markets to the U.S. beef, south Koreans staged massive candlelight actions, branding the act as sycophancy and treachery little short of selling off their right to existence and health to outsiders, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The KCTU also joined in this struggle staged by south Koreans, men and women and young and old. The struggle for the right to existence waged by the KCTU while protesting against the humiliating negotiations on the American beef import can never be incriminated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even before his seizure of power Lee defiled the legitimate activities of trade unions as \"an ineffective, illegal and violent labor movement.\" It is nobody's secret that after coming to power, he enforced \"a policy for the extreme rich\" aimed at bringing profits to \"the rich who account for one per cent of the population\" while bleeding the workers and farmers white.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to this policy, the \"law on part-time workers\" and \"law on minimum wage\" were retrogressively revised to touch off stronger resistance among people against it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The organized massive struggle spearheaded by the KCTU is deepening the ruling crisis of the group of traitors keen on pursuing the above-said policy. It is for this reason that Lee Myung Bak is directing the spearhead of suppression to the KCTU, regarding it as a thorn in his flesh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is as clear as noonday that the south Koreans will find themselves in a more difficult position than now if they remain a passive on-looker to the Lee group's moves to stamp out the organization."
