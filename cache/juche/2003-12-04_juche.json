The anachronistic security law has no justification of existence today when for the south and north to pool efforts to achieve independent reunification has become an irresistible trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK will wage a more vigorous struggle for abolition of the security law, a peerless evil law against the nation, democracy and reunification, together with all people.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The programme sets the foundation of a unified national state, independent, peace-loving and neutral, as an ultimate goal of great national unity and defines patriotism and the spirit of national independence as an ideological basis of unity and the promotion of co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests of the north and the south as a basic principle of unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo is a design for national reunification as it shows the whole aspect of a unified state and ways of founding it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indicated in the proposal is the basic ways of achieving the reunification of the country without any deviation on the basis of tolerating the ideologies and systems in the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three charters for national reunification serve as an immortal banner gripping the hearts of all members of the Korean nation, who love the country and the nation and want national reconciliation, unity and reunification and encouraging them to accomplish the cause of national reunification as they clarify the basic principle and ways for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are called upon to wage a vigorous struggle to thoroughly implement the three charters for national reunification, regarding them as a strong pillar for accomplishing the national reunification no matter how the situation and circumstances may change in the future.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"

In fact, such crimes are being committed again in Japan. This is well illustrated by acts against the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) and suppression of Koreans in Japan. The Japanese government, while encouraging such acts of the rightist reactionary forces of Japan, listed Chongryon, a legal overseas citizens' organization of the DPRK, as a target of its \"anti-subversive activity law\" which is applied to an anti-state conspiratorial organization or espionage group, and is scheming to destroy it by mobilizing the \"Self-Defence Forces\" in an emergency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those moves trace their origin to the grave human rights crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have the legitimate right to make Japan apologize and compensate for the forcible drafting of Koreans, mass killings and drafting women as \"comfort women\" for the Japanese Imperial Army at any time and will surely exercise this right.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was a product of their idea of despising Koreans and their dominationist arbitrary practices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Candles reflecting hatred and indignation against the U.S. imperialist aggression troops remain burning in different parts of south Korea, lighting the nocturnal sky with grudge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they keep committing killings, defying that protest. This year witnessed an unbroken chain of crimes committed by GIs in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is working hard to hurl young south Koreans into the abyss of death in Iraq while GIs in south Korea are hell-bent on killing civilians there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality calls on the south Korean people to rise up in fierce anti-U.S. resistance for their own security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A commentary of Minju Joson urges the U.S. to punish the killer and fully apologize and compensate for the murder if it sincerely admits the crime and feels responsible for it. The U.S. forces should be forced out of south Korea. This is the only way for the south Korean people to get rid of misfortune and pain, it adds.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He even cried that the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK would not be excluded.\r\n Coinciding with this, the U.S. Department of Defense again declared its stand that the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea was impossible and Armitage and other senior officials of the Bush administration demanded the deployment of more armed forces in the Asia-Pacific region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today in a signed commentary notes that the DPRK would not be indifferent to their remarks that openly manifested the Bush administration's invariable scheme to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The strengthening of the U.S.-Japan and U.S.-south Korea security alliance cried for by the U.S. hard-line conservative forces means nothing but tightened military tie-up, which is aimed at crushing the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It must not go unnoticed that those hard-line conservative forces in the U.S. are crying for the \"possible use of nuclear weapons\" against the DPRK even now when the U.S.-DPRK nuclear issue is on the order of the day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dialogue can never go with pressure. Under the present situation, the DPRK cannot but strengthen its self-defense capabilities in every way in order to cope with at any time the U.S. moves to crush the DPRK which are getting more desperate behind the curtain of dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately give up its scheme to destroy the DPRK and make a sincere approach to a solution to the nuclear issue between the two countries, looking straight into the present situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Only the total dissolution of the \"National Assembly\" and its early election are the right way of redressing the confused political situation, achieving social stability and saving the people from the depth of misery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our people are the master of this land and motive force of history and they are responsible for remoulding the corruptive \"National Assembly\" and \"politics.\" History has already proved how strong and mighty the people are. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The people of all social strata should resolutely turn out in the struggle to judge the GNP mocking at and deceiving the people and only pursuing its interests, dissolve the \"National Assembly\" turning its back on the popular sentiments and hold an early \"election\" to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only destruction awaits the GNP which looks down upon the people and turns against them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
