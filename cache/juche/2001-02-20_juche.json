            "content": "KCNA on certain forces' anti-reunification utterances in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 20 (KCNA) -- Certain forces in South Korea do not bother to make reckless utterances on the issue of \"return visit to Seoul.\"\r\n Displeased with the implementation of the historic June 15 joint declaration and the development of the north-south relations into ones of reconciliation and cooperation, they went the length of putting what they called \"precondition\" on the \"return visit\" and asserting that the visit should not take place.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Moreover, the former President of South Korea did not hesitate to let loose a string of reckless remarks that \"some unfortunate thing may happen,\" talking about the issue of \"personal safety.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the military boss of South Korea is becoming more assertive for anti-north confrontation, maintaining that the theory of \"principal enemy\" should not be withdrawn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It cannot but be a surprise to the DPRK that those utterances are openly made quite unhindered at the \"national assembly\" of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This, in fact, means that they have no intention to sit with the north. This can not be construed otherwise than a premeditated and deliberate provocation intended to put a brake on the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, bring the inter-Korean relations back to those of confrontation and thus drive the situation to an unpredictable phase. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that the inter-Korean relations can not develop smoothly nor the points agreed upon between the north and the south be implemented as scheduled under such situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK set this year as a year of opening the door of reunification by concerted efforts of the entire nation and is making positive efforts to implement the historic joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such stand of the DPRK has won the unanimous support and positive response from the people from all walks of life in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If some forces in South Korea persist in their highly disturbing anti-DPRK campaign quite contrary to the trend of the times, they will get nothing but a shameful frustration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are well advised to stop at once such foolish utterances which only remind one of a puppy knowing no fear of a tiger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK once again clarifies that it will remain true to the spirit of the historic Pyongyang meeting and make all efforts to implement the joint declaration but it will be merciless if anyone goes against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The responsibility for the ups and downs the inter-Korean relations may undergo in future and the possible failure to implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration will totally rest with the provokers and those who cooperate with them and connive at them.    \r\n\r\n"

It is well known to everyone that similar views were expressed by Japanese politicians in the past only to stir up furore and protest at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the international community dismisses the view of Japan and its politicians on history as totally wrong and describes them as political dwarfs avoid of sincere will to repent of and apologize for the history of the past aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The point at issue is why Japan is letting loose a string of rubbish in a bid to beautify and justify the history of the past aggression in the new century, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' aim is to launch a war of reinvasion against the DPRK and other Asian countries at any cost in order to realize their old dream in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Norota's remark goes to prove that he is keen on realizing the old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's history of aggression is still fresh in the memory of the Korean and other Asian peoples. They will heighten vigilance against the Japanese reactionaries' ambition for militarist aggression, never pardon them, but bury them forever, if they try to repeat the past history.    \r\n\r\n"

He published more than 890 works from June Juche 53 (1964), when he started his work at the central committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, to June Juche 83 (1994). His famous work \"On The Juche Idea\" (march 1982) is a typical one showing his outstanding &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ideological and theoretical wisdom. This work systematizes in an integral way the Juche idea founded by President Kim Il Sung and newly clarifies the socio-historical outlook based on the position and role of the popular masses and the guiding principle and method in the revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s, he published works including \"Socialism Is a Science\" (November 1994) and \"Abuses Of Socialism Are Intolerable\" (March 1993), clearly indicating the road of the progressive humankind in the movement for the rebuilding of socialism and in accomplishing the cause of global independence under the complicated world political situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea that everything is decided by ideology, the theory that the leader is the top brain of the popular masses, the principle that the driving force of the revolution is the integral whole of the leader, the party and the masses and the theory of seed, which means the core of literary and art works, are a clear proof of the greatness of the ideological and theoretical exploits performed by Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n"
