In this regard Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a signed commentary: The claim made by the Japan Defense Agency is nothing but sophism making a profound confusion of right and wrong and part of a vicious smear campaign against the DPRK.\r\n The ultra right forces of Japan have launched a campaign for visits of 200,000 people to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\" on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the defeat of the Japanese imperialists while the LDP committee for drafting a new constitution formally made public a \"draft amendment to the constitution\" aimed at legislating on the possession of regular armed forces and militarizing the Japanese society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What remains to be done now is just to get a chance for launching military reinvasion. It is in pursuance of this aim that the Japanese warlike forces are painting the DPRK as a \"major factor of instability\" under the absurd pretext of \"military threat\" from it.\r\n Japan predicts that its moves to grab others' territories for its territorial expansion may spark regional disputes and, furthermore, lead to armed conflicts to bring irrevocable serious consequences to Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of crafty and shameless nature of Japan to term the DPRK \"factor of instability\" though the former is chiefly to blame for threatening peace and stability in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to bear in mind that the reinvasion to be launched by it at any cost, seized by its inveterate bad habit, would only entail disastrous consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
