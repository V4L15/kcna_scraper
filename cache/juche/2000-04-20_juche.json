K. Shastri, secretary of the central committee of the All-India Forward Bloc, stressed in his statement that the signed agreement on holding the north-south summit talks is a victory of the policy put forward by the great leader Kim Jong Il to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country through great unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il set forth the five-point policy of great national unity to carry out the instructions given by the President Kim Il Sung for national reunification and this policy is enjoying full support from  all the Koreans in the north, south and abroad, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the north-south summit talks are to be held in conformity with the desire of all the Korean people, the South Korean authorities should, first of all, repeal the \"security law,\" a roadblock in the way of Korea's reunification, and shift the anti-communist confrontation policy into reconciliation policy for alliance with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo put forward by President Kim Il Sung is the most fair and reasonable one for Korea's reunification under the condition in which different systems exist in the north and the south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   O. P. Mantri, secretary general of the Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification, in his statement pointed out that the inter-Korean summit talks should be held in accordance with the three principles of national reunification and the 10-point programme of the great national unity brought out by President Kim Il Sung and the policy of national reunification of the respected Kim Jong Il so that they may bring joy to all the Korean people who earnestly desire the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He called upon the South Korean chief executive to deal with the talks on the principle of national independence and with sincere stand on relieving pain of the fellow countrymen. \r\n\r\n"

In 1946, 77 percent of school-age children were enlisted in the 6-year elementary educational network and at least 556,000 working people in the adult educational network. \r\n\r\n"
