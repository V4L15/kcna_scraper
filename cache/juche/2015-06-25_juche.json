I feel deep remorse at the failure to show Kim Jong Il this wonderful terminal, he said, adding:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The leader would have been very glad to hear that the airport was built wonderfully like this by our own efforts. His smiling image is vivid before my eyes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un gave his thanks on behalf of the Party Central Committee to the soldier-builders, officials of commissions, ministries and national institutions and working people who built the terminal as a model edifice in the Songun era to be proud of before the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the need to ensure the management and operation of the terminal in a good manner, he specified the tasks and ways for having a splendid ceremony for its inauguration on July 1 and starting the aviation service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He ardently called for building many edifices symbolic of the thriving and highly-civilized country by whipping up the creative zeal for the Korean speed exerted in the construction of the terminal and thus significantly adorning the venue of the grand October festival.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Pak Pong Ju, Kim Yang Gon, Ri Jae Il, Ri Pyong Chol, Kim Yo Jong and Jo Yong Won."

As the U.S. imperialists' moves have reached a serious phase that can no longer be overlooked, the NDC of the DPRK said as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. We state to the world that the army and people of the DPRK will launch a nationwide anti-U.S. struggle on a new higher stage to foil the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy toward the DPRK and their unprecedented moves to isolate and stifle it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 25 indicts the U.S. imperialists for their ferocity, cruelty and barbarity and makes the army and people of the DPRK to give vent to the pent-up wrath and hatred.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the U.S. imperialists are working with bloodshot eyes to make the past crime-woven history repeat itself by igniting another war, far from apologizing with their knees bent for their thrice-cursed crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is bracing for a nuclear war and even a modern germ warfare to exterminate the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The new stage of the anti-U.S. struggle will lead to a just confrontation for ending the long history of the DPRK-U.S. stand-off for the victory of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The U.S. should, though belatedly, repeal its hostile policy toward the DPRK that can never come true, and raise a white flag before history and the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK are not what they used to be in the past when they had no state, being under the jackboots of outsiders as they had not enough rifles and swords.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better face up to the reality and stop running amuck.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It would be the best policy for it to immediately repeal its desperate hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has to withdraw the war scenario targeting the DPRK and stop the reckless nuclear war racket which it has kicked up on the land and in the sea and air.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better look back with a cool head what its hostile policy toward the DPRK has entailed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It should pay heed to the warning of the DPRK that it is ready for a conventional war, nuclear war and cyber warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The only way for the U.S. to take is to make apology before the army and people of the DPRK and hoist a white flag.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. We appeal to the world to turn out in the worldwide anti-U.S. struggle to dismember the gangster U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the most shameless chieftain of aggression and war and ill-famed architect of provocation and destruction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not time to get afraid of the U.S. bluffing, blindly add voice to the U.S. unreasonable and brigandish sophism and dance to the tune of the U.S. acts of destruction and disturbance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is still not time to take to flunkeyism and submit to the U.S. to echo whatever it says.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever truly hopes for global peace and regional stability has to set right at an early date the dangerous situation on this planet plagued with bloodshed, disputes and upheavals by the U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asia should turn out to cut off the U.S. right hand, Africa should rise up to cut off the U.S. left land, the Mid-east has to cut off the U.S. ankles and Europe has to cut off the U.S. neck.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The whole world has to pool efforts to dismember the fatty monster U.S. imperialists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is just like a paper tiger easy to be crushed and set on fire.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhoever truly wishes for durable peace in the world, welfare of humankind and lasting security of posterity has to turn out in the anti-U.S. struggle in high spirits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will invariably stand in the van of the worldwide just struggle against the U.S. to build a peaceful world and defend genuine life of humankind."

At this time the Park Geun Hye group of south Korea staged a foul confrontation racket in total ignorance of the DPRK's magnanimity and sincerity as well as of the fellow countrymen's expectation and desire. This is a never-to-be-condoned treachery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the \"UN office for human rights performance in the north\", it is an illegal, plot-breeding tool the U.S. and its followers invented by abusing the name of the UN in an aim to stifle the DPRK, frightened at the invincible might of Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That is why various circles of south Korea have strongly opposed the establishment of the \"office\" intended to incite confrontation of social systems, spoil the north-south relations and invite a war, branding the \"office\" as an \"anti-north plot-breeding body in the guise of the UN\" and a \"deceive human rights tool for interference\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Many countries and Western media, too, have strongly rejected the UN's \"report on human rights in the north\", \"resolution on north Korean human rights performance\" and \"office for human rights performance in the north\" as deceptive since they were prompted by extreme prejudice and insidious political aims without any creditability.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK had already warned that the \"office\" would become a target of merciless strike from the moment it puts up nameplate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is no longer need to deal anything with those keen only on hysteric confrontation racket and what remains to be done is only the final showdown. This is the fixed will of all servicepersons and civilians in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group will have to entirely take the blame for all the ensuing catastrophic consequences in the north-south relations from this moment."

Y provoco la guerra de agresion anti-RPDC con el fin de eliminarla en su cuna y extender sus tentaculos de agresion al continente chino y a los vastos territorios de la ex Union Sovietica, determinados como blancos B y C. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta ambicion de EE.UU. vagabundea hasta hoy en la Peninsula Coreana como fantasma de agresion y guerra, o sea, como la politica de hostilidad y las provocaciones belicas anti-RPDC y la formacion del cerco estrategico sobre el continente asiatico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora pasa el limite el complot de EE.UU. de aislar y aplastar en lo politico a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLejos de sacar la leccion en su derrota sufrida en la pasada guerra coreana, desatada el 25 de junio de 1950, el imperio norteamericano intensifica incesantemente el nivel de aislamiento, bloqueo y aplastamiento anti-RPDC con el designio de provocar la segunda guerra coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon respecto a que llegan a la etapa insoslayable las maniobras de los imperialistas norteamericanos, el Comite de Defensa Nacional de la RPDC declara como lo siguiente:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Anunciamos a todo el mundo que entra en una nueva etapa elevada la lucha antiyanqui de nuestro ejercito y pueblo por frustrar la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC de los imperialistas norteamericanos gangsteriles y sus maniobras de aislamiento y aplastamiento sin precedentes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa pasada guerra coreana revela a todo el mundo la barbaridad del imperialismo norteamericano y explota la colera arraigada de nuestro ejercito y pueblo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos problematico es que EE.UU. se desespera por repetir la historia criminal del siglo pasado con la provocacion de la segunda guerra coreana, en lugar de pedir perdon por sus tremendos crimenes ya cometidos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio prepara la guerra nuclear y hasta la guerra bacteriologica moderna para exterminar a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nueva etapa de la lucha antiyanqui se extendera a la justa confrontacion dar el punto final a la historia de enfrentamiento RPDC-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. Aunque sea tarde, EE.UU. debe rendirse ante la historia y el pueblo coreano abandonando la politica hostil a la RPDC, nunca realizable con el paso de mucho tiempo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro ejercito y pueblo no son apatridas de ayer en que sufrian martirios nacionales por las fuerzas extranjeras por no tener armas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe actuar con prudencia viendo claramente la realidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLe seria un proceder clarividente renunciar sin demora la politica hostil a la RPDC que es imposible de realizar aunque pase mucho tiempo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl mismo tiempo, debe abandonar el plan de guerra de agresion y el alboroto de guerra nuclear en la tierra, el mar y el aire. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque sea ahora, debe reflexionar con serenidad sobre la consecuencia de su politica hostil a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo debe despreciar nuestra advertencia de que estamos listos para la guerra convencional, la nuclear y la cibernetica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. no tiene otro remedio mas que pedir perdon y rendirse ante el ejercito y pueblo coreanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. Exhortamos al mundo a levantarse en el enfrentamiento antiyanqui mundial para desmembrar al bandidesco imperialismo norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. es el caudillo de agresion y guerra y de provocacion y destruccion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora no se debe temer la fanfarroneria de EE.UU. ni unir las voces con sus injustas sofisterias gangsteriles ni incorporarse a sus actos de destruccion y perturbacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los que desean de veras la paz del mundo y la estabilidad de la region deben salvar cuanto antes las masacres, los conflictos y las guerras que se comenten en nuestro planeta por las bestias yanquis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsia, Africa, el Medio Oriente y Europa deben cortar el brazo derecho, el izquierdo, el tobillo y el cuello de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodo el mundo debe unir las fuerzas para descuartizar a EE.UU., tigre de papel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las personas que desean la paz duradera, el fomento del bienestar de la humanidad y la eterna seguridad de los descendientes deben levantarse en la lucha antiyanqui.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC estara para siempre al frente de la lucha antiyanqui mundial para defender el mundo pacifico y la vida autentica de los seres humanos."

            "content": "CRPP denuncia instalacion de \"Oficina de DDHH de ONU\" en Sur de Corea\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 25 de junio (ACNC) -- Pese a las reiteradas advertencias de la RPDC y el fuerte rechazo interno y externo, los compinches titeres surcoreanos instalaron por fin el pasado dia 23 en Seul la \"oficina de DDHH del Norte de Corea\" de la ONU, organo conspirador de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, las autoridades titeres y otros menganos y fulanos lo califican unanimemente como \"jalon historico\" y \"asistencia y cooperacion necesarias\". Tambien las fuerzas conservadoras incluyendo el \"Partido Saenuri\" tratan de aprovechar esta oportunidad para aprobar la \"ley de DDHH del Norte\" sometida a la consideracion de la \"Asamblea Nacional\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio yanqui y otras fuerzas hostiles expresan la \"bienvenida\" a la instalacion y revelan abiertamente el intento de aplastar la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa declaracion fechada 24 del Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria condena el presente complot como provocacion politica mas connotada contra la RPDC, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl CRPP califica el alboroto de los compinches titeres para instalar ese organo intrigante bajo el control del imperio como desafio a la dignidad y regimen de la RPDC y abierta declaracion de guerra para confrontarse hasta el final con ella, y lo condena en nombre de toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ocasion del 15o aniversario de la publicacion de la historica Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, aclaramos, a traves de la declaracion del gobierno de la RPDC, la posicion de principios y los remedios mas justos para salvar las relaciones intercoreanas en crisis seria y abrir la fase trascendental de la reconciliacion y la unidad nacionales bajo el ideal de \"Entre nosotros, los connacionales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando todos los connacionales aplauden esa declaracion y desean con ansiedad la mejora de relaciones de ambas partes coreanas, la horda de Park Geun-hye orquesto a plena luz la presente conspiracion, lo cual constituye un crimen antinacional jamas intolerable que nego totalmente nuestra magnanimidad y sinceridad y pisoteo despiadadamente la esperanza de los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"oficina de DDHH del Norte de Corea\" de la ONU es un organo conspirador inventado por el imperio y las fuerzas seguidoras, atemorizados ante el poderio invencible del cada dias mas prospero socialismo a estilo coreano centrado en las masas populares, abusando del nombre de la ONU con los datos falsos de un punado de las escorias humanas para aislar y aplastar la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor eso, diversos estratos surcoreanos la rechazaron como \"organo conspirador anti-Norte con el casco de la ONU\" y \"enganoso organo intervencionista en asuntos ajenos con la mascara de derechos humanos\" y se opusieron fuertemente a la instalacion de la \"oficina\" que incita la confrontacion de regimenes, destruye las relaciones intercoreanas y llama la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMuchos paises del mundo y hasta los medios de prensa occidentales insistieron en que el \"informe de DDHH del Norte\" de la ONU, la \"resolucion de DDHH del Norte\" y la \"oficina de DDHH del Norte\" no tienen la autenticidad porque fueron fabricados con el extremado perjuicio y el malsano intento politico. Y vinieron rechazandolos tenazmente insistiendo en que esos no pueden ser documentos y organos de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los compinches de Park instalaron por fin el organo conflictivo en Seul bajo la instigacion de su amo gringo y so pretexto de la \"peticion de la ONU\". Asi volvieron a poner al desnudo que ellos mismos son los maniacos conflictivos enloquecidos por el morboso veto y la hostilidad a su connacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe hizo mas oscura la perspectiva de las relaciones intercoreanas dado que se revelo mas claramente la intencion maligna de los compinches de Park de realizar a toda costa la ambicion de lograr la \"unificacion mediante la absorcion de regimenes\" sumandose a la campana intrigante de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa advertimos severamente que desde cuando se ponga la placa en la puerta, esa \"oficina\" se convertira en el blanco de ataque despiadado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa ferrea voluntad de los uniformados y civiles coreanos es que ya no tenemos la necesidad de encontrarse por mas tiempo con quienes cometen solo la histerica furia conflictiva al llevar a la fase catastrofica las relaciones intercoreanas y solamente se queda la liquidacion final.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesde este momento, los compinches titeres se responsabilizaran totalmente de las consecuencias catastroficas que se emanen de las relaciones intercoreanas."
