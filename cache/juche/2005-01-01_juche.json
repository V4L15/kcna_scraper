            "content": "Foreign Ministry Spokesman on Japan's Anti-DPRK Campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government recently announced \"results of thorough probe\" into the information and material evidence concerning the dead abductees handed over to it by the DPRK and clarified \"its stand and demand concerning the issue.\" We can neither accept nor admit the results and resolutely rejects them as the government reacts to our good faith with an immoral attitude, said a spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry in an answer given to a question raised by KCNA Thursday concerning the results.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the \"results of the probe\" cooked up to attain its political aim the Japanese government cried out for \"protest\" and \"strong counteraction.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The document called \"results of the probe\" is peppered with words totally negating the sincere efforts the DPRK has made for the reinvestigation into the issue of abduction and its results. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now denouncing the Japanese ultra-right forces as a group of cunning and cold-blooded guys. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion drawn by us through previous contacts with Japan is that Japan has exploited the DPRK's sincere attitude towards its dialogue partner for its political plots and hostile acts against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that it has become clear that the Japanese government has openly joined the ultra-right forces in their moves against the DPRK it no longer feels that any DPRK-Japan inter-governmental contact is meaningful. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government should return the remains of Yokota through an official channel as already demanded by the DPRK side and thoroughly probe into the truth behind the case of the fabricated \"DNA test\" of her remains and apologize for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government's above-mentioned warning against the DPRK is a very threatening and despicable provocation as it reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As we have already clarified, we are fully prepared to react to Japan's every provocation with physical strength.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Nat�fl Meeting Marks Anniversary of Kim Jong Il's Start of Songun Policy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 31 (KCNA) -- A national meeting took place at the April 25 House of Culture Friday to mark the 10th anniversary of the start of the\r\nunique Songun policy by leader Kim Jong Il.\r\n Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army Kim Il Chol, member of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and minister of the People's Armed Forces, made a report at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun policy of Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il is the unique political mode as he has carried forward the Songun idea which President Kim Il Sung set out when he was pioneering the Korean revolution and consistently maintained in the whole course of revolution and his Songun revolutionary leadership, thus further developing them in depth as required by the prevailing situation and the developing revolution, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only way of defending the country and the nation and emerging victorious to pursue the Songun policy. When a revolutionary army remains strong, there is nothing to fear even in case a ten million strong enemy comes in attack on us and even if the world changes a hundred times and it is quite possible to accomplish the cause of socialism. This is the main review of the decade- long history in which the great Songun policy has been in force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should invariably take the Songun idea as the lifeline of the Korean revolution and firmly uphold it and dynamically advance only along the road of the Songun revolution in any storm and stress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Party members, servicepersons and people should live and struggle as the Songun revolutionary soldiers sharing their destiny with Kim Jong Il and make the trait of the perfect unity based on comradeship centering around the leader prevail throughout the revolutionary ranks at all times, holding high the slogan \"Let's unite around the great Comrade Kim Jong Il!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should dynamically conduct the political and ideological offensive with main stress on the idea and thus shatter the vicious moves of the enemy to destabilize the DPRK and his psychological warfare and consolidate the ideological position of our revolution as firm as a rock. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should channel utmost efforts into increasing the People's Army to more firmly prepare our revolutionary armed forces as the army of the supreme commander and the strongest revolutionary armed forces both nominally and virtually and make the military position of our revolution steel-strong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to regard it as the primary strategic task before the revolution and construction to develop the defence industry guaranteeing the military capacity of the country and continue directing big efforts to strengthening and developing our defence industry into an independent and modern one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should thoroughly establish the trait of attaching importance to military affairs throughout the society, give full play to the traditional trait of the army-people unity, organize all work on the principle of giving priority to the military affairs with a view to augmenting the military power of the country in every way and consistently implementing the Party's policy of putting all people under arms and fortifying the whole country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on the whole Party, country and people to come out to bring about a signal turn in the nation's agricultural production, true to the Party's intention to direct all forces to farm work and reenergize the overall national economy to make new progress in socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will unite the whole nation as one under the banner of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, check and frustrate the separatist moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification through national cooperation without fail, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the situation on the Korean Peninsula is growing extremely tenser due to the evermore undisguised U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula can never be achieved, to say nothing of the improvement in the DPRK-U.S. relations, unless the U.S. makes a switchover in its hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will do our best to bolster the war deterrent force to cope with the prevailing situation while following the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK with high vigilance. If the U.S. ignites a war of aggression without discretion despite our repeated warnings, the army and people in the DPRK will make merciless annihilating strikes at the aggressors by mobilizing all the potentials they have built, pursuant to the Songun policy, and win a final victory in the confrontation with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attending the meeting were senior officials of the Party, the state and the army, chairpersons of the friendly parties and others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The planes involved in the espionage numbered 8 on Dec. 16 and 7 on Dec. 17, 23 and 28 on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such espionage proves that the U.S. imperialists' talk about \"dialogue\" and \"peaceful solution\" to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula is nothing but a smokescreen for covering up their moves for aggression against the DPRK and they are only giving spurs to their moves for a new war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
