            "content": "KCNA on U.S. much ado about human rights issue \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 29 (KCNA) -- The human rights commission of the U.S. House of Representatives held a hearing on the human rights situation in the DPRK on April 17.\r\n The chairman of the U.S. international association of religious freedom in a \"testimony\" told sheer lies about the human rights situation in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. termed the DPRK \"a country of poor human rights performance\" when it pulled up Iraq, Cuba and other countries over human rights issue at the meeting of the un commission on human rights held on April 8. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent racket over the human rights situation kicked up by the U.S. does not help settle the international human rights problem as it is part of the political burlesque escalated by the U.S., quite unaware of its real position as a country with the poorest human rights record in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only touches off the international community's bitter criticism of the U.S. human rights abuses because it has been censured for interfering in the internal affairs of those countries situated in the areas rich in natural resources and of military strategic importance and militarily involving itself in regional problems and disputes under the pretext of \"human rights situation.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the DPRK clarified more than once, there exists no \"human rights problem\" claimed by some dishonest forces of the U.S. in the DPRK nor can there be such a thing as its people lead an independent and creative life as the masters of the state and society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such being a stark fact, the U.S. has persistently pulled up the DPRK and other countries over \"human rights issues\". It does such a thing not because it is truly interested in human rights in other countries or has any qualification to settle international human rights problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through this arrogant interference in human rights the U.S. seeks to conceal the poor human rights performance in the U.S. and politically isolate those independent and anti-U.S. countries that stand in the way of realizing its strategy for world supremacy based on \"strength\" and invent a pretext for military intervention in other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is using such good term as \"human rights\" as a political leverage to carry out its unethical and aggressive policy against the global peace and the happiness of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clearly proved by historical facts that the U.S. put political and economic pressure, imposed sanctions, committed military intervention and provoked a war in such anti-U.S. independent countries as Cuba, Iraq, Libya and Yugoslavia and infringed upon the sovereignty and dignity of those independent states and inflicted a huge loss of lives and properties upon innocent people there under the pretext of \"human rights situation.\" tragic happenings in Afghanistan and Palestine also testify to the criminal role played by the U.S. as regards the \"human rights issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts strongly urge the u.s. to stop pursuing self-justified human rights policy aimed to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, styling itself a \"human rights judge\" of the international community, but respect the sovereignty of independent countries, the genuine human rights of those countries, and settle the human rights issue in its own country ridden with crimes and corruption to begin with.\r\n"

Yet, they are keen to make an armed attack on the DPRK while evading this responsibility. What they are now doing only adds to the crimes committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan opts for reinvasion, refusing to liquidate its past, the DPRK can not but take a strong countermeasure against it. If the Japanese reactionaries invade the inviolable land of the DPRK it will not miss the opportunity to wipe out the Japanese aggressors, the sworn enemy, to the last man with thousand-fold merciless retaliatory blows and vent the spite which has rankled deeply in the heart of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is well advised to stop its moves to enact the war law, not forgetting the lesson of history in which it went to ruin due to the war but facing up to the present reality. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
