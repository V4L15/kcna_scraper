            "content": "U.S. intention to scrap ABM treaty flayed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 7 (KCNA) -- The United States is making desperate efforts to scrap the ABM treaty, asserting that it is a \"leftover of the Cold War.\" \r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to build up public opinion to give impression that its mainland and allies are exposed to the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and some other countries, asserting that new Missile Defense system (MD) is needed to cope with it. But this is sheer sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not for \"defense\" that the U.S. is racking its brain to scrap the ABM treaty. its MD is aimed to contain nuclear powers, hold an unchallenged military edge over them and thus realise its ambition to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nuclear weapons are by no means monopoly of the U.S. few countries would be browbeaten by U.S. nuclear blackmail. That is why the U.S. is working so hard to establish the MD. It is its calculation that this will help realise with ease its ambition to dominate the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It seeks to scrap the ABM treaty and get Russia embroiled in an arms race in a bid to significantly weaken the potentials of Russia keen to build a powerful nation just as it pushed the former soviet union to collapse through arms race in the period of the Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is getting undisguised in its moves to scrap the treaty with the calculation that its stepped-up space militarization would help contain other big powers, establish unchallenged domination and pep up its staggering economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. does not bother to disclose that it will scrap the ABM treaty anytime it deems necessary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite clear that that will result in upsetting the world strategic equilibrium and sparking a fierce arms race even in space. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration's moves to increase the U.S. military spending to be the biggest in history and spark a new arms race from the outset of the new century clearly show how much it is obsessed by the ambition to dominate the world.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the inter-Korean ministerial talks are to be resumed at last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This constructive step of the north side has been warmly hailed at home and abroad since it was announced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, only some right-wing conservatives of the \"Grand National Party\" in South Korea described this reunification-oriented proposal of the north side as a step intended to save someone of the south side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We, on behalf of the nation, bitterly denounce this criminal act of the anti-reunification forces of the \"GNP\" who, dead-set against the implementation of the joint declaration warmly welcomed by the entire nation, vilify even the resumption of dialogue between the north and the south authorities, a step taken in reflection of the unanimous desire of the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already clarified, the DPRK Council for National Reconciliation holds that the agreed points of the joint press release adopted at the recent festival should be put into practice as soon as possible. So, it proposes the organizations and personages concerned of the south side to have working-level contacts on Mt. Kumgang in order to hold a north-south symposium on dominium over Tok Islet, for the present, and co-host a grand function for commemorating the national foundation day at king Tangun's mausoleum on October 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We express the expectation that pro-reunification movements and other organizations and personages of South Korea will join us in the vigorous advance along the road of the independent reunification of the nation in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We also strongly urge the public security authorities of South Korea to take a proper attitude toward the festival participants who contributed to the development of the national reunification movement and immediately release the arrested delegates to the August 15 grand festival for national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
