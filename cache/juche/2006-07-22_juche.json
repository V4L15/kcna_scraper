This portcall is stirring up the deep concern of the public at home and abroad as it fully revealed the intention of the U.S. imperialists to further strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula and thus realize their ambition to start a nuclear war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

No other country but the DPRK has firmly defended socialism in face of constant high-handed military blackmail and aggressive threat by the U.S. imperialists for decades. The U.S. imperialists would have already attacked the DPRK many a time, if it had not built up colossal self-reliant defense capacity. It was entirely right for the DPRK to have boosted its self-reliant defense capabilities in every way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  No one can take issue with the DPRK over its defense building for smashing down the moves of the U.S. imperialists to unleash another Korean war and ensuring peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia as it is a legitimate exercise of the right to self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peace-loving and progressive people worldwide should fight relentlessly to ensure world peace and security by offering a tough rebuff with military might to the reckless \r\nmilitary highhandedness of the imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
