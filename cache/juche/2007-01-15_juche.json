If the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning is allowed, it will weaken the faith of people in the cause of independence against imperialism and disarm them ideologically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their ideological and cultural poisoning may produce such serious results as deteriorating and disintegrating socialism, destroying the faith of the people in socialism and, furthermore, overthrowing the socialist system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years \"coloring revolution\" such as \"rose revolution\" and \"orange revolution\" took place in an unbroken chain in different countries, bringing about regime changes there.

This is a very dangerous military step taken to reorganize the \"Self-Defence Forces\" into the offensive armed forces and prepare them so that they may be mobilized for a war of aggression any time.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The militarists in the land of Japs has described their country as a \"pacifist state\" while crying for \"peace\" but they are now refusing to say the word \"peace\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, they neither strove for peace nor wanted Japan to remain a pacifist state. Day and night they have been hell-bent on whetting the sword of reinvasion and made desperate efforts to create international circumstances favorable for it. The Japanese ruling quarters have not liquidated the past crimes though half a century has passed after the war but beautified and whitewashed the Japanese imperialists' history of aggression and justified it and become evermore pronounced in their moves to instill the militarist idea into the Japanese through visits to the \"Yasukuni Shrine\". These are aimed at creating the political and military circumstances to realize their ambition for reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Defence Ministry is to exercise its authority as the supreme armed forces organ in Japan, it can send armed forces to necessary regions and, furthermore, mobilize manpower and material resources of the country to war under the order and instruction of the prime minister without \"approval\" of the Diet which has been kept nominally. This is little different from the war commanding system which the Japanese imperialists established in the country before the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists set forth preemptive attack as a new military principle and seek to put it into practice. That is why the ruling quarters of the land of Japs upgraded the Defence Agency to a ministry before the abolition of the \"pacifist constitution\" and, on this basis, are trying to put greater spurs to scrap it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they opt for the territorial expansion, obsessed with the ambition for reinvasion, far from drawing a lesson from the past defeat, Japan will fall into a bottomless abyss.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) issued a statement Saturday blasting the United States for on-going introduction of a wing of F-117 Stealth fighter bombers and at least 300 support personnel into south Korea.\r\n The U.S. introduction of this type of war hardware which earned an ill-fame in its war of aggression is a dangerous military move blatantly challenging the aspiration and desire of all the fellow countrymen and humankind for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue and the peace on the Korean Peninsula as it is aimed at putting its scenario for a war against the DPRK into practice, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On behalf of the whole nation aspiring after the peace and reunification of the country the CPRF strongly condemns the U.S. bellicose elements for driving the situation to the brink of war through their reckless arms buildup and military provocations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., driven to a corner at home and abroad, is keen to seek a way out in igniting a new war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the U.S. intends to let the above-said Stealth fighter bombers participate in the largest-ever south Korea-U.S. RSOI slated to take place in coming spring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to clearly prove that the \"peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue\" much touted by the U.S. is nothing but window-dressing to deceive the world people and its real intention is to realize its aggressive ambition for putting the whole of Korea under its control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is ready both for war and dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. opts for a war of aggression against the DPRK despite its repeated warnings and the unanimous condemnation of the public at home and abroad, it will not be able to escape an irrevocable defeat.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Shameless Stance Taken over Issue of Its Base Transfer under Fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 13 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the North Headquarters of the Nationwide Special Committee for Probing the Truth behind the GIs' Crimes made public a statement today blasting the shameless and brigandish stance taken by the U.S. over the issue of transfer of its military base in south Korea.\r\n Some days ago, the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea at a press conference with Korean and foreign reporters blustered that American servicemen and their families no longer want to live in the outdated and environmentally unfriendly base. Should the agreement the U.S. signed with south Korea on the transfer of its military base to Phyongthaek by 2008 is not implemented due to political reasons or the financial problem, the former would stand up against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman said that this is a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation and an intolerable insult to the south Korean people as it betrayed the true colors of the U.S. as an arrogant ruler of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing facts to prove that for over 60 years of their presence in different parts of south Korea the U.S. forces have polluted its environment and devastated its land, he went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Far from apologizing and compensating for these crimes before the Korean nation, the U.S. is pressurizing south Korea to cover huge expenses for the transfer of the base and keen to usurp new land including Phyongthaek for its military bases of aggression. Worse still, it is making threatening remarks over the delay made in the implementation of the agreement. This is like a thief crying \"stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He demanded the U.S. immediately withdraw its troops from south Korea instead of transferring its military base.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It stressed that the federation will wage a vigorous struggle to reveal the seriousness and true nature of the Japanese authorities' crackdown upon Chongryon and stir up the public opinion against it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Lurking behind it is their heinous political intention to justify by all means the extreme sanctions against the DPRK taken to toe the U.S. line and tarnish the daily-growing dignity of the DPRK and remove Chongryon and the Korean community from Japan at any cost by taking advantage of this opportunity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Provoking the dignity of Chongryon means violating the sovereignty of the DPRK, and to deprive the Korean residents of their rights immediately means to encroach upon the right of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the reactionaries of the island country, toeing the U.S. line and seeking a foolish political delusion to provoke someone, continue to be hostile toward the DPRK, Chongryon and Koreans in Japan, the Korean working class and trade union members will deal a stern punishment and strong retaliation on them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to clearly see through the reality, stop at once the unethical and inhumane persecution and suppression of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and adequately apologize and compensate for the crimes Japan committed against the Korean nation in the past.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
