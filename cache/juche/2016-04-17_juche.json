            "content": "S. Korean Regime Urged to Send back Abductees of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, April 17 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) Sunday released a statement hitting out at the Park Geun Hye group of traitors for becoming all the more undisguised in their confrontation and conspiratorial racket.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group recently committed a hideous abduction against the DPRK. It lured into other country in the most despicable and brutal manner DPRK's employees of a restaurant in Ningbo, Zhejiang Province of China in collusion with brokers active there, before abducting them into south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement branded this as an inhuman act that can be committed only by such fascist tyrant as Park Geun Hye and the group of ferocious terrorists and gangsters such as the puppet Intelligence Service.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Park group is working hard to mislead public opinion by describing the case as \"a group defection from the north\" and \"substantial effect of sanctions\" and \"skepticism about north's social system\", \"reflection of yearning\" for the south Korean society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for those abductees, they are talents who grew up in happiness while learning to their heart's content under the care of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There can be no socio-political and economic reason for them to be \"skeptical\" about the social system and about their beloved parents and family members as they have enjoyed a highly stable life under the social system in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, they are the women with pure conscience as they have never imagined that they would be taken to such horrible hell as south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The abduction of the citizens of the DPRK is an extension and vivid manifestation of the hideous \"north policy\" of Park Geun Hye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The CPRK clarifies its crucial stand as follows under the prevailing gruesome situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. Park Geun Hye and her group must apologize for the unprecedented group abduction and immediately and unconditionally send them back.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If Park and her group keep them in custody and persecute them in a bid to press them into defection and cause harm to their physical condition even a bit, the Park group will be made to pay dearly for the crime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The Park Geun Hye group must sternly punish those involved in the allurement and abduction and backstage wire-pullers or hand them over to the law enforcement organ of the DPRK side and make assurances against the recurrence of similar crimes to the DPRK and the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case those involved in the allurement and abduction and back-stage wire-pullers are neither handed over to the DPRK side nor punished, and no assurances are given against the recurrence of similar crimes, the DPRK will consider the recent case was committed at the direct instruction of Chongwadae and it is an expression of the intention to keep abducting DPRK citizens in the future, too, and will take thousand-fold retaliatory measures targeting Chongwadae.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The Park Geun Hye group must clearly understand the will of the army and people of the DPRK to annihilate the enemies and must stop running riot.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never remain an on-looker to our citizens falling victim to political conspiracy after being abducted in group in broad daylight and taken to such a veritable hell as south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The infuriated army and people of the DPRK are closely following every movement of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will never tolerate the recent terrorist gangster-like act but will certainly force the criminals to pay a dear price.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the Park group of traitors keeps DPRK citizens in custody, defying the just demand of the DPRK, the group will have to pay an unimaginably high price."

            "content": "IAPIC revela verdad de sofisteria anti-RPDC de EE.UU. y satelites\r\nPyongyang, 17 de abril (ACNC) -- El Instituto de Asuntos Politicos Internacionales de Corea (IAPIC) hizo publica el dia 17 un acta de acusacion que revela los verdaderos aspectos de las calumnias y sofisterias de Estados Unidos y sus satelites contra Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y sus seguidores hablan tan ruidosamente de la \"provocacion\" y \"amenaza\" de la RPDC, lo cual es una sofisteria cinica y bandolera que convierte lo negro en lo blanco, critica el documento y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste proceder parte del temor extremo a la RPDC que se hace cada dia mas fuerte y persigue el objetivo asqueroso de asfixiarla y sepultarla movilizando hasta las gentuzas de toda indole. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"violacion de la ley internacional y de la resolucion de la ONU\" de la RPDC, de que hablan tanto EE.UU. y otras fuerzas hostiles, no pasa de ser una provocacion infundada e injusta de quienes no saben nada del fundamento, ni la esencia del orden politico internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEso no pasa de ser una terquedad perversa y abierto chantaje a la RPDC que no obedece al despotismo y arbitrariedades de si mismos ni al orden centrado en EE.UU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos Estados criminales mas anormales y malos en este mundo son EE.UU. y sus seguidores que convierten el globo terraqueo en el planeta donde reina la ley de la selva sin tener en consideracion los derechos y convenios internacionales por la igualdad y la paz. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl rumor de \"inestabilidad del regimen norcoreano\", que EE.UU. y sus lacayos difunden como hecho consumado en varias oportunidades, es una tonteria de quienes se ilusionan como realidad su sueno en espera ansiosa del \"derrumbe del regimen\" de la RPDC en varios decenios. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo ya reconocen los compatriotas y los extranjeros, la RPDC no sufrio ni un pequeno titubeo politico, inestabilidad social, caos ni tumulto aun en medio de las severas pruebas y dificultades y pasando numerosos periodos mas penosos que la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Al contrario, en el corrupto sistema politico capitalista ocurren incesantemente la lucha antigubernamental y la resistencia popular de grandes y pequenos tamanos y toda la sociedad va sacudiendose y derribandose debido a la irreparable confusion y crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los disparates de EE.UU. y la banda de Park Geun-hye contra nuestra linea de desarrollo paralelo de la construccion economica y la de las fuerzas armadas nucleares no pasan de ser los alaridos agonizantes de los enajenados por el desarrollo deslumbrante y la victoria final de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Si ellos desean cuestionar tanto la realidad de la RPDC, no les retendremos sino les aconsejamos hablar solo de lo que hayan presenciado con sus ojos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La puerta de Pyongyang esta abierta de par en par e indulgentemente a quienes criticaron a la RPDC habitualmente o siguiendo a ciegas a alguien en el pasado. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A pesar de tal magnanimidad y paciencia, si uno que sea un individuo, una entidad o un Estado, sigue censurando nuestra idea y regimen sagrados y puros para lograr el mas sucio y vil objetivo y recurriendo a la demagogia anti-RPDC con la movilizacion de varias organizaciones internacionales y hasta los medios de agitacion venales, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no lo toleraran nunca y le hara pagar sin falta el precio merecido."
