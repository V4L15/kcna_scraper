It also imprisoned eleven people including Pak Thae Hyon, Chairman of the Puchon Democratic Society of Young Workers because they formed the society and conducted pro-reunification activites. It charged them with the violation of the notorious \"National Security Law\".\r\n   In a commentary the daily says it was only too natural that Hanchongryon students demonstrated their patriotic will for reunification through the inaugural ceremony and their activities can never be branded as a \"violent demonstration\".\r\n   The daily continues:\r\n   It is the Kim Young Sam regime that should be punished. \r\n   It, prompted by the ambition for invading the north and unifying the country under the \"liberal democratic system\", is fostering confrontation and pursuing \"north-south closed-door policy.\r\n   The fascist regime's suppression of patriotic-minded students and young workers is nothing but its last-ditch effort for emerging from the crisis.    \r\n\r\n"

The western style can never be a criterion now when each country and each nation is shaping its own destiny and making independent development, says the daily.\r\n   In an article the daily says:\r\n   The imperialists, who describe the western style as the yardstick for international life, put a yellow label on those nations that go against it and reduce them to the victims of their sanction and pressure. This shows their brazen-faced dominationist ambition.\r\n   The western-style democracy and equality the bourgeois politicians are advertising are only things for camouflaging the reactionary nature of the political mode of bourgeois dictatorship and the anti-social nature of the capitalist system.\r\n   \"Human rights\" is another style the imperialists use as means of interference and pressure against other nations, regarding it as international standards.\r\n   Western-style human rights is, in essence, bourgeois human rights. It is the privileged rights of a handful of those with money and power.\r\n   As each country has different history, political, economic, cultural development, life and style, there can never be any standards of human rights.\r\n   The imperialists are not entiled to talk about \"human rights\" because they do not give the working masses even elementary freedom, democracy and vital rights but pursue anti-social policies, racial and national discrimination, aggression and domination.\r\n   They are describing western culture as \"model of human culture\" and \"universal culture\" and advertising the western style of cultural life as standards of the world's cultural life.\r\n   They intend to degenerate the people ideologically and mentally and make the western culture prevail in the world by spreading the western culture and style of life in other countries.\r\n   Bourgeois culture benumbs the people's healthy thinking faculty, contaminates their mind and reduce them to mental cripples. It is also inhuman and unethic reactionary culture which makes the mental and cultural life poor.\r\n   The imperialists' advertisement of the western style of cutural life as the standards of the world's cultural life is an insult to humankind.\r\n   It is an act going against history that they embellish the western style and force it on the world to obliterate the Juche character and the national character of other countries and turn the world into a western-style \"liberal world\" under their control.    \r\n \r\n"
