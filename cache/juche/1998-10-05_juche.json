            "content": "DPRK will accept humanitarian offer\r\nPyongyang, October 5 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee of the DPRK had an interview with KCNA today over false reports broadcast by some countries after the organisation \"Medicines Sans Frontiers\" (MSF) withdrew from the DPRK at the end of emergency medical assistance.\r\n   He told KCNA:\r\n   The MSF stayed in the DPRK for emergency offer of medical and pharmaceutical products to the DPRK in temporary difficulties caused by years of natural disasters.\r\n   Their assistance encouraged the Korean people in the effort to heal the aftereffect of natural disasters at an early date. We are grateful for their assistance.\r\n   The assistance from international agencies and donor nations is effectively used to help the DPRK not only overcome the present difficulties but also attain the objective of reaching the pre-disaster level at an early date.\r\n   Recently, the government asked the international community for assistance aimed at increasing the DPRK's capacity of agricultural production, decided to use the medical assistance to increase the local capacity as in the agricultural sector and asked international agencies and donor nations for assistance.\r\n   The international community favors this effort of the DPRK.\r\n   Under this policy of the government, the Flood Damage Rehabilitation Committee asked William Claus from the MSF in Brussels who visited the DPRK in early August for discussions on future assistance, to end the assistance that was underway and to offer raw material for pharmaceutical production in the next stage. That would markedly increase the effect of assistance funds in the economic aspect.\r\n   He expressed understanding about that proposal and replied that as his organisation was to offer medical and pharmaceutical products in the form of emergency assistance, not raw material for medicines, his organisation would withdraw at the end of the assistance and that he would introduce another relief organisation which can offer raw material for medicines.\r\n   That was why the MSF withdrew from the DPRK.\r\n   This being the fact, U.S., British and some other western mass media broadcast incoherent reports that the DPRK expelled the MSF and that the MSF suspended the assistance and withdrew because it was not allowed to treat cases of malnutrition and relief medicines and food were diverted to troops and specific quarters.\r\n   Now a certain donor agency calls for suspending food assistance to the DPRK, alleging that relief food is diverted to the army.\r\n   We consider this to be an act prompted by hostile forces hell-bent on frustrating humanitarian assistance to the DPRK. \r\n   Humanitarian assistance agencies that stay in the DPRK are free to go to the areas under their concern, unless any special problem occurs, and relief materials are distributed to relevant areas.\r\n   Humanitarian assistance should be given from the humanitarian point of view in the true sense of the word.\r\n   If donor organisations give us humanitarian assistance, We will accept it gratefully, and if not, we will not beg for it. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is exercise of an internationally recognised right of a sovereign state to self-reliance and poses no threat to anyone.\r\n   Kang In Dok's outcry about \"missile threat\" from the north is a sheer lie and shameless remark reversing black and white.\r\n   His talk about possible \"failure\" of the satellite launch and \"strike\" was motivated by his criminal intention to belittle the world-startling success of the DPRK, incite confrontation with fellow countrymen and inveigle the Japanese reactionaries in this hostile campaign. \r\n\r\n"
