Ademas demuestra abiertamente su intento criminal de aprovechar el Servicio Nacional de Inteligencia para reprimir la lucha \"antigubernamental\" de los habitantes de diferentes clases vinculandola con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdelanta asi el portavoz de la Sociedad de Medidas de DDHH en el Sur de Corea en su nota publicada el dia 3, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo problematico es que tal locura fascista se torna mas indiscriminada y horrorosa despues de que la mandataria surcoreana insulto a los habitantes opuestos a su politica antipopular comparandolos con los terroristas del \"Estado islamico\" y dio la orden represiva parloteando que \"nunca estaria con brazos cruzados ante el hecho\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa represion violenta, que se comete en el suelo surcoreano, es un desafio intolerable a los derechos humanos y la democracia siendo la imprudencia fascista de aplastar despiadadamente a los habitantes en lucha contra la resucitacion de la dictadura de \"renovacion\" y la infame politica antipopular y mantener la gobernacion traidora de las fuerzas conservadoras en el poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa represion y locura fascistas se resucitan hoy dia en el Sur de Corea y estas pisotean cruelmente la dignidad y los derechos de la poblacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la gobernacion antipopular, antidemocratica y antietica de la banda conservadora en el poder, el territorio surcoreano se ha convertido en la peor tundra y zona de represion de DDHH en este mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy natural que la poblacion surcoreana se movilice en la lucha masiva en protesta a las fuerzas conservadoras en el poder que violan los derechos humanos y llevan la vida del pueblo a la miseria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa violencia antipopular de los gobernantes conservadores surcoreanos causara la protesta mas grande y la lucha de las indignantes opiniones publicas y no podra evitar la condena y el repudio fuerte de los connacionales y la sociedad internacional."
