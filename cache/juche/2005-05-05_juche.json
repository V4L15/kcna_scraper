            "content": "Cooperation for Peace against War Called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 4 (KCNA) -- Cooperation for peace against war is a patriotic cause aimed at shattering the evermore reckless moves of the U.S. and Japanese aggressive forces for a war by the concerted efforts of the Koreans, defending the peace of the country and the security of the nation and achieving the reunification of the country, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n Now that the United States is getting overheated in its moves to ignite a new war, cooperation for peace against war presents itself as a vital task to defend the security of the Korean nation and dynamically advance the cause of independent national reunification, the article says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a vital issue related to the existence of the Korean nation and its development to oppose aggression and war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the enemy of peace and an empire of evils because it is engrossed in aggression, war, murder and destruction in all parts of the world while challenging the aspiration of humankind for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously threatening the life and security of other countries and nations with war moves. It is becoming more reckless in these moves in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Opposing aggression and war and defending peace on the peninsula where the danger of a nuclear war is increasing day by day is the most important issue related to the fate of the nation and, at the same time, a pressing issue in achieving the concord, reunification and co-prosperity of the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation for peace against war presents itself as a vital task for shattering the U.S. moves for a war against the DPRK and defending the peace and the security of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to defend peace against war represents a cause common to the nation, not one for any of the two sides of Korea. Foreign forces' moves for aggression and war are by no means aimed to do harm to the DPRK alone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nForeign forces are working hard without hesitation to force all the Koreans in the north and the south to fall victim to a nuclear war in a bid to achieve their goal for aggression. If a war is ignited by foreign forces on this land, all the Koreans in the north and the south and the whole land will suffer from its disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. bellicose elements and the Japanese reactionaries are keen on their moves to unleash a war against the DPRK while cooperating with each other in the drive to invade it, cooperation between the north and the south is essential for peace against war and no Korean is, therefore, allowed to turn aside from it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
