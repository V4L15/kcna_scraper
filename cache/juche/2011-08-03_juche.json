Not a few students are expelled from schools for failing to pay the yearly sky-rocketing school expenses. 200-300 students commit suicides out of despair in a year. There are also not a few parents of students who commit suicides, driven to despair after failing to pay school expenses for their children. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean students are now turning out in the actions to put an end to the traitorous rule of the present ruling quarters bringing misfortunes and sufferings to them and build a new society where everybody enjoys worthwhile life, given an ample opportunity of learning."
