But Japan has not sincerely and clearly redressed its past crimes. This is quite contrary to human conscience calling for the liquidation of its past wrongs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is obliged to redress the crimes committed against Korea in the past. This is the focal point in owning its responsibility for the past aggression and war crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration was adopted as a result of Japanese Prime Minister Koizumi's visit to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis marked a landmark event as it meant a new start of the history of the DPRK-Japan relations. Japan's redress for its crimes is the core of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration and the master key to normalizing the DPRK-Japan relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the dishonest forces and right-wing forces in Japan are hamstringing the implementation of the declaration from a negative stand on it. They are projecting such secondary and unessential matters as the issue of several kidnapped persons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey did not bother to let loose provocative war outcries that the Japan-U.S. joint military drills are aimed to deter North Korean aggression and \"Japan may fight a war against it under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Confrontation and war will only lead Japan to ruin.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. accused of standing in way of Korea's reunification\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 7 (KCNA) -- The DPRK National Reunification Institute released a white paper on Dec. 6 accusing the U.S. of more desperately blocking peace and reunification of Korea.\r\n The U.S., displeased with the adoption of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, has worked hard to hamstring its implementation, the paper said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon hearing the news that the Pyongyang meeting of the top leaders of the north and the south had been scheduled under the April 8, 2000, inter-Korean agreement the U.S. blamed the South Korean authorities for not having a prior consultation with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the historic Pyongyang summit resulted in the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, a programme for the country's reunification in the new century, which calls for achieving the independent reunification of the country by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush ruling quarters officially informed the South Korean authorities of their intention not to allow them to have any contact and exchange with the north without their approval, complaining that the meeting between the north and the south without the U.S. consent is a serious development that should not be overlooked. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the bush administration emerged, it, in fact, ditched the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework and escalated its anti-DPRK campaign, singling out the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" and a \"rogue state\" . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n On June 6, 2001, U.S. President Bush issued the so-called \"U.S. policy toward the DPRK\" the keynote of which is the \"DPRK's improvement of its compliance with the Geneva Agreement related to its nuclear activities including its past nuclear activities\", \"regulations to verify the DPRK's missile development\", \"reduction of its conventional military equipment\", etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"report on the nuclear posture\" presented to U.S. Congress by the U.S. Defense Department said that in case of emergency, the U.S. Forces may use nuclear weapons against the DPRK and it is necessary to develop nuclear weapons of the next generation capable of destroying underground facilities in that case and it is also necessary to abrogate the nuclear test ban treaty to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the Bush administration is set to openly mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK, discarding even the signboard of \"blockade and deterrent strategy\" put up by the successive U.S. administrations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, Bush ordered the special units of the U.S. Forces to \"destroy the channels of North Korea and other countries for the supply of weapons\" under the pretext of the nuclear issue, thus revealing more saliently its attempt to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tells that the U.S. military plot to attack the DPRK has reached the phase of its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is working hard to derail at any cost the inter-Korean economic cooperation and the construction of light-water reactors and the supply of heavy oil under the DPRK-U.S. Geneva Agreement, claiming that these provide the DPRK with a leverage to survive economically. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the project of reconnecting the rail and road links made brisk headway under an agreement and the clearing of mines in the Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) reached its final stage between the north and the south, the U.S. urged the north and the south to submit a list of their members to the \"UN Forces Command,\" unreasonably faulting their crossing of the portion of the DMZ under the control of the north and the south for mutual verification according to the bilateral agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By adopting the decision to stop the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK on Nov. 14 the Bush administration ditched the only article of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework, which has been in the process of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All this proves that U.S. attempt to halt the construction of light-water reactors under the pretext of \"nuclear suspicion\" and the like after stopping the supply of heavy oil to the DPRK is not attributable to someone's \"nuclear issue\" but a product of the Bush administration's hostile policy toward the DPRK to stifle and economically subjugate the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts indicate that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for blocking peace, reunification, security and prosperity of the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
