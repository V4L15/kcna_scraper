It, therefore, cannot but affect the world political situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is as clear as noonday that the U.S. \"national security strategy\" based on \"preemptive attack\" will increase the danger of a new war worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is well advised to face up to the trend of the times toward peace and drop its reckless doctrine of war for hegemony. \r\n\r\n"

Korean girls under fire\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 22 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) released information bulletin no. 818 on June 21, denouncing the U.S. imperialist aggression troops for driving an armored car over South Korean young school girls to death.\r\n The bulletin says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent crime is a thrice-cursed atrocity which can be perpetrated only by the U.S. military occupiers who consider the lives of South Koreans to be ephemeral. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than half a century-long history of the U.S. imperialists' occupation of South Korea is characterized by aggression, plunder and bloody genocide as they cruelly insulted and murdered South Koreans irrespective of age and sex, regarding them as colonial slaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The CPRF secretariat vehemently denounces the U.S. imperialist aggressors, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, for blocking peace and reunification of Korea and perpetrating bloody murder of people and plunder while lording it over South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are resorting to all sorts of tricks to evade the responsibility for the murder of girl students Sin Hyo Sun and Sim Mi Son with a far-fetched assertion that victims are to blame for the accident. But the U.S. can by no means shirk the responsibility for the deliberate murder of passers-by young students by an armored car. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-mounting anti-U.S. struggle of South Korean people is an eruption of their resolute will to pardon the U.S. new war provocation moves, murder and robbery no longer and not to be colonial slaves.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly see the will of the Korean nation, make apology and compensation for the immeasurable crimes committed against the Korean people for more than half a century and immediately pull all its murderous equipment and aggression troops out of South Korea.     \r\n\r\n"
