A signed commentary of Minju Joson Wednesday says that suppressing people under the pretext of \"pro-north activities\" and \"praising the north\" is intolerable as it is an act of negating the joint declaration itself.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it is true that they manufactured and distributed CDs introducing the Juche idea and posted an article supporting and praising the Songun politics on an Internet homepage, what they did might have reflected the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Then why do the south Korean judicial authorities incriminate and suppress those who support the Juche idea and the Songun politics. This proves that they still use the outdated yardstick dating back to the Cold War era of confrontation to judge things. It is self-evident that the NSL which designates the fellow countrymen as an \"enemy\" should be repealed in order for the north and the south to achieve reunification by their concerted efforts under the banner of \"By our nation itself\", the core of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention is that the authorities are shutting their eyes to the introduction of mixed culture and ideology of the outsiders that do harm to the dignity of the nation and benumb the independent awareness of the people while kicking up a row of suppression of patriotic people who explained and supported the Juche idea and the Songun politics that command everyone's sympathy and support. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean judicial authorities should face up to the trend of the June 15 era, repeal the anti-reunification draconic NSL at an early date and immediately set free the detained patriotic people and democratic figures.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, papers here Wednesday says this means the establishment of a local aggressive tool for controlling and ruling Africa with strength and an undisguised military interference in this region.\r\n A Rodong Sinmun analyst notes: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. contemplates establishing its domination and control over the whole of the continent by poking its nose deeply into the affairs of African countries through the command in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"war on terrorism\" has become at present the pronoun of U.S. military interference and aggression against other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the cloak of \"war on terrorism,\" the U.S. war-like forces are openly resorting to military interference and aggressive acts against the countries which fall out of its favor or are situated at strategic vantages. The U.S. scheme to set up a command of its forces in Africa under the plea of \"preventing terrorism\" is intended to force its military strategy for attaining its avaricious and predatory aim on the African continent which is of strategic importance next to the Mid-East and is called \"a warehouse\" of energy resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the chieftain of aggression and war and the main harasser of peace. The louder it cries for \"anti-terrorism\", the more are the countries embroiled in wars to suffer huge human and material losses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the command is established, the situation in the region will get more complicated and many countries be put on the U.S. altar. So this scheme will bump into the opposition of the African countries desirous of independence and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A Minju Joson analyst says it is the best way of guaranteeing peace and security of the world to check and foil the U.S. drive for military aggrandizement, urging it to immediately withdraw its forces and military bases from the Korean Peninsula and other parts of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
