If the ambassador refuses to do this and continues to get on the nerves of the north, the people would conduct a powerful campaign to expel him, it warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Unswerving Will of DPRK \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- The Korean history has recorded many days when the people of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have demonstrated their invincible will in the confrontation with the U.S. imperialists.\r\n January 23, Juche 57 (1968) was one of such days. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the heroic Korean People's Army (KPA) captured the U.S. armed spy ship \"Pueblo\" which infiltrated into the territorial waters of the DPRK to commit espionages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Far from admitting their crime, the U.S. imperialists threatened the DPRK militarily, fabricating all kinds of lies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK stated that it would return retaliation for retaliation and all-out war for all-out war. This compelled the U.S. administration to apologize for the espionage and hostile acts committed by the spy ship and sign a document guaranteeing that its any warships shall not infiltrate into the territorial waters of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mettle of the DPRK that it does not allow any infringement on the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, far from drawing a lesson from the \"Pueblo\" incident, committed such acts of invading the DPRK as the large-sized spy plane \"EC-121\" incident in April 1969, \"OAH-23G\" incident in August 1969 and reconnaissance helicopter incident in December 1994. Each time they could not avoid a telling blow of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. imperialists infringed upon the supreme interest of the sovereign state on the pretext of \"nuclear issue\" in January 2003, the DPRK made public a government statement declaring that it would quit the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty to defend the sovereignty, right to existence and the dignity of the country and the nation, thus frustrating the enemy's anti-DPRK moves to smithereens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, the U.S. imperialists have been intensifying overall pressure on the DPRK, raising unwarranted issues including \"human rights issue\" and \"counterfeit issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK, which has strengthened in every way the single-minded unity stronger than the nuclear weapons and the self-reliant national defence power including nuclear deterrent always sternly stands against any anti-DPRK moves of the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists start a war, defying the strong will of the Korean people, they are bound to meet the same destiny with \"Pueblo\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "CIA Secret Report on Its Operation against DPRK under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement Monday in connection with the disclosure of the fact that the CIA of the United States had a secret confab and staged \"an exercise\" under the simulated conditions of a dramatic change in the situation on the Korean Peninsula in January 1998 after making the \"collapse of the north\" an established fact.\r\n The secret report which a press corps of the south Korean KBS claimed to have obtained from the NSA of the U.S. elaborated on the fact that the CIA staged the exercise under the simulated conditions of coping with the above-said situation allegedly created by a coup or a civil war on the premise that the \"north's collapse\" was imminent in 1997. The report also dealt with the conclusion that the U.S. would take charge of security in Northeast Asia whether the south and the north of Korea stand in confrontation or get reconciled and the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea and the U.S. influence would go on even after the Korean Peninsula is reunified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently declassified report goes to clearly prove that the U.S. has long desperately pursued its scenario to bring down the DPRK after making its \"collapse\" an established fact, the spokesman noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The report also betrayed the U.S. aggressive design to maintain its forces' presence, domination and interference in the affairs of south Korea under the signboard of \"regional security\" and \"preservation of influence\" regardless of whether the north and the south get reconciled or the Korean Peninsula get reunified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has reneged on the statement adopted at the six-party talks, to say nothing of the bilateral agreement. It has gone so frantic as to kick up a racket against the DPRK, terming it a \"criminal state\" and a \"dangerous state\" over \"human rights\" and \"counterfeit notes\" issues in the wake of the nuclear issue. This is, however, nothing but a desperate effort to realize its ambition for aggression at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly know that there can never be such a thing as the \"collapse\" of the DPRK although the earth may break apart and it is a pipe dream. The present reality goes to clearly prove that the DPRK not only remains unfettered but has grown stronger than ever before despite stern trials and difficulties and it is making a long drive as the days go by. The U.S. had better give up a foolish dream and reckless racket and honestly admit its criminal plan and apologize for it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
