If the ambassador refuses to do this and continues to get on the nerves of the north, the people would conduct a powerful campaign to expel him, it warned.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This compelled the U.S. administration to apologize for the espionage and hostile acts committed by the spy ship and sign a document guaranteeing that its any warships shall not infiltrate into the territorial waters of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the mettle of the DPRK that it does not allow any infringement on the sovereignty of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, far from drawing a lesson from the \"Pueblo\" incident, committed such acts of invading the DPRK as the large-sized spy plane \"EC-121\" incident in April 1969, \"OAH-23G\" incident in August 1969 and reconnaissance helicopter incident in December 1994. Each time they could not avoid a telling blow of the Korean People's Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the U.S. imperialists infringed upon the supreme interest of the sovereign state on the pretext of \"nuclear issue\" in January 2003, the DPRK made public a government statement declaring that it would quit the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty to defend the sovereignty, right to existence and the dignity of the country and the nation, thus frustrating the enemy's anti-DPRK moves to smithereens. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years, the U.S. imperialists have been intensifying overall pressure on the DPRK, raising unwarranted issues including \"human rights issue\" and \"counterfeit issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the DPRK, which has strengthened in every way the single-minded unity stronger than the nuclear weapons and the self-reliant national defence power including nuclear deterrent always sternly stands against any anti-DPRK moves of the enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists start a war, defying the strong will of the Korean people, they are bound to meet the same destiny with \"Pueblo\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
