When the Party, the army and the people effect an upswing in socialist construction with extraordinary resolution, they can fly the flag of victory in the final campaign of the present-day \"Arduous March\".\r\n   It is the steadfast will of  Kim Jong Il to fundamentally change the appearance of Korea in the near future and make it a country strong in ideology and politics, military affairs and economy by effecting a new upswing in socialist economic construction.\r\n   We should wage a vigorous struggle with extraordinary resolution to bring about a new great upsurge in socialist construction and successfully realize the ideology and politics of General Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n   All domains and units of socialist construction should set the aim higher to thoroughly apply his leadership, work in a big way and make the whole country seethe with the general socialist onward movement. \r\n   All the sectors and units of the national economy should more vigorously conduct the final campaign of the \"Arduous March\" to effect a revolutionary turn in the economic work and people's life.\r\n   We should more strictly preserve the Juche character and national character of socialist construction and continue to firmly adhere to the socialist principle in all sectors and units.\r\n   In order to effect a great upswing in socialist construction, all domains and units should give fuller play to the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle. Self-reliance and hard struggle is the tradition of the Korean revolution and the ideological weapon to exalt the glorious Kim Jong Il era.\r\n   We should decorate the present era with the feats of self-reliance and powerfully display the indomitable stamina of the Korean people, who do not know impossibility. \r\n\r\n"
