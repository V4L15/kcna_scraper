            "content": "NDC Policy Department Warns U.S., S. Korea against Anti-DPRK Acts\r\n Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Policy Department of the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK issued the following statement Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Years of tensions and confrontation have been defused and atmosphere for reconciliation and cooperation has been created in the direction of achieving peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula in recent days thanks to the initiative measures taken by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Typical examples are the sincere efforts made by it to save the Kaesong Industrial Zone from the danger of total shutdown and bring the operations in the zone to normal and to solve from a broad stand such issues as the reunions of families and relatives separated from the last Korean War and resumption of the Mt. Kumgang tourism project. The separation is symbolic of tragic national division.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the fixed stand and will of the army and people of the DPRK to realize at any cost whatever is required by the times and desired by the fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These are prompted by the firm policy to perfectly carry forward the historic June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration for its implementation, precious fruitions of the devotions and painstaking efforts made by General Secretary Kim Jong Il and heritages bequeathed down by him out of his patriotic will for reunification, and thus pave the wide avenue for national reunification and peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Unfortunately, however, the atmosphere for reconciliation hardly in the making has faced a serious challenge from the beginning due to the improper attitude taken by the U.S. and the south Korean authorities who are still seized by the old confrontational concept.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present chief executives of the U.S. and south Korea are loudly speaking about ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and building reconciliation and confidence between the north and the south. But in fact, they directly choreographed dangerous war racket and confrontation moves, quite contrary to their call. This is a stark reality today.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They started on August 19 the DPRK-targeted Ulji Freedom Guardian war exercises as before under the pretext of \"annual\" exercises. In mid-August they started the operation of scattering leaflets slandering the DPRK with the use of human scum. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We can not but question if it is the U.S.-style way of \"improving ties\" and south Korean-style way of \"building confidence\" to level guns at the dialogue partner and to respond to the magnanimous and peaceful step with war drills and sinister psychological warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known by the world that the U.S. and the south Korean authorities cried out for the DPRK's \"dismantlement of nuclear weapons\" more loudly than any others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the recent war exercises they flied formations and flying corps of B-52H nuclear strategic bombers from Guam and the U.S. mainland to the sky above the Korean Peninsula round the clock, openly posing nuclear threat to the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. truly wants denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, it should stop the nuclear blackmail against the DPRK. The present rulers of south Korea should drop the double-dealing attitude of tolerating outsider's nuke while denying the nation's nuke.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is important for the south Korean authorities to stop vitriolic rhetoric against the DPRK and clear themselves of discord, antagonism, distrust and hostility, to begin with, if they do not want to see the north-south ties repeating the bitter history of the past five years.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present rulers of south Korea, without deep knowledge about war and military affairs, are taking the lead in inciting confrontation and escalating tensions while touring what they called wartime commanding posts and field command posts, being lost to reason. They will only face shameless fate, being marginalized by the public.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are calling a small agreement that was reached with much difficulty a \"victory of principle\" and making a mockery of the public, being guided by its own unilateral yardstick called \"common sense and international norms\". This will only cast shadow to hard-won atmosphere for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will neither give up nor make even a step backward in the road for ensuring peace and security of the country and building a powerful and prosperous country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK equipped with powerful striking means have followed with vigilance not only the whole process of the war exercises but all the movements of the flying corps of nuclear strategic bombers, with their guns aimed at them, being considerate of the nation's desire and wishes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We are seriously examining issues for planning and realizing several constructive and bold peaceful measures while still exercising utmost patience for genuine peace and detente on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Time has come to drop for good the hostile concept and the policy for confrontation with the fellow countrymen, leftovers of the Cold War era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the time to stop anachronistic act of targeting the dialogue partner and take political decisions favorable for creating atmosphere for dialogue and peaceful environment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the demand of the times and the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should clearly face up to the trend of the times and think twice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should remember that there is limit to the magnanimity and patience of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will closely follow with high vigilance every movement of the present chief executives of the U.S. and south Korea."

Korea War Exercises Slammed\r\n Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- The National Peace Committee of Korea spokesman issued the following statement Thursday:\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the situation on the Korean Peninsula has turned to the road of detente from that of confrontation. This was thanks to the initiative measures taken by the DPRK for the improvement of the north-south ties and the peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula and the sincere efforts made by it for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the trend for reconciliation and unity has faced a serious challenge due to the reckless nuclear war moves and confrontational racket against the DPRK being kicked up by the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On August 27, the U.S. imperialist aggressors flew two B-52H nuclear strategic bombers to the sky above south Korea from an air force base in the U.S. mainland to stage a nuclear attack drill targeting the DPRK before their deployment on Guam. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At night on August 15 and during the day on August 21, a few days after they started Ulji Freedom Guardian, they flew Guam-based B-52H to the sky above Jik Islet in south Korea, two planes each, staging DPRK-targeted nuclear strike drills.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. introduction of the nuclear strategic bombers, one of three nuclear strategic strike means, timed to coincide with the massive Ulji Freedom Guardian which it is staging together with the puppet south Korean warmongers with the involvement of its huge troops, is an open nuclear threat to the DPRK, a revelation of its hideous scheme to ignite a nuclear war on the Korean Peninsula at any cost and another unpardonable grave provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warmongers kicked up the racket for confrontation with the DPRK, saying that when a war breaks out they have to surely win and full combat readiness should be taken, openly throwing a hurdle in the way for hardly arranged north-south dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an intolerable mockery of the DPRK, which is making big efforts while exercising patience for detente, and an anachronistic act of going against the aspiration of the Koreans for the improvement of the north-south ties and stability and against the trend of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Question is if they have face to talk about \"dialogue\", \"genuine peace\" and \"stability\" while being bent on war moves against the DPRK with the use of nuclear strategic bombers, the dialogue partner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, it is the height of folly and brigandish sophism to cry out for \"dismantlement of nuclear program\" by the DPRK while posing a nuclear threat to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation clearly proves that it is exactly the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers who are straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula and escalating confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is a limit to the patience of the DPRK as it had already clarified.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Peace, stability and advancement of the north-south ties can never be realized with the efforts by one side only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists and the south Korean military warmongers should know that dangerous provocations violating sovereignty of the DPRK and encroaching upon its supreme interests will lead to an irrevocable development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the south Korean warmongers should behave with discretion, not misjudging the patience and self-restraint exercised by the army and people of the DPRK."

Y desde mediados de agosto, se entregan publicamente al lanzamiento de volantes de contenido anti-RPDC movilizando a las escorias humanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo podemos menos que preguntarles de que apuntar el fusil a la contraparte del dialogo y responder a sus medidas magnanimas y pacificas con los ejercicios de guerra y la malsana campana intrigante psicologica es el \"mejoramiento de relaciones\" al estilo norteamericano y la \"creacion de confianza\" a la manera surcoreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa esta conocido por todos el que las autoridades de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea insisten mas que nadie en la \"renuncia nuclear\" de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, ellas mismas recurren al abierto chantaje nuclear contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante el presente simulacro, introducen sucesivamente en la Peninsula Coreana, sin distincion de las horas avanzadas de la noche ni del pleno dia, la escuadrilla de cazabombarderos estrategicos nucleares B-52H emplazados en la isla Guam, y el dia siguiente, mismas aeronaves en el territorio norteamericano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi desean de veras la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Corana, EE.UU. debe parar el chantaje nuclear contra la RPDC y tambien los actuales gobernantes surcoreanos deben abandonar la actitud dual de tolerar las armas nucleares de las fuerzas extranjeras y renegar las otras de la parte connacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo importante para evitar la repeticion del amargo lustro pasado de las relaciones intercoreanas es que las autoridades surcoreanas paren las conductas insultantes y limpien sus entranas de antipatia, odio, desconfianza y hostilidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos gobernantes surcoreanos en actual mandato, que no tienen profunda comprension sobre la guerra ni los asuntos militares, toman la delantera en fomentar el enfrentamiento y agravar la tension dando vueltas incesantes a los puestos de mando de tiempo de guerra y los de campana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos que actuan como ellos seran marginados de la corriente de la epoca y sufriran la vida corta vergonzosa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl acto irreflexivo de elogiar un acuerdo de poca importancia logrado al cabo de muchos esfuerzos como \"triunfo de principio\" y el proceder de burlar la opinion publica con la pauta unilateral llamada \"sentido comun y norma internacional\" entenebrecera el ambiente de reconciliacion preparado dificilmente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo de la RPDC no se rendiran ni retrocederan en preservar la paz y seguridad del pais y lograr la prosperidad nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor esta razon, nuestras fuerzas armadas revolucionarias dotadas de invictos medios de ataque han observado con alta vigilancia teniendo al alcance de tiro, en reflejo de la aspiracion y demanda de la nacion, todo el proceso de los ejercicios de guerra de agresion  y todos los movimientos de la escuadrilla de cazabombarderos estrategicos nucleares. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara la verdadera paz y el alivio de la tension de la Peninsula Coreana, revisamos con seriedad los asuntos para proyectar y ejecutar las constructivas y audaces medidas pacifistas manteniendo la maxima paciencia. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa llego el tiempo de poner punto final a la concepcion de hostilidad y la politica conflictiva, residuos de la guerra fria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora es el tiempo en que no se permiten los actos anacronicos contra la contraparte del dialogo, sino se necesita solo la decision politica util para crear el ambiente pacifico y de dialogo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa epoca y la poblacion lo desean.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben actuar con prudencia dandose clara cuenta de la tendencia de la epoca. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeben tener presente que tienen limites la magnanimidad y la paciencia de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo coreanos observaran con alta vigilancia el movimiento de los gobernantes en actual mandato de EE.UU. y del Sur de Corea."
