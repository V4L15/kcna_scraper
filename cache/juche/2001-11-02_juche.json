Such bestial outrages of the U.S. against religionists are still going on. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is slinging mud at other countries over their religious issues while shelving its violation of religious freedom and styling itself a \"judge of religious issues\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This imprudent behavior reminds one of a thief crying \"stop the thief\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. mud-slinging at the DPRK over its religious issue is aimed to impair the daily mounting authority and prestige of the DPRK. This will bring it to nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The freedom of religion is fully guaranteed by law and many religionists are free to conduct their activities under the DPRK socialist system. The U.S. mud-slinging only reveals once again its shamelessness before the world.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 2 (KCNA) -- The solidarity for implementing the south-north joint declaration reportedly made public an appeal for a massive anti-U.S. struggle and militant slogans.\r\n The appeal said that the grave situation prevailing on the Korean peninsula at present is due to the hostile policy of the bush administration towards the DPRK and its moves to escalate tensions in a bid to maintain its hegemony over the peninsula by scraping the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It called upon all the Koreans to turn out in the anti-U.S., anti-Japan struggle and the struggle against the separatists in order to preserve the self-respect and prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogans expressed opposition to the United States obstructing the implementation of the joint declaration and rendering the situation on the Korean peninsula strained with its anti-DPRK policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush government should renounce its hostile policy towards the DPRK and implement the DPRK-U.S. agreement, they urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They also demanded that Japan stop its ballistic missile development, a threat to peace in northeast Asia, and redeem its past of aggression and make an apology and compensation for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They urged the resignation of Ri Hoe Chang betraying the nation and the dissolution of the \"Grand National Party.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The slogans called upon all the fellow countrymen to check the U.S. intervention and put into practice the joint declaration by their united efforts.    \r\n\r\n"
