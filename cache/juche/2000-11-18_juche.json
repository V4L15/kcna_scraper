Japan is running amok to realise its wild ambition for reinvasion, indifferent to the settlement of its past, the principal issue that should be settled first of all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should bear in mind that as long as Japan does not settle its past crimes committed against the Korean people, it will remain an eternal sworn enemy of the Korean people. \r\n\r\n"

That principle calls on both sides in dispute to settle it through a sincere agreement on the \"peace-for-land\" principle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Israel's act of sidestepping and evading the principle  cannot be construed otherwise than pursuing only its design for territorial expansion, opposed to the fair solution to the Mideast issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Israel does not observe the cease-fire agreement, clashes will continue to drive the Mideast peace process to a collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an exercise of the sovereign right of the Palestinian people to found an independent state of Palestine. \r\n\r\n"

Dunn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, talks between the defence ministers of the north and south of Korea took place on Jeju Island between September 25 and 26 to implement the June 15 joint declaration adopted at the inter-Korean summit. It was proposed at the talks to open some portions of the Military Demarcation Line and the DMZ through which railways and road will pass to relink the north and the south, and put them under the control of the north and the south sides and ensure safety in the projects there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was a matter to be discussed between the KPA side and the U.S. forces side, signatories to the Armistice Agreement, as required by the agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the KPA side proposed to work out a supplementary agreement of the AA related to the projects so as to militarily and legally guarantee the issue of relinking the railways and road between the north and the south, and had several working contacts with the U.S. forces side at Panmunjom to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A draft agreement discussed at the working-level contacts so far was finally confirmed and ratified at the general officer-level talks held today between the two sides. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement was signed by Pak Rim Su and Michael M. Dunn. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement said that both sides will open some portions of the Military Demarcation Line and the demilitarized zone through which Sinuiju-Seoul railways and Kaesong-Munsan road will pass and put those portions under the control of the north and the south  in accordance with the Armistice Agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, both sides will allow the armies of the north and the south to consult and deal with  the technical issues concerning the opening of some portions of the DMZ and military problems arising in the portions under the control of the north and the south in conformity with the armistice agreement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement said it goes into effect from the date of its ratification at the general officer-level talks in Panmunjom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement on opening some portions of the demilitarized zone and placing them under the control of the north and the south reached between the signatories to the Armistice Agreement provides a legal guarantee for the north and the south to consult and settle the technical problems concerning the relinking of the Sinuiju-Seoul railways and Kaesong-Munsan road. \r\n\r\n"

A delegation of south media organizations visited Pyongyang and a joint communique of media organizations in the north and the south was published. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The project to relink the severed railways and roads between the north and the south, the table-tennis game for reunification and the north's State Symphony Orchestra's performance in Seoul, etc, bolstered up the whole nation's enthusiasm for reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the north and the south showed the nation and the world their will to trust and unite with each other, free from mutual misunderstanding and the stand of confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Separated families and relatives in the north and the south had an emotion-charged reunion in Pyongyang and Seoul, the first of its kind in over 50 years, on the occasion of the August 15 liberation day. And over 60 unconverted long-term prisoners, products of division and confrontation, returned to the DPRK in early September under the blessings of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The athletes of the north and the south jointly entered the 27th Sydney Olympics to be cheered by more than 100,000 spectators and the north-south joint resolution \"peace, security and reunification on the Korean peninsula\" was adopted at the plenary meeting of the 55th UN General Assembly to command widespread support of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A special mention should be made of the fact that General Secretary Kim Jong Il sent gifts to President Kim Dae Jung and members of several delegations of the south side, which visited Pyongyang, on the occasion of Chusok (autumn festival). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These noteworthy events this year greatly help bring earlier national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation. \r\n\r\n"
