The organization expressed opposition to the south Korea visit of Rumsfeld, incarnation of war and a guide who leads the troop dispatch and demanded the U.S. scrap its plan for a war on the Korean peninsula and hostile policy toward north Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Seoul District Federation of University Student Councils in a statement titled \"Opposition to south Korea visit of Rumsfeld, a lion of evil\" said that his visit is aimed to pressurize  south Korea to discuss the issue of troop dispatch to Iraq and the issue of redeploying the U.S. troops and transferring the U.S. military bases at the \"south Korea-U.S. annual security consultative meeting\" and calm down the public opinion opposing war on the Korean peninsula and turning down troop dispatch.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

On top of this they forced 200,000 teenage girls and women into sexual slavery for the imperial Japanese Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The list of 427,129 Korean victims recently disclosed in Japan is just part of the victims of forcible drafting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spokesman cited detailed facts to prove the monstrous crimes the Japanese imperialists committed after occupying Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The forcible drafting, massacres, torture and other moves to exterminate the Korean nation were the most hideous human rights abuses as they wantonly violated international law and regulations in force including regulations of the Nuremberg International Military Court. Their gravity lies in that they were state-sponsored crimes committed at the instruction and connivance of the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a system and practice established by international law for an assailant state to hold responsibility before a victimized state, persons and their bereaved families for its organized human rights abuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the Japanese government which is distorting its history in a bid to cover up the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists against humanity in the past and evade its legal and moral responsibility as an assailant state. Japan is ignoring the principles related to state responsibility to make compensation stipulated in norms of international treaties and universally recognized practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities are obliged to probe the truth of every human rights abuse the Japanese imperialists committed during their occupation of Korea and make it public and sternly punish those responsible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should survey materials about those Koreans killed and their remains and ascertain them to the last and inform their bereaved families of them and make full apology and compensation to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should bear in mind that only then can they completely shake off the ill fame of a criminal state and will be able to establish truly friendly relations with the DPRK.    \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
