            "content": "Political Parties, Government and Organizations in DPRK Call for Promoting Cause of Reunification \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 18 (KCNA) -- Political parties, government and organizations of the DPRK issued a joint statement Wednesday representing the mission of the nation to make this significant year a year of turning point in history by giving a new momentum to the cause of national reunification and the will of all the Koreans to achieve it.\r\n The Korean nation's movement for reunification has entered into a new historic phase, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's access to nukes is a great national event to be especially recorded in the national history spanning 5,000 years. This provided the Korean nation with a sure guarantee for reliably defending its dignity and sovereignty and the peace and security of the country and steadily glorifying the June 15 era of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Newspapers Rodong Sinmun, Joson Inmingun and Chongnyon Jonwi in a joint editorial for this year took a patriotic initiative to add brilliance to the June 15 reunification era by attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north and the south of Korea should firmly adhere to the stand of giving importance to the nation, regard it as the best one, put the nation's dignity and interest above anything else, subordinate everything to them and maintain its independent stand, believing in its own strength, not other's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The political parties and organizations in south Korea should reject cooperation with outsiders doing harm to the fellow countrymen and positively opt for national cooperation from a pro-reunification and patriotic stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas should resolutely stand up against the U.S. nuclear racket and war moves against the DPRK, properly distinguishing the aggressive nature of the U.S. nukes and the peace-loving and nation-saving nature and mission of the DPRK's nukes and wage a more dynamic struggle to force the U.S. to pull back its troops, a source of war, from south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should stop at once their arms buildup and joint military exercises targeted against compatriots. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"presidential elections\" to be held in south Korea this year will be a scene of a fierce showdown to choose between peace and war and between reunification and continued division. All the patriotic south Koreans are called upon to form a great alliance against conservatism in order to decisively frustrate the plot of the conservative forces to return to power as it is aimed to spoil the gains made through the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and bring a war holocaust to this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We ardently call on all the Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to turn out as one in the drive to make this year as a year of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should broaden the ways of inter-Korean visits and meetings for reunification paved by the June 15 joint declaration and reenergize cooperation undertakings common to the nation including the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the construction of the Kaesong Industrial Zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to reinforce the June 15 All-Korean Committee and achieve the solidarity and alliance among all the Koreans in order to strengthen the driving force of national reunification movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All political organizations, social organizations and the Koreans at home and abroad aspiring after peace and reunification of the country should actively support and uphold the great Songun policy, the lifeline of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should drop its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK, halt its reckless nuclear row against the DPRK, give up its plot to stifle the latter through sanctions and stop unreasonably interfering in the issues of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our expectation and belief that the authorities, political parties and organizations of south Korea and all the Koreans at home and abroad would positively turn out in the nation-wide grand march for independent reunification and governments, political parties and organizations of all countries, international organizations, progressives in the world who value justice and truth would extend full support and solidarity to the Korean nation in its cause of independent and peaceful reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This reflects the truth the Korean people had keenly experienced in the course of the revolutionary struggle of Korea, which started and advanced under the banner of Songun.\r\n President Kim Il Sung, who laid down the slogan \"Weapons are our life and soul! Oppose armed force with armed force!\" in his early days and pioneered Songun, founded the revolutionary armed force, first of its kind in Korea, in April, Juche 21(1932), thus declaring a war against the one million-strong aggression troops of the Japanese imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He created original guerrilla tactics to win one brilliant victory after another in the anti-Japanese war to accomplish the historic cause of national liberation in August 1945. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After liberation he put forth the foundation of the revolutionary regular armed forces as one of the main tasks in building a new country and developed the Korean People's Revolutionary Army into a modern regular army in a short span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the revolutionary armed forces, the servicepersons and people could defend with credit the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation in the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950-July 1953), which was started by the U.S. imperialists to conquer the DPRK in its cradle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the postwar period the President set forth the slogan \"Hold a rifle in one hand and a sickle and hammer in the other!\" and simultaneously pushed ahead with the economic construction and defence upbuilding and, at the same time, developed and strengthened the KPA to be invincible one. As a result, he smashed every move of the U.S. imperialists and their followers to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is brilliantly carrying forward the Songun-based idea and leadership of the President and always leading the Korean revolution along the road of victory under the banner of Songun. The Korean people elected him to be chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and Supreme Commander of the KPA. It was a special event in the Songun history of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the middle of the 1990s the leader frustrated the unprecedentedly intensified aggressive maneuvers of the imperialists and safeguarded the destiny of the country and people with the might of Songun to usher in a fresh heyday of building a great, prosperous and powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are filled with a firm resolution to remain faithful to the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

As a homogeneous nation, the Koreans in the north and the south can surmount any difference in views through dialogue and negotiation, reconciliation and cooperation to achieve the national unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of great national unity calls upon all the Koreans to unite closely and achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by the strength of their unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Korea's reunification is, in essence, a cause of reuniting the divided nation into one. The unity of the whole nation just means national reunification. All the Koreans at home and abroad should be closely united as one under the banner of great unity disregarding differences in ideology and system to build up the driving forces for reunification. This is the main guarantee for achieving the independent national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle for carrying out the three-point task of attaching importance to the nation, defending peace and achieving unity set forth in the joint New Year editorial is immediately the just patriotic struggle to realize the three principles of national reunification. All the Koreans from all walks of life at home and abroad should turn out to carry out the three-point task.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This clearly proves once again that they are a pack of brutes in human skin and brazen-faced robbers whose means of living is high-handed practices and terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japs hell-bent on unjustifiable terrorism against Chongryon and Koreans in Japan in gross violation of elementary human ethics and the international law are bound to be brought to a tribunal by the conscience of the world people who love truth and peace and face a stern judgment of the times and history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries had better immediately stop the reckless moves against Chongryon and Koreans as they are little short of digging their own graves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
