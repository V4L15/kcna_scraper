            "content": "Withdrawal of U.S. troops urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- Papers here today denounce U.S. President Bush for clamouring for permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea and \"strengthened security alliance\" at a press conference some time ago.\r\n Rodong Sinmun in a signed commentary titled \"powder-reeking outburst\" says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's remarks compel the DPRK to keep a sharp vigilance against the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops stationed in South Korea are the stumbling-block to the reunification of Korea and a detached force for aggression on Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His clamour for the permanent presence of the U.S. troops in South Korea is a clear expression of the U.S. policy of aggression against the DPRK, the policy aimed at stifling it by force of arms at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops' occupation of South Korea can never be permitted in light of the trend of the times and the desire of the Korean people for the independent reunification of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bid to strengthen the \"security alliance\" with South Korea is aiming at gaining military edge over the DPRK and stifling it by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to maintain its hegemonic position in the Asia-Pacific region by strengthening its military presence in South Korea and its policy of aggression against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula can never be a theatre for the U.S. hegemony. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. persistent hostile policy toward the DPRK, designed to make the Korean peninsula a military springboard for continental aggression and a bargaining chip for its hegemony, arouses deep-felt resentment of the Korean people. The Korean people are fully ready to cope with possible military challenge of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is openly talking about the possibility to extend its military operations in Afghanistan to other countries, while resorting to ill-boding moves pulling up the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is our will and independent mode of counteraction to respond to the U.S. hard line with a super hard line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson in a commentary titled \"decision to withdraw U.S. troops should be made\" says that the U.S. should not seek its permanent military presence in South Korea, but take a practical measure to withdraw its troops from South Korea at an early date.     \r\n\r\n"

Putin and DPRK NDC chairman Kim Jong Il is of great significance and the Moscow summit talks and the Russia-DPRK Moscow declaration laid foundations to consolidate the positive trend of Russia-DPRK state relations and further develop effective and equally beneficial cooperation in the new millennium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is now important to carry out the tasks put forward by the two leaders, he said, stressing that the complicated situation requires the strengthened coordination of action in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia is ready to cooperate in establishing a just and stable system of international relations, he said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such attitude of Russia towards the international issues coincides with the purpose and principles of the DPRK foreign policies. It is one of important tasks to boost the relations between Russia and the DPRK as a whole to develop economic and trade relations today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Russia consistently holds that the tensions in the Korean peninsula should be turned into a stable and secured peace and Korea should be reunified independently, peacefully and in a democratic way without outside interference on the basis of articles of the north-south joint declaration at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Premier Hong Song Nam said in his speech that Kim Jong Il's Russia visit held amid the special concern of Putin and warm welcome of the Russian people was a historic event of weighty significance in developing the traditional DPRK-Russia relations on a new foundation in conformity with requirements of the new century and ensuring world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His visit deepened the intimate relations of the two leaders and opened a bright vista to rapidly develop the DPRK-Russia relations, which is a joy and auspicious event common to the two peoples, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government and people will value the practical examples set by the heads of state for the development of the DPRK-Russia relations and continue to invariably develop long-standing traditional relations with Russia on the principles of independence, equality and mutual benefit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government and people support the policies of the present Russian leadership and sincerely hope that all things will go well in the country in conformity with the aspiration and interests of the Russian people and they will achieve success in the efforts to form a fair and justifiable new world structure.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Speech of DPRK delegate at 56th UN General Assembly \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- A DPRK delegate made a speech during the discussion of item no. 86 \"international cooperation in the peaceful uses of outer space\" at the fourth committee meeting of the 56th UN General Assembly on October 22.\r\n He said that if the space is to be made peaceful one conducive to promoting the welfare of mankind, arbitrary practices, exclusive possession, selectivity and double standards should be rejected in the development of the pace so that all countries can take part in that work in an equitable and free manner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To decisively prevent the militarization of the space and provide a guarantee for its peaceful use at present has become a pressing issue, the solution of which brooks no moment's delay, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has clamoured about \"missile threat\" from the DPRK to make a pretext for the establishment of missile defense system in outer space. Such deed can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's missile program is of totally peaceful nature and it poses no threat to anybody. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Preventing the space militarization is a serious matter that is related to ensuring peace in our planet and guaranteeing the future destiny of humankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should immediately stop the MD establishment that may spark off arms race in the space. And it should discontinue such attempts as to violate developing countries' right to independent space development while raising an unreasonable and far-fetched theory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK delegation holds that the legal committee of the committee on the peaceful uses of outer space should pay deep attention to taking measures for the prevention of space militarization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will further accelerate its space development for the nation's economic progress and strive to promote technical cooperation and exchange with other countries, he concluded.    \r\n\r\n"
