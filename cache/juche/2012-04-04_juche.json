He, at the same time, ordered the unit to send all the intruders into the bottom of the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe went round the service personnel's health complex, non-staple foodstuff store, vegetable greenhouse and other supply service facilities run by the defence unit itself. He underlined the need to continue directing big efforts to supply service so that the service personnel there may not be nostalgic for the life on the land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaking the rounds of the company and the coastal battery under the unit, he paid deep attention to the living of the service personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe guided the training in firearms at the coast artillery emplacement visited by Kim Jong Il and had a photo session with soldiers, holding their shoulders in his arms.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe highly appreciated the achievements performed by the unit in the past period, noting that the unit honored with the title of O Jung Hup-led Seventh Regiment is a model in all aspects including combat and political training, supply service and unit command and management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe highly appreciated the efforts made by Hero of the Republic Chon Jae Gwon while serving as commander of the unit for 25 years and reposed deepest trust in Chon by saying that there should be by his side such officers as Chon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe got aboard the warship to sail despite rough waves, telling the commanding officers that he entrusted the defence of Ryo Islet to them and wishing them good health and greater success in rounding off the combat preparations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by KPA Generals Kim Won Hong and Hyon Chol Hae, KPA Lieut.
