Korean Authorities' Attitude\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 8 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee issued a statement on Wednesday denouncing the dishonest forces of south Korea including the puppet conservative media for perpetrating the heinous provocative act of hurting  the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK over the issue of Ri Hui Ho's visit to Pyongyang. \n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group let the conservative media spread misinformation as regards Ri's visit. It claimed that Ri suggested an overland travel but the leadership of the north side proposed a travel by air in a bid to propagandize among south Koreans Pyongyang International Airport built by the leadership with much effort. And the group also let experts on north Korean affairs float the false story that the north adjusted the timing of Ri's visit to Pyongyang for \"its political purpose.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet Ministry of Unification let loose a spate of vituperation that it would handle the issue of Ri's visit to Pyongyang with a \"principle\" despite the fact that officials concerned of the north and the south reached an agreement on it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an unpardonable serious provocation against the DPRK as the puppet group brought to light its sinister intention to stand in confrontation with the DPRK to the last, displeased with the process to improve the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t And this cannot be construed otherwise than a deliberate and vicious obstruction to block Ri's visit by getting on the nerves of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In connection with Ri's course of visit to Pyongyang, the DPRK told the Kim Dae Jung Peace Center that it was better for Ri to travel to Pyongyang by air to the best convenience of the guests as the Pyongyang-Kaesong Highway is under repair and the officials concerned of the south side fully agreed with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was reported that Ri accepted our sincere proposal with pleasure. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet group should not recklessly wag their tongues, clearly understanding that the Korea Asia-Pacific Peace Committee and the Kim Dae Jung Peace Center just tentatively agreed on the issue of Ri's Pyongyang visit at the working-level contact and it has not been fully confirmed. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We solemnly warn that if the south Korean conservative group persistently hurts the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and makes provocations against it, the hard-won opportunity may be scuppered. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Hui Ho's successful Pyongyang visit depends on the behavior of the puppet group."

And the President invited Allende to visit Pyongyang again, calling on him to share eternal comradeship with each other in the struggle against imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After his DPRK visit, Allende praised President Kim Il Sung as an incarnation of independence and justice and regarded the President's teachings on the Latin American revolution as an absolute truth and motto of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During his term of office as the Chilean president, he devoted himself to putting an end to the domination by the imperialists and the domestic monopoly capitalists in conspiracy with them over his country and to meeting the interests and demand of the working masses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When a coup d'etat against his government was engineered, he died a heroic death on the battlefield.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Upon receiving the news of his death on the way of field guidance, President Kim Il Sung saw to it that messages of condolence and wreaths in his name were sent to the widow of Allende and the Chilean embassy in Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President also took a measure to announce the national mourning day for the death of Allende.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that he was very sorry for being absent at the memorial service held in the Chilean embassy, the President bestowed his time on having a meal with the couple of the Chilean charge d'affaires.

One of them is \"Let Us Shatter Imperialist Moves towards Aggression and War and Safeguard Peace and Independence\", a speech he delivered at a party given in honor of the delegates to the World Conference of Journalists against Imperialism and for Friendship and Peace on July 3, Juche 72 (1983).\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his lifetime, the President had met a large number of foreign personages, telling about the principles to be maintained in the struggle for global peace and its tasks and ways.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In his talks with an editor of the Peruvian Newspapers Expreso and Extra in August 1975, he said: If we avoid fighting against imperialism or make unprincipled compromises with it, we cannot bring about genuine peace. Only by determined struggle against imperialism can we halt and frustrate the imperialist schemes for aggression and war and maintain world peace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February 1981, he met the leader of the French Social Party and underscored the need for the European nations not to join any block but maintain independence in order to deter a new world war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In June 1992 when he met the chairman of the Communists Labor Party of Sweden, the President stressed that the progressive people the world over should unite as one and invariably hold fast to the banner of anti-imperialist, anti-U.S. struggle to defend the global peace and security and build a free and peaceful world."
