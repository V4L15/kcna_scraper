They must clearly see that their desperate and adventurous acts will bring nothing but disgraceful ruin and must stop the provocative \"Foal Eagle\" at once.\r\n   The United States must know that its war manoeuvres against the DPRK together with the south Korean puppets will never bring a good result.\r\n   If the bellicose elements at home and abroad ignite a war against the north in spite of our repeated warnings, they will have to pay dearly for it.\r\n   Minju Joson in a commentary says: it is our will to answer retaliation with retaliation, all-out war with all-out war. We will deal a decisive blow to those who infringe upon our sovereignty and dignity if only a little, and will defend our socialist homeland as firm as a rock.    \r\n\r\n"

It is filled with confidence in victory and determination to annihilate the enemies and reunify the country if they unleash war of aggression.\r\n   Thanks to this army, the Juche socialism is firmly defended and dynamically promoted.    \r\n\r\n"

And he said that the automation should begin with the introduction of internal closed-circuit television and a commanding system by wireless telecommunication means so that the workers may understand their advantages.  He added that workshops with comparatively simple production streamlines and those with more than two processes and heat \r\n   Affected furnaces should be remote-controlled and on its basis, furnaces and open-hearth furnaces be remote-controlled completely and thereby, the metallurgical processes as a whole should be switched over to the allround remote-control system.                                  This was a perfect blueprint for the automation of the complex.\r\n   To this end, he sent television transmitters of important places to the complex and made sure that internal closed-circuit television and wireless telecommunication were introduced at one unit after another.  And he said that the first achievements of automation should be generalized at all workshops and they be gradually remote-controlled. \r\n   When the automation of the complex stopped for a while owing to the high-cost sintering furnace workshop, he told officials that nothing should be spared for the sake of the workers. And he led the automation to be realized on the principle of self-reliance.\r\n   The automation of the complex was realized with our strength and technique under his wise leadership.\r\n   He saw to it that the experience gained in automating the complex should be generalized throughout the country. \r\n   Therefore, a national model lecture was given at the complex and automation was introduced at other industrial establishments.    \r\n \r\n"
