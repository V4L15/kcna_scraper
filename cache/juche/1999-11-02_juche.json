They were significant years when the socialist cause of Juche was firmly defended and victoriously accelerated thanks to Marshal Kim Jong Il's idea of red flag, iron faith and wise guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In those years of sacred revolutionary history the Korean people have felt his greatness more deeply. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The greatness of the Marshal who has led the cause of socialism to victory can be found, above all, in the fact that he has firmly defended the socialist principles in all fields of revolution and construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The red flag idea of the Worker's Party of Korea means unfailingly loyalty to the principles of revolution, the socialist principles. The most important idea of the work \"socialism is a science\" is that we will make no concession as to the principles of revolution adhered to by the President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   With the steadfast revolutionary principle Kim Jong Il has strictly ensured the political leadership of the party and the unified guidance of the state and firmly defended the socialist ownership. It was thanks to his principled leadership that even under the difficult conditions of the \"arduous march,\" the forced march, our party could consistently shape popular policies and maintain the socialist way of combining political and moral incentive with material incentive while giving priority to the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His greatness was also manifested in the fact that he had reliably defended the socialist  fatherland with the army-first policy. His army-first policy is the unique socialist way of politics under which all the problems arising in the revolution and construction are solved on the principle of giving priority to the army and socialism is accelerated in all aspects with the people's army as a main pillar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His greatness is also that he had brought about a great revolutionary upswing in socialist construction with the might of single-hearted unity. As a result, a strong springboard has been laid for the building of a powerful nation and the powerful 2nd grand Chollima march has been launched across the country in the period of stern trials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il the Korean people will advance the socialist cause of Juche victoriously. \r\n\r\n"

They had better properly know about their counterpart before talking about the DPRK-U.S. relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The sovereignty of the country is extremely vital to us. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWe do not need any improvement of relations which may do harm to our nation's dignity and the  sovereignty of our country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It seems that some quarters of the U.S. regard the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations as a \"gift\" to us, but nothing is more impertinent than this contention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They  should bear in mind that if the U.S.  expects any concession from us on account of the improvement of relations or tries  to use it as a lever for putting pressure, it will make the situation more complicated and the U.S. will be held wholly responsible for the ensuing consequences. Those who are busy talking nonsense about the improvement of the DPRK-U.S. relations to please others, are well advised to come to their senses.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They massacred civilians in Taedok county and Taejon city of South Chungchong Province from July 18 to 29, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The open letter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   U.S. brutes and \"ROK\" army man-hunters  murdered 739 civilians in Chungju in one day of July 4 alone and 1,146 in Suwon, Kyonggi Province,  from June 28 to July 4, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In July, 1950, the fleeing \"Raju unit\"  disguised itself as people's army soldiers and killed innocent civilians in Haenam and Wando. The special service corps of Pusan brutally slew 4,832  innocent civilians in prison and buried them in different places or threw them into sea from early July to the end of September, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   During their flight in 1950, the U.S. troops and the \"ROK\" army  soldiers killed over 10,000 innocent people in Seoul, more than 600 in Phyongthaek, Kyonggi Province, over 500 in Ansong, more than 400 in Anyang, over 30,000 in Chunchon, at least 2,000 in Chongju, North Chungchong Province, over 2,060 in Chungju city,  more than 600  in Kongju, South Chungchong Province,  at least 2,000 in Puyo, 158 in Jochiwon, 8,644 in Taejon, at least 4,000 in Jonju, North Jolla Province, over 400 in Kunsan and  more than 3,000 in Kwangju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. even called out fighter planes to  indiscriminately bomb and strafe peaceable people to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. troops and \"ROK\" army killed many innocent civilians under the name of \"punitive operation against communists\" and \"liquidation of those assisting rebels\" in the areas south of the 38th parallel that came again under their control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The massacre of civilians in Hamphyong, South Jolla Province was an example of their barbarities. The 5th company of the 11th division of the \"ROK\" army reduced the whole village of some 50 houses to ashes and killed all the aged people and women in less than 20 minutes on December 5, 1950, by the order of the American military adviser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Similar atrocities were also committed in Sanchong and Hamyang counties, South Kyongsang Province. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   On December 18, 1950, the \"Kanghwa homeland defence commando\" which was organized to \"liquidate red\" slew over 300 civilians in a little over two months. Countless is the number of those killed when the casualties are added to those murdered  by the \"commandos\" which were active in each sub-county. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Headquarters for searching the red\" was cooked up in Seoul. It set up \"check-points\"  in all streets to indiscriminately  arrest and kill innocent people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Even the evil \"slave labour law\"  was enacted to arrest and imprison anyone whose relatives joined the volunteer corps or anyone who assisted the people's army even a bit. As many as 72,390 people were tortured to death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. troops committed  monstrous massacre everywhere by mobilizing several divisions allegedly to \"ensure security in the rear.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the up reported on September 15, 1951, over one million innocent people were killed in South Korea from June 25, 1950 to the summer of 1951. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The shuddering massacre perpetrated by the U.S. troops and \"ROK\" army  in South Korea during the war  which started on June 25, 1950  is the  heinous crime unprecedented in history and the nation should force the murderers to  pay for the blood shed by the Koreans. \r\n\r\n"

He told them to take an optimistic view of the reality and undertake all work in a bold and big way in reliance upon enormous production potentials, attach importance to science, update technology and ensure real benefits through the improvement of economic methods. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His energetic on-the-spot guidance greatly inspired  all the people and brought about fresh miracles and  feats an all fronts of the socialist economic construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Korea will witness the appearance of a powerful and prosperous nation before long thanks to the second grand chollima march, now in full gear, demonstrating the might of the single-hearted unity between the leader and people. \r\n\r\n"

This is chiefly because the South Korean authorities are  serving and protecting their master from a sycophantic stand of toeing the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to put an end to the tragic history of the nation's division and gain the sovereignty of the nation it is necessary, first of all, to get the U.S. aggression forces withdrawn from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries must ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their anti-DPRK moves for war and confrontation, renounce the hostile policy toward the DPRK and act with discretion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean students and people should wage a more vigorous struggle to shatter the war moves of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries and the South Korean authorities subservient to them to ignite a war on the Korean peninsula and thus achieve  durable peace and security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the meeting were Kim Jung Rin, secretary of the C.C., the Worker's Party of Korea, and others. \r\n\r\n"
