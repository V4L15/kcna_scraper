            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean Bellicose Forces' Moves for Nuclear War against DPRK Blasted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, October 27 (KCNA) -- The bellicose forces of the United States and south Korea are nowadays getting evermore frantic in their moves to provoke a nuclear war against the DPRK under the pretext of its nuclear test. They are totally revising and supplementing their scenarios for a war against the DPRK, including \"OPLAN 5027\" while stepping up the introduction of latest nuclear war means. \r\n A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee released a statement on Friday blasting such moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such madcap nuclear war moves against the DPRK are an extremely reckless provocation as they cause the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula to fester and drive the situation to the worst phase, the statement said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States has turned south Korea into a nuclear arsenal, posing the threat of a nuclear war to the Korean nation for several decades. Instead of apologizing for such crimes, it is hatching a more dangerous plot to ignite a nuclear war, taking issue with the DPRK over its war deterrent for just self-defence. This proves that the U.S. has no intention to solve the nuclear issue on the peninsula but a wild design to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK by aggravating the situation at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is citing the DPRK's self-defensive nuclear deterrent as a pretext for escalating the nuclear arms race and provoking a war against the DPRK. Such behavior can never work on anybody as it is a reckless and brigandish deed reminding one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a day-dream to seek to bring down the dignified political system in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK are fully ready to retaliate against any provocation or nuclear war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the south Korean war-like forces would be well advised to stop running amuck and cancel at once such extremely provocative and reckless war scenarios. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military authorities should not do such a foolish thing as taking part in the war moves of the outsiders, well aware that the \"nuclear umbrella\" of their master would not protect them but only invite a disaster.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In pursuance of this aggressive and dominationist Korea strategy, the U.S. has kept its aggression troops in south Korea and persisted in military occupation and domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The aggression troops have committed madcap military provocations and war moves against the DPRK since the very day of their occupation of south Korea in utter disregard of the desire of the Korean nation and the requirement of international law in a bid to carry out the U.S. brigandish Korea strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' moves of aggression and war against the DPRK have assumed greater intensity of late. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists put a heavier stumbling block in the way of ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula by enhancing their forces' aggressive role and increasing their capability to fight a war under the pretext of \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea. And now they are putting greater spurs to the war exercises against the DPRK and arms buildup under the cloak of \"transfer of the right to control wartime operations\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' occupation and domination of south Korea and their moves to launch a war of aggression against the DPRK are a crime against peace and the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If south Korea remains under their occupation, the whole Korean nation cannot evade a nuclear holocaust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea is, in the final count, a matter of averting a war and ensuring peace on the Korean Peninsula. All the Koreans should build up a fiercer flame of the struggle for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces, staking the destiny of the nation, and thus pave the way for peace and reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said struggle is a struggle for finding settlement of the crimes committed by the fascist dictators in the past and bringing about new politics and new life, and it represents an advance for justice as it is meant to bury the pro-U.S. conservative forces who have covered a path of treachery for more than half a century, backed by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pro-U.S. fascist dictatorial forces in south Korea had been ousted from power after being forsaken by the times and people as they had infringed upon democracy and human rights and committed unpardonable crimes against the nation and humanity in reliance upon foreign forces. But the remnants of the history and their descendents have not been buried but joined the \"Grand National Party,\" whetting their swords to seek revenge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP is a traitorous party that has grown from the roots of the pro-U.S. fascist dictatorship. It is operating as a shelter for traitorous forces and their descendents and as a base for their frantic offensives. The \"GNP\" is, therefore, is the principal target of the struggle for liquidating the past history as it is based on the same pro-U.S. fascist dictatorship as what was in force in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"GNP\" is dead-set against the liquidation of the past history for fear that it may be brought to justice by history for the crimes perpetrated by its predecessor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"GNP,\" instead of quitting the political arena after apologizing to the nation for the above-mentioned crimes, is playing a petty trick in a bid to keep those crimes buried into oblivion and working hard to satisfy its greed fro power through the next \"presidential election.\" It is as clear as noonday that in case the \"GNP\" comes to power, it will ride roughshod over people and restore the harsh fascist dictatorship against them.
