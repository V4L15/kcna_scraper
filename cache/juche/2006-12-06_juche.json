Therefore, we have built powerful war deterrent under the banner of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is for the whole Korean nation. The politics defends not only the north but also the whole territory of Korea and protects the people of all strata in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In fact, it is not because of international law or the stand of neighboring countries that the U.S. imperialists have not ignited the second war in the Korean Peninsula. They are the warmongers who unleash a war of aggression in disregard of the UN if they are to realize their dominationist ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is the invincible treasured sword for preventing aggression and war of the U.S. imperialists on the Korean Peninsula and guaranteeing the reunification and prosperity of the Korean nation and the precious lifeline of the Korean nation for carving out independent destiny. Koreans' stand and attitude toward the Songun politics is a touchstone for distinguishing patriotism from treachery.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan's Move to Grab Tok Islet under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- Four Japanese maps which had long been kept under wraps in a library of south Korea were recently disclosed to draw public attention. According to them, Tok Islet was not marked on the Japanese historical map printed on the textbook inspected and approved by the Ministry of Education in 1929 and 1933 and the new Japanese geographical map album published in 1934.\r\n The bibliography of Japanese geographical names published by the International Association of Geography in 1940 did not mention the islet as part of the Japanese territory. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday observes this in a signed commentary. It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said historical and geographical facts once again prove that the Tok Islet belongs to Korea and it is a far-fetched assertion for the Japanese reactionaries to claim that the islet belongs to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing the Japanese reactionaries' moves to usurp the islet, the commentary notes: A postal service company of Japan issued three times hundreds of stamps of three kinds on which \"Takeshima\" was written in Japanese and English below a photograph of the islet taken in the air while the Shimane Prefecture set even the \"Day of Takeshima\" and the Japanese government undisguisedly claimed \"dominion\" over the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intolerable is Japan's claim for \"dominion\" over the islet now that it has been proved that the islet is part of the inviolable territory of Korea from the historical and legal point of view. It is a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation that Japan persistently and impudently claims \"dominion\" on Tok islet instead of settling all the hideous crimes it committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are keen to ignite another Korean war. It is against this backdrop that the Japanese militarists are working hard to stage a comeback to Korea, taking advantage of their moves. They consider their move to grab the islet as a prelude to this reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish of them to try to seize the islet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Commenting on this, Minju Joson Tuesday says:\r\n Japan has an inveterate bad habit of fishing in troubled waters by clinging to the coattail of its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is working hard to be free from the binding force of Article 9 of the Constitution. The Japanese chief executive is attempting to revise the constitution but no progress has yet been made in this respect due to the public strong opposition and pressure at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is for this reason that the Japanese reactionaries are trying to interpret and modify key points of the article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries conceived the active \"security cooperation\" with the U.S. in a bid to attain their sinister purpose. It is the ulterior aim pursued by the Japanese reactionaries to get justification for the exercise of \"the right to collective self-defense\" in return for clearing the U.S. of its \"security worries\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries leave no means untried to realize their cherished desire to become a \"leader of Asia\" through the militarization of Japan. They are poised not to bother to lick other's boots for this purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only Japan in the world which makes desperate efforts to attain such sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are too naive to think that everything will be solved once the path for militarist expansion is paved. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The exercise of the \"right to collective self-defense\" is as foolish an act as jumping into fire with faggot on one's back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to ponder over what serious consequences their reckless acts will entail and behave themselves.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Korean Bell Reflected in Tomb Mural Painting\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The Korean bell is a precious cultural heritage that the Korean people had developed in the period of middle ages following the ancient times.\r\n It is well illustrated by the Korean bell reflected in mural tomb No. 3 in Anak County, one of the mural tombs belonging to the period of Koguryo Dynasty. The color remains unchanged even one thousand and several hundreds of years after its building. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mural painting depicts a king's procession with 250 characters. Seen in the middle of the procession are the two characters shouldering the bell on a pole and a character beating with two hammers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The bell is similar with the Tongthak bell of Kojoson (ancient Korea). The patterns decorated on the bell body are same with the fine line patterns decorated in mirror and geometric patterns of Tongthak bell in the period of the Bronze Age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The instrumental march musicians are following the coach of the king. The Korean bell they are carrying has a handle on the very place where there was the Tongthak hook and the striking hammers were newly made. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows that the Koguryo people had developed the Tongthak, which was an ornament and one for rite, into a bell making loud metallic sound. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also shows that in making a metal tool, they not only pursued utility but also made efforts to reflect fine formative beauty in its shape, decoration and color. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean bell with a long history reflects the wisdom and resourcefulness of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After arresting her in the wake of the search operation the Japanese reactionaries are now treating her as a criminal and working hard with blood-shot eyes to build up public opinion against Chongryon by faking up the sheer lie that the medicament was meant for someone's exclusive use for manufacturing biological weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This reveals once again the moral vulgarity of the Japanese reactionaries and an intolerable criminal act prompted by extreme enmity toward the DPRK and Chongryon, observes Rodong Sinmun Tuesday in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the smear campaign launched by the Japanese reactionaries under the pretext of \"violation of the law on drug use\" is a serious criminal purpose to charge Chongryon with the violation of the law and secure a pretext for suppressing and destroying it, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese right-wing reactionaries' base mud-slinging at Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and crackdown and human rights abuses against them is an infringement upon the dignity of the DPRK and a vicious political provocation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The crackdown and persecution of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan intensified by the Japanese reactionaries against the backdrop of their frantic campaign against Chongryon and the DPRK, instead of apologizing and compensating for the hideous crimes committed against the Korean nation in the past, are touching off towering indignation among all Koreans. It is a fixed will of the Korean people to settle accounts with Japan, their sworn enemy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should clearly understand the towering resentment of the Koreans against Japan and immediately stop the reckless anti-DPRK and anti-Chongryon acts pushing the DPRK-Japan relations to an explosive phase.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
