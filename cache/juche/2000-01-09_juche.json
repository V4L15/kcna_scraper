            "content": "S. Korean chief executive's irresponsible remarks assailed\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 9 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive in his \"New Year address\" raised the issue of \"forming a south-north economic community\" by confining the inter-Korean relations just to \"economic cooperation\", turning his back on the issue of the reunification of the country vital to the nation. Terming it a very irresponsible behaviour before the nation, Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The so-called \"south-north economic community\" is nothing new. It was long ago that the north and south of Korea formed a body for economic cooperation under an agreement and specified the details of the overall cooperation. His assertion that the inter-Korean economic cooperation should be discussed by powerless research institutes is as good as an intention to grossly backpedal even the agreement already reached between the north and south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   There is no change in our stand to put into practice the already agreed provisions related to the inter-Korean economic cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What is important is to create an atmosphere and circumstances promptly to carry the agreed provisions into practice. To this end the South Korean authorities should find solutions to urgent fundamental problems in implementing the agreed provisions, including a drop of their dependence upon outside forces and the repeal of the \"security law.\" \r\n\r\n"
