            "content": "KCNA Commentary on \"Tax War\" between U.S. and EU\r\n Pyongyang, September 6 (KCNA) -- A new \"tax war\" broke out between the European Union and the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently the EU decided to levy a heavy fine on the U.S. multinational Apple Corporation on the basis of the three-year-long investigation into its tax evasion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The EU Commission made a final decision that the Apple Corporation is obliged to pay the exempted taxes to Ireland, claiming that for an individual corporation to get a special benefit in taxation contravenes the EU legislation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Commenting on this, media said that the EU again imposed the heaviest fine on the Apple in the wake of making a decision on collecting additional taxes running into a stupendous amount of money from the U.S. companies in Netherlands and Luxembourg despite friction with the U.S., adding that this was, in fact, a declaration of a \"war against tax evasion.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. deserves this maltreatment as it imposed unequal economic relations on other countries, pursuing their own unchallenged interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known, the U.S. is a rogue state without an equal as it regards it as its state policy to perpetrate economic aggression and plunder of other countries and regions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The free trade and the like much touted by the U.S. is nothing but a hypocritical artifice to invade and subjugate other countries and regions economically.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is evidenced by the remarks of the U.S. ambassador to Seoul that south Korea-U.S. free trade agreement will play a symbolic role of binding south Korea to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. economic policies, neo-colonial policies are now in force in disregard of domestic act and international law as they pursue financial benefits for a handful of conglomerates.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As disclosed to public, the U.S. conglomerates including the Apple are operating at least 1 600 bogus accounts in tax havens and the amount of the funds hidden by 50 companies of the U.S. amounts to 1 400 billion U.S. dollars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Muddy spring will have muddy streams. The U.S. conglomerates operating overseas cannot do otherwise.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Apple justified the tax evasion, claiming that it contributed to the job creation in Ireland and development of European economy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the U.S. government is pressurizing the EU to rescind the decision, threatening to double the taxes the European companies are obliged to pay in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of Treasury asserted that the EU additional taxation is little short of robbing U.S. tax payers of money.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These reckless remarks are no more than sophism spouted by the U.S. which has become corpulent by sacrificing the interests of other countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a legitimate measure of the EU for the defence of economic interests that it decided to levy a fine on the U.S. corporation despite the U.S. threat and blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t World media attributed the EU's decision to the American Empire's arrogant hegemonic policy now under fire worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. \"sanctions\" against the DPRK prove ineffective, bitterly rebuffed, as they run counter to the universally accepted international laws including the UN Charter. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. had better stop its rash acts, bearing in mind that its arrogant practices are censured and derided by an increasing number of countries."
