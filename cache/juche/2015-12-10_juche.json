Paektu and a monument to their field guidance, submachine-gun performance test ground and firing range and the revolutionary museum.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said with high appreciation that every part of the site has been redintegrated in the principle of historicism and its education compound and greening are neat and admirable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The education in the Songun (military-first) idea occupies an important part in the Party's ideological work, he said, adding that the Phyongchon Revolutionary Site has a very important role in conveying the immortal Songun revolutionary exploits performed by the peerlessly great persons of Mt. Paektu and encouraging the servicepersons and civilians to remain loyal to the Party's Songun leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced such tasks for operating the site as matters of displaying a photo of the President test-firing a submachine gun at the shooting range, intensifying the work to discover historic data, meticulously organizing the visits to the site, steadily raising the ability of its lecturers and conducting a brisk itinerant lecture and bettering the environment of the site.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Phyongchon Revolutionary Site is just a native place of the Songun arms, he said, adding: Every gun, produced thanks to the tireless efforts of the President, has formed a forest of arms defending the Party and the revolution, the country and its people and the historic gun report made by him at the site turned the DPRK into a powerful nuclear weapons state ready to detonate self-reliant A-bomb and H-bomb to reliably defend its sovereignty and the dignity of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If we struggle in the same spirit with which the workers produced submachine guns by their own efforts just after the liberation of the country when everything was in need, we can further build up our country into a powerful one no enemy dare to provoke, he said, stressing the need to steadily put big efforts on the development of the country's munitions industry associated with devoted efforts of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Hwang Pyong So, Yun Tong Hyon, Jo Yong Won, Hong Yong Chil and Jang Chang Ha."

            "content": "Kim Jong Il's Exploits Praised by Russian, Tajik Personages\r\n Pyongyang, December 10 (KCNA) -- Remembrance meetings were held by the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia and the Communist Party of Tajikistan on Dec. 2 and 3 on the occasion of the 4th anniversary of demise of leader Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t The director of the International Affairs Department of the Liberal Democratic Party of Russia said in a report that Kim Jong Il was a peerless statesman who safeguarded socialism by pursuing the great Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The director went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il was a great man who implemented the line of independence in politics, self-support in economy and self-reliance in national defence, turning the DPRK into a power which no enemy dares provoke. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was a father of the people who dedicated himself to them, regarding it as his motto to believe in them as in Heaven and always finding himself among them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has adhered to the independent stand and demonstrated its might as a power. This would have been unthinkable without the exploits of Kim Jong Il who was possessed of matchless grit and courage. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The chairman of the Communist Party of Tajikistan said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il is always remembered not only by the Korean people but by the world progressives as a great leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He developed in depth the Juche idea founded by President Kim Il Sung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He frustrated every move of the imperialist allied forces to stifle the DPRK and firmly defended socialism with his Songun revolutionary leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to his wise leadership, the DPRK emerged a political, ideological and military power which even the U.S. dares not provoke."
