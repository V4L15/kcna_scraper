            "content": "Japan's Moves for Territorial Expansion Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 7 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed article terms Japan's moves for territorial expansion a revelation of its ambition for a military giant and overseas expansion and a prelude to overseas aggression.\r\n Noting that the Japanese reactionaries seek to realize their long-cherished militarist ambition with their deliberate and undisguised moves to grab the lands of neighboring countries and expand their territory, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have set this year as the \"year of protecting the national interests\" and resorted to the frantic moves to grab others' lands and expand their territory, which goes to clearly prove that their militarist ambition has remained unchanged and reached a more grave and reckless stage of its materialization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their loud-mouthed \"protection of the national interests\" is, in essence, the slogan for undisguised overseas aggression. \r\n Japan's moves to grab others' lands and extend its territory are the extension of the Japanese imperialists' aggression of Asia in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of Japanese militarism to reinvade Asia and conquer the world. The Japanese reactionaries have never abandoned their ambition for overseas aggression. On the contrary, their ambition is getting stronger as the days go by.\r\n They intend to invent a pretext of overseas aggression through the territorial dispute. They attempt to intentionally deteriorate the territorial disputes with neighboring countries and escalate the tensions to perpetrate military aggression. Japan's claim to territories of neighboring countries and its moves to grab them are the root cause of the military clash. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have attributed the Japanese imperialists' defeat in the past to their weak might and beefed up their military muscle for overseas aggression. They are now arrogantly behaving, foolishly considering that it is high time for them to realize the ambition for the \"greater east Asia coprosperity sphere\" which they failed in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Given that the Japanese reactionaries are insisting that territories of other countries are parts of \"Japan's territory,\" it is easy to suppose what a dangerous phase their arrogance and ambition for overseas aggression have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are going to realize their ambition for military overseas expansion, taking the best advantage of the U.S. aggressive Asia strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should stop their reckless moves for territorial expansion, clearly mindful that their moves will bring only catastrophic disasters to Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also displayed its might as an unshakable and invincible bulwark even when socialism collapsed in different countries by the renegades of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to his politics of love and trust and benevolent politics the Korean people, who had been torn into fractions and could not defend their national sovereignty in the past, have realized all-people unity and cohesion for the first time in the history of the nation and the whole country has turned into a great harmonious family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great history and lineage of Kim Il Sung's Korea has been purely defended by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The future of Kim Il Sung's Korea is firmly guaranteed under the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il who adopted Kim Il Sung Constitution on holding him in high esteem as the eternal President of the DPRK, carried forward his idea and exploits 100 percent and carried on all state affairs including the Party, the state and the army the way he did.\r\n The 60-year long history of the country is more shining thanks to the 40-odd-year history of Kim Jong Il's leadership of Songun revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last \"Arduous March\" was the rigorous period when the worst hardships faced our country. But, our socialism has never shaken under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. Under his guidance the Korean People's Army has grown into an invincible strong army and displayed its ever-victorious might as the driving force of the revolution and first-line defender of socialism and the whole country has been turned into a powerful socialist bulwark unshakable under any political and ideological offensive and military threat of the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army and people are now stepping up the revolutionary general march to implement the life-long intention and last instructions of Kim Il Sung, father of socialist Korea, in response to the joint slogans published by the Central Committee and the Central Military Commission of the Workers' Party of Korea.

S. troops as an active volcano of the anti-U.S. struggle against their 60-year long occupation of south Korea and put an end to the thrice-cursed U. S. occupation of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people of all strata should wage a more vigorous anti-U.S. struggle to drive the U.S. imperialists aggressor troops, the root cause of all misfortunes and pains and the ringleader of all evils, out of south Korea, upholding the slogan \"Let us not go beyond the 60 years of the U.

In another development, it is contemplating the deployment for action one year earlier than scheduled of the missile defense system (MD) which had originally been expected at around the end of 2006. All these are very disturbing military moves. \r\n Minju Joson Saturday in a signed commentary carried in this regard observes: Japan attributes these boisterous military moves reminiscent of the eve of a war to the \"military threat from China and north Korea.\" These cannot be construed otherwise than rash military actions bringing their ulterior motive to light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan used to raise a hue and cry over the \"threat\" from someone whenever it took an important step for becoming a military power and realizing overseas aggression. It is the inveterate bad habit of Japan to find fault with others to meet its interests.\r\n The U.S. is now getting more frantic in its moves to bolster its military muscle in a bid to deter the major powers from exercising their influence in Northeast Asia and establish supremacy in Asian-Pacific. The MD now being jointly developed by the U.S. and Japan is also a product of their ambition to upset the strategic balance in Northeast Asia and go unchallenged in terms of strategic offensive weapons. It is Japan's chief aim to take a stride forward in its moves to emerge a military power and realize its ambition for reinvasion by taking best advantage of the U.S. military moves.\r\n This goes to prove that Japan's much publicized \"threat from China and north Korea\" is precisely the other side of their scenario to reinvade China and Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation in Northeast Asia is now rapidly deteriorating. A new wave of arms race is rising to sweep Northeast Asia where the consequences of the Cold War era have not yet been completely eradicated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries can never flee from the responsibility for having driven the regional situation into catastrophe, swimming against the trend of the present times toward peace and detente    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
