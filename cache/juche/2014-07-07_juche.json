            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects Defence Detachment on Ung Islet\r\nPyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, inspected the defence detachment on Ung Islet honored with the title of the Three-Revolution Red Flag, which is defending an outpost in the East Sea of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t After receiving a salute, he looked round the monument to the field guidance given by President Kim Il Sung. Kim Jong Un recollected with deep emotion the undying exploits performed by the President and leader Kim Jong Il for the development of the defence detachment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He noted Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il worked heart and soul for the development of the KPA. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the military installations there, he underscored the need for the service personnel of the detachment to turn the Ung Islet into an impregnable fortress and thus glorify for all ages the feats performed by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il in commanding the army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he watched the firepower training of the service personnel of the artillery emplacement visited by Kim Jong Il. He gave an order to open fire and guided their drill. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was greatly satisfied to see them accurately hit the target. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Highly praising the artillerymen for accurately hitting the target, he said that he was very pleased to meet the crack shots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He bestowed the great honor of awarding a crack shot diploma to the Artillery Piece No. 1 of the First Platoon of the First Company of the detachment and crack shot medals and badges to its artillery men before having a photo taken with them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He watched the heavy gymnastic drill of the service personnel of the detachment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks which would serve as guidelines for rounding off the combat capability of the detachment. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"The commanding officers of the detachment should prepare themselves as commanding officers and political cadres of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il style and intensify the political and ideological education among the service personnel to train them as revolutionaries and patriots strong in idea and faith and possessed of versatile knowledge and high cultural attainments,\" he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed the need for the detachment to always direct efforts to the anti-U.S. education and class education, regardless of conditions and circumstances, so that the service personnel may make training part of their life and habit with burning hatred towards the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave an instruction to the detachment to turn it into one of crack shots so that it may send the enemies intruding into the waters of the DPRK to the bottom of the sea to the last man once a battle kicks off and thus not allow them to set foot even an inch of its inviolable land. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the bedrooms, education rooms, wash-cum-bath rooms, mess halls and stores of the First and Third companies of the detachment to take deep care of the living of their service personnel as their real father would do.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After learning in detail about the supply service to the service personnel, education of the children of the military families, etc., he stressed the need to pay particular attention to the living of the service personnel there and their families. He showed deep loving care for the defence detachment, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave a pair of binoculars and an automatic rifle to the First Company as gifts and had a photo session with the service personnel of the detachment and the military families. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA, and KPA Colonel General Pak Jong Chon, vice chief of the General Staff and director of the Firepower Commanding Department of the KPA."

            "content": "DPRK Government Statement Calls for Ending Confrontation and Improving North-South Ties\r\nPyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The government of the DPRK released the following statement Monday, 20 years since President Kim Il Sung left his last signature on a historic document related to Korea's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean nation's cause for national reunification is undergoing big difficulties and trials due to the vicious challenge and obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad, the statement said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government clarifies as follows out of its patriotic desire to tide over the difficulties lying before the nation, improve the north-south relations and open up a fresh turning phase for independent reunification at present:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. The north and the south should end reckless hostility and confrontation and open up the road for reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grave situation in which even a single remark and act and tiny friction may lead to a dangerous conflict and destruction of the nation is prevailing on the Korean peninsula as hostility and confrontation have reached the extremes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should no longer remain a passive on-looker to this tragic situation in which exhaustive political strife among compatriots may cause tremendous catastrophe of the nation at a crucial time when all the Koreans should pool their strength and wisdom for the cause common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south should open up the road for improvement of relations from fresh viewpoint and stand for the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should discard the anachronistic concept of hostility and make a bold decision to change its policy for confrontation with fellow countrymen into that for alliance and reconciliation with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should stop all kinds of the north-targeted war exercises which they conduct with outsiders, a direct product of their hostile policy toward the fellow countrymen in the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they have true willingness to improve the relations with the north, they should opt for respecting and implementing the north-south agreements including the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration which were provided thanks to the top leaders of the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2. The north and the south should reject dependence on outsiders and settle all issues by the efforts of Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south should never fall a victim to outsiders keen on catching fish in troubled waters through the division of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should solve all issues by their own efforts in the common interests of the nation from the stand of putting the nation above all, attaching importance to the nation and achieving national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south should never tolerate the unreasonable act of outsiders to interfere in the internal issue of the nation but counter it with joint efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will join hands with all those including the south Korean authorities if they take the stand of settling the issue of the north-south relations and the reunification issue of the country in line with the desire and wish of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 3. The north and the south should seek reasonable reunification proposals supported by all Koreans and that guarantee the prosperity common to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is increasing demand and requirement of fellow countrymen to achieve reunification through federal formula in Korea where differing ideologies and social systems exist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the June 15 joint declaration the north and the south recognized that there are common points in the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed confederation, and agreed to work for reunification in this direction in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north and the south should specify the reunification proposals by way of federation and confederation and make efforts to realize them and thus actively promote co-existence, co-prosperity and common interests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 4. The north and the south should create the atmosphere favorable for the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To actively create the atmosphere favorable for reconciliation and unity at present is a prerequisite for improving the extremely deteriorated north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to put an end to all kinds of calumnies and vituperations that foster misunderstanding and distrust among the fellow countrymen, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Legal and institutional measures that block kindred bonds and compatriotic feelings between the north and the south should be lifted and a broad avenue for contacts, visits, cooperation and dialogue should be opened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An end should be put at an early date to such an abnormal situation in south Korea in which the desire of the people from all walks of life for reunification is dampened and the hostility against the DPRK is incited through the racket for \"eliminating forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the above-mentioned principled stand of the DPRK and measures taken by it in good faith are implemented, an epochal occasion will be provided in normalizing the deteriorated north-south ties, easing the situation on the Korean peninsula and achieving the national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We express the expectation that all Koreans would actively support the principled stand of the DPRK government that was prompted by its noble sense of responsibility to improve the north-south ties and open up a wide avenue for independent reunification and that the south Korean authorities would positively respond to it."

            "content": "DFRK Memorandum on Feats of Kim Il Sung, Kim Jong Il for Korea's Reunification\r\nPyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea (DFRK) made public a memorandum Sunday to convey down through generations the great exploits performed by President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il, the peerless great men of Mt. Paektu, before the nation for the sacred cause of national reunification, 20 years since the President left his signature \"Kim Il Sung July 7, 1994\" in a historic document related to Korea's reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The President wisely led the nationwide struggle to put an end to the permanent division of the country and realize the independence and complete sovereignty of the country, the memorandum said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In several speeches including the New Year address for Juche 37 (1948) the President aroused all the people in the north and the south to the nationwide struggle to oppose the ruinous \"separate election\" of the U.S. imperialists and their followers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After finding the way for preventing the national division in the unity of all patriotic forces in the north and the south, he took practical measures one after another to this end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On his initiative, there took place in a big way the historic north-south joint conference in Pyongyang in April 1948 amid great interest and expectation of all Koreans. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the April joint conference he made a scientific analysis of the political situation that prevailed in the country and clarified a signal measure for waging a nationwide struggle to build a reunified independent and sovereign state by pooling all efforts and to build a unified government on the principle of democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Under his energetic leadership, there took place the general election for the establishment of a unified government across the north and the south, and the founding of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea was proclaimed all over the world on September 9, 1948.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After founding the DPRK, he energetically led the struggle to form the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea comprising all patriotic political parties and social organizations in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place in Pyongyang in June 1949 a meeting for forming the front with the attendance of representatives of 71 political parties and social organizations in the presence of the President.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He directed big efforts into arousing all the Koreans to the struggle for foiling the moves to provoke a new war on the part of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces and for realizing the reunification of the country in a peaceful way under the condition that the DPRK was founded and the front comprising patriotic forces from all walks of life in the north and the south of Korea was formed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He provided wise guidance over the struggle to stir up the atmosphere for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in a nationwide scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He clarified the policies for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country in a report to the meeting held in 1955 for celebrating the 10th anniversary of the liberation of Korea (August 15), a report to the 3rd Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea convened in April 1956 and other works.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Considering it as an important issue in realizing the peaceful reunification of the country to bring the living of the south Koreans to normal, he made sure that assistance was rendered to them with warm compatriotic feelings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also saw to it that the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea was formed in May 1961, thus providing a powerful driving force for realizing the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the 4th Congress of the WPK in September 1961, he stressed the need for the Korean people to reunify the country independently and peacefully.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Attaching great significance to the work of getting the force for national reunification ready, he energetically guided the struggle for its realization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the 8th Plenary Meeting of the 4th Central Committee of the WPK in February 1964, he advanced the outstanding policy on strengthening in every way the three forces for national reunification-- the revolutionary forces in the northern half of Korea, the revolutionary forces in south Korea and the international revolutionary forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When meeting a representative from the south side who came over to Pyongyang to take part in the north-south high-level political talks on May 3, 1972, he expounded the three principles of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The north-south joint statement was made public simultaneously in Pyongyang and Seoul on July 4, 1972 amid the great interest of the Korean nation and the attention of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also wisely led the struggle to put into practice the July 4 joint statement and thus prevent the permanent division of the nation and put the national reunification movement on a new stage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the historic 6th Congress of the WPK in October 1980, he advanced the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo and wisely led the struggle for putting it into practice, thereby opening up a wide avenue for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the north-south relations faced a crisis due to the U.S. imperialists' vicious racket for nuclear threats, the President turned the adversities into favorable conditions with his matchless grit, thus making sure that the national reunification movement steadily advanced along the road of victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the 5th Session of the 9th Supreme People's Assembly in April 1993, he declared before the world \"10-Point Programme of the Great Unity of the Whole Nation for the Reunification of the Country\", thus opening up a new chapter for the great national unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 7, 1994, he, looking far into the national reunification, left his last signature reading \"Kim Il Sung July 7, 1994\" on a historic document, reflecting the minds of all the Koreans. This was the last autograph he left in his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum said that leader Kim Jong Il worked heart and soul to glorify for all generations to come the undying feats performed by the President for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The monument inscribed with the President's signature was successfully built in Panmunjom under the leadership of Kim Jong Il to convey long the President's leadership feats for reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il made public the famous work \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" on August 4, 1997, thus making a comprehensive compilation of the national reunification feats performed by the President and formulating the three principles of national reunification, the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo as the three charters for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il ushered in the June 15 era of independent reunification. This shines as a distinguished exploit he performed before the country and the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There took place the significant meeting of the top leaders of the north and the south for the first time in the 55 years of national division in Pyongyang in June 2000 and a historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration was adopted and made public to the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that the historic \"Declaration for Development of North-South Relations and Peace and Prosperity\" was adopted on October 4, 2007, to the great excitement of all the Koreans and the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum said that the Korean nation's cause of reunification is given a steady continuity today under the outstanding and tested leadership of Marshal Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Let Us Brilliantly Accomplish the Revolutionary Cause of Juche, Holding Kim Jong Il in High Esteem as the Eternal General Secretary of Our Party\", \"Let Us Add Eternal Brilliance to Comrade Kim Jong Il's Great Idea and Achievements of the Songun Revolution\" and other works authored by the Marshal reflect his iron faith and will to achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail true to the noble intentions of the peerless great men of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Marshal set forth from a fresh angle the line on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force to bolster up the capabilities for self-defence with the nuclear force as a pivot which Kim Jong Il provided with his lifelong dedication, thus laying a firm foundation for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country by strictly rejecting the outsiders' domination and interference.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His speech at the military parade for celebrating the centenary of birth of the President in April 2012 has become an inspiring banner that instilled great hope and optimism about the future of a reunified country into the hearts of all Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The special proposal recently sent by the National Defence Commission of the DPRK to the south Korean authorities has aroused big support and sympathy of the public inside and outside as it reflected the desire and wish of all the Koreans to improve the north-south relations that were pushed to a catastrophe, put an end to the state of confrontation and realize at an early date the national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The memorandum called on all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to wage a courageous nationwide struggle to carry through the instructions for national reunification of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Un."

Therefore, the differing ideologies and social systems in the north and the south do not provide any ground for the compatriots to be hostile to each other and stand in confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pursuance of the north-south confrontation is a sycophantic act and an act of treachery as it is little short of dancing to the tune of outsiders who are keen on keeping the Korean nation divided and sowing seeds of discord between them to fish in troubled waters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An atmosphere favorable for national reconciliation and unity can never be created as long as the north and the south stand in confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should discard the anachronistic concept of indiscriminately antagonizing the fellow countrymen because of differing ideology and social system but take a bold decision to make a switchover in its policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen to that of alliance and reconciliation with the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All forms of north-targeted war exercises which the south stages in collusion with outsiders are a basic factor of escalating the north-south confrontation as it is a direct product of its hostile policy toward the fellow countrymen in the north. The war exercises under various codenames which the south Korean authorities stage every year together with the U.S. have escalated the political and military confrontation between compatriots and seriously harassed the peace on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t National reconciliation and peace can hardly be achieved as long as military exercises, an open threat to the dialogue partner, persist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is necessary to respect and implement the north-south agreements in order to put an end to the confrontation between the north and the south and achieve the national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration serve as firm guidelines for putting an end to the state of confrontation between the north and the south, improving the relations between them and achieving the independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the denial of the agreements common to the north and the south is a major factor of pushing the north-south ties to a catastrophe and confrontation. As conservative \"governments\" appeared in south Korea one after another, the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration were totally denied and all the achievements made in the June 15 era were brought to naught and the north-south relations were pushed to the lowest ebb.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prevailing on the peninsula at present due to the south Korean authorities' extremely reckless hostile policy and confrontational moves is such a grave situation that even a slight provocative word and action  and a friction may lead to a dangerous conflict and national ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the crucial time for the north and the south to pave the way for improving the relations with a fresh viewpoint and stand for national reconciliation and unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All Koreans should turn out as one in the patriotic struggle to put an end to the state of confrontation between the north and the south, with the single and sincere desire to achieve the reconciliation and unity of the nation and the peace and reunification of the country."

            "content": "Crucial Time for Settling Issue of Korea's Reunification: News Analyst\r\nPyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- It is 20 years since President Kim Il Sung left his last autograph on a historic document related to the national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of Korea's reunification spawned as the territory of the country was divided due to outsiders at the end of the Second World War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Taking to heart more than anyone else the misfortune and pain the Koreans have undergone due to their split though they had lived in one and the same territory as a homogeneous nation generation after generation, President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il devoted all their wisdom and energies to achieving the reunification of the country all their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the liberation of the country the President convened the historic Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Social Organizations in North and South Korea, arousing all the Koreans to the nationwide struggle to foil the moves of the sycophantic and traitorous forces to divide the nation and ushering in a heyday of the reunification movement through the solidarity and alliance of the whole nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He clarified the three principles of national reunification in the July 4 joint statement and set forth the 10-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo, thus providing basic guidelines for solving the reunification issue of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President energetically worked for decades for the country's reunification and left his last autograph on a historic document related to the national reunification in the last moments of his life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il opened up a bright prospect for independent reunification, regarding national reunification as his noble mission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He authored \"Let Us Carry Out the Great Leader Comrade Kim Il Sung's Instructions for National Reunification\" and other famous works, formulating the President's idea and line on national reunification as the three charters for national reunification, laying down the five-point policy for the great unity of the nation and providing a powerful weapon for realizing independent reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He made sure that the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and the October 4 declaration were made public as a valuable boon for achieving independent reunification, peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The cause of national reunification that had dynamically advanced along the road indicated by Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is undergoing great trials due to the vicious challenge and obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the emergence of the conservative regime in south Korea, all the achievements made in the June 15 era were brought to naught, the north-south relations are at rock bottom and the danger of a nuclear war is increasing with each passing day on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The reality in which the competition for hegemony is festering among big powers over the Korean peninsula proves that if the Korean nation persists in confrontation that does more harm than good, it can not get rid of a bottomless quagmire after being played into the hands of outsiders.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the Koreans who are keenly interested in national reunification and they are also directly responsible for the reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now is the crucial time when the north and the south should carve out with responsibility the destiny of the nation and its future, shouldering upon themselves the dignity and honor of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t An exhaustive political strife among compatriots is likely to spark a national disaster at a crucial time when all of them should pool efforts and wisdom for the cause common to the nation. This tragic situation should never be allowed to go on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the way of developing the national reunification movement to positively support and respond to the special proposal of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and the statement of the DPRK government calling for paving a wide avenue for improving the north-south relations and achieving the independent reunification."

            "content": "Two North Korean Missiles Cause Unified Barrage of Retaliatory Propaganda Fire\r\nPyongyang, July 7 (KCNA) -- NSNBC, an internet homepage of Denmark, posted an article titled \"Two North Korean Missiles Cause Unified Barrage of Retaliatory Propaganda Fire\" contributed by Christof Lehmann, a German expert on international issue, on June 29.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t North Korean (DPRK) Head of State Kim Jong Un witnessed the test of two domestically developed tactical guided missiles. Similar events are regular occurrences in other arms-producing nations, but somehow, these two missiles caused a barrage of retaliatory propaganda fire launched by corporate western mainstream media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t KCNA, the official news agency of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK), reported that Kim Jong Un, in his function as First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, First Chairman of the National Defence Commission and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army, participated in the launch of what is described as a newly developed, cutting-edge ultra-precision tactical guided missile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Both the photo opportunity for Kim Jong Un and the missile test were a success, assuring North Korean citizens about the Korean People's Army's short, medium, and long-range defense capabilities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The test and photo-op were also reassuring the people of the People's Republic about the fact that the political and military leadership, including Kim Jong Un, are doing their utmost to prevent a repetition of the genocidal war that was being waged against Koreans by the United States.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The war that ground to a halt at the 38th parallel in 1953 is no longer ago than that many still can remember utterly devastated cities and the cave dwellings in which tens of thousands had to seek shelter from the U.S. carpet-bombing of undefended civilian cities.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Yearly U.S.-led military drills like Foal Eagle, Double Dragon, or Key Resolve and recent years' U.S. foreign policy, resulting in a war in Libya, Mali and Iraq-again, leave no doubt: a credible defense is necessary to deter the aggressor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A Barrage of Retaliatory propaganda \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successful missile test didn't fail to provoke a barrage of retaliatory propaganda fire. The state-run BBC pointed out that:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The North is under UN sanctions over its weapons and nuclear porgrammes. It has carried out nuclear tests in 2006, 2009 and 2013 and is thought to have enough nuclear material for a small number of bombs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The BBC failed to add that the DPRK's satellite launch was legal, that the underground nuclear weapons test was legal, that the sanctions were illegal and that both Russia and China had each their geopolitical reasons to go along with the illegal, U.S.-sponsored sanctions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Another \"noteworthy\" fact about the BBC is that it never reported that U.S. troops in Korea use the UN designation illegally and that the U.S. defied the calls of three UN Secretary-Generals to stop the illegal use of the UN name.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The New York Times made a point, headlining that \"North Korea Fires 2 Missiles in Defiance of U.N. Ban\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The NYT didn't explain whether the headline referred to an illegally imposed missile firing ban or to Ban, like Ban Ki-moon and his failure to work towards sanctioning the United States until it stops its fraudulent use of the UN name for U.S. troops in the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Other media that didn't fail to participate in the unified retaliatory propaganda barrage include Associated Press, CNN, ABC, Al Jazeera, Japan Times, Chicago Tribune, Global Gazette, Evening Express,… just to mention a few.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is noteworthy that this unified propaganda barrage was launched after the launch of two missiles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also noteworthy that the DPRK may have the material to produce five or six nuclear warheads and that the U.S. has an operational potential of thousands of nuclear ballistic missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The most noteworthy fact may be that one U.S. administration after the other has either threatened the use of nuclear weapons against the DPRK or reserved to leave \"all options on the table\". Who would want to blame a responsible political and military leadership and the people for wanting to have a deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A unified corporate Western media celebrates U.S. missile tests.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t June 22, 2014, only days before the DPRK launched two missiles across open sea, the Reuters news agency reports \"U.S. missile defense system hits target in key test\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report celebrates the successful flight test of the exercising elements of the Ground-Based Midcourse Defense (GMD) system that was launched by the 30th Space Wing and the U.S. Missile Defense Agency at the Vandenberg AFB, California June 22, 2014. It justified the test with potentially menacing threats from the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Always happy to promote the special relationship between the U.S. and the United Kingdom, the M15 and M16 infested \"the guardian\" didn't let the Atlantic partners down, celebrating the first successful U.S. ballistic missile test since 2008. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Joining \"the guardian\" in the celebratory propaganda choir were, among others:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IB Times, The Wall Street Journal, Raytheon, NewsMax, FOX News, The Statesman, CNN, Yahoo,… among many others.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t None reported the fact that one of the primary objectives with using so-called defensive anti-ballistic missile systems is to secure a first-strike capability. None promoted any ban, or demanded that Ban Ki-moon should reprimand the U.S., or reiterate the UN's call on the U.S. to stop its fraudulent use of the UN designation for its U.S. troops in the Korean peninsula under the UN command."

El Norte y el Sur deben poner fin al temerario estado hostil y de confrontacion y abrir el camino de reconciliacion y la unidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, en la Peninsula Coreana, han llegado a un ultimo extremo la hostilidad y la confrontacion, debido a lo cual perdura la situacion grave en que tal insignificante palabra y friccion puedan provocar un peligroso conflicto y la derrota nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo deben estar con brazos cruzados ante esta situacion tragica que por innecesarios conflictos politicos entre los connacionales, causara una catastrofe de la nacion en este periodo importante en que todos los coreanos deben unirlas fuerzas e inteligencias para la causa comun de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el destino de la nacion, el Norte y el Sur deben abrir el camino de mejoramiento de las relaciones con nuevo punto de vista y posicion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas deben tomar la decision audaz de cambiar la politica de confrontacion fratricida en la de reconciliacion y alianza con el Norte, al abandonar el anacronico ideal hostil.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY deben suspender todos los ejercicios de guerra contra la RPDC en contubernio con las fuerzas exteriores, producto concentrado de la politica hostil a los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas tienen la voluntad sincera de mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas, deberan respetar y cumplir los acuerdos comunes del Norte y el Sur inclusive la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre, preparadas por las cumbres N-S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. El Norte y el Sur deben rechazar la dependencia de las fuerzas foraneas y resolver todos los problemas entre los connacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cualquiera ocasion, el Norte y el Sur no deben ser victimas de las fuerzas extranjeras que quieren sacar lucros en la division de nuestro pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Norte y el Sur deben resolver todos los problemas entre las connacionales conforme al interes comun de la nacion partiendo de la posicion de dar prioridad, importancia y unidad a la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Norte y el Sur no deben permitir todas las acciones injustas de las fuerzas extranjeras tendentes a intervenir en los asuntos internos de la nacion, y enfrentarse en comun a ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC tomara las manos de cualesquiera personas inclusive las autoridades surcoreanas, si estan en la posicion de resolver el problema de relaciones intercoreanas, el de reunificacion de la patria, conforme a la aspiracion y anhelo de la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3.

El Norte y el Sur deben crear el ambiente favorable a la mejora de relaciones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la actualidad, crear activamente el ambiente favorable a la reconciliacion y la unidad es la premisa imprescindible para mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas empeoradas al extremo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que poner punto final primero a la difamacion de toda indole que genera el malentendido y la desconfianza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace falta disolver las medidas legales e institucionales que impiden el lazo fraternal intercoreano y el amor entre los compatriotas y abrir el camino de contacto, viaje, cooperacion y dialogo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe debe concluir cuanto antes la situacion anormal del Sur de Corea donde debido a la campana de \"purga a las fuerzas pro-Norte\" se viola la ansiedad de reunificacion de diversos estratos y se inculca la concepcion hostil anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi se realizan las posiciones de principios y las medidas de buena fe de la RPDC arriba mencionadas, se preparara un motivo de viraje en normalizar las empeoradas relaciones intercoreanas, aliviar la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y lograr la reconciliacion y unidad nacionales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExpresamos la esperanza de que todos los compatriotas apoyen activamente y las autoridades surcoreanas respondan a la posicion de principios del gobierno de la RPDC al partir de su noble responsabilidad de abrir el nuevo camino de las relaciones N-S y la reunificacion independiente."

dejada por el Presidente Kim Il Sung en el documento historico referente a la reunificacion de la patria, el Secretariado del Comite Central del Frente Democratico para la Reunificacion de la Patria hizo publico el dia 6 un memorando para transmitir de generacion en generacion las indelebles hazanas de los grandes hombres del monte Paektu realizadas por la causa de reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota recuerda la destacada direccion del Presidente sobre la lucha pannacional para prevenir la division perpetua del pais y lograr la  soberania y la independencia completa de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su Mensaje del Ano Nuevo del 37 (1948) de la Era Juche y otros discursos, el Presidente llamo a todo el pueblo del Norte y el Sur a la lucha nacional contra las \"elecciones por separado\" del imperialismo norteamericano y sus lacayos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl buscar la salida de la crisis de la division nacional en la unidad de todas las fuerzas patrioticas del Norte y el Sur, tomo las  sucesivas medidas practicas para este fin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor la iniciativa del Presidente, se efectuo en abril de 1948 con solemnidad en Pyongyang la historica Conferencia Conjunta del Norte y el Sur en medio de la atencion y la esperanza de toda la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la ocasion, el Presidente analizo de modo cientifico la situacion politica creada en Corea e indico una medida trascendental de desarrollar una lucha nacional para construir un Estado reunificado, soberano e independiente y establecer un gobierno unificado en el principio democratico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a su dinamica direccion, en toda la extension del Norte y el Sur se desarrollaron las elecciones generales para establecer el gobierno unificado y a base de ellas, fue proclamada el 9 de septiembre de 1948 a todo el mundo la fundacion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues de fundarla, el Presidente dirigio la lucha por constituir el Frente Democratico para la Reunificacion de la Patria que abarca todos los partidos politicos patrioticos y las entidades sociales del Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn junio de 1949, bajo la presencia del Presidente tuvo lugar en esta capital la conferencia de constitucion del FDRP con la participacion de los delegados de los 71 partidos politicos y entidades sociales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConforme a tales condiciones dadas, el Presidente dedico grandes esfuerzos a movilizar a toda la nacion coreana en la lucha por frustrar las maniobras del imperialismo norteamericano y los titeres surcoreanos tendentes a provocar una nueva guerra y realizar por via pacifica la integracion territorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl oriento sabiamente la campana pannacional para activar el ambiente de la reunificacion independiente y pacifica de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el informe presentado ante el acto por el 10o aniversario de la liberacion del 15 de agosto de 1955 y el otro presentado ante el III Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, convocado en abril de 1956, y otras obras, indico claramente la orientacion de reunificacion independiente y pacifica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl considerar la estabilizacion de vida de los habitantes surcoreanos como un problema importante para realizar la reunificacion pacifica de la patria, hizo ayudarles con el caluroso amor fraternal.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn mayo de 1961, hizo constituir el Comite por la Reunificacion Pacifica de la Patria, asi que se preparo la poderosa fuerza motriz de la lucha por la empresa coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el IV Congreso del PTC efectuado en septiembre de 1961, dijo que el pueblo coreano debia realizar la reunificacion pacifica de manera independiente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl dar gran importancia a la preparacion de las fuerzas necesarias a esta empresa, condujo con dinamismo la lucha por llevarla a cabo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el VIII Pleno del IV Periodo del Comite Central del PTC, efectuado en febrero de 1964, presento la orientacion de consolidar por todos los medios las tres fuerzas revolucionarias, o sea, las de la RPDC, las del Sur de Corea y las internacionales para realizar la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 3 de mayo de 1972, se reunio con el delegado surcoreano quien vino a Pyongyang para participar en las conversaciones politicas de alto rango N-S, ocasion en la cual aclaro los  Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 4 de julio de 1972, en Pyongyang y Seul se publico a la vez la Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur atrayendo gran atencion de toda la nacion coreana y el resto del mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente dirigio sabiamente las labores para ponerla en practica a fin de impedir la division perpetua de la nacion y llevar a una nueva etapa el movimiento por la reunificacion de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el historico VI Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, celebrado en octubre de 1980, presento el Proyecto de la Fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo y abrio una buena perspectiva por la reunificacion independiente y pacifica de la patria dirigiendo sabiamente la lucha por realizarlo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando las relaciones intercoreanas se encontraban en la crisis debido al brutal alboroto nuclear de los imperialistas norteamericanos, el Presidente convirtio con su audacia incomparable la situacion en la favorable y llevo adelante el movimiento por la reintegracion territorial del pais. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el quinto periodo de sesiones de la IX Legislatura de la Asamblea Popular Suprema, efectuado en abril de 1993, proclamo a todo el mundo el \"Programa de diez puntos de la gran unidad pannacional para la reunificacion de la patria\" y abrio una nueva era para la gran unidad nacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 7 de julio de 1994, dejo su ultimo autografo de vida \"Kim Il Sung, el 7 de julio  de 1994\" reflejando el alma de toda la nacion y previendo el dia de reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota enumera que el Dirigente Kim Jong Il hizo todo lo posible por glorificar generacion tras generacion las imborrables proezas del Presidente por la reunificacion de la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGracias a la energica guia del Dirigente, la lapida con ese autografo del Presidente dejado en el documento historico el 7 de julio de 1994 se ha levantado magnificamente en Phanmunjom como monumento para transmitir las proezas del Presidente por la reunificacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 4 de agosto de 1997, el Dirigente publico la obra maestra \"Materialicemos de modo consecuente el legado del gran Lider, camarada Kim Il Sung, para la reunificacion de la Patria\". En la obra sintetizo globalmente las hazanas del Presidente por la reintegracion territorial del pais y formulo como Tres Cartas para la Reunificacion de la Patria los Tres Principios de la Reunificacion de la Patria, el Programa de Diez Puntos de la Gran Unidad Pannacional y el Proyecto de la Fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente abrio la era de reunificacion independiente del 15 de Junio, lo cual es su mas relevante proeza realizada ante la patria y la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn junio de 2000, se realizo en Pyongyang la Cumbre Norte-Sur por primera vez en la division nacional de 55 anos, ocasion en la cual se publico la historica Declaracion Conjunta Norte-Sur del 15 de Junio. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 4 de octubre de 2007, fue aprobada la historica \"Declaracion para el Desarrollo de Relaciones Norte-Sur, la Paz y la Prosperidad\" conmoviendo a toda la nacion y todo el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor ultimo, el documento narra que hoy dia, la causa de la nacion coreana por la reunificacion de la patria continua ininterrumpidamente por la destacada y probada direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las obras del Mariscal como \"Llevemos a feliz termino la causa revolucionaria del Juche enalteciendo al gran camarada Kim Jong Il como eterno Secretario General de nuestro Partido\" y \"Hagamos perpetuas la gran idea revolucionaria de Songun del companero Kim Jong Il y sus hazanas\" estan reflejadas su ferrea conviccion y voluntad de lograr sin falta la historica empresa nacional en acato al noble proposito de los grandes hombres sin iguales del monte Paektu. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Mariscal presento la nueva linea de desarrollo simultaneo de la construccion economica y la de fuerzas armadas nucleares para fortalecer la capacidad de autodefensa nacional basada en las fuerzas armadas nucleares preparadas por el Dirigente. De esta manera, preparo la firme base para rechazar la dominacion y la intervencion de las fuerzas extranjeras y reunificar la patria de manera independiente y por via pacifica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl discurso del Mariscal pronunciado en abril de 2012 en el desfile militar en celebracion del centenario del natalicio del Presidente Kim Il Sung estimulo a toda la nacion y le infundio la gran esperanza y optimismo sobre el futuro de la patria reunificada. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa propuesta especial del Comite de Defensa Nacional de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, recien enviada a las autoridades surcoreanas, acapara gran apoyo y simpatia del interior y el exterior, porque refleja la aspiracion nacional de mejorar las relaciones intercoreanas en la fase catastrofica, eliminar el estado de enfrentamiento y realizar cuanto antes la reunificacion de la patria, anhelo de la nacion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa nota llama a todos los integrantes de la nacion en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar a dinamizar la lucha pannacional por materializar los legados de los grandes Generalisimos en materia de la reunificacion de la patria bajo la sabia orientacion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un."
