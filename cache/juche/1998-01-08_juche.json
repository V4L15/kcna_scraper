The forced march of socialism is the only way out for us and a road to victory in socialism.\r\n   This is a historic struggle to realise the ideas and politics of the General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   He is a great statesman and iron-willed brilliant commander who is leading the new era of the Juche revolution with extraordinary strategy, matchless grit and outstanding leadership art. When his ideas and politics are thoroughly put into effect, there will be no fortress we cannot occupy.\r\n   The forced march is a worthwhile struggle to make a new upsurge in the socialist economic construction. It is aimed at decisively solving economic problems and improving the living standard of the people. Only when our strong political and military force is combined with a solid economic foundation can we pull through any difficulties and consolidate the bulwark of socialism as firm as a rock.\r\n   Our forced march of socialism must be oriented toward adorning this year marking the 50th founding anniversary of the DPRK with great revolutionary upsurges in the socialist economic construction.\r\n   It is a proud tradition of our revolution to overcome severe situations with forced marches and emerge victorious.\r\n   The slogan \"Let us push ahead with the forced march for the final victory !.\" represents the strong spirit of the revolutionary forerunners who always won victories and also reflects the stamina of the revolutionary Korean people.\r\n   The arduous march in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle led to the liberation of the country and the post-war grand Chollima March built up a powerful state independent, self-sustaining and self-reliant in defence.\r\n   The present forced march will bring an eternal prosperity in the new era of the Juche revolution. \r\n   Socialism and the final victory are ours.    \r\n\r\n"

At this time, however, the three parties have agreed to go ahead with the introduction of the reactionary system, clean indifferent to the interests of the workers.\r\n   Their attempt to solve the economic problem at the sacrifice of workers is an unreasonable, anti-people behavior.\r\n   The three-party agreement is aimed at encouraging the  Kim Young Sam regime in its waning days to fully implement the demand of the IMF, thus getting a larger amount of money from it.    \r\n\r\n"
