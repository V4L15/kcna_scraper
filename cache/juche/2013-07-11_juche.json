Korean Intelligence Service\r\n Pyongyang, July 11 (KCNA) -- South Koreans are becoming increasingly stronger in denouncing the Intelligence Service (IS) for interfering in the \"presidential election\" and making public the minutes of the 2007 north-south summit.\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of civic and public organizations, the Federation of University Students and opposition parties published the declarations on the situation and held candlelight rallies, demonstrations and other mass actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an eruption of their pent-up grudge and wrath against the regime of conservatives who stoop to any infamy to meet their dirty political greed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Historically the south Korean regimes mobilized the whole gamut of fascist methods to seize and maintain power whenever the situation turned unfavorable for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are a number of examples, typically the March 15 election fraud orchestrated by puppet clique Syngman Rhee, the May 16 military coup engineered by gangster Park Chung-hee and the bloody suppression of Kwangju uprisers by murderer Chun Doo Hwan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The history of the IS whose predecessors were the Central Intelligence Agency and the Security Planning Board is replete with crimes of cracking down by force on people's struggle for independence, democracy and reunification, the crime of propping up the dictatorial \"government\" with all sorts of political intrigues and gimmicks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present regime succeeded in coming to power under the sponsorship of IS. With this coming to light, the regime made public the minutes, a thing unprecedented in the history of the north-south relations, to divert the public attention to the campaign of eliminating \"forces following the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This proves that the present ruling quarters are as the same sordid tricksters as the conservatives of the preceding regimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that a broad spectrum of south Koreans brand the recent fraudulent case as a \"swindle worse than the March 15 election fraud\" and \"coup\", and strongly call for the nullification of the 18th-term \"presidential election\" and resignation of the incumbent rulers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the disclosures of backstage political stories in south Korea have been followed by the people's protest.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The situation is a clear proof of the sordid intelligence-based politics that continue in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What south Korea claims as politics is an unpopular and fascist one providing an unlimited power and wealth to a handful of the privileged in return for violating the sovereign rights and interests of people. Genuine democratic policy for the toiling masses can be guaranteed only when the unpopular political system is overturned."

So, more deplorable is the IS's contention that it has the ownership of the minutes as the recorder belongs to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly explains why the IS reform is so urgent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The IS should no longer be allowed to exercise dangerous power as it goes reckless, unaware of the main principle of gathering and preservation of information."
