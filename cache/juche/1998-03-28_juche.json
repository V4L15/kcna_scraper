Korean authorities urged to make policy switchover\r\n  Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- The last one month after the replacement of the South Korean regime was a blank period in the north-south relations, says Rodong Sinmun today in a commentary titled \"one month fraught with apprehensions and disppointment.\"\r\n   This has made all the fellow countrymen suspect that the Present South Korean ruling forces are following in the footstops of their predecessors who committed anti-national and  anti-reunification crimes and anti-north confrontation, the author of the commentary, says, and continues:\r\n   Most of South Korean people have expressed disappointment and worries about happenings in the last one month.\r\n   The South Korean rulers have acted contrary to their advertisement for \"reconciliation\" and \"cooperation\" in the relations between the north and the south.\r\n   They have turned their face away from the principle of national independence, the nucleus of the three principles of national reunification. They have gone the length of crying that they could not agree to the pullout of the U.S. troops  under the pretext of \"security\"  and that they would follow the policy of dependence on  outside forces.\r\n   It is a matter of grave concern.\r\n   They take no account of the principles of great national unity and peaceful reunification. \r\n   Whenever opportunities presented themselves in the last month they openly declared that they would not repeal the \"National Security Law\" and dissolvethe \"Agency for National Security Planning.\" and they have frantically staged war exercises against the north  and arms buildup. We cannot but think that they have no willingness to remove the political and military confrontation between the north and the south.\r\n   If they administer politics against the will of people while crying that theirs is a \"government for the people\", no one will believe them.\r\n   They should take a right road from the outset.\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters should seriously approach our patriotic initiative to pave the way for the nation independently through the unity of the north and the south and show in action their willingness  to make a policy switchover.    \r\n \r\n"

They are also a despicable drama seeking a sinister political purpose for  obstructing a solution to the historical problems existing between the DPRK  and Japan and hurting the DPRK's dignity.\r\n   In the past Japan invaded korea and many other Asian nations and committed massacres and plunder in the occupied countries. If the Japanese reactionaries are able to feel quilty even a little bit, they should have broken with the crime-woven history and launched a signature campaign for a new start. Doing so is needed for Japan itself.\r\n   We give a serious warning to the Japanese right-wingers.\r\n   If they continue the anti-DPRK, anti-socialist campaign, ignoring our repeated warnings and sincere, magnanimous efforts for improving DPRK-Japan relations in the interests of the two peoples, they will have nothing to get from it. \r\n   And the responsibility for all the possible consequences will rest with Japan.    \r\n \r\n"
