In January of 1696 the Edo Government of Japan recognized the fact that Ullung Island and Tok Islets belonged to Korea and issued an instruction banning Japanese' entry into waters off Ullung Island.  On March 20, 1877 Tomomi Iwakura of the Taiseikan, the then supreme mechanism of the Japanese government, issued an instruction to the Ministry of Home Affairs informing it that the above-said island and islets had nothing to do with Japan. These facts also go to prove that Tok Islets have not been part of the territory of Japan from a historical viewpoint. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, the islets are not the territory to be disputed because of ambiguous ownership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Japanese reactionaries are persistently claiming that they are part of the territory of Japan. This once again clearly proves that they are the impudent guys who stoop to any infamy to realize their ambition for territorial expansion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Clear is the aim sought by them in raising a claim to the islets so persistently and shamelessly. They seek to deliberately build up public opinion supportive of their claim and internationalize the issue in a bid to spark the territorial dispute and create conditions and environment for staging a comeback to Korea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan openly described the islets as its territory not only in its diplomatic blue paper but in history textbooks, maps and other books for the education of young Japanese which have been distributed inside and outside it. Not content with this, It let dozens of Japanese shift their domicile of origin to the islets this year. Those who claim to be Dietmen attempted to visit Ullung Island. All these are part of their moves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan's claim to Tok Islets is aimed to convince its people that the islets are part of its territory in a bid to prepare them to be ready for a future war for territorial expansion, ie aggression of Korea. It is nothing but a crafty artifice to float story about Japan's dominion over the islets in the international community and legalize and justify its moves for grabbing the islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan is making far-fetched assertion that the inviolable territory of other country belongs to its territory. This is a reckless act which can be committed only by the Japanese reactionaries steeped in the wild ambition for overseas expansion to the marrow of their bones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Neither concession nor compromise is allowed over a territorial issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The army and people of the DPRK will never tolerate any moves of Japan to grab the islets. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere can never be Japan's dominion over the islets."

In the past he did not hide his extremist stand and categorically opposed the idea that various cultures can coexist.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t His hooliganism tells the world that it is an urgent task for the European countries to hold in check the spread of the ultra-right idea and, at the same time, achieve social stability irrespective of political view, religious faith and culture.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter the end of World War II, the state control over Nazism considerably weakened the ultra-right forces in Europe and there was an exodus of immigrants to the West Europe which was short of manpower from Mideast and African countries. With the flow of time social integration presented itself as a headache due to the wide gap among various ethnic groups in culture and lifestyle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recent economic depression in Europe injected fresh energy into the ultra-right forces. The European economy is hit hard by global financial crisis and debt crisis, increasing the joblessness and sparking off Xenophobia among some people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ultra-right forces became vocal in the political forces in European countries including Denmark, Netherlands, Finland, France, Germany and Austria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such ultra-right organizations as \"Skin heads\" and \"self-styling nationalists\" have frequently appeared on streets, vandalizing real estates and staging violent demonstrations.

Some ultra-right political parties took parliamentary seats and even some of them held important government posts, influencing states to adjust policies in such a manner as to control cultural leniency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tragedy of bloodshed in Norway warned the whole Europe that such ultra-right trend has gone beyond the limit, letting extremism do harm to the life of the people and the society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community should draw a lesson from the shocking bloodshed committed against the peaceable inhabitants of Norway and heighten vigilance against the revival of ultra-right forces."

The number of trading days will extend from two to four days per week.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also agreed to continue the talks over the issues of expanding export items and establishing a system of confidence building over the nuclear issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As regards the agreement, news media are of the view that the two countries have entered a new stage of peace talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The bilateral relations are historically complicated.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the two countries won independence separately in 1947, they failed to reach an agreement on the Kashmir issue. Two of the three wars fought by the two countries were entirely related to Kashmir. In the hope of settling the Kashmir issue the two sides started all-round peace talks in 2004. But, in the wake of the 2008 Mumbai terror attacks, the peace talks had been suspended.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the latest talks, the Pakistani foreign minister said the bilateral relations have come into a new era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After the meeting, the Indian foreign minister said he was satisfied with the progress achieved in the round of the resumed dialogue and the outcomes have been with their expectations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In a joint statement, both sides did not touch on the Mumbai terrorist incident, but underscored the need to seek a peaceful settlement by narrowing difference in opinion and establishing a common view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of the willingness common to both countries to make a bigger stride in peace talks."

Y el 20 de marzo de 1877, Tomomi Iwakura de Taiseikan, órgano supremo del gobierno japonés, dio al Ministerio del Interior la instrucción de que \"Japón no tiene nada que ver con la Ullung y el Tok\". Tales hechos comprueban que desde el punto de vista histórico el islote Tok no es una parte del territorio japonés. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ciertamente, el islote Tok no es un territorio conflictivo sin dueño evidente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Sin embargo, los reaccionarios japoneses insisten en su posesión del Tok, revelando por sí solos su naturaleza de cínicos que se valen de todos los medios para la expansión territorial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Su verdadera intención es provocar un conflicto internacionalizando ese problema y preparar las condiciones y el ambiente favorables para la nueva agresión a Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Para ese fin, anotan sin escrúpulos el islote Tok como un territorio japonés no sólo en la carta azul diplomática sino también en los manuales de historia, mapas y folletos. Además, este año decenas de japoneses decidieron trasladar al islote Tok el domicilio de origen y los parlamentarios tratan de entrar en la isla Ullung.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La insistencia de Japón en la posesión del islote Tok es una artimaña para inculcar entre los japoneses la compresión de que el islote Tok es el territorio japonés para que ellos puedan incorporarse a la guerra de expansión territorial, o sea, guerra de agresión a Corea, y al mismo tiempo, legalizar y justificar la usurpación del Tok difundiendo en la sociedad internacional el rumor de que el derecho a la posesión de ese islote está en Japón. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   Con respecto al territorio, no hay ninguna concesión ni una conciliación. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El ejército y el pueblo de Corea no perdonarán jamás la usurpación del islote Tok por parte de Japón. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Tanto en el pasado como en el presente y en el futuro es irrealizable el derecho a la posesión del islote Tok por Japón."
