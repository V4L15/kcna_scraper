He is in a sickbed with continued nerve paralysis, seized with relapse, losing his sight. \r\n   Recalling that on December 13, last year, the north side proposed to send back the old man to his hometown and dispatch a medical group and his two daughters to the south side, the letter said that the President of the South Korea Red Cross took such a very irresponsible and inhuman attitude as giving no answer to it.\r\n   Never should it go unnoticed that the South Korean authorities are continuing to watch Kim In So sick in bed, persecuting his mind and body and branding as impure elements those who are going to nurse him. \r\n   The south side should ponder over grave consequences to be entailed in case an untoward incident happens to him, the letter said, urging it to immediately take a necessary and positive step to send back old Kim In So, an unconverted long-term prisoner, without condition, true to the mission and duty of red cross man, though belatedly. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Papers urge Japan to settle the past immediately \r\n   Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- The Japanese authority, describing \"lump sum compensation to former comfort women for the army by a civilian fund\" as a solution to  the crime, said the \"compensation\" will be continued in such a way.  In a commentary Rodong Sinmun says such an act is an expression of the undisguised intention to flee from the state responsibility for the crime and its obligation for compensation. Japan should not delay the settlement of the past to the 21st century, it stresses.  The daily says:\r\n   Recently, Japan's \"civilian fund\" suddenly paid two million yen to each of some former \"comfort women\" in a secret way.\r\n   As the world public circles consider, the crime is not a matter to be solved by such a civilian fund as \"national fund\". It needs the Japanese government's compensation because the crime was committed by the Japanese state.\r\n   But the Japanese authorities have neither admitted nor atoned for the crime. They are still justifying the crime in every way.\r\n   If they see the 20th century out without admitting and apologizing and compensating for the crime,  it will not be good for Japan.\r\n   With such a wrong position, Japan can neither become a permanent member of the UN Security Council, nor can it win confidence from the international community.\r\n    If Japan does not want to suffer a deep disgrace and isolation, it had better settle the past with sincerity as Germany has done.\r\n   In a commentary Minju Joson accuses the Japanese government of trying to evade the state and legal responsibility in such a way as assuaging the anger of the \"comfort women\" with \"lump sum\". \r\n\r\n\r\n"
