Korean Group of Traitors\r\nPyongyang, April 19 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) released information bulletin No. 1031 Friday in connection with the fact that the south Korean puppet forces have become all the more undisguised in their moves of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK despite the repeated warnings of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\tAt a time when all the Koreans were celebrating the Day of the Sun, old riff-raffs of the \"Association of Elderlies\" and other ultra-right conservative gangsters went on the rampage in downtown Seoul, hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK. This proves that the puppet conservative group's provocation farce has reached an intolerable phase, the information bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespite their hideous crime, the puppet conservative villains do not hesitate to make the whole gamut of rubbish to justify their hideous acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey called the ultimatum sent by the Supreme Command of the Korean People's Army \"an act hardly understandable\" and called on the army and people of the DPRK to make \"decorous words and deeds\" in reference to their will to take retaliation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet military hooligans led by Kim Kwan Jin are coming out in a provocative way, threatening to \"punish the north if it makes provocation under any pretext\" following the ultimatum of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll facts prove that the ultra-right hooligans' act of hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK was a deliberate and planned provocation to fan up confrontation with fellow countrymen, incite hostility and strain the situation, and that the puppet authorities are a chief culprit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhile conniving at and defending the thrice-cursed treason, the puppet authorities are speaking loudly of \"dialogue\" in public. This makes the DPRK burn with indignation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can go unpunished without making a word of apology for mangling the hearts of the army and people of the DPRK who regard the dignity of its supreme leadership as their life and soul.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs they had already declared, they will deal retaliatory blows at those who hurt the dignity of their supreme leadership no matter wherever they are.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group should clearly know that the moment of its most miserable end has come."

The ship came up along the Taedong River in Pyongyang, perpetrating spying, murder and robbery, but was sunk by the heroic resistance of Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFar from drawing a lesson in the sunken General Sherman case, the U.S. intruded its warships Shenandoah and China into Korea in 1868 and launched an invasion of it on a large scale in 1871, with involvement of fleets, including flagship Colorado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the end of the Second World War, it occupied the southern half of Korea to divide the country into two and has since attempted to conquer the northern half by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt last, the U.S. unleashed the Korean War in 1950 in a bid to realize its strategy for world supremacy. The aggressive nature of this war on the part of the U.S. imperialists was well evidenced by the following irrefutable facts:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Top secret document No. 4849\" of the Information Research Bureau of the U.S. Department of State on January 28, 1949 said that in the light of Korea's geographical situation in Northeast Asia to control Korea and its people was of value to any other states interested in the Far East and it was beyond any doubt that Korea was very important for the U.S. from the political point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMacArthur, then commander of the U.S. forces in the Far East, was reported to say that Korea was like a bridgehead leading to the continent and that conquering the whole of Korea would help the U.S. forces cut off the only supply line linking Siberia of the Soviet Union with its southern parts and put the whole areas between Vladivostok and Singapore under the U.S. control.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnyhow, the three-year war ended in the defeat of the U.S. But, the U.S. imperialists did not give up their design for aggression. They committed armed provocations one after another to invade the DPRK, including intrusions of armed spy ship Pueblo and spy plane EC-121 and \"Panmunjom\" incident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn the new century, too, they have schemed to unleash a war any time while persistently straining the situation on the Korean Peninsula after designating the DPRK as the first target of their preemptive nuclear attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo this end, military drills have been staged without letup in and around the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Foal Eagle joint military exercises now under way in south Korea show that the U.S. imperialists' scheme to stifle the DPRK by force has entered a more dangerous phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they ignite a war in the Korean Peninsula, the revolutionary forces of the DPRK will smash the provokers without mercy."

If you are media persons who regard impartiality and justice as your life and soul, you should clearly see through the essence of the Korean war which is misinterpreted as a national conflict.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. is busy misleading the public opinion by claiming that the second Korean war would be a dispute between Koreans in a bid to conceal its true colors as harasser of peace and aggressor. By painting the DPRK as a provoker of war, the U.S. seeks to falsify the truth about the war to be started by it according to its carefully worked out scenario for invading the DPRK and justify its undisguised armed intervention in the name of the UN.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. imperialists did so during the Korean War in the 1950s. By abusing the name of UN, the U.S. shifted the blame for the war on to the DPRK. They employed all means and methods to attain their goal of putting the whole of Korea under their military occupation. They mobilized for the war one third of its ground force, one fifth of its air force, most of its Pacific Fleet and troops of its 15 satellite countries under the berets of \"UN forces.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRed herring is a curtain raiser to the U.S. imperialists' full-scale armed invasion. A huge press corps busy in south Korea indicates once again that the curtain has been raised for implementing the scenario for another Korean war worked out by the U.S. imperialists together with the south Korean stooges."
