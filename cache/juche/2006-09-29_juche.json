            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Smashing U.S. Imperialists' Moves for War \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- In order to prevent a war and defend peace on the Korean Peninsula, it is imperative to check and frustrate the U.S. moves for a war of aggression, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an urgent and important task of the nation to prevent an impending war and defend peace of the country today when the Korean nation is exposed to the threat of military aggression by the foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any member of the nation cannot remain an onlooker to the present grave situation in which the U.S. imperialists are getting frantic in their moves to reduce Korea to wasteland and inflict horrible nuclear holocaust upon all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out as one in the nationwide movement for peace against war in defence of the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should further strengthen the patriotic movement for peace against war on the basis of their achievements and experience so as to achieve a decisive success. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should smash the new war provocation moves of the U.S. imperialists with their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whether to oppose the U.S. moves for a war or not is a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery. It is imperative to resolutely oppose and reject the U.S. imperialists' frantic arms buildup and war exercises against the DPRK. A sledge hammer should be dealt to the treacherous acts of joining the foreign forces in their moves for a war against the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to wage a more dynamic struggle to get the U.S. forces withdrawn from south Korea and dismantle the U.S. military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces in south Korea are the root cause of war and the U.S. military bases are a springboard, a forward base for invading the DPRK. The danger of war cannot be removed from the Korean Peninsula and the Koreans cannot live in peace even a moment as long as the U.S. forces and military bases remain in south Korea. The south Korean people should keep the flame of the struggle for withdrawal of the U.S. troops from south Korea flaring up like an active volcano and develop the struggle to check the expansion of the U.S. military base into the struggle to dismantle it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Peace Must Be Won by Struggle: Rodong Sinmun \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 28 (KCNA) -- It is a common demand of humankind and a pressing task of the times to ensure peace and the progressives should turn the 21st century into a century in which the independent demand and desire for peace of the popular masses would have been realized comprehensively, not a century in which the imperialist forces of aggression ride high and mighty, says Rodong Sinmun in a by-lined article Thursday.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is the universal idea of humankind because it embodies the intrinsic demand of humankind and it is a highly important task of humankind to avert aggression and war and defend peace in the present era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people are the driving force in the struggle to defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Peace is not presented by anyone nor is guaranteed spontaneously. Still less do the imperialists present or can they present peace in view of their aggressive nature. Peace can be guaranteed only when the peoples of all the countries which treasure independence and love peace turn out as one in a relentless fight against the aggression and war provocation moves of imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unity is what brings victory to the struggle for peace against war. It is a truth of history and a bloody lesson drawn by the people that dismemberment means defeat and unity means victory in the struggle against imperialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Differences in idea, ideology and systems cannot be a problem in achieving the unity of the world peace-loving forces; All the countries and peoples of the world interested in peace must be involved in the struggle to defend peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The anti-war struggle is the key to world peace at the present juncture and its main target is the United States. The U.S. imperialists are the chieftain of aggression and war and the very wrecker of peace in the 21st century. A war can be prevented and world peace and security be guaranteed only when all the countries and peoples worldwide desirous of independence and peace fight determinedly against the aggression and war moves of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The peoples of all countries worldwide should lift up louder voices against war and the U.S. and bind it hand and foot so that it could not cause a war as it likes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A peaceful climate can be created and the human cause of peace be accomplished earlier when blows are dealt to the aggression and war moves of the U.S. imperialists everywhere in the world and they are dismembered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will together with the world progressives resolutely fight against the aggression and war moves of the imperialist forces, holding aloft the banner of peace, and thus make a sizable contribution to the human cause of peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The authorities invoked the fascist \"National Security Law\" against them for the mere reason that they produced and distributed CDs describing the Juche idea and posted an article supporting the Songun politics on its Internet homepage.\r\n Terming this action a brutal crackdown intended to dampen the daily growing desire for independent reunification and poison the atmosphere of supporting the Songun politics now being rapidly disseminated in south Korea, the statement continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean judicial authorities cracked down on absurd charges those who introduced the Juche idea and the Songun politics which are recognized by the world and supported by all the Koreans while antagonizing the fellow countrymen by invoking the \"NSL\", a leftover of the old era of confrontation. This cannot but be a treacherous act of swimming against the trend of the times and history and the desire of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolish for the authorities to try to dampen the people's desire and stem the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Justice and truth and the desire of the times can never be checked at the point of bayonet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean judicial authorities had better stop such fascist suppression as violating the elementary democratic rights and freedom of people and inciting north-south confrontation, repeal the NSL, fascist law against reunification, and immediately set free those arrested.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
