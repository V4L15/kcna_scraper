            "content": "International Solidarity Meeting in Spain Supports DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 5 (KCNA) -- An international solidarity meeting for supporting young people's struggle against imperialism took place in Madrid, Spain on June 28.\n\t\t\t\t\t The speakers at the meeting referred to the fact that the imperialists have become all the more undisguised in their moves of aggression, war, domination and interference, sanctions and blockade against sovereign countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They called for marking the 18th World Festival of Youth and Students as an important occasion of demonstrating the united strength of youth desirous of independence against imperialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The meeting adopted an appeal \"Let's extend support and solidarity to the Korean youth and other people in their just struggle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The appeal noted that the acute nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula is attributable to the hostile policy towards the DPRK with which the U.S. has been present in south Korea for almost 70 years while working hard to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It called for launching an international media campaign to vehemently condemn the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces for their hostile policies and nuclear war moves endangering peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world and having the U.S. troops withdrawn from south Korea immediately.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It urged to raise voices of solidarity with the Koreans' efforts to establish durable peace mechanism on the peninsula with the approach of the 60th anniversary of their victory in the great Fatherland Liberation War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It appealed to extend full support and encouragement to the Korean people's struggle to check and foil the U.S. and south Korean authorities' vicious war moves and confrontation racket against national reunification and open the gate to national reunification in unity under the banner of June 15 joint declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace and security in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of the world would be creditably guaranteed only when the progressive youth and student organizations pool efforts with the Korean youth and other people in their just struggle, the appeal stressed."
