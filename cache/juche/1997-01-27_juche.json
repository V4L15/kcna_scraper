            "content": "Revolutionary spirit of self-reliance \r\n   Pyongyang, January 27 (KCNA) -- The Workers' Party of Korea and the government of the DPRK called upon the Korean people to make a new revolutionary advance in socialist construction in high-pitched revolutionary spirit of self-reliance this year, too.\r\n   Self-reliance is a revolutionary banner which always leads the Korean people to victory.\r\n   Self-reliance is a fighting spirit and revolutionary way peculiar to the Korean people. With this  revolutionary spirit they surmount all difficulties by their own efforts. \r\nAnd carry out their revolutionary tasks without fail through creation and quest.\r\n   The Korean people have consistently maintained this spirit of self-reliance in the whole course of the protracted and arduous revolutionary struggle.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung successfully pioneered the Korean revolution, holding high the banner of Juche from the first days of his activities.\r\n   He always said that self-reliance is the only way for communists to win and led the Korean people to work in the spirit of self-reliance.\r\n   Thanks to the spirit of self-reliance and hard struggle instilled by the President, the Korean people have been able to make victory after victory at all times, pulling through obstacles and difficulties cropping up in the way of their advance. \r\n   The war (June 1950-July 1953) started by the U.S. imperialists destroyed everything and reduced korea to ashes.\r\n   Then, the enemy prattled that korea would not rise again even in 100 years.\r\n   The Korean people, though empty-handed, rehabilitated the economy and effected the great Chollima upsurge under the motto of self-reliance. They successfully carried out socialist industrialisation in a matter of 14 years and built a powerful socialist state of Juche which is independent, self-supporting and self-reliant in national defence.\r\n   In recent years, the imperialists and the reactionaries have become undisguised in their moves to stifle the DPRK and great obstacles and difficulties have been created in economic construction with the collapse of the world socialist market. Even under this situation, the Korean people are stepping up socialist construction without any wavering.\r\n   This year they will demonstrate the might of the Korean-style socialism by braving all obstacles and difficulties in the spirit of self-reliance and \"arduous march\" and making a new advance on all fronts of socialist construction. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

During the four decades of their illegal Korean occupation, the Japanese imperialists drafted some six million Koreans for the war of aggression and labor and killed one million of them brutally.\r\n   They also destroyed or took to Japan Korea's wealth and, worse still, tried to erase the Korean nation.\r\n   The Japanese authorities have claimed that the \"comfort women for the army\" crime was committed by individuals, not by the government. This is a mean trick to cover up Japan's past crimes and flee from the responsibility for them.\r\n   The Japanese government must admit, apologize and compensate for all the crimes against the Korean people. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
