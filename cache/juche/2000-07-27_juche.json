            "content": "U.S. urged to renounce \"missile defence\" program \r\n\r\n  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 27 (KCNA) -- The United States is floating a new fiction of \"missile threat\" and \"suspected technology transfer\" by the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whenever an opportunity presents itself American officials take issue with the DPRK's development of missile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThey are persistently spreading the story that the DPRK transfers missile technology to other countries so that they may be capable of striking the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such fuss over \"missile threat\" from the DPRK does not come from the fear that its missile may strike the U.S. mainland. It is intended to push ahead with the development of the U.S. \"National Missile Defence\" system (NMD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. adventurous \"missile shield\" program now under way is of very dangerous nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This program, if it is put into practice, will further expand the sphere of U.S. military influence on the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe \"missile shield\" will provide decisively favourable conditions for the U.S., the world's biggest possessor of nuclear weapons, to make a preemptive nuclear attack and neutralize other countries' nuclear offensive capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. \"NMD\" program is a criminal plan because it may trigger off a new arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Its unilateral building of \"missile shield\" will prompt other big powers either to drastically increase strategic nuclear attack capabilities or to develop new-type weapons to destroy the \"shield.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What the U.S. seeks in establishing the \"NMD\" system is to put European countries going their own way under its tight control. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Those countries are planning to build independent defence forces in Europe. But this plan will misfire and they will inevitably come under the control of the U.S. if Russia and China are embroiled in the arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   That is why the EU countries as well as Russia and China are strongly opposed to that adventurous and dominationist program of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   So, the U.S. invented \"missile threat\" from the DPRK to calm down other big powers and justify its dominationist moves. \r\n\r\n"

If countries and nations are to be independent, there should be global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is a common aspiration of the world people and their vital demand today to realize global independence and this trend of independence sweeps all continents and all regions of our planet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Imperialism is the filth of history as it has lived out its days. The imperialists are plagued with insolvable inner contradictions and finding themselves in a bottomless abyss of ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The increased frenzy on the part of the imperialists to maintain their old order of domination and subjugation and their intensified moves for aggression and war will only invite stronger resistance from the world people demanding independence and peace and more serious political and economic crisis. \r\n\r\n"
