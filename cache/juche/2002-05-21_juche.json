But, he worked at an important post of the state for many years after the liberation of Korea thanks to particular trust and care of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was posthumously awarded the title of Hero of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the funeral service, the president personally pinned on his chest the medal of the DPRK Hero, though it was usual practice to convey such a medal to the bereaved family. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he frequently wiped away tears in his eyes with a handkerchief, looking at his beloved man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was one blizzardly day in February Juche 63 (1974) when the president came across a girl on a rural road in South Phyongan Province while traveling in a car for field guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He told his chauffeur to stop the car. He took her frozen hands in his to warm them, asking where she was going in such cold weather. She said she was going to a town hospital to see her younger brother who had been admitted to it. Taking her in his arms tightly and looking at the blizzardly road, he told the chauffeur to carry her to the hospital and personally opened the door of the car to let her in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And he remained standing on that blizzard-swept road for a long while.    \r\n\r\n"

To frustrate the imperialists' blockades and develop science and technology is a serious matter related to the destiny of socialism and the future of the nation.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      \r\nOnly when we develop science and technology quickly with extraordinary determination can we foil the imperialists' blockades and build a powerful country in this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bright is the future of scientific development in the DPRK as long as there are the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il, inexhaustible scientific and technological potentials and a large contingent of intellectuals.     \r\n\r\n"

In other words, it is intended to escalate its political and military interference in the DPRK under the same pretext. by doing so it seeks to strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula and start a new war of aggression against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This betrays the true nature of the U.S. policy of undisguised interference in the internal affairs of the DPRK.  \r\n"
