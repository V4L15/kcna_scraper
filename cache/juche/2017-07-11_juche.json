A su vez, el vicepremier picoteo que \"su pais tomara parte en las acciones militares contra el Norte de Corea si este lance la ojiva nuclear contra EE.UU.\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las locuras provocativas de los estadistas australianos con los sentidos lentos sobre la realidad no son mas que una queja de los politiqueros conservadores proyanquis que repiten las palabras de Estados Unidos sin consideracion alguna sobre la voluntad del pueblo australiano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo insoslayable del caso es que los politiqueros conservadores proyanquis se obstinan en describir sin razones el presente lanzamiento del pais socialista como una \"amenaza a los paises perifericos\" y hacen esfuerzos desesperados por formar la \"fobia\" sobre la RPDC entre los paises asiaticos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo habia declarado, la RPDC, siendo el responsable pais poseedor de armas nucleares, no ha amenazado ni una vez con el pertrecho nuclear y nunca amenazara a otros que no le amenazan con el mismo pertrecho.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA diferencia de las insistencias de los politiqueros conservadores, la capa militar de alto rango de ese pais opina que \"es claro que su region septentrional esta en el alcance de disparo del Norte de Corea\" y \"es necesario comprenderlo bien inclusive las consecuencias desde el punto de vista militar\". Estos criterios exigen el juicio mas realista, sano y objetivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcentuamos una vez mas que quienes se encuentran tan perplejos ante las medidas de la RPDC por el fortalecimiento de fuerzas armadas nucleares, son el pais norteamericano y las fuerzas seguidoras que imponian al pais socialista durante decenios la unilateral amenaza nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl armamento nuclear de la RPDC es la espada de justicia para defender la soberania y los derechos a desarrollo y existencia del pais y la nacion desde la amenaza nuclear de EE.UU. y para preservar la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara los politiqueros australianos es mejor meditar bien las consecuencias de sus palabras ignorantes e irresponsables."
