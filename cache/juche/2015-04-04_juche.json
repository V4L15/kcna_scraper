Seeing with keen interest the precious historic data, he recalled the undying feats of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for the development of the unit which was personally organized by Kim Il Sung in May 1955.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He toured a monument to the field guidance of Kim Il Sung and high-speed transport boat No. 6251, which was examined by Kim Il Sung and whose test sailing was guided by Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then he dropped in at the building of the unit command and gave important instructions for commanding and managing the unit. He set forth the tasks and ways for further building up the unit in keeping with the features of its combat duty and more thoroughly establishing the anti-Japanese guerrilla method of commanding and management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He went round the library and servicepersons' hall of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needed to supply the must books to the library on a regular basis and organize writing impressions and discussion of books and oratorical meeting often for the seamen to regard the reading as part of their military service so that they can develop into many-sided persons with versatile knowledge, he said, adding: This is a shortcut to making the whole army politico-ideologically and morally stronger.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the need to run the servicepersons' hall in an effective way, he instructed the unit to concentrate efforts on the five-point education, set forth by the Party, and steadily conduct the class education, in particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Supreme Commander looked round the room for general warship training.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He learnt in detail about the combat and political training, watching torpedo attack and other drills. And he clarified the main link in the whole chain that the unit should concentrate efforts on for its combat preparedness and the important matters arising in properly employing the Juche-based naval war tactics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that Generalissimo Kim Il Sung projected the all-round seaman movement decades ago, he said that various kinds of specialized training should be intensified among the seamen to prepare them as all-round seamen and death-defying corps on the sea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underlined the need for commanding officers to focus on having a deeper grasp of the abilities to organize and command naval battles and the art of operating warships under the actual war conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He also went round barracks, education room and mess of the 1st company of the 5th flotilla under the unit to take warm care of seamen's living conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Learning about the tree-planting campaign conducted by the unit this year, he gave instructions to better a nursery and intensify the campaign so as to turn the surroundings of the unit and its stationary area into a thick woodland and greenery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was satisfied to go round the unit, he said, expressing belief that the unit would bring about a new turn in its combat preparation and commanding and management.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him was KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA."
