This eye-opening reality is bringing joy, happiness and vibrant life to its people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people more strongly oppose aggression and war and more ardently love peace than any others as they have been exposed to the ceaseless war drills and constant nuclear threat and blackmail of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The WPK has made responsible and sincere efforts, prompted by its will to defuse the tension on the Korean Peninsula and contribute to ensuring peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It sets store by the support and solidarity of the communist parties and workers' parties in various countries in its just struggle for security in the Korean Peninsula, the world's biggest hotspot, and lasting peace in the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It will as ever join efforts with the communist parties and workers' parties in the world and wage a positive struggle to defend peace and security on the peninsula and in the rest of the world and win the victory of the human cause of independence and the cause of socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Availing myself of this opportunity, I express once again profound thanks to the communist parties and workers' parties including the Communist Party of Portugal and people in various countries for extending invariable support to the WPK and the Korean people in their efforts to build a thriving socialist nation and achieve the independent reunification of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed firm belief that the meeting would mark an important occasion in powerfully demonstrating the unity and solidarity among the communist parties and workers' parties in various countries for the victory of the cause of socialism."

Korean Authorities Accused of Human Rights Abuses\r\n Pyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet authorities are desperately resorting to the operations to lure and abduct inhabitants of the DPRK and conspiratorial plots against it by use of defectors from the north, human scum, despite its repeated warnings.\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently even the chief executive and the prime minister of south Korea staged such burlesque as praising defectors from the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is a blatant challenge to the dignity and social system of the DPRK and unpardonable political provocation and hideous crime unprecedented in history, Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All cases of abduction of DPRK inhabitants were premeditated criminal operations directly spearheaded by the south Korean authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Protection of defectors from the north\" and \"universally accepted human rights\" touted by the south Korean authorities to cover up their crimes are nothing but sophism no longer workable. The testimonies made by those who returned home after being lured and taken to south Korea lay bare shuddering human rights abuses of the puppet authorities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korean people's resentment at the conservative group's illegal interference in the \"presidential election\" and its moves to revive \"yusin\" dictatorship is now running high. Much upset by this, the puppet regime is becoming evermore desperate in its operations to abduct inhabitants of the DPRK and hatch plots against it in a bid to stoke atmosphere of confrontation with fellow countrymen and tide over its crisis by diverting elsewhere the public criticism of it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural to punish the criminals and terrorists keen to hurt the social system and lives and security of people in the DPRK. It is in full line with international law and norms on protecting human rights and combating terrorism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nam Jae Jun, director of the puppet Intelligence Service, and other diehard confrontation maniacs are the primary target of punishment as they are taking the lead in these operations and conspiratorial plots."

The DPRK will not unilaterally move first to resume the six-party talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is taking issue with the DPRK, contending that Pyongyang has not abandoned its nuclear program as it promised to do in the September 19 joint statement, but it is the U.S. which reneged on its promise and defaulted on its duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After its emergence, the Obama administration adopted it as its policy to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. It has openly threatened and blackmailed the DPRK while introducing strategic forces such as nuclear strategic bombers and nuclear carriers into the Korean Peninsula in a rotating way and ceaselessly staging nuclear war exercises to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. still remain as empty commitments due to the U.S. reckless hostile acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The escalating U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail and moves for a war against the DPRK are a grave encroachment upon its vital rights and sovereignty in wanton violation of the DPRK-U.S. agreements and the September 19 joint statement in which the U.S. promised neither to use any armed forces including nuclear weapons against the DPRK nor to threaten it with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will not take a denuclearization step first to resume the talks unless the U.S. shows in action its willingness to roll back its hostile policy toward the DPRK."
