Assailed for Slandering Crucial Proposal of NDC of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, February 2 (KCNA) -- Papers Sunday in their commentaries disclose the ulterior design sought by the U.S. dignitaries in hurting the crucial proposal made by the National Defence Commission (NDC) of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t Burns, deputy secretary of Department of State, who visited south Korea after the publication of the proposal, talked aloud about the \"possibility of reckless actions to be taken by north Korea in the future and the danger of additional provocation to be made by it\".   In the wake of Burns' visit, the assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs went to south Korea where he talked similar rubbish. The commander-in-chief of the U.S. Armed Forces in the Pacific recklessly asserted Washington is concerned about the nuclear capacity of north Korea, saying nuclear threat coming from north Korea is a source of trouble not only to the U.S. mainland but also in the Korean peninsula and that it may plunge the whole world into confusion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun terms it Washington's ploy to divert elsewhere the public opinion focused on the proposal made by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Washington has been busy carrying out its pivot-to-Asia-Pacific strategy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After deploying its huge forces in the Asia-Pacific region and various other parts in the world, it has openly revealed its scheme to mount military attacks upon the countries with which it is displeased, being engrossed in posing threats and perpetrating provocations against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a calculation of Washington to seize the Korean peninsula, contain the countries around it by using it as a vantage point and thus dominate the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is, therefore, making so much fuss over the non-existent \"threat from the DPRK\" in a bid to blunt the world-wide vigilance focused on its move and to carry out its Asia-Pacific strategy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If it is truly interested in peace and security in the Korean peninsula, it should do what it should do before finding fault with the crucial proposal made by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson urged the U.S. to neither meddle in other's affairs nor hinder the efforts for the improvement of inter-Korean relations."
