Korea show?\r\n Pyongyang, June 4 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today comments on what took place in South Korea over the past 100 days since the change of regime.\r\n   In this period, the new regime, which styles itself a \"government of people,\"  has carried forward the traitorous politics of the successive flunkeyist, fascist and anti-reunification dictatorial regimes, the daily says, and continues:\r\n   The South Korean puppet rulers' politics finds no sign of independence. They shape all policies, depending on outsiders. They are trying to revive the economy, which has been ruined due to foreign capital, by introducing more foreign capital, and calling for \"powerful joint defense preparedness\" with the united states.\r\n   Worse still, they say they will have dialogue with the north, which pertains to internal affairs of the nation, through \"close consultation with foreign countries\" including the United States and Japan.\r\n   \"Democratic politics\" advertised by the present regime has revealed its true colors as fascist, repressive politics. It, instead of eliminating the fascist laws and repressive tools which have been foundations of the successive fascist dictatorship, is seeking to strengthen their function.\r\n   Due to such steps of the new regime, national reunification is far off. The South Korean authorities have answered our just proposals and sincere efforts with the escalating anti-reunification, anti-north confrontation and war moves.\r\n   What they have done in the period shows that their advertisement about the \"government of people\" is hypocrisy, they are carrying forward the anti-nation, anti-democracy and anti-reunification policies of their predecessors and are getting more frantic in pursuing such policies.\r\n   They must draw a lesson from the crime-woven 100 days and seek national independence, reconciliation and reunification to meet the demand of the South Korean people and to satisfy the desire of the fellow countrymen.\r\n   All the fellow countrymen will keep a watchful eye on their attitude.    \r\n \r\n\r\n"

This is why it is going to rewrite the \"treaty.\"\r\n   Another purpose sought by the United States through the revision of the \"treaty\" is to technically form the \"triangular military alliance\" aiming at the DPRK and build a combined forces system.\r\n   The United States also intends to organize a NATO-type military bloc, form an encirclement ring around independent countries of Asia and those countries which challenge it and contain them with military pressure and pincer attacks.\r\n   We will never tolerate such dangerous moves to stifle our republic with military force.\r\n   If the United States continues getting on our nerve with military threat and hostile policies, breaking its promise, we will be left with no other choice but to make a proper option.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was favourably received by visitors.\r\n   Though the Songhwa Art Studio is only three years old, it has experienced artists, whose career, on average, is 45 years and their age ranges from 64 to 84. \r\nBefore the studio was inaugurated, some artists were teaching at the Pyongyang University of Fine Arts and still others were working at the Mansudae Art Studio, a leading art creation centre, and other art institutions.\r\n   Some already retired from their official posts, but never stopped following their vocational job.\r\n    Before Korea's liberation from Japanese rule, most of artists were not provided with opportunities to fully develop their talents. Liberation came and their abilities began to spread their artistic wings under the warm care shown by General Kim Il Sung.\r\n   Then came the Korean War (June 25, 1950). Many artists in South Korea joined the Korean People's Army to be taken into the heart of the DPRK. Since then, they were able to give full play to their abilities. In the course of this, many great art works were created. In recognition of their distinguished services to the country, some were awarded the title of people's and merited artist.\r\n   Time has passed, and their hair has turned gray. Grateful for the favours the state has shown to them they were always eager to repay them to the last moment of their lives. The government was quick to grasp their minds. That was how the Songhwa Art Studio came into being in Juche 84 (1995).\r\n   The old painters are provided with full conditions for art creation. Though now well up in years, they are still full of vigor like the pine tree which stands, withstanding the most violent storms.\r\n   The masterpieces created by people's artists Rim Hong Un, Ryu Hwan Gi, Pak Jin Su, Ri Kun Hwa, Yu Hung Sop, Ri Won In have been well-reputed at home and abroad.\r\n   Some 1,400 pieces were created, of which 1,000 pieces met a ready sell abroad.\r\n   Their youthful vigor is revealed in powerful, graceful and soft touches.\r\n   Their simple wish is epitomized in the words \"more and better works for our socialist country.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
