He expressed great satisfaction with the rapid progress made in the construction of the power station. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the heroic drive of the soldier-builders a huge dam of Huichon Power Station No. 1 will tower and there will appear a large man-made reservoir before long, he noted, calling upon them to wage a bold charge to bring earlier the day of victory.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The next leg of his guidance was the construction site of the dam of Huichon Power Station No. 2.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed on the construction before a big map showing the panoramic view of the power station, he looked round the construction site of the dam to acquaint himself with the progress made in the project.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching the dam rise against the time, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the soldier-builders have registered signal successes in the dam project by actively introducing efficient work methods and waging a three dimensional drive. He highly appreciated their feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We can successfully undertake any epoch-making huge nature-harnessing project as we determined to do as we have the heroic soldiers intensely loyal to the Party and the revolution, he said, adding: This is wealth and prosperity which our Party and people alone can enjoy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that every minute and second in the construction sites of the Huichon Power Station witness a leaping advance and innovation and world-startling miracles are being wrought without let-up in the crucible of this high-pitched drive, he said with pride that this great speed precisely means a new Chollima speed, \"Huichon speed\" based on the revolutionary soldier spirit, the basis of the Songun politics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After making the rounds of the construction sites, he put forth on the spot highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for completing the construction of the Huichon Power Station ahead of schedule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that it is the top priority task for building a thriving nation to satisfactorily settle the shortage of electricity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that in order to complete the construction of the power station before 2012 it is necessary to launch a great offensive with the whole Party and army and all the people involved. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed conviction that the builders of the power station would unconditionally complete the Huichon Power Station till 2012 by displaying popular heroism and matchless devotion and thus live up to the Party's trust and expectation with shining feats.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Kim Yong Chun, minister of the People's Armed Forces, KPA Generals Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su and other commanding officers of the army, Pak To Chun, chief secretary of the Jagang Provincial Committee of the WPK, and Pak Nam Gi and Jang Song Thaek, department directors of the C.C., the WPK."
