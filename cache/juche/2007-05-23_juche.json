And in his \"We Should Reunify the Country by the Concerted Efforts of Our Nation\" and \"Talks with the UN Secretary General and His Party\" and other works he enunciated the idea of preventing the permanent division of the nation and achieving the country's reunification by the concerted efforts of the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book also indicates tasks and ways of carrying out the revolution and construction including the issue of successfully building the revolutionary battle sites and revolutionary sites as centres for the education in the revolutionary traditions, the issues of turning the city of Pyongyang into a more beautiful and modern city and providing its citizens with good living conditions and the issues of developing the democratic national education of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan and intensifying the movement of Koreans in Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

These facts go to prove that the U.S. is still persisting in the military confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of military confrontation with the DPRK is an intentional and premeditated move to stonewall the denuclearization and peace of the Korean Peninsula and aggravate military tension in order to drive the situation to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the U.S. to realize its Asia strategy with the Korean Peninsula as a springboard. The U.S. seeks to secure a military guarantee for its world supremacy at any cost by accelerating the modernization and build-up of its aggression armed forces in the Korean Peninsula and its vicinity and gaining the upper hand in strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be entirely held accountable for serious consequences to be entailed by its reckless military confrontation policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun in an article today brands this as a manifestation of the militarist aggressive idea of the Japanese reactionaries which has been carried into extremes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the doctrine of preemptive attack of the Japanese reactionaries is a military provocation backed by preparations for overseas aggression, the author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has been rounding off military preparations for overseas aggression by hastening arms buildup after the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The maritime \"Self-Defense Force\" of Japan has grown into a modern naval force equipped with various up-to-date battle ships including submarines and destroyers and its offensive capability is well on a par with that of other capitalist powers. As estimated by Western media, the maritime \"Self-Defense Force\" of Japan is partially way ahead of the U.S. naval force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The air and ground \"Self-Defense Forces\" of Japan are also prepared for all wars. The air \"Self-Defense Force\" is equipped with ultra modern fighter planes while the ground \"Self-Defense Force\" has a perfect system of ground offensive as it is fully equipped with tanks, armored cars, artillery pieces, missiles and other weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are in possession of all conditions for overseas aggression, institutional and legal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are going ahead in real earnest with the revision of the constitution allowing the exercise of the \"right of collective self-defense.\" This is a very dangerous act to set up a military system of a war-seeking state, totally throwing away the veil of \"a pacifist state\" which they have been showing off after the war, and launch into a preemptive strike at other countries any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists are now making quite a fuss, shouting themselves hoarse about \"anti-terrorism\" and \"coping with contingency.\" They seek in this to mount a preemptive attack on other countries with these as a pretext. And their first target here is the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The preemptive attack doctrine about which the Japanese reactionaries are so much blatant is, in essence, intended for a surprise military attack on the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Minju Joson denuncia despliegue de pertrechos belicos en Sur de Corea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 22 de mayo (ATCC) -- Recientemente Estados Unidos publico un plan de despliegue en el Sur de Corea del sistema de misil mar-aire de gran eficacia \"SM-2\" y tres destructores \"Aegis\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Tal movimiento, que promueve EE.UU. a rotulo de \"ejercicios militares\", parte de la intencion de desplegar enormes fuerzas armadas agresoras en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno para dar golpe preventivo a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Asi senala el periodico Minju Joson en un comentario individual de este martes y continua: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ultimamente las fuerzas belicosas norteamericanas y las surcoreanas libraron freneticamente el \"ejercicio combinado de refuerzo para el tiempo de guerra\" y el simulacro conjunto \"Aguilucho\" contra la RPDC y efectuaron una prueba de lanzamiento de misil crucero \"Tomahawk Black-3\" en el crucero atomico situado sobre el Oceano Atlantico. Esto es una clara prueba de que EE.UU. persigue invariablemente la confrontacion militar con la RPDC. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El imperio persigue tal politica de confrontacion militar con la RPDC para obstaculizar la desnuclearizacion y la preservacion de paz en la Peninsula Coreana y exacerbar la tension militar para llevar la situacion al borde de la guerra. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. abriga la invariable ambicion de realizar la estrategia asiatica tomando por trampolin la Peninsula Coreana y trata de ocupar la superioridad de la fuerza al dar espuelas a la modernizacion y aumento de las fuerzas armadas agresoras en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno y de preparar de esta manera la garantia militar para la realizacion de su ambicion de dominio al mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  EE.UU. debe asumir la entera responsabilidad de las graves consecuencias que emanen de su temeraria politica de confrontacion militar.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
