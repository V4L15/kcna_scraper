This is an anti-national act, it said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, with bush's junket to South Korea at hand, he clamoured about \"reciprocity\" and \"verification\" of the DPRK. It is typical sycophancy and treachery intended to hurt the fellow countrymen with the help of outsiders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He fully reveals his ambition to become \"president\" by courting the U.S. hardliners' support. This is an expression of the willingness to fawn on the U.S. and unhesitatingly work as its servant to seize power, clean indifferent to the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more intolerable is that even during his foreign tour he expressed his persistent opposition to the June 15 joint declaration, the statement said, adding: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang should stop letting loose such remarks against national interests at once and make an honest apology to the nation.    \r\n\r\n"

Its silk fabrics, soft to the touch and vivid in colour, are produced under the brand \"CCR\", well-known in neighbouring countries and on the international market. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Experts attribute the high quality of this brand to the age-old fame of the local cocoons and pure water. In this province of rolling mountains and steep ravines, the water is ideal for silkworm breeding and cocoon production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The province was selected as a base for sericulture after a government decision to localize and specialize agricultural output, and the province has since made tangible progress in the cultivation of mulberry trees and cocoon production. In particular, the proportion of good-quality cocoons has shown a considerable increase.\r\n The mill's major outputs of raw silk and by-products are widely available for consumption. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It employs up-to-date production processes from cocoon sorting to silk reeling, and runs an effective transportation system to bring the cocoons from suppliers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Huichon silk mill is now concentrating on greater efficiency and technical upgrading, as required by the torch of Ranam.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
