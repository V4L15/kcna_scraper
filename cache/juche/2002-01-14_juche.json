It is ready to fight a life-and-death battle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing itself of this opportunity, the DPRK warns the South Korean authorities that if they follow the U.S. missile strategy against the northern half of Korea, it will give rise to a very complicated and grave situation and endanger the future of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a big mistake for the U.S. to set up missile attack networks on the plea of the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK and attain its sinister strategic aim. It will only put the U.S. in a serious danger.    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, over 73 per cent of them have been improved as such taking the country as a whole. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The July 6 Railway Factory has technical foundations and processes for massproducing cast-railway wheels while the Kim Jong Thae Electric Locomotive Plant is accelerating preparations for the mass production of high capacity locomotives and passenger coaches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recently produced passenger coaches attract the attention of travellers as they are equipped with all amenities for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There remain not a few problems to be solved in the field of the railway transport. but the whole country is helping this domain.    \r\n\r\n"

But we can neither overlook nor tolerate the disturbing rumor that the China-U.S. joint statement will include the Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said rumor can be spread only by those who do not know well about the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It regards sovereignty as the life and soul and takes independence as its first principle in foreign relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some media of the U.S. and the west are floating this kind of rumor in a bid to create impression that foreign forces are \"responsible\" for the Korean issue. But this will bring them to nowhere. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the foundation of the DPRK, its army and people have never left its issue to any foreign forces nor has it allowed anyone to encroach upon its national dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will consider foreign forces' discussion of the Korean issue behind us to be included in their joint statement as an encroachment upon our sovereignty and will never tolerate it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some media of the U.S. and the west are well advised to face up to such reality and remain true to the ethics of the media whose life and soul are objectivity, impartiality, accuracy and truth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
