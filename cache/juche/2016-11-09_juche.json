Much upset by this, they are set to take revenge upon it by escalating state-sponsored terrorism against Chongryon even by discarding the veil of \"law-governing\" and \"human rights.\" This is nothing but a mean behavior of the narrow-minded Japanese politicians.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the Japanese reactionaries should bear in mind that it is a serious mistake and daydream to bring down Chongryon which is under the protection of Juche Korea reliably defending its dignity and sovereignty and fully demonstrating its might under the unfurled great banner of Songun."
