            "content": "National Meeting Celebrates February 16  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at the April 25 House of Culture on Friday to celebrate February 16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were senior officials of the party, the army and the state, chairpersons of the friendly parties, officials of the party, armed forces and power organs, public organizations, ministries and national institutions, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army, officials in the fields of science, education, culture and arts, public health and media, labor innovators, working people in Pyongyang, congratulatory groups and delegations of overseas compatriots and other compatriot figures and the chief of the Pyongyang Mission of the Anti-Imperialist National Democratic Front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A report was made by Kim Yong Nam, member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and president of the Presidium of the DPRK Supreme People's Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter noted that the birth of Kim Jong Il as son of the legendary guerrillas in the historic period when the dawn of the liberation of the country was at hand amidst fierce battles for the final victory of the anti-Japanese war was the greatest fortune for the Korean nation as it promised a rosy future of Juche Korea and a world historic event which opened a bright prospect for the human cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Every great social change and progress brought about by the army and people of the DPRK while steadily advancing the socialist cause of Juche generation after generation are closely associated with the distinguished ideological and theoretical wisdom and outstanding political caliber, iron-will and matchless grit and noble personality of Kim Jong Il, the reporter said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il is the outstanding thinker and theoretician who has carried forward the immortal Juche idea in all fields and developed it in depth with fresh ideological and theoretical wealth, indicating the right way for the popular masses in the present era to accomplish the cause of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is outstanding among the ideas and theories expounded by Kim Jong Il is that he has carried forward the idea of attaching importance to arms and military affairs, which President Kim Il Sung enunciated in the incipient period of the Korean revolution and invariably adhered to, and developed it in depth in all fields as required by the developing situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il formulated the philosophy on army that a revolution starts and advances by dint of arms and the principle of Songun that the army means the party, state and people, set forth the idea of putting the army ahead of the working class for the first time in the history of the revolutionary movement and defined the Songun politics as a main political mode under socialism, thus providing an all-powerful treasured sword in the struggle for independence against imperialism and for socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBy establishing the Korean-style state leadership system with the National Defence Commission as its backbone under the veteran and tested leadership of Kim Jong Il the government of the Republic has grown stronger to be a powerful political weapon for fully embodying the Songun idea and line of the party in all fields of the revolution and construction and accomplishing the Juche revolutionary cause with the might of Songun. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All party members, servicepersons and people should enshrine the truth that the prosperity of the socialist motherland and the genuine life and happiness of the Korean people are ascribable to Kim Jong Il as unshakable faith and protect him politically and ideologically at the cost of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will implement the October 4 declaration, holding aloft the banner of \"By our nation itself\" along the path indicated by the June 15 joint declaration based on Kim Jong Il's noble idea of achieving national reunification and surely achieve the historic cause of national reunification through a nationwide struggle for independent reunification and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are closely following the double-dealing attitude of the U.S. as it is employing double-edged tactics of appeasement and pressure, persistently trying to stifle the DPRK by force. We will not tolerate even a slight hostile action on the part of the U.S. but decisively react to it with a stronger measure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only victory and glory are in store for the army and people of the DPRK as long as they have Kim Jong Il in the van of the revolution and there are the revolutionary party of Juche, the invincible revolutionary armed forces and the single-minded unity of the revolutionary ranks, he concluded. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, similar meetings took place in every province, city and county across the country on the same day.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Urges Withdrawal of U.S. Forces from S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- To ensure peace on the Korean Peninsula including its denuclearization is not the issue to be settled by the efforts of one side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From this point of view, the U.S. forces' presence in south Korea poses an actual danger to ensuring the peace on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n From the outset of the year, the upper echelon of the U.S. has become more vocal in \"supporting\" the U.S. forces' permanent presence in south Korea. This is a development which cannot be overlooked from the viewpoint of ensuring peace on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some days ago, the commander of the U.S. forces in the Pacific said that \"what is important is not the numerical strength of the U.S. forces in south Korea but their military deterrence,\" blustering that the U.S. forces would continue to remain in south Korea even after the transfer of the \"right to command wartime operations\" to the south Korean forces in April 2012. And the commander of the U.S. forces in south Korea uttered that \"the U.S. forces positively support their permanent presence in south Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such remarks cannot be construed otherwise than a revelation of a sinister attempt at aggression aimed at stifling the DPRK by force and a blatant challenge to the ardent desire of the Korean nation to usher in a new era of independent reunification, peace and prosperity by its concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces in south Korea are the very source of tense situation and war in the peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and a stumbling block lying in the way of developing the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear issue was spawned on the Korean Peninsula due to the nuclear threat posed by the U.S. forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as the U.S. forces remain in south Korea, it is quite impossible to achieve detente and peace on the peninsula and provide a military guarantee for the development of the inter-Korean relations and prosperity common to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working hard to paint its forces in south Korea as what it called \"deterrent force,\" \"peace force,\" but this is sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are putting spurs to their moves to provoke a new war on the basis of such reckless plans for preemptive nuclear attack upon the DPRK and war scenarios worked out to suit different circumstances as \"OPLAN 5027-04\" and \"OPLAN 5030.\" According to the strategy for preemptive attack upon the DPRK, the U.S. military has massively shipped various type ultra-modern war hardware into south Korea to increase their attacking capability and maneuverability under the pretext of \"strategic flexibility,\" while pushing ahead with the redeployment of its forces present in south Korea in the areas south of the River Han. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of aggression toward the DPRK, the U.S. imperialist aggression forces' presence in south Korea, the resultant provocative arms buildup and military exercises, etc. are the main factor of escalating military confrontation and tension and the increasing danger of war on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly wants peace and stability on the Korean Peninsula, it had better make a bold decision to pull its forces out of south Korea at an early date as this is a touchstone showing its will for peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Paektu in Korea is known as a place good for the health of people for its beautiful scenery and peculiar highland climate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The area is lower than other areas in atmospheric pressure and temperature and the higher one climbs, the lower the humidity in the air decreases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The low atmospheric pressure in highlands reduces the oxygen partial pressure and improves respiratory and heart functions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The area is particularly good for mental workers. It helps respiratory, heart and digestive functions without any special physical exercise and labor. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is a primitive forest below 2,000 meters, the timberline of Mt. Paektu. Above the timberline there lie forest zones in the order of shrub forest zone, alpine steppe zone and lichen zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thanks to the varied geographical distributions of plants, the air contains fewer amounts of dust but various kinds of antibiotics and aromatic materials which are beneficial to health.  Rich in the area are the rates of solar radiation and ultraviolet rays. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the air in the areas around the Sagimun Falls which is falling on three stages with a certain interval, the Paektu Falls and the Paektumilyong Falls contains much amounts of ion good for health than other areas.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun Calls for Foiling U.S. Strategy for Proxy Aggression \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 15 (KCNA) -- The United States is now resorting to proxy aggression in a bid to carry out its hegemonic strategy for aggression and war, a strategy aimed at containing the anti-imperialist forces for independence by force and realizing domination and control over the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By carrying out its strategy for proxy aggression the U.S. seeks to strengthen the domination and control over its allies and satellite countries and puppets in a bid to seize the world's major areas rich in resources and military strongholds. Another sinister aim sought by it through this is to use its proxies for dominating and subjugating other countries and put them forward as a shock brigade for its \"anti-terror war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the intention of the U.S. imperialists to let Asians, Europeans, people in the Middle East, Africans and Latin Americans fight among themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has channeled greater efforts into carrying out its strategy for aggression with the help of its proxies, taking into consideration the change of the balance between world forces and the most serious crisis in history it is now undergoing. This situation prompts the U.S. to use as many allies and satellite countries and puppets as possible for escalating the proxy aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to stand up firm against the U.S. imperialists' moves for proxy aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world peace-loving people are called upon to intensify their struggle for independence against imperialism in order to deter the above-said countries from acting puppets and agents of the U.S. imperialists. It is particularly necessary to check Japan's aggression overseas including the Indian Ocean under the pretext of \"cooperating in the anti-terror war\" and Israel's frantic military offensive operations against Palestine under the signboard of \"combating terrorism.\" If an increasing number of people of the world advance along the road of independence and countries dependent upon the U.S. imperialists stop following them, they will stand isolated and their strategy for proxy aggression prove futile.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
