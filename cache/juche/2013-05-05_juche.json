He called for widely applying them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said he would send modern equipment for researches to the institute.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to turn the country into a socialist thriving nation and make it richer and more beautiful for the people by dynamically conducting the land management under a long-term plan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Choe Thae Bok, Pak Thae Song and Hwang Pyong So."

Therefore, the DPRK showed generosity and set them free from the humanitarian point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pae's case proves that as long as the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK remains unchanged, humanitarian generosity will be of no use in ending Americans' illegal acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. hostile policy goes on, American's illegal acts should be countered with strict legal sanctions. This is a conclusion drawn by the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some media of the U.S. said that the DPRK tried to use Pae's case as a political bargaining chip. This is ridiculous and wrong guess.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has no plan to invite anyone of the U.S. as regards Pae's issue."

Such saber-rattling has compelled the DPRK to take strong countermeasures.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is adding fuel to the flames by introducing latest war means into the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The acute situation on the peninsula is suitable to the U.S. in its effort to extend the sphere of its influence to the Asia-Pacific region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A high-ranking official of the European Union told a press conference that in its aggression moves the U.S. pursues a strategic aim to press China and Russia after occupying the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We should bear in mind again that the imperialists' ambition is pushing the world to another nuclear crisis."
