            "content": "Colonial servant's misbehaviour\r\n   Pyongyang, November 25 (KCNA) -- The South Korean ruling quarters recently made public the government budget in which they appropriated nearly dlrs 400 million in terms of the \"defence cost sharing\" for the \"upkeep\" of the U.S. troops present in South Korea. Thus, a total sum of costs for the upkeep of the U.S. troops including \"direct aid fund\" and \"indirect aid fund\" exceeds about dlrs 3 billion.\r\n   Commenting on this fact, Rodong Sinmun ( paper of Workers' Party of Korea) today says: \r\n   This clearly shows once again that the present South Korean ruling quarters  are a group of dastardly traitors engaged in flunkeyist and treacherous acts as their preceding dictators were.\r\n   South Korea is undergoing great difficulties under the economic trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund. The South Korean authorities, however, are offering a huge sum of money collected from the people to the United States, their master.    This shows that they have no intention to rehabilitate the devastated economy and improve the deteriorated life of the people but are trying to prolong their remaining days in reward for selling the interests of the nation to the united states, lock, stock and barrel.\r\n   This also proves that they scheme to unleash a war against the north at any cost in league with the U.S. imperialists.\r\n   Not content with selling  the dignity and interests of the nation to outsiders and leaving land, economy and money to their mercy,  they are rushing  headlong along the road of fratricidal war hand in glove with the aggression troops. Indeed, they  are a herd of heinous traitors without an equal in the world, who cannot be members of the nation.\r\n\r\n   \r\n"

If the \"national assembly\" does not properly probe the truth behind the crisis, they will, through legal proceedings, clarify who are responsible for it, they declared.\r\n   They decided to submit to the \"national assembly\" a document of protest carrying the calls of over 3,200 citizens.\r\n   On November 6, those organizations in a ceremony declared that they would start the citizens' movement for probing the truth behind the economic crisis and punishing those responsible for it and have since conducted a signature campaign in streets.    \r\n   \r\n"

The inexhaustible strength based on his politics of love and trust, benevolent politics, is a source of the building of such a powerful and prosperous country in the north as it is.\r\n   President Kim Il Sung gave social prominence to women, pursued a policy of attaching importance to women and provided them with all conditions to live and work with no worries. The Marshal has put forth all his energy to keep in fuller bloom the flowers of families and the country, the women whom the president put his heart and soul into training.\r\n   The strength of the masses who have grown under the benevolent politics of the marshal is so big and great that the north will soon appear before the eyes of humankind as  a powerful and prosperous socialist country with a brilliant future.\r\n   Thanks to the great loving care and trust of the Marshal, the great sun of Juche, the Korean nation will remain the strongest nation in this planet forever.    \r\n  \r\n"

But, in time of war, it organized one million-strong army.\r\n   Its people with a strong spirit of independence had victoriously repulsed invasion by outsiders -- one million-strong invaders in 598, three million troops in 612 and over one million troops in 645 and 661-662.\r\n   In the July Salsu Battle of the year 612 in particular, they annihilated or captured alive more than 300,000 enemy troops in a day. It was a great victory unprecedented in the world history of war in middle ages.\r\n   With developed economy and great national strength, Koguryo approved itself a political and military power.\r\n   In the whole period of its existence Koguryo followed independent foreign and domestic policies and developed relations with neighbouring countries.\r\n   It became the most powerful state in northeast Asia in fifth-seventh centuries and  played a big role in the historical development of Asia.    \r\n \r\n   \r\n"
