            "content": "Kim Jong Un Inspects KPA Unit 1973\r\n Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army Marshal Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and first chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission, inspected the command of KPA Unit 1973 honored with the title of O Jung Hup-led 7th Regiment on Friday.\n\t\t\t\t\t He gave a pair of binoculars, an automatic rifle and a machine gun to a sub-unit directly under the unit as gifts before having a photo session with its service personnel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After being briefed by its commanding officers on the monument to field guidance erected for handing down to posterity the immortal exploits of leader Kim Jong Il, who visited the unit on May 23, 2003, he looked round the rooms devoted to the education in the revolutionary history and the unit's history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un recalled that Kim Jong Il watched the unit's street battle training on November 30, 2011, the last period of his life. He looked back on the unforgettable day when he visited the drill ground, accompanying Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need for the unit to glorify the undying exploits of Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il with a proud victory in a great war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He highly praised the unit for having always taken the lead in upholding the Songun revolutionary leadership of the Party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said the Generalissimos attached importance to this unit and it is the unit he regards as the most important and the Party trusts, adding that his inspection of the unit today has a profound meaning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He looked round the soldiers' hall, library and a place for educating them as heroes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching with keen attention photos of exemplary book readers at the library, he praised the unit for operating the library well.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the place for educating soldiers as heroes he was told that the unit produced 189 heroes of the republic and labor heroes and 19 recipients of the National Reunification Prize and that it has 21 hero companies. Saying that the unit has quite a lot of heroes, he reposed deep trust in it, urging it to become a hero unit in the battle for making a breakthrough in a great war for national reunification in the future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At the soldiers' hall he underlined the need for the unit to fully prepare all its service personnel as those strong in idea and faith and members of a scouting party and a death-defying corps for national reunification fully equipped with the spirit of defending the socialist country by continuously paying primary attention to their political and ideological education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Asking about how education is conducted by the O Jung Hup Political University, he clarified the issues of properly working out the education program suited to the nature of the unit, successfully building ranks of teachers and improving their qualifications.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Soldiers of the unit who should fight in the enemy-controlled areas can creditably perform their mission only when they are fully prepared not only in military technology and physically but politically and ideologically, he noted.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Watching a topographic relief map showing enemy-controlled areas and the operational plan of the unit at the military lecture hall, he listened to a detailed report on the unit's performance of the operational combat duties and trainings from the commander of the unit.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Stressing the unit has an important mission to conquer the strongholds of the enemy, he said once a war breaks out, the unit should storm the heart of the enemies in a flash to strike and destroy the targeted military installations and reactionary ruling institutions of the puppet regime at a lightning speed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He instructed the unit to correctly set major objects of its strike and grasp all major targets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to properly work out a training program suited to the features of the unit's performance of duty and conduct training under the simulated conditions of an actual battle to prepare combatants in such a way as to enable them to operate freely in the enemy-controlled areas in case of emergency.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round the sub-unit directly under the unit, he stressed the need to take good care of the living of the soldiers of the unit who would fight in the enemy-controlled areas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed expectation and conviction that the service personnel of the unit would demonstrate the mettle of the heroic KPA in a decisive battle with the enemies and defend the dear socialist homeland as firm as an iron wall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Hwang Pyong So and Pak Jong Chon."

When considering the year 2011 alone, in July a soldier in Waegwan U.S. military base in Chilgok County, North Kyongsang Province committed a sexual violence against a woman in her 40s and in September a drunken GI raped 18-year old schoolgirl in Tongduchon, Kyonggi Province and a soldier belonging to the U.S. 8th Army stormed a room of a schoolgirl in Mapho District, Seoul where he raped her and fled with a laptop computer.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Drunken GIs recently brandished lethal weapons and did damage to innocent inhabitants and policemen, arousing furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Much upset by this, the U.S. Forces Commands in Japan and south Korea ordered soldiers to abstain from wine and put in force a nighttime curfew. But it was just like closing the barn after the horse is stolen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true nature of the U.S. forces plagued with corruption can never change.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is ridiculous for the U.S. to think of provoking the DPRK with such an army little short of a group of riff-raffs ill famed for corruption and crimes."

Por eso, la aprobacion de susodicha \"resolucion\", siendo producto de tal vicio inveterado, demuestra solo su bajeza y vulgaridad de ellos que abusan de DDHH, noble concepcion de la humanidad, para el malsano objetivo politico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara cumplir con su mision, el Consejo de DDHH de la ONU debe poner fin a la aprobacion de la \"resolucion de DDHH\" contra la RPDC, que es el climax de politizacion de DDHH, la opcion y la pauta de doble rasero y cuestionar ante todo la violacion de EE.UU. a la soberania del Estado que se comente por doquier del mundo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy dia, en los paises que se han convertido en escenas caoticas debido a la agresion y la intervencion de las fuerzas foraneas, persiguen  circulos viciosos de terror y venganza y la tragica situacion de DDHH que causa grave preocupacion de la sociedad internacional, lo cual demuestra fehacientemente cuan grave es  la consecuencia de la violacion a la soberania del Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas crece la hostilidad de EE.UU. tendente a aplastar la idea y el regimen optados por nuestro pueblo, tanto mas se elevara la intensidad de la confrontacion total antiyanqui de la RPDC."
