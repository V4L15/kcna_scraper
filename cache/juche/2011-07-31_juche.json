Korean Authorities' Unpopular Education Policy Denounced\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, July 31 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Youth and Student Sub-Committee of the North Side Committee for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration issued the following statement Sunday:\n\t\t\t\t\t The actions of youth and students and other people to have the university registration fee issue solved and the registration fee halved are sweeping across south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The government promised to halve the university registration fee in a bid to help families bring down their burdens of education expenses. This was traitor Lee Myung Bak's commitment during his \"presidential campaign.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had he come to power than he threw away this commitment like a pair of old shoes, depriving youth and students of the opportunity of learning. South Korea is thus ill-famed for appalling registration fee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enraged by this, the youth and students of south Korea launched the actions to have the registration fee halved. This was joined by lots of civic and social organizations including the Citizens' Solidarity for Democratic Society, the Teachers' Union and the Society of Parents of Students for Genuine Education. Even opposition parties responded to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Sub-Committee, together with the youth and students in the DPRK, extends full solidarity and warm support to the south Korean youth and students and all other people who turned out against the Lee group's unpopular education policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean youth and students are suffering from misfortune and pain more than others under the rule of traitor Lee and the \"Grand National Party\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A great number of students are dropping from the school unable to afford the tuition fee rising on annual basis. They are toiling and moiling at working places to earn money to pay for education.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not a few young people have taken their own lives calling for a society without registration fee and not a few parents committed suicides in face of soaring registration fee, leaving a note asking for their children's forgiveness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the biggest crime to deprive the youth of their precious and urgent right to learn and to drive them to despair and death, far from injecting hope and vitality into them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The tragic happenings in south Korea caused by the unaffordable registration fee eloquently prove that south Korea under the rule of Lee and GNP is a land of destitution and a tundra of human rights without future.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is not possible to meet the desire of the people to have the registration fee halved nor is it possible to expect hopeful tomorrow and happiness as long as the Lee Myung Bak group is allowed to go scot-free, deceiving and mocking at the people to remain in power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The protest demonstrations, sit-ins, candlelight rallies and one- million signature campaign now under way in different parts of south Korea are pushing the Lee group into a serious political crisis.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Righteous and brave south Korean youth and students, aware of their responsibility and role as vanguard forces, should fight it out in solidarity with the people from all walks of life to throw Lee Myung Bak and the GNP into the abyss of ruin and bring about a new society without registration fee, a society where everyone leads a genuine life, given ample opportunity of learning."
