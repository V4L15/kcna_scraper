            "content": "Open Letter to U.S. and S. Korean Authorities\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, August 8 (KCNA) -- The United States and the south Korean authorities are contemplating staging again adventurous Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military exercises from August 16 to 26 despite the unanimous desire of the people at home and abroad for peace on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn view of such situation sparking another danger of war on the peninsula, the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army Sunday sent the U.S. and the south Korean authorities the following open letter reflecting the unanimous will of the army and the people of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPeace is the strong desire and invariable requirement of the army and the people of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is, however, long since the situation on the peninsula inched close to a touch-and-go situation, after going beyond the fragile state of armistice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSuch trend of the situation is attributable to the hostile policy enforced by the U.S. toward the DPRK, failing to match its words with its deeds and the anti-DPRK policy of confrontation followed by the south Korean authorities, toeing its line. It is, at the same time, a direct product of the evermore undisguised war hysteria kicked up by the military warmongers against the north, pursuant to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Ulji Freedom Guardian is part of this hysteria for a war of aggression against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis can be explained by the fact that the projected joint saber-rattling will be dangerous war maneuvers to be staged by the U.S. and the south Korean military warmongers in accordance with newly revised and supplemented war scenario against the north. This can also be evidenced by the fact that the projected joint exercises would be all-out nuclear war maneuvers involving modern war hardware including improved nuclear attack means and huge aggressor forces and even local administrative organs and non-governmental enterprises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should not go unnoticed is the fact that they are going to stage such reckless saber-rattling though they must know well the resentment and hatred of the servicepersons and people of the DPRK and their determination to take revenge upon the military warmongers of south Korea for their hideous provocations are running high.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe KPA Panmunjom Mission is authorized to raise the following principled demands to the U.S. and the south Korean authorities in view of the prevailing grave situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should show the DPRK the will for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula by making a bold policy decision to cancel the projected joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf they stage actions of blackmailing against the other party by mobilizing even the group of super-large nuclear aircraft carrier and strategic nuclear strike flying corps, while urging someone to show sincere attitude towards denuclearization, this will amount to breaching the principle of simultaneous action for denuclearization. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula cannot be achieved by denuclearizing one side only.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis should be comprehensive and fair denuclearization including the removal of nuclear threats to the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK are not what they used to be in the past. They do not hide that they have had access to nuclear deterrent powerful enough to protect themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the other party launches a nuclear war, the DPRK is ready to counter it with nukes. It is its solemn declaration.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean authorities had better face up to the changed situation and properly understand who their rival is. They should show their willingness to denuclearize the peninsula in the eyes of the world by canceling the projected nuclear war exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. By canceling the exercises the U.S. and the south Korean authorities should make a bold practical decision to replace the armistice system by a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWar and peace can never go together.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNothing is more shameless political artifice than showing such poor double-dealing tactics as making preparations for a war behind the scene while paying lip-service to peace and dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe annual repetition of such war provocation actions as the Ulji Freedom Guardian would only keep the evil cycle of mistrust and confrontation and this is bound to lead to a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and south Korea are gravely mistaken if they think they would remain safe in case of a war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf a war breaks out, the DPRK will lose the military demarcation line and gain national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation. The DPRK is full of confidence and optimism about it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. has true willingness to replace the armistice system by a peace-keeping mechanism, it should show its practical willingness to do so at home and abroad as a big power by canceling the joint military maneuvers for this year at least.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The U.S. and the south Korean authorities should officially show their willingness to normalize the DPRK-U.S. relations and the inter-Korean relations by canceling the projected joint military exercises.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe normalization process should begin with ending the hostile relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo call for reconciliation, cooperation and improvement of relations and then to stage war exercises to do harm to the other side would be the height of double-dealing tactics.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. incurred the towering grudge of Koreans and the south Korean authorities ruined the June 15 era, bringing untold pain to the people. But the army and people of the DPRK are ready to subordinate everything to the great cause of peace, reunification, reconciliation and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean authorities should no longer commit such a policy error as misjudging the will of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUpcoming August 15 is supposed to offer a new watershed for the improvement of the relations between the north and the south. In the light of the public expectation for this, it would mean the total denial of the improvement of the relations if they start the joint military exercises against the DPRK from Aug. 16. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrankly speaking, as far as the issue of improving the DPRK-U.S. relations and the inter-Korean relations is concerned, the U.S. and south Korea is more pressed for time than the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has so far followed its path without having had its relations normalized with the U.S. and south Korea and it will thrive and live better off in the future, too.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey must officially make public their willingness to cancel the military exercises targeted against the army and people of the DPRK, if they want to normalize the relations with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK remain unchanged in their will and stand to counter the said exercises with the toughest stand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. and the south Korean authorities should behave with discretion, cogitate and choose a wise way-out at the crossroads of dialogue or confrontation and peace or war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK look forward to a positive response to their just call."

I'm working for a Beijing-based travel company founded in 1993. Our work is to bring foreign tourists to your country, the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuestion: The name of your company sounds meaningful. Why is your company named after Koryo? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnswer: We chose the word \"Koryo\" because it has a lot of meanings to the people in the DPRK. And we know that it was the name of the first unified dynasty here and also because our company runs only for tourism in the DPRK. So we wanted to choose the name very special to the Korean people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuestion: Can you tell me about tourists' impressions of the DPRK?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnswer: They are very happy to be able to come and hear for themselves the story of your country and the history of your country.

That is one of the highlights of their trip to the DPRK. And there is nothing else like this in the world. They find it utterly breathtaking, very, very specially prepared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tQuestion: What do you think your company can do for the improvement of relations between the DPRK and UK?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnswer: We are trying to do that. We have already made several films about the DPRK and we are making a film which would be finished this year. We're to develop the cultural exchange. For example, last year we brought a British women's football team to the DPRK to play football matches and next year we hope to take the DPRK team to Europe."

EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben mostrarnos la voluntad de desnuclearizar la Peninsula Coreana con su decision politica de suspender los presentes ejercicios militares conjuntos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi demandan a la contraparte la accion sincera por la desnuclearizacion y desarrollan por otra parte los actos de provocacion de guerra chantajeandola con el colectivo de portaaviones nuclear supergrande y la aviacion de ataque nuclear estrategico, esto significaria ya faltar al principio de accion simultanea hacia la desnuclearizacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana no es la de una parte, sino es la comprensiva e imparcial que toma en cuenta hasta la eliminacion de amenaza nuclear sobre la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no ocultan al mundo que poseen, a diferencia del pasado, el fuerte disuasivo nuclear para la autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY anuncian francamente que estan preparados para responder con armas nucleares si el rival les impone la guerra nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben conocer bien la situacion en cambio y a la contraparte robustecida y demostrar a todo el mundo la voluntad de desnuclearizar la Peninsula Coreana al revocar los presentes ejercicios militares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben tomar la decision practica de sustituir el actual sistema de armisticio de la Peninsula Coreana por el de paz, al suspender los presentes ejercicios belicos conjuntos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon incompatibles la guerra y la paz.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria la peor muestra de cinismo politico si incurren hasta hoy dia en la mala jugada de doble rasero como hablar mucho de la paz y dialogo por delante y preparar la guerra a las espaldas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa repeticion de ano en ano de los actos de provocacion de guerra como \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" empeorara el ciclo vicioso de desconfianza y enfrentamientos y dara lugar inevitablemente a la guerra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSerian muy equivocados si piensan que estaran seguros o ilesos el territorio estadounidense y el surcoreano en el caso de que se desate la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTenemos la conviccion y optimismo de que si se desata la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana, perderemos unicamente la linea de demarcacion militar y buscaremos la reunificacion de la patria, maximo anhelo nacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. tiene de veras la intencion de cambiar el actual sistema de armisticio de la Peninsula Coreana por el de paz, debe exponer al interior y al exterior su voluntad practica como gran potencia, al suspender, por lo minimo, los ejercicios militares conjuntos de este ano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben expresar oficialmente la voluntad de normalizar las relaciones con la RPDC mediante la suspension de los ejercicios militares en cuestion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa normalizacion de las relaciones comienza por el cese de actos hostiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi hablan hoy de la reconciliacion, cooperacion y mejoramiento de relaciones y desarrollan manana los ejercicios belicos para eliminar a la contraparte, esto sera el climax de la dualidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. impuso indecibles sufrimientos al pueblo coreano y las autoridades surcoreanas dejaron una herida muy profunda a todos los coreanos al echar a perder la epoca de reunificacion iniciada el 15 de junio.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, el ejercito y pueblo coreanos estan dispuestos a sujetar lo todo a la gran empresa por la paz, la reunificacion, la reconciliacion y la cooperacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas no deben cometer mas el error politico de malinterpretar tal disposicion del ejercito y pueblo coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn particular, si se toma en cuenta la esperanza del pueblo de que el venidero 15 de agosto (dia de liberacion de Corea) sea el nuevo punto de viraje en las relaciones intercoreanas, el inicio al dia siguiente de los ejercicios militares contra la contraparte (RPDC) significaria la negativa total al mejoramiento de esos vinculos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrancamente dicho, el que esta apretado por mejorar las relaciones no es la RPDC sino EE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa RPDC vino viviendo hasta ahora sin normalizar las relaciones con EE.UU. o las autoridades surcoreanas y seguira viviendo en mayor prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara normalizar las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU. y las N-S, hay que publicar oficialmente la voluntad de suspender los ejercicios de guerra nuclear que toman al ejercito y pueblo coreanos como su blanco.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon invariables la voluntad y la posicion del ejercito y pueblo coreanos de responder con intransigencia a \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. y las autoridades surcoreanas deben actuar con prudencia ante la disyuntiva de dialogo o confrontacion y de paz o guerra y tomar una opcion sensata.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y pueblo coreanos esperan la respuesta positiva a sus demandas justas e imparciales."
