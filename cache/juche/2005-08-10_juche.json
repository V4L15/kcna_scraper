The secretary of the Mfumalanga Provincial Committee of the South African Communist Party who is chairman of the South African Association for Friendship and Solidarity with the Korean People said this in a statement issued on August 2 on the occasion of the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Korea. \r\n President Kim Il Sung liberated Korea, freeing Korea from the yoke of colonial slavery and enabling the Korean people to enjoy an independent and creative life and their country, once eclipsed on the world map, to appear on the international area as a full-fledged independent and sovereign state, he noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people are now firmly defending the sovereignty of the country and dynamically pushing forward the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation under the outstanding and tested Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  He expressed the conviction that the Korean people would as ever fully demonstrate their might as a pioneer of the era of independence at the head of progressive humankind, meeting  all the challenges of the imperialists and glorifying Korean-style socialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea in violation of the Korean Armistice Agreement. In order to settle the nuclear issue the U.S. should drop its hostile policy toward the north and its plan for a preemptive nuclear attack and build confidence for normalizing the relations with the DPRK, they noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They urged the U.S. to stop giving lip-service to peace but show its will to work for peace in practice.    \r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n"

After its defeat Japan took a direct part in the war of aggression against the DPRK and has systematically obstructed its socialist construction and the reunification of Korea.\r\n Japan is kicking off a racket over the \"abduction issue\" which had been already settled, while shamelessly refusing to admit the crimes committed against the Korean people and honestly repenting of them. Lurking behind this is Japan's foolish and sinister intention to bring a groundless charge against the DPRK and flee from the responsibility to redress its past crimes come what may, reading the face of the U.S., its master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to bear in mind that they will only meet self-destruction if they persistently run wild in their moves to tamper with history and stage a comeback to Korea, failing to properly understand the tremendous might and will of the Korean youth.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a sinister deception, distortion of history and a mockery of human conscience, the commentary charges, and says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ceasefire on the Korean Peninsula was established on assumption that the Korean issue is settled in a peaceful way. However, the issue has not yet been solved for over half a century since the conclusion of the AA. This is entirely attributable to the U.S. unjust hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To change the armistice system into a peace-keeping mechanism is an urgent problem which brooks no further delay to settle on a fair basis the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue, a matter of deep concern of the world community.\r\n If the armistice system is changed into a peace system on the Korean eninsula, the U.S. hostile policy and nuclear threat to the DPRK, which are the root cause of the nuclear issue, will disappear and it will naturally lead to denuclearization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an inevitable process for a solution to the issue of the Korean Peninsula to put an end to the unstable ceasefire and establish a peace system. The uccessful establishment of peace system will be conducive to ensuring peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and, furthermore, the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This establishment of peace system depends on whether the U.S. is ready to drop the anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK and ensure peace and security on the Korean Peninsula or not. The U.S. should renounce its Cold War way of thinking and make a resolute decision to take a practical measure for getting rid of the last legacy of the Cold War era on the peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
