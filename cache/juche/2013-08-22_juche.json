Core basic technologies and technical engineering in important fields are making rapid progress and the country has reached a high level in latest technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the fixed will of Kim Jong Un to turn the DPRK into a thriving socialist nation both in name and reality, true to the behest of leader Kim Jong Il. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe British Association for the Study of Songun Policy in an article posted on its internet website said that smiling Kim Jong Un reflects the confidence that he can surely turn the DPRK into a thriving socialist nation in the near future. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt went on: Kim Jong Un said that it is the steadfast will of the Workers' Party of Korea not to let the people tighten their belts again but help them enjoy wealth and prosperity under socialism. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people optimistically foresee the future of prosperous Korea when seeing the confident smile of Kim Jong Un leading the building of a thriving nation, and achieve fresh successes every day in building an economic power true to his leadership. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Uruguayan paper La Juventud said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Songun politics of the DPRK is displaying its great might not only in politics and military affairs but also in the economy and culture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe People's Army is making a breakthrough towards developing national economy under the slogan \"Let us take upon ourselves both national defence and socialist construction!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traditional great army-people unity has reached the highest stage in the DPRK where the People's Army takes the lead in all fields and the people learn after the revolutionary soldier spirit. Multifarious events startling the world people are taking place in building a thriving nation, thanks to the indomitable mental power of the service personnel and people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Nigerian National Committee for the Study of the Juche Idea posted on its internet website an article which said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK produced everything including satellite by its own efforts. Everything including a screw nail is locally produced. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the scientists and technicians who produced, launched and controlled satellites are talents trained at home. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThese facts indicate that the DPRK has strong self-supporting economy and latest science and technology. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe chairman of the Russian Blagobeshensk Association for the Study of Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism made public an article. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Democratic People's Republic of Korea is a developed country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people keep turning out excellent products to be proud of in the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK underwent a stern trial owing to the economic blockade of the imperialist allied forces and natural disasters at the end of the last century. But this was irrelevant to the political system in the country. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people, very diligent, have strong creative ingenuity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScience and technology are rapidly developing in the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Guinean domestic broadcasting service said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people suffered a lot of bottlenecks and difficulties in economic construction for several decades. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBecause the DPRK had to divert huge human and material wealth to bolstering up the military capability of the country due to the U.S. and other hostile forces' persistent sanctions, pressures and moves for aggression though they should have been used for economic development and improvement of the people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean people are now in a position to push forward the building of an economic power as they please. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Nepal Today said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGone are the days never to return when the U.S. obstructed economic construction of the DPRK, threatening it with nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's new strategic line helps make a huge investment in economic construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world will clearly witness the DPRK successfully building a thriving socialist nation."
