It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is zealously patronizing traitor Park Chung-Hee's pro-U.S. criminal history in which it met his personal interests by making many south Korean women provide sex to the GIs.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t \"Yusin\" dictator Park Chung-Hee set up brothels at the U.S. military bases in south Korea and put sexual slavery for the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces on a legal and institutional basis since the early 1960s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At that time the \"yusin\" dictator regarded the south Korean women as mere scapegoats for courting the U.S. pleasure and an \"industry without chimney\" for money-making.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He established a \"purification committee for the U.S. military base villages\" at Chongwadae in December, 1971. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A \"measure for purification of the U.S. military base villages\" signed by him in 1977 was opened to public in 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to it, the direct administrative expenses of the authorities for the women in the base villages were backed by a \"special fund of the president\" and they used an official term \"comfort women for GIs\" referring to the women in the base villages. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitor Park Geun Hye paid no heed to getting apology and reparation from the U.S. in a bid to cover up the \"yusin\" dictator's treason of conniving at and supporting the sexual slavery for the U.S. troops.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park unhesitatingly committed the thrice-cursed act of treachery by covering up the crimes related to the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army in an effort to hush up her father's pro-Japanese acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye and her clan are following Park Chung-Hee's despicable pro-Japanese acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Kun Ryong, brother of Park Geun Hye, openly justified the pro-Japanese acts during his junket to Japan in July last year, saying that to cause a discord with Japan over the issue of the past history was a \"shameful behavior.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Park Geun Hye frequently promised that she would drastically increase the rate of women's involvement in politics and train 100,000 talented women, but it was no more than a cynical ploy to deceive the women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The World Economic Forum in its annual \"report on the world gender gap\" evaluated that the most serious gender discrimination against women was in the south Korean political circle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Women in south Korea are subject to the most serious discrimination in their social and economic life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Shortly ago, the British magazine Economist was critical of the worst position and working conditions of south Korean women among the countries and regions belonging to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development by putting together ten indices including wage gap and rate of women holding high posts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Marriage and family have become a symbol of misfortune and pain to the south Korean women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the thoughtless introduction of abnormal and corrupt Western culture and lifestyle and undisguised production and distribution of literature and art works in which women are regarded and portrayed as playthings, the number of sex-related crimes of all kinds is on the steady increase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In south Korea where infamous \"yusin\" fascist dictatorship has been revived and democracy and human rights are crudely violated, those women who sympathize or support the north' assertion even a bit have become the primary target of \"witch hunting\" whether they are south Koreans, overseas Koreans or foreign women.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park Geun Hye group does not hesitate to commit crimes against humanity and human rights abuses which sacrifice women hailing from the north for the purpose of the policy of confrontation with the fellow countrymen while detaining them and forcing them to \"defect\" to the south after abducting them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The report branded the Park Geun Hye group as a group of fascists and hideous criminals who are not in a position to talk about human rights as they are ruthlessly abusing rights of women in wanton violation of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Genuine rights of women can be attained through struggle only, the report said, calling on all the women in the north and the south and abroad to force traitor Park Geun Hye to face the severest punishment by history as she is not entitled to stay among the Korean women."

el Sur de Corea de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea publico el dia 6 un reporte sobre el crimen de la violacion de derechos humanos de mujer de la banda de Park Geun-hye que convirtio el Sur de Corea en el  infierno y escena caotica del desprecio y el maltrato a las mujeres.\n\t\t\t\t\t  La nota revela con datos el crimen de haber encubierto el crimen de la esclavitud sexual de sus amos, Estados Unidos y Japon, el crimen antipopular de haber convertido en la tierra esteril de mala fama en el mundo privada de DDHH de mujer y la atrocidad antietica que toma a las mujeres como victimas de la confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La horda de Park Geun-hye protege insistentemente los actos proyanquis y vendepatrias de Park Chung Hee que satisfizo sus intereses personales vendiendo la castidad conyugal de numerosas mujeres.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El dictador de \"Yusin (renovacion)\" es el culpable que legalizo y sistematizo la instalacion de las estaciones sexuales en las bases de las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea y el servicio sexual para las tropas agresivas imperialistas yanquis desde el principio de la decada de 1960.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  En aquel entonces, para este dictador de \"Yusin\" las mujeres surcoreanas no pasan de ser un juguete para atraer la simpatia de su amo gringo y un medio de la ganancia de la \"industria sin chimenea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El traidor Park Chung Hee instalo hasta el \"comite de purificacion para las villas de las bases militares norteamericanas\" en Chongwadae en diciembre de 1971. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 2013 se dieron a publicidad las \"medidas para la purificacion de villas militares\", firmadas en 1977 por el dictador de \"Yusin\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun este documento, se adiciono el \"fondo especial del presidente\" a los gastos de administracion directa de las autoridades sobre las mujeres de las villas militares de aquel entonces, y las autoridades las llamaban oficialmente como \"consoladoras para uniformados norteamericanos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa traidora Park da espaldas a obtener la disculpa y la indemnizacion merecidas a fin de encubrir la historia proyanqui y vendepatria del dictador de \"Yusin\" que tolero el crimen de esclavitud sexual para los uniformados norteamericanos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara ocultar los crimenes projaponeses y vendepatrias de su padre Park Chung Hee, prescindio el crimen de esclavitud sexual para el viejo ejercito japones. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye y sus familiares continuan la historia vendepatria y projaponesa de su padre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl visitar Japon en julio del ano pasado, Park Kun Ryong, hermana menor de Park Geun-hye, justifico su actitud projaponesa diciendo que es una \"verguenza\" fomentar la discordia con Japon en cuanto al problema del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye expreso reiteradamente la voluntad de \"aumentar en gran medida la proporcion de las mujeres en las actividades politicas\" y \"formar a 100 mil mujeres talentosas\", pero esto fue un engano para atraer a las mujeres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"informe mundial sobre la discriminacion sexual\", que se publica anualmente por el Forum Economico Mundial, estima que la discriminacion sexual es mas grave en el circulo politico surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas mujeres surcoreanas reciben el trato de inferioridad no solo en la vida politica sino tambien en la socioeconomica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace poco, la revista britanica Economist critico que en los 10 indices como las diferencias de sueldos y la proporcion de empleadas en alto rango, la posicion y las condiciones de trabajo de las mujeres surcoreanas son mas inferiores que otros paises y regiones ingresados en la Organizacion de Cooperacion Economica y Desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara las mujeres surcoreanas, el casamiento y la familia se consideran como simbolo de desgracias y sufrimientos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos introducen a sus caprichos la cultura y modos de vida anormales y corruptos de los paises occidentales y permiten la creacion y distribucion de las obras literarias y artisticas que consideran a las mujeres como juguetes de placer, debido a lo cual se incrementan cada dia mas los crimenes sexuales de toda indole. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la sociedad surcoreana donde se rehabilita la dictadura fascista de \"Yusin\" de mala reputacion y se ven exterminados completamente la democracia y los derechos humanos, las mujeres que expresan la minima simpatia por la insistencia de la RPDC, sin distincion de las surcoreanas, las compatriotas en ultramar y las extranjeras, se hacen primer blanco de la \"caza de bruja\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Park Geun-hye comete sin escrupulos los crimenes de lesa humanidad como el secuestro, arresto forzoso y sumision de las mujeres norcoreanas convirtiendolas en las victimas de la politica fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta horda de gangsteres fascistas y criminales, que viola despiadadamente los derechos humanos de las mujeres despreciando brutalmente la ley internacional, no tiene la calificacion de hablar de DDHH.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos verdaderos derechos humanos de las mujeres se obtienen solo por la lucha. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodas las mujeres coreanas en el Norte, el Sur y en ultramar deben dar el castigo mas duro a la traidora Park Geun-hye."
