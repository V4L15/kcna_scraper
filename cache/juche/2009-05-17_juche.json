            "content": "Lee Myung Bak Group's Dependence on Outsiders Slammed\r\nPyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- The minister of \"Foreign Affairs and Trade\" and other confidants of traitor Lee Myung Bak recently vied with each other to call on the U.S. \"special envoy for its policy toward north Korea\" on a visit to south Korea to have secret talks. At the talks they echoed the balderdash talked by him that \"the north Korea-U.S. dialogue is not taking place due to the former\" and \"the north will have to pay a due price in case it conducts a nuclear test.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson Sunday observes in a signed commentary in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t These outbursts admit of no argument as they were let loose by crazy colonial bailiffs to stifle and do harm to fellow countrymen while serving outsiders. But there is a need to probe the truth about what happened as they are speaking for the U.S. in a bid to mislead the public opinion in and outside south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present U.S. administration is following the same hostile policy toward the DPRK as enforced by the former administration, while touting \"a change\" and \"diplomacy for multilateral cooperation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. remains unchanged in its wild ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms behind the scene of \"dialogue.\" The Lee group, too, must be aware of this. The group is echoing the U.S. unreasonable sophism not merely because it does not have any principle but because it regards confrontation with compatriots as a means of existence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the Lee group that is getting frantic with its moves to do harm to fellow countrymen, backed by the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No matter what nonsense the Lee group may talk under the clutches of the U.S., the DPRK remains unchanged in its determination and declaration made to protect the dignity and sovereignty of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the invariable principled stand of the DPRK not to cowardly bow to the U.S. and other countries without any self-respect, as far as its relations with them are concerned, but counter sword brandishing with sword and reciprocate the offer of cake in kind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Whoever works hard to dare stifle the DPRK is bound to face a stern punishment by its army and people and the Lee group will have to pay a dear price for its moves to escalate confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group had better bear this in mind and stop acting running dogs of the U.S., though belatedly."

Korea Called for\r\nPyongyang, May 17 (KCNA) -- All political parties, organizations and people from all walks of life in south Korea desirous of independence, democracy and reunification should form a great alliance of progressive forces as early as possible irrespective of idea and ism in order to foil the fascist clique's unprecedented repressive offensive and intensify the anti-\"government\" struggle by dint of unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday observes this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The unity serves as a fundamental guarantee for the south Korean people in winning a victory in the struggle for independence, democracy and reunification, the article notes, and goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A key to ensuring the unchallenged superiority of the progressives in the acute confrontation with the reactionary conservatives standing in the way of advance of the history is to achieve the unity of the people of different circles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No unity would be thinkable without a great alliance of the progressive forces. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To form the said alliance means that all patriotic organizations, personages and people aspiring after independence, democracy and reunification get united organizationally for the common purpose and take united actions, firmly solidarizing with one another.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Only when individual progressive organizations subordinate everything to achieving the common goals of independence, democracy and reunification and form a great alliance on this basis, is it possible to achieve strong unity and meet any challenge to reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The grave situation in which the south Korean conservative ruling forces have intensified as never before the repressive offensive against the pro-reunification democratic forces urgently requires the progressive forces from different circles to unite close as one and form the great alliance as early as possible.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Koreans' desire for independence, democracy and reunification is absolutely just and no force on earth can bar them from forming the great alliance of progressives for realizing it."
