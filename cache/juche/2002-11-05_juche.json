It will clearly demonstrate that no matter what military pressure and economic sanctions the U.S. imperialists may impose upon the DPRK and no matter what barbaric war of aggression they may start against it, they cannot destroy Korean-style socialism as long as there are the invincible revolutionary forces of Mt. Paektu and ten million people who sincerely assist the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paper calls upon the People's army and people of Korea to uphold the army-based policy of Kim Jong Il, highly display the army-people unity and the trait of defending the army and loving the people, firmly safeguard Korean-style socialism and build a powerful nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that assisting the army is a demonstration of the Korean people's fixed faith and will to implement the army-based policy of the Workers' Party of Korea with loyalty.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM spokesman on talks for normalization of DPRK-Japan relations\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 5 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave answers to a question put by KCNA today as regards the recent talks for the normalization of DPRK-Japan relations.\r\n He said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan intergovernmental talks were held in Kuala Lumpur between October 29 and 30 for the normalization of the bilateral ties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At the talks both sides reaffirmed each other's will to implement the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration. This deserves appreciation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, no progress was made in the discussion on the essential problems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was because the Japanese side insisted on discussing outstanding issues such as nuclear and abduction issues before taking up the issue of settling the past, the core problem for the normalization of the bilateral relations, thus damaging confidence between the two parties to the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The key point in the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration is for Japan to settle its crime-woven past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The declaration was adopted as Prime Minister Koizumi visited the DPRK with his decision and will to solve this problem. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut for Japan's will to redress its past, the declaration would have not been produced. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unpleasant outstanding issues cropped up between the DPRK and Japan one after another because Japan has not yet redressed its big crimes committed against the Korean people in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Therefore, the DPRK recognized that doing away with the leftovers between the two countries by discussing and agreeing on the issues of establishing diplomatic relations and economic cooperation on a priority basis would lead to radically improving the bilateral relations and successfully settling the outstanding issues and proposed an appropriate mode of discussion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese side asserted at the talks that it could not discuss other issues unless the nuclear issue and the issue of kidnapped Japanese are settled despite the fact that it confirmed its will to normalize relations and effect economic cooperation in the Pyongyang declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such behavior of Japan is now creating very serious issues as it is illogical. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the nuclear issue is concerned, it is an issue directly related to the security of the Korean nation as it is a product of the U.S. escalated hostile policy toward the DPRK and its threat to mount a preemptive nuclear attack on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is insisting on discussing the nuclear issue with the DPRK although it is well aware that it is in no position to guarantee the DPRK its security. This only arouses the DPRK's doubt as to whether it is not speaking for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If there is any security issue between the DPRK and Japan, both are only committed to keeping promises made in the declaration not to do anything threatening each other's security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis will be proved in the process of normalizing the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the issue of kidnapped Japanese is concerned, the Japanese side broke the first promise made to the DPRK, thus damaging the confidence, spoiling-the hard-won atmosphere of cooperation and rendering the situation more complicated. \r\n The agreements and promises made between the countries should be observed on the basis of reciprocity under any circumstances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If any party ceases to implement its commitment, it is impossible for the other party to continue to fulfil its commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Upon learning about the outcome of the talks, the relevant organs and people of the DPRK are becoming increasingly assertive that it is necessary to reconsider various points related to security including the nuclear and missile issues under the untransparent conditions where Japan's words and deeds regarding the implementation of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang declaration do not go with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Especially, the DPRK's relevant field is of the view that the DPRK should reconsider the moratorium on the missile test-fire in case the talks on normalising the relations between the DPRK and Japan get prolonged without making any progress as was the case with the recent talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is in the process of seriously examining the situation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
