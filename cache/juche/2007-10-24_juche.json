In escalating their campaigns to isolate and pressurize the DPRK, the U.S. bellicose forces seek to take a physical option against it if their gangster-like demand lurking behind their loudmouthed \"peace\" and \"dialogue\" does not work on it. But such U.S. double-dealing tactics can never go down with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. frantic moves to establish the MD are creating a dangerous situation in and around the Korean Peninsula where the military equilibrium may be upset and a new arms race may rage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to see through the seriousness and danger of the present situation and stop at once its reckless and adventurous moves for a war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
