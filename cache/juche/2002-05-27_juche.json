Women serve our society as a flower of life, happiness, country and revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No other women in any page of human history and any country of the world take so lawful position of masters of a country equal with men and play the role of masters as the Korean women. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no other country in the world than the DPRK where many laws, regulations and social measures for women have been instituted. Our society attaches importance to women and in our era women are respected and active. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only the great sun, the genuine leader can bring up and train women as a flower of family, the society, the country and the nation. Kim Il Sung broke all iron chains of inequality and oppression and turned the history of women's ordeals into a history of happiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean women are now more fully blooming as beautiful flowers under the loving care of Kim Jong Il who is carrying forward the president's idea and theory on solving the problem of women.\r\n"

The U.S. troops violated the 1949 Geneva Convention. There should be compensation for killing defenseless civilians by bombing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n I will inform the international association of democratic lawyers of this fact and take a legal action as regards these crimes.\r\n"

It is quite abnormal that there still remains this leftover although the world entered the 21st century. The U.S. should drop its policy to keep its troops overseas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the past the U.S. justified its forces' presence in South Korea with the Cold War logic. But it no longer works. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present situation has deprived the U.S. of any justification to keep its forces in South Korea any longer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. forces' pullout is an irresistible trend of the times and it is urgently required for the peace and stability in northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should take a bold decision to withdraw its forces at once.\r\n"

The number of the bombers making sorties to drop germ bombs reached as many as 480 in a single day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n GIS used over 20 types of germ weapons including pest, cholera, smallpox and epidemic bleeding fever and more than 34 species of insects and animals infected with germs including fly (5 species), mosquito (3 species), flea, bug and mouse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They massively used chemical weapons in 24 cities, counties and front areas in the north including Jangwon, South and North Hwanghae and South Phyongan provinces from February 1951 to July 1953. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist air pirates used poison-gas bombs 33 times from February 27 to April 9, 1952 and U.S. army units fired suffocative and lachrymatory gas shells at defence positions of the Korean people's army 41 times in the almost same period. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The weapons of mass destruction used by the U.S. troops during the Korean War included more than 15 million spa-napalm bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The biological and chemical warfare committed by the U.S. forces during the Korean War was a deliberate and premeditated criminal act to exterminate the Korean nation and severely destroy the land of Korea.\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On December 26, 2001, the DPRK informed the UN security council of its legal and administrative steps it deemed necessary for combating terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these facts prove that the \"charge\" brought by the United States against the DPRK this time is baseless and it is another product of its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Lurking behind the U.S. fallacy is a foolish attempt to \"justify\" Bush's remarks about the \"axis of evil\" censured worldwide even through the profound confusing of right and wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rumsfeld, U.S. defense secretary, recently told sheer lie that \"North Korea is offering weapons of mass destruction to terrorists with whom it has already maintained relations\". This is also a foolish remark made to achieve the above-said aim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nonsensical that the U.S. is imprudently talking about \"cooperation with the DPRK in anti-terrorism\" after ditching the DPRK-U.S. joint statement that clarifies the political willingness to delist the DPRK as a \"sponsor of terrorism\" and keeping it on the list of the \"sponsors of terrorism\" for no reason. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more vociferous the U.S., the kingpin of international terrorism, is becoming in slandering others, styling itself a \"judge of terrorism\" whom no one recognizes, the bitterer worldwide ridicule and criticism it will meet.\r\n\r\n"
