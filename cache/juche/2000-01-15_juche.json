This bars the DPRK from reposing any trust in the U.S. It is only paying lip-service to the \"improvement of relations with the DPRK.\"  This requires the DPRK to heighten vigilance against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK considers principle as its lifeline. It will, therefore, never flinch from the principled stand no matter what others may say or no matter which way the wind may blow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK will react to the \"hard-line\" attitude of the U.S. bellicose forces with its strongest will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should change its attitude, deeply mindful of the consequences to be entailed by the confrontation with the DPRK. \r\n\r\n"

Only when one channels greater efforts into building one's own defense capabilities, is it possible to check and frustrate the aggressive maneuvers of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Worker's Party of Korea and the DPRK government will faithfully discharge the honorable international duty they have assumed for the human cause of independence, socialist cause, invariably upholding the revolutionary banner of independence against imperialism in the future, too, the article concludes. \r\n\r\n"

But this is a sheer deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that erstwhile socialist countries in east Europe and other countries and nations, taken in by the \"peace\" and \"cooperation\" touted by the imperialists, had their sovereignty wantonly violated and are now subjected to slavery, the article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The lesson to be drawn by the people is that they should resolutely fight against the imperialists' undisguised military aggression and pressure and should never be taken in by their carrot strategy, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should never be tricked by a broad hoax of the imperialists who seek a sinister aim with smile on their faces but maintain a strong anti-imperialist stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Even the slightest illusion about imperialism should never be allowed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Any illusion about imperialism is as harmful as poison. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   \"Peace\" on their lips means an aggression and war and their loudmouthed \"cooperation\" and \"improvement of relations\" are a noose for domination and subjugation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nProgressive countries and peoples are preserving their ideologies, systems and modes, not taken in by the sophism of the imperialists. This is because they are well aware of the imperialists' dominationist intention veiled with the carrot strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ideological and cultural poisoning by the imperialists should be thoroughly frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Taking to bourgeois ideology and culture would lead to ideological degeneration and benumbed class awareness and illusion about imperialism.

Needless to say, this is intended to tarnish the image of the peace-loving DPRK and find a pretext to escalate the U.S. moves to isolate and stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What can not go unnoticed is the fact that the U.S. administration authorities were behind those who dreamed up such misinformation as evidenced by the source of those news items. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The point at issue is why the U.S. administration authorities are deliberately spreading such rumours insulting its dialogue partner, at a time when a climate is being created for the improved DPRK-U.S. relations in the wake of last year's Berlin talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is clear to everybody that such diatribe goes against the spirit of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and adversely affects the on-going multi-faceted DPRK-U.S. talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This compels us to suspect the U.S. talk about dialogue and express deep concern about the true aim sought by it in its \"stick strategy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The dastardly false propaganda launched by the U.S. only goes to clearly prove that it is desperately clinging to the foolish stratagem to justify its ceaseless arms buildup and the moves to provoke a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was part of this stratagem that in recent years the U.S. administration worked out in great haste an additional budget for missile defence and schemed to spend 2.2 billion U.S. dollars of more funds for the establishment of the national missile defense system out of its budget for the year 2001 under the pretexts of \"missile launch capacity\" of some countries and \"threat\" posed by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. is truly interested in peace and  stability on the Korean peninsula and in the improved relations with the DPRK, it should stop its arms buildup and moves for a war against the DPRK, which aggravate the situation, and such false propaganda aimed at slandering its dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are prepared for both dialogue and confrontation. \r\n\r\n"
