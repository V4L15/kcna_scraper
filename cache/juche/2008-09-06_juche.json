            "content": "KCNA Blasts Lee Myung Bak Group's Anti-DPRK \"Human Rights\" Racket\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak clique hell-bent on sycophancy toward the U.S. and confrontation with fellow countrymen is playing the role of a shock brigade in executing the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After coming to power Lee Myung Bak set \"human rights diplomacy\" as the \"task of state policy\" and adopted the \"improved human rights of someone\" as its policy while unhesitatingly kicking up an anti-DPRK \"human rights\" racket which even his predecessors were reluctant to do. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After setting up \"a section in charge of north's human rights\" in the \"Unification Ministry\", the traitor has frantically stepped up the moves to gather information about the human rights situation in the DPRK by mobilizing the \"State Human Rights Committee\", the \"Institute for State Policy Studies\" and other organs and riff-raffs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This year the \"Institute for Unification Studies\" allocated 100 million won for establishing \"database\", a collection of \"white papers on human rights situation\" in the north which it has issued since 1996. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters here is that the \"human rights\" ruckus kicked up by the Lee Myung Bak group has something in common with the U.S. anti-DPRK \"human rights\" offensive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that Lee at the talks with U.S. President Bush during his recent junket to Seoul raised the \"human rights issue\" in the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He blustered it was the first time that the human rights issue of the north was mentioned in south Korea-U.S. \"joint statement\" and the \"improvement of human rights performance\" should be regarded as \"a standard and principle\". He talked the same nonsense even when he met the president of the U.N. General Assembly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee clique is behaving impudently even in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To cite an example, as instructed by the authorities, a \"chief delegate\" of south Korea slandered the north at an international conference, urging it to \"take appropriate measures.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was a premeditated politically-motivated provocation to stoke hostility and mistrust between the fellow countrymen and push the north-south relations to confrontation as it was a vivid manifestation of the Lee group's deep-rooted animosity toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As recognized by the world, the DPRK regards it as its state policy to guarantee people's rights and it has contributed to the international efforts for the protection and improvement of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government considers it as the most important issue in safeguarding human rights to ensure people's right to independence and has exerted its utmost effort for providing them with genuine freedom and rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is south Korea where human rights issue actually exists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Demands for the abolition of the \"National Security Law\", a law that has earned ill fame as a legal mechanism that has violated human rights and justified the anti-reunification moves for more than half a century, have been turned down and all sorts of new evil laws and repressive mechanisms are in the making. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the deplorable reality there that the people's right to existence, the most essential element of human rights, has been grossly violated by foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is absolutely illogical for such group to raise their heads and talk about \"human rights record\" of someone although they should have been judged by history for the hideous human rights abuses they have committed against the nation and thrown overboard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak regime will have to pay a dear price for its human rights abuses to be cursed by history.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Accused\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 5 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak clique of south Korea recently sentenced Yun Ki Jin, chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance of Youth and Students for the Country's Reunification, to three years in prison and three years of suspension of civil rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on such fascist action, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun today says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group charged Yun with \"infiltration and escape\", \"accession to an enemy-benefiting organization\" and \"encouragement and praise\". It is a far-fetched assertion that can never be justified. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to anyone that Yun can never be a target of suppression as he should be praised for his devotion to the practical struggle to put an end to the national division and accelerate the national reunification by the concerted efforts of all Koreans in the spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, a great reunification programme common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group, however, sentenced him to penal servitude despite the unanimous protest of south Korean people from all walks of life, which is an artifice to tide over the serious ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By harshly punishing Yun on charges of \"violation of the National Security Law\" the puppets seek to pose threat to the pro-reunification patriotic forces and, furthermore, cook up a certain shocking incident groundlessly linked with the DPRK and thus divert the hatred of people to them elsewhere and find a way out of their ruling crisis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through such frantic repression of the pro-reunification patriotic forces, the Lee group has revealed that its loudmouthed \"improvement of relations\" and \"dialogue and cooperation\" with the DPRK are no more than an empty talk and that it is a group of traitors pursuing confrontation and provocation of a war against the DPRK while swimming against the trend of the June 15 era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Brandishing a sword against the people will bring nothing but self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If it does not want to meet death due to the strong resistance of the people, the Lee Myung Bak group should promptly set free Yun Ki Jin and all other pro-reunification patriots detained on unreasonable charges and stop at once the fascist suppression of the pro-reunification patriotic forces.  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

If Japan is truly interested in settling the issue of world peace and humanitarian issue, it should opt to settle these issues before anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese political circles are locked in a fierce scramble for extending the law on the refueling mission of the Maritime \"Self-Defense Force\" in the Indian Ocean. This is aimed to justify the overseas military activities of the MSDF in a bid to lay a legal foundation for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries seek to improve their international image and prestige and demonstrate their raison d'etre by laying a legal groundwork for overseas aggression.\r\n For Japan to redress its past crimes is an important touchstone showing whether it has a will for peace or not. Asian people's mistrust in Japan will go on unless this issue is settled. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan had better opt for liquidating its past as demanded by the international community rather than behaving in a narrow-minded and crafty manner to invite criticism from others. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is the lesson the Koreans have drawn from the past history of inter-Korean confrontation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to ensure peace, it is necessary to remove the source of threatening it, first of all. The U.S. military presence in south Korea and its reckless policy of war to invade the DPRK are the constant source of war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea are the main source of escalating the military tension on the Korean Peninsula and bringing the danger of a nuclear war to this land. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The treacherous confrontation and war moves stepped up by the south Korean puppets subservient to the aggressor outside forces are the main factor of threatening the peace on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Intolerable are the treacherous acts of south Korean puppets keen on the military confrontation with fellow countrymen after becoming running dogs of the aggressor outside forces, utterly indifferent to the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans at home and abroad are responsible for the struggle to defend peace against war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans who love the country and the nation and value peace should pool efforts regardless of whether they are in the north or the south or abroad and intensify the struggle for peace against war in order to smash the moves of the bellicose forces at home and abroad for a war of aggression.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should hold higher the banner of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration in order to cope with the daily escalating moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges for a war of aggression and carry on the dynamic struggle to achieve the peace and independent reunification of the country by their concerted efforts.   \r\n\r\n\r\n"
