Korea urged to pursue policy of national independence\r\n Pyongyang, March 7 (KCNA) -- Choe Song Ik, Department Director of the Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland, contributed an article to Rodong Sinmun today.\r\n   The article calls upon South Korea to preserve the Juche character and the national character, reject domination by outsiders and dependence on them and take the road of national independence in order to improve the stalemated inter-Korean relations and open a wide road to national reunification in keeping with the desire and aspirations of the Korean nation.\r\n   It goes on:\r\n   National independence is the principle that should certainly be maintained in shaping the destiny of the nation and the fundamental principle of national reunification the north and south of Korea confirmed in the July 4 Joint Statement and reaffirmed in the inter-Korean agreement.\r\n   For the improved inter-Korean relations the two sides of Korea should take the stand of national independence to believe in the strength of the nation and rely on the nation.\r\n   If any side of the two wants to find a solution in dependence on outsiders, it cannot become an independent dialogue partner.\r\n   The lessson drawn from the past inter-Korean relations clearly shows that inter-Korean relations can neither be improved nor the nation's peace and peaceful reunification can be expected when South Korea pursues \"policy\" of dependence on outside forces and allows domination and interference by outsiders, shuting its eyes to the fact that the interests of the nation are encroached upon.\r\n   South Korea has suffered from domination and interference by outsiders for scores of years.\r\n   The policy of dependence on outside forces pursued by the successive South Korean rulers has placed South Korean economy under the \"trusteeship\".\r\n   It is high time that South Korea preserved the Juche character and the national character and lived independently with its own viewpoint.    \r\n\r\n"
