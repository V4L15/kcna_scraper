They are a version of the \"Team Spirit\" joint military exercises.\r\n   Kim Young Sam, who is in the grip of the most serious crisis, forsaken by the people for his traitorous misrule and irregularities, intends to remain in power by unleashing a fratricidal war. His intention is well illustrated by the projected manoevures. \r\n   25 years have passed since the July 4 Joint Statement was published. The DPRK Government has made all sincere efforts to promote national reconciliation and unity and open a favorable phase for the peace and peaceful reunification of the country with the approach of August 15, the anniversary of the country's liberation.\r\n   The south Korean puppets can never be allowed to answer the DPRK Government's peaceloving efforts with war hysterics.\r\n   If they persistently seek a war in concert with outsiders, they will meet a disgraceful end. \r\n\r\n"
