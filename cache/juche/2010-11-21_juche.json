            "content": "Japan's Moves to Realize Ambition for Militarism under Fire\r\n Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- Japan is bound to meet international isolation and destruction if it keeps to the path of militarism while persistently dodging the legal and moral responsibility for the settlement of the past. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It cites facts to prove that the Japanese imperialists that invaded Asian countries including Korea to realize the dream of the \"Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere\" in the first half of the last century massacred Asian people in cold blood while running with bloodshot eyes to become the \"leader\" of the East.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Japanese imperialists have neither honestly reflected on the past crimes of Japan nor made apology and reparation for them even though more than 60 years have passed since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists. This aroused deep concern about the despicable true colors of Japan styling itself a \"pacifist state\" and its future among the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moves to deny the past crimes and realize the militarist ambition are getting ever more pronounced in Japan today. This is clearly proved by the moves for overseas expansion zealously stepped up by the Japanese reactionaries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan has so far failed to settle its past. Lurking behind this is its dangerous revanchist and militarist ambition to follow in the footsteps of the past imperialist Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The moves to realize the ambition for militarism getting evermore undisguised in Japan in recent years go quite contrary to the demand of the world public for Japan's honest admittance and reflection on its past crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan should make a clean break with its history in the past century in which it brought holocaust to mankind and turn over a new leaf."

            "content": "Anti-DPRK Remarks by S. Korean Ruling Quarters Denounced \r\n Pyongyang, November 21 (KCNA) -- The chief executive of south Korea during his recent foreign trip pulled up the DPRK, letting loose such foolish remarks about \"complete abandonment of nuclear program\" and \"responsible attitude\". He made no scruple of making such arrogant remarks that \"the north's insistence on its stand would only bring bigger damage to it\" and that \"only the south-north summit for achieving denuclearization is possible.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, Minister of Unification Hyon In Thaek, addressing a meeting of the \"National Assembly,\" claimed that the north has not taken a switchover in its stand on the south-north relations, talking about \"drastic change in attitude\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Sunday in a signed commentary brands these reckless remarks of the south Korean puppet group as an intolerable mockery of the whole Korean nation desirous of improved relations between the north and the south and blatant challenge and provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ridiculing the shameless remarks of the south Korean authorities as scream of those who were driven to a tight corner inside and outside, the commentary goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The six-party talks would have already resumed and the inter-Korean relations not been driven to such acute phase of confrontation as now if the south Korean authorities had not fabricated the anti-DPRK plots and not resorted to sanctions and military provocations against the DPRK in league with outside forces. Nevertheless, the south Korean authorities tried to convince the public that the responsibility for the situation rests with the DPRK. This is the culmination of shamelessness. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They have no qualification to talk about \"abandonment of nuclear program\" and \"change of attitude\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The balderdash of the south Korean authorities revealed their anti-reunification intention to stand in confrontation with the DPRK to the last while denying dialogue and cooperation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson in a commentary urges the south Korean authorities to stop the moves of confrontation with fellow countrymen though belatedly and sincerely come out for the north-south dialogue, bearing in mind that such anti-reunification remarks would only deepen their ruling crisis."
