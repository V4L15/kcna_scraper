This is a tragedy of Japan which it can never escape as long as it is in the pocket of its American master, observes Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary.\r\n Japan is describing the application of the \"financial sanctions\" against the DPRK as \"efforts\" for what it called \"dialogue\" and has become more vociferous about \"the abduction issue\" while intensifying its suppression of the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan since the emergence of the new Cabinet, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Abe Cabinet's desperate hostile moves against the DPRK are nothing but despicable acts that can be perpetrated only by political charlatans loyal to the Uncle Sam. The Japanese militarists seized by the ambition for reinvasion are zealously cooperating with the U.S. in its moves to provoke a new Korean war and going crazy to please it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the new Japanese government has taken only actions to bedevil the DPRK-Japan relations since its emergence. The desperate political provocations made by Japan against the DPRK to seriously infringe upon its sovereignty and dignity have touched off indignation among the Korean people.  The Korean people accurately keep on record not only the crimes Japan committed in the past but those crimes being perpetrated by it at present. Growing stronger are the Korean people's resolution and will to force Japan to pay for all those crimes without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is foolhardy of Japan to eye a responsible post at the UN. No country will trust Japan as it is going reckless, just copying the behavior of its American master, still not free from the bad practice of kowtowing to the U.S. and toeing its line.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They went the lengths of letting loose vituperations that they should do the north serious disservice, while finding fault even with its social system without hesitation.\r\n Commenting on this, a news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP gentry is a group of traitors utterly indifferent to the fellow countrymen and the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war deterrent of the DPRK built under the great banner of Songun is, to all intents and purposes, to cope with the U.S. imperialists' moves to launch a nuclear war and invade the DPRK as it is a shield for just self-defense. It is also meant to protect south Korea, too, with warm compatriotism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP group is raising a hue and cry over the war deterrent of the north which protects them, too, while uttering no bad word about the nukes of the U.S. which threaten the nation. As if it were not enough with this, they are crying out for sanctions and calling for not ruling out even a war. This is nothing but a silly intention to respond to good will with evil one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These traitors are desperately insisting on suspending the tour of Mt. Kumgang and the project of the Kaesong industrial zone, icons of undertakings for national reconciliation and cooperation. They had better bear in mind who wished for them and who benefit from them before wagging their thin tongues. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said behavior of the GNP teaches a lesson that this group of quislings hell-bent on confrontation with fellow countrymen and acts of treachery should be thrown overboard in order to frustrate the U.S. imperialists' moves for a war and achieve peace of the country and national reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
