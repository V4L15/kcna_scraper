            "content": "Speech of DPRK delegate at 56th session of UN General Assembly \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- The DPRK delegate in his speech at the meeting of the first committee of the 56th session of the UN General Assembly held on Oct. 17 said that it is necessary to eradicate the policy of strength and intervention in order to ensure durable peace and security of the world.\r\n He continued:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An attempt to establish the missile defense system is one of the main challenges to the world security, which is clearly aimed to dominate the world by having absolute military strategic edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the conditions where the U.S. is taking issue with the DPRK in a bid to find a pretext for the establishment of the MD, the DPRK will take strong countermeasures to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's moves to become a military power and revive militarism are throwing another dark shadow on the world security, the security in northeast Asia in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits attention is that Japan, in conspiracy with the united states, has persistently pursued the hostile policy toward the DPRK, talking about the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is firmly defending the destiny of the country and the nation, dynamically pushing ahead with the socialist economic construction and contributing to ensuring peace and security in the Korean peninsula and northeast Asia to cope with the hostile forces' attempt to stifle the DPRK by force. The credit for this goes to the army-first politics pursued by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The major nuclear weapons states should fulfil their commitment to nuclear disarmament and contribute to ensuring lasting peace and security of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to increase the major role of the UN in the aspects of disarmament and world security.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Paper on frantic moves of S. Korea for confrontation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed commentary dealing with such disturbing developments in South Korea as considering the north-south relations as hostile relations, relations between the two different nations, not relations between fellow countrymen.\r\n The \"Grand National Party\" and bellicose elements of the military and other ultra right-wing conservative forces in South Korea are hell bent on the moves for confrontation with the north, considering the north as the \"principal enemy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a vivid expression of their criminal ambition to harm and stifle the north in league with the outside forces, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How can any man of reason consider fellow countrymen, a partner of dialogue for reunification, as the enemy and try to harm them in conspiracy with the outside forces?    One may wonder if the south side has an ounce of national conscience or national awareness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side has recently put the whole army and police on \"emergency alert\" under the pretext of happenings in other country, placing the whole land of South Korea in the crucible of acute showdown. That was why the Seoul visits of the fourth home-visiting group of separated families and relatives and the Taekwon-do exhibition team of the north side were put off. It is contrary to reason that they block the road ahead of fellow countrymen by force of arms after inviting them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same can be said of the fact that the south side arrested some members of its delegation, who had participated in the 2001 grand festival for national reunification held in Pyongyang in August last, on the charge of \"enemy-benefiting activities.\" the south side took this action though it had promised to the north side to work for achieving reunification by the efforts of the nation. This is a challenge to the inviting side. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also arrogant that the \"grand national party\" clan are claiming that they are giving something to somebody. If they make free with all the vicious phrases, they may suffer severe punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had better behave themselves with courtesy.    \r\n\r\n"

To this end, the Japanese government is putting spurs to establishing a wartime system including the institution of a bill allowing the overseas dispatch of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" and even their advance into a disputed zone without prior approval of the diet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the U.S. began its military retaliatory operations against Afghanistan, Japan tried to send \"SDF\" warships and planes to the Indian ocean and put the \"SDF\" in battle readiness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing themselves of this opportunity, the Japanese ruling quarters are scheming to boost the position of Japan from that of an \"economic giant, military junior\" to that of the \"economic giant and military power\" in a bid to show off to the world community as a \"political power,\" through which to rank among permanent member nations of the UN security council. This means the \"full-fledged position\" which Japan is seeking to take in the international arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ruling quarters try to become a permanent member for world supremacy, not for global peace.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 24 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today in a signed article urges the united states to immediately withdraw its aggressor forces and all military equipment from South Korea.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces from South Korea is urgently demanded by the history of our nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in South Korea are chiefly responsible for the nation's division and a stumbling block lying in the way of the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their pullback from South Korea is the unanimous demand of the peace-loving people of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear to everyone that if the U.S. imperialists ignite a war in Korea, the war will quickly spill into other countries of Asia, not confined to the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation and the world are strongly calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea because their presence poses such a great threat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no ground for the U.S. forces to stay in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deceptive nature of the mask of \"liberator\", \"supporter\" and \"protector\" under which the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces are going in South Korea has already been brought to light. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A dynamic struggle for independence against the U.S. is raging in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This shows the determination of the South Korean people not to allow the U.S. forces to stay in South Korea any longer because through their life experience they realized that those forces are aggressors, plunderers and murderers who put the half of the land of Korea under their illegal occupation and a main obstacle lying in the way of peace and reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. argument that its forces should stay in South Korea to avert the \"threat of southward aggression\" from the north and check the southward advance of the former soviet army has gone totally bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nobody believes the U.S. working hard to justify its criminal moves to establish the Missile Defence system and its forces' continued presence in South Korea with its hue and cry over the \"missile threat\" from the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"
