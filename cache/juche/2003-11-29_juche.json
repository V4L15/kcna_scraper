If the \"National Assembly\" has a will, time offers no problem in instituting the law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"National Assembly\" should enact a comprehensive special law on probing the truth behind the mass killings of civilians to give vent to the grudge of the victims and their bereaved families who have undergone sufferings for the last half a century.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

It is its ultimate goal and the cherished desire of all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than the United States that compelled the DPRK to increase its physical deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggression and plunder are the true nature of imperialists and means of their existence. After occupying a half of the territory of other country, the U.S. has brought misfortune and sufferings to the nation and worked hard to impose the holocaust of a nuclear war upon it. It is American-style impudence for the U.S. to style itself \"a champion of global peace\". \r\n The U.S. is the chief harasser of the world peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is apt to charge others with \"harassing peace\", while bringing horrible disasters to humankind. This only reveals the shameless and crafty nature of the U.S. styling itself an \"apostle of peace\" while clamoring about \"global peace.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can be no durable peace and security in the world unless the U.S. arbitrary and high-handed practices are frustrated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the reality today when injustice judges justice and evil prevails over good, unilateral international standards are forged and \"anti-terrorism war\" is escalated without any proper reason and attempts to overthrow legitimate governments are openly hatched due to U.S. unilateralism.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The head of a DPRK delegation said this in a speech made at the 23rd meeting of the IMO opened in Britain on Nov. 24.\r\n In order to effect closer cooperation between the developing and developed countries, it is important to standardize maritime laws and regulations acceptable to all member states and provide the member states with ample conditions for participating in their implementation on an equal basis, he said and, went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The IMO's plan for technical cooperation and its efforts for its implementation should become a foundation of cooperation to make an effective contribution to creating capabilities of the developing countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All illegal acts of infringing upon the freedom of sailing should be stopped. The incident of the DPRK ship \"Sosan\" was an open armed attack on a peaceful trading ship. It was an illegal act as it not only seriously infringed upon the sovereignty of its member state and international law but gravely threatened the lives and dignity of its crew. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government will as always strengthen cooperation with the IMO and its member states in the idea of independence, peace and friendship and thus positively contribute to the international efforts for maritime security and the protection of sea environment, he concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the ulterior aim of the GNP to cover up its corruption and attack the present chief executive and the Uri Party by preventing the prosecution from conducting investigation through the invocation of the \"law\" against close associates of the chief executive. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Needless to say, the GNP is chiefly to blame for this disturbing development and the political chaos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary for the nation to eliminate the GNP not only to achieve national reconciliation and cooperation and its independent reunification but to put an end to the corrupt policy in south Korea.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
