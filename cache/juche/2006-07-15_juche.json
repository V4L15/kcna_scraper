It goes on:\r\n The tenth seminar of world political parties for building a new society held in Mexico City last March issued a joint statement calling for positive support to the struggle of the Worker's Party of Korea and Korean people to defend the cause of socialism and reunify the country. Other major international conferences adopted documents voicing support for the Korean people's cause of socialism and their struggle against the imperialists' anti-DPRK moves. Meanwhile, media of many countries released articles supporting the Korean people's cause of socialism. The DPRK is advancing under the uplifted banner of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It handles all issues related to its foreign relations according to its independent judgment and determination in line with the interests of its people. It has always shaped and implemented policies and line from an independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people have dynamically pushed forward the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation in the new century, foiling every move of the U.S. imperialists against the DPRK, because they have maintained a transparent and firm independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of defending socialism in Korea is directly related to the matter of preserving global peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The prevailing situation in which the U.S. imperialists have gone to extremes in their moves against the DPRK requires the world people to defend Korean socialism in order to safeguard world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The defence of Korean socialism presents itself as an urgent task in view of the requirements of both the present situation and the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is in full line with the desire of humankind to build a free and peaceful new world in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the daily mounting movement of international solidarity with the Korean people's cause of socialism, the article notes these international solidarity actions not only powerfully encourage the Korean people in their efforts to build a great prosperous powerful socialist nation but deal heavy blows at the U.S.-led imperialists and reactionaries keen to stifle the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

In the whole course of his leadership of the reunification movement, he has seen to it that the three principles were steadfastly maintained through whatever difficulties and ordeals and all problems be resolved strictly in reliance upon them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The work has turned the reunification movement into a nationwide movement by implanting the staunch will of reunification in the hearts of all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The three principles are the undisputed standard distinguishing between reunification and division, and between patriotism and treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il set forth national reunification already long ago as a noble patriotic struggle to achieve independence of the nation and showed deep attention to lighting the sparks of patriotism cherished in the hearts of the fellow countrymen and rousing all of them in a nationwide turnout for the accomplishment of the reunification cause. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By Korean nation itself\" held high at the head of the reunification cause has become the nation's common banner of unity and reunification, because it embodies the three principles of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To struggle to implement the three principles of national reunification is and will invariably be a noble national task facing the Koreans, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
