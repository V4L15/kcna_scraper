Through this it seeks to cover up its criminal moves that spawned the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and craftily evade its responsibility for the solution of the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That is why the U.S. describes the DPRK's withdrawal from the NPT as a \"violation\" of its commitments under international law and a \"challenge\" to the international community and advertises its unilateral assertion as the common view of the international community. This is, however, sheer sophism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the U.S. that has systematically violated the NPT and reduced it to a dead document. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. as a depository committed itself not to use nukes against nor threaten with them non-nuclear states that acceded to the treaty but has wantonly violated its commitment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This caused a nuclear crisis on the Korean Peninsula in 1993 and, therefore, it could be settled only through negotiations between the DPRK and the U.S. responsible for the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the Bush administration took a negative approach toward what was achieved in improving the DPRK-U.S. relations during the time of the preceding administration and once again escalated nuclear threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While systematically violating the official agreement reached between the DPRK and the U.S., the administration stopped the supply of heavy oil, the only commitment which had been implemented, thus totally breaking the basic promise made by the two sides for the solution of nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As seen above, the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula surfaced because of the nuclear threat posed by the U.S., the assailant, to the DPRK, the victim, and this is an issue of bilateral nature that can be solved by the parties concerned peacefully through negotiations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A public opinion was built up on the international arena on this issue to create the impression that this is an international issue of universal significance related to the fate of the NPT in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was because the IAEA served as a tool for carrying out the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK after discarding its principle of impartiality as an international organization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This was also attributable to the wrong thinking and mode of action on the part of some countries that blindly followed the U.S. stand, reading its face and currying favor with it because they gave priority to their unilateral interests and relations with the U.S., the only \"superpower\" in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This tendency should be eradicated without fail as it is quite contrary to international justice and the genuine desire and will of humankind for peace, security and stability of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Otherwise, the UN and the international community will continue to serve the purpose of meeting the U.S. unilateral interests, giving it the chance to fish in troubled waters, and then they will be unable to represent the genuine interests and desire of sovereign states and people to defend national independence, dignity and sovereignty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN and the international community are called upon to reject and check the U.S. high-handed and arbitrary practices in order to observe justice and equality in international relations and establish a fair international order.    \r\n\r\n"

Even if the worst thing happens, they have nothing to fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Some countries and media are so foolish as to describe the step taken by the DPRK as \"brinkmanship\". But it is not \"brinkmanship\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK regards any U.S. sanctions against it as a declaration of a war and is fully combat-ready to cope with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the unshakable will of the Korean people that if the ten million-strong army and people unite as one and fight in a do-or-die spirit, they can surely emerge victorious. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. politicians value the interests and future of their country, they had better properly understand the DPRK's resolute stand and stop going reckless.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary dismisses it as a shrill cry of those who are upset by the might of the DPRK dynamically advancing to speed up the building of a powerful nation under the banner of the army-based policy.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Temporary economic difficulties in the DPRK were caused by the blockade policy persistently pursued by the U.S. for over 50 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Right after the foundation of the DPRK, the United States set up the \"COCOM\" and has since controlled the export to the DPRK and its trade. It has massively brought its aggression troops to South Korea and frequently committed dangerous war exercises and armed provocations, constantly aggravating the situation on the Korean Peninsula. This has hamstrung the DPRK's efforts to push ahead with the economic construction and improve the people's living standard. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is beyond doubt that but for the U.S. persistent obstructions, our economy would have advanced faster than now and the living standard of our people would have improved remarkably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK Government's step to withdraw from the NPT is an expression of our steadfast will and pluck to foil the U.S. imperialists' economic blockade and moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. Any increased U.S. pressure on the DPRK only hardens its people's will to speed up the building of an economic power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists should lend an ear to the just voice of the international community and immediately drop its anachronistic economic sanctions and hostile policy to stifle the DPRK before imprudently interfering in its internal affairs.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
