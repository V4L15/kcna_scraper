He highly appreciated their feats and extended thanks to all the officials, workers and technicians of the mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t   He met with a weaver Jon Ok Hwa, a spinner Kim Pok Sil, the head of a shop Ri Myong Ok, all labor heroines who have worked at the mill for years and weavers Mun Kang Sun and Ri Myong Sun and spinners Sonu Ok and Han Chol Ok, young labor innovators, and highly praised their patriotic devotion and gave them warm pep talks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Never before have women had their fame and worth glorified as the women in the era of the Workers' Party did, he said, adding that this epoch-making change that has taken place in the position and role of the Korean women clearly proves that the women strong in revolutionary character and militancy have grown to be a powerful force dynamically pushing forward the revolution and construction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He set forth important tasks to be fulfilled by the mill.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Noting that it is an unshakable resolution and will of the Party to provide the people with better clothes, he underlined the need to bring about a fresh turn in solving the problem of clothing by exerting great efforts for the production of textile.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  One can witness a high-pitched drive for effecting a great revolutionary surge at every factory and the country is advancing at an exceptionally high speed thanks to the drive, he said, stressing that the day of the victory in the drive for building a great prosperous powerful nation is drawing nearer thanks to the unprecedented great advance of all the people and servicepersons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Now when a great turn is taking place is the time for all the domains and all the units to forge ahead vigorously toward the finish line, he noted, calling on all the servicepersons and people to make a great leap forward by dint of their single-minded unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Secretary of the C.

That is why the group of traitors feigns ignorance of the mounting anti-Japanese sentiment of all Koreans and the evermore undisguised moves to stage a comeback to Korea including the moves to seize Tok Islet.

This made it possible for them to perform their role as part of the driving force of the country in the political, economic, cultural and all other fields of the revolution and construction with equal rights with men. The Korean women have witnessed shining progress of the revolutionary women's movement under the care of the three commanders of Mt. Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean women's movement was kicked off with the formation of the Anti-Japanese Women's Association by Kang Pan Sok under the guidance of the President in his early days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The precious tradition and historical roots of the Korean women's movement were provided by Kim Il Sung in the crucible of the anti-Japanese struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He personally worked out and promulgated Law on Sex Equality in the wake of the founding of the Democratic Women's Union of Korea after liberation, thus realizing the long-cherished desire of the women.

The glorious history of the above-said movement and its stirring reality today would be unthinkable without the wise guidance of Kim Jong Il and his meticulous care.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Incomparably noble are the ideological and moral traits of the Korean women in the era of Songun led by him. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Minju Joson calls upon all the women to more dynamically wage the all-out charge for building a thriving nation full of faith in sure victory and optimism and thus demonstrate the revolutionary spirit of the Korean women grown up under the care of the President and Kim Jong Il."
