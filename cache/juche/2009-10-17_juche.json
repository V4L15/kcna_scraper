Esto es la demanda de la epoca y la aspiracion de todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Resultara absurdo el intento de invertir la corriente de la epoca induciendo en error la opinion publica mediante actos provocativos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El periodico Minju Joson enfatiza que aunque las fuerzas belicistas del Sur de Corea y EE.UU. se valen de todos los medios y metodos para volver a llevar al empeoramiento las relaciones Norte-Sur que entraron en el camino de normalizacion, no podran detener por nada la corriente de la epoca hacia la reconciliacion, la colaboracion, la paz y la reunificacion."
