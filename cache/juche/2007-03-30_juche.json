            "content": "Japan's Crimes in Drafting \"Comfort Women\" for Imperial Army Condemned \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 29 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries are trying hard to cover up their past crimes in drafting \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army, claiming that there is no evidence of forcible drafting of a great number of \"comfort women\".  The claim is arousing great indignation at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The victims whose chastity and the bloom of youth were violated by the Japanese imperialists are venting their anger to the shameless and gangster-like Japanese. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kwak Kum Nyo residing at Sindong-ri of Tanchon City, South Hamgyong Province, said: In 1939 when I was 16 years old, Japanese scoundrels cheated and took me and 14 other girls to \"Mengying\" in a border area between the former Soviet Union and Manchuria some 28 kilometers off from the Mudanjiang of China, being escorted by Japanese soldiers.  We were forced upon shameful life as \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army at military barracks for one and a half years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She condemned the brazen-faced and gangster-like assertion of the Japanese reactionaries as extra-large inhuman crimes the Japanese imperialists committed in an organized way by setting in motion their government authority and military force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kun Suk and two others were spoils of the \"girl-hunting\" of the Japanese police in a park in Seoul in 1938. They were taken to Shenyang of China (Fengtian of Manchuria at that time) to be imposed on the life of \"comfort women\".  Kim Kun Suk said that such atrocity was a crime perpetrated not by pimps but by the then Japanese authorities in an organized way.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese Seiji Yoshida, one of the chiefs of the drafting teams, also disclosed the forcible drafting of the \"comfort women\" for the imperial Japanese army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recollecting the forcible drafting, he confessed: We \"did not conscript the 'comfort women' but forcibly arrested them\".  He confessed that he was a \"slave hunter\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He further said to this effect:  Going round villages, they put healthy women irrespective of girls and house-wives on trucks by kicking and threatening them at the point of bayonet.  The number of the \"comfort women\" walked away forcibly by himself exceeded 1,000. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The survivors of the \"comfort women\" unanimously demand that the issue of the sexual slaves should be settled without fail though many years have passed and Abe group give up the efforts to avoid the responsibility but immediately apologize and compensate for the crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, the Japanese reactionaries' crime-woven history against the Korean people can neither be effaced nor distorted.     \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is popular among readers. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is based on a famous patriotic general Choe Yong who dedicated his whole life to the struggle for defending the country at the close of Koryo(918-1392). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The internal and external situation of the country was very complex owing to the incessant invasion of Japanese pirate raiders and foreign forces and interference in the internal affairs by big countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Choe Yong increased the defense capabilities of the country in every way to beat back foreign invaders and mercilessly punished corrupt officials blinded for power and wealth and traitors to safeguard the security of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, who had earned fame as a famous general from his youth, volunteered to the battlefields in spite of his age of over sixty and won one victory after another in battles.\r\n His exploits permeated with his indomitable will and efforts, however, were brought to naught by the traitorous and careerist Ri Song Gye group. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The novel, through historical facts, artistic fiction and vivid delineation and various characters, gives the truth of history that in order to defend the country, it is imperative to cultivate a strong national power and the serious lesson that vigilance should be always kept against traitors and they should not be tolerated in the least.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
