This can not be construed otherwise than a deep-seated desperate effort to challenge the times and history to the last. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara's hooliganism at the international meeting was by no means limited to his personal conduct but reflects the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces' wild ambition to revive militarism and ultra-nationalism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that such a guy as Ishihara is still allowed to strut as an official politician and his provocative utterances and behaviours are overlooked in Japan and a political environment is created for him to expand the theatre of his activities to the international arena though the world has entered the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All these go to clearly prove that Japan is not likely to be a member of the international community in the new century, either. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those wild remarks of Ishihara swimming against the trend of history only increase the international community's awareness of the Japanese reactionaries' moves to revive militarism and heighten its vigilance against Japan keen on overseas expansion.    \r\n\r\n"
