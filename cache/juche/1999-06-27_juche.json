It has not yet broken with the bad habit, though.   We consider this humiliating diplomacy as a foolish act reminiscent of a drowning man catching at a straw.\r\n   It is more absurd of the Japanese authorities to think we may lend an ear to somebody's words.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK deems independence its life and soul. We flatly reject what others say, if it violates our sovereignty and if it offends us. \r\n   Our dignity and sovereignty remain unchanged, not affected by what a big country or a small country says.\r\n   No one can undermine such a stand of ours. \r\n   What must be called into question in northeast Asia is not \"missile launch\" by the DPRK, but Japan's attempts at overseas aggression. \r\n\r\n"

Unlimited is our merciless retaliation against the provocateurs and aggressors. The South Korean war-thirsty elements are well advised to stop going berserk, clearly mindful who their rival is. This strong warning comes in a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun today lashing out at the warlords of South Korea for their anti-north war agitation made at the recent \"meeting of major commanders of the army.\"    They were reported to have repeated their absurd assertion about \"northern limit line,\" crying for the \"strengthened combat posture\" and \"sternly dealing with\" someone's \"provocations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Dismissing what the war hawks uttered, failing to draw a proper lesson from the west sea incident as disgusting, the commentary goes on: This incident was entirely attributable to the South Korean bellicose elements' intrusion into our inviolable territorial waters and their military provocations against us. The waters where this clash occurred indisputable belong to our territorial waters both in the light of the armistice agreement and the practice so far followed since the truce. This notwithstanding, the South Korean war hawks unilaterally set the so-called \"northern limit line\" which nobody recognizes.
