The \"government\" authorities and prosecution, police, conservative media and ultra-right organizations ran wild with a wholesale campaign for \"eliminating followers of the north\" and \"witch hunt\", pursuant to her order.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This was, indeed, despicable sycophancy and treachery of the group of traitors and the hysteric fit of those obsessed with confrontation with fellow countrymen in the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What Kim Ki Jong did deserves admiration of all people as it reflected the mindset of the south Korean public which denounced the U.S. war maniacs who posed a serious threat to peace and security on the Korean peninsula and blocked national reunification through their nuclear war drills targeting the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group of traitors' act of demanding heavy penalty for the fair-minded south Korean by labeling him \"an anti-U.S. element\" and \"terrorist\" is the worst act as treachery punishes patriotism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such reality in which action against war and the U.S. is incriminated and just revenge-seekers are branded as criminals goes to clearly prove that the Park group is, indeed, the U.S. war servants and hordes of traitors hell-bent on the confrontation with fellow compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is Park Geun Hye who should be punished by the nation for bringing the dark clouds of a nuclear war to hang over the land of Korea while keeping the U.S. aggression forces in south Korea for an indefinite period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the puppet group works hard to quell the south Korean people's anti-U.S. and anti-war sentiment, the second and third Kim Ki Jong will appear to mete out severer punishment to the U.S. imperialist aggressors and the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean people from all walks of life should bring down the society where the traitors punish the patriots as soon as possible and mete out a stern punishment to Park Geun Hye hell-bent on the war drills targeting the DPRK in collusion with outsiders."

En adhesion a la traidora Park, las autoridades \"gubernamentales\" y los sirvientes del poder como la fiscalia, la policia, los medios de prensa conservadores y las entidades ultraderechistas del Sur de Corea se entregaron a la campana de eliminacion de \"fuerzas pro-Norte\" y a la \"caza de bruja\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una histerica locura vendepatria y pronorteamericana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa conducta de Kim Ki Jong fue una accion de justicia a ser aplaudida por todo el mundo y refleja el sentimiento de la poblacion surcoreana contra EE.UU. que amenaza gravemente la paz y la seguridad de la Peninsula Coreana e impide la reunificacion de la patria librando los ejercicios de guerra nuclear anti-RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, la camarilla traidora de Park Geun-hye condeno la pena dura al morador justiciero tildandole de \"hombre antiyanqui\" y \"terrorista\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto significa que la traicion a la patria sentencia el patriotismo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo vemos, en la sociedad surcoreana se consideran como crimenes las acciones contra los yanquis y la guerra y por la paz y se tildan de criminales los vengadores justicieros. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad demuestra claramente que la banda traidora de Park Geun-hye es la de sirvientes de guerra de EE.UU. y maniacos de confrontacion fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPark Geun-hye es la criminal a ser castigada por la nacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuanto mas los traidores surcoreanos se desesperen por frenar el clima antiyanqui y anti-guerra de la poblacion surcoreana, tanto mas se aumentaran el numero de vengadores como Kim Ki Jong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes surcoreanos deben revolcar cuanto antes la sociedad injusta y sentenciar a la traidora Park Geun-hye que recurre a los ejercicios belicos anti-RPDC en adhesion a las fuerzas extranjeras."
