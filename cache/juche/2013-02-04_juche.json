Lee said that the \"post of the chairman of the Broadcasting and News Agency Committee is 100 times more important than that of the director of the Intelligence Service\". Choe was thrown into prison being censured by the public as \"Goebbels of MB\" and \"chief of broadcasting and news agency\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the period of Lee's office, the south Korean media have become more conservative and reptile, and the ultra-right media took the lead in escalating confrontation with fellow countrymen.
