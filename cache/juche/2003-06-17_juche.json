It adopted a statement demanding an immediate stop to the special inspection of the remittance to the north which goes against the nation, reunification and historical responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This special inspection prompted by the intrigues of the United States and the \"Grand National Party\" to scrap the joint declaration serves as an obstacle as it is aimed to serve the purpose of the U.S. hostile policy toward the north and block the unity of the nation, the statement said, branding the special inspection as a total negation of the joint declaration and an anti-national and anti-reunification action to suppress national reconciliation and cooperation by invoking the evil law of the old era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the special inspection team takes a legal action, going against the willingness of the Korean nation to preserve and implement the joint declaration, it will face the judgment of the history and nation, the statement warned.    \r\n\r\n"

Latest war equipment committed to the Iraqi war are being deployed in South Korea. One apache helicopter wing envisaged in the \"current plan for arms buildup\" flew into South Korea. It attracts our attention that the U.S. military bosses openly said the plan is intended to destroy the front of someone in case of \"emergency\" in the Korean Peninsula and advance straight toward Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suggests that the U.S. military action against North Korea will not be an \"optical precision attack\" on its strategic objects but be an overall preemptive attack war. Herein lies the gravity of the \"arms buildup\" moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since it has been made clear that the U.S. is steadily putting into practice its moves to stifle the DPRK, we can never remain a passive onlooker to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the aggressors dare amount a preemptive attack, we will wipe them out with an unpredictable and limitless strike.    \r\n"

Contained in the chapter are articles on the meaning and characteristics of names of various countries and on the names of the clans and tribes in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapter 2 gives scientific data on Kojoson  (ancient Korea) and its byname and the names of its tributaries Puyo, Kuryo and Jinguk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kojoson, which made its appearance as the first state in the Korean history, existed from the early 30th century b.c to 108 b.c. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Puyo and Kuryo were separated from Kojoson in around 14th century b.c. and Jinguk before 12th century b.c. Puyo existed until 219 b.c., Kuryo until 277 b.c. and Jinguk until 8 a.d. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapter 3 contains articles on Koguryo (277 b.c.-668 a.d), Paekje (the late 1st century b.c. - 660 a.d.), Silla (the beginning or middle of the 1st century- 935), Kaya (the middle of the 1st century - the middle of the 6th century) and Palhae, successor to Koguryo (the end of the 7th century-the early 10th century) and  Koryo (918-1392). There are also articles on the origin of the name \"Korea\" and on Joson (Korea) -- Ri dynasty (1392-1910). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Carried in chapter 4 are historical facts on how Joson was renamed kingdom of Korea (1897-1910). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Chapter 5 introduces the Democratic People's Republic of Korea founded on September 9, Juche 37 (1948) and the popular character of its nomenclature and mission of the republic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n President Kim Il Sung put forward the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo to put an end to the split of the country and the nation imposed upon the Korean people by outside forces and to reunify the country in conformity with the will and aspiration of the nation.
