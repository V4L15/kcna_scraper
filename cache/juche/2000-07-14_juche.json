They had lived for many years as one nation, strengthening its identity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to defend their national identity as a homogeneous nation and independently carve out its destiny, the Korean people should join the severed blood ties of the nation as one and regain its identity as a homogenous one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Strong driving force of the nation should be built up to reunify the country. To this end, it is important to achieve the great unity of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Great national unity should be achieved on the principle of national independence. Only then, is it possible for the Korean nation to become true master of its destiny and a great motive and decisive force for the reunification and prosperity of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As the trend of the times can hardly be stemmed, nothing can break the Korean nation's will for unity and reunification. \r\n\r\n"

It underwent repairs several times afterwards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The gate is made up of the substructure and the two-storied pavilion resting on it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The substructure, 7.6 m in height, was laid with trimmed granite blocks with arched gateway, 4.4 m in width and 4.55 m in height, in its middle part. The front of the gateway used to be barred by a solid wooden gate reinforced with rows of iron rivets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The pavilion is a loft building with crane-shaped roof of double eaves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As a gateway opening out to the northwest of the walled city of Pyongyang, the Pothong Gate was of great importance throughout the periods of the Koguryo, Koryo and Li dynasties because it occupied a vital situation both from the standpoint of national defence and of day-to-day traffic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In 1592 when the Imjin patriotic war was fought the Korean people and soldiers dashed in through the gate and dealt a crushing blow to the enemy troops, liberating the walled city. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Solid and elegant in its architectural style, the gate adds to the scenic beauty of its surrounding areas. From olden times the gate has been called a gate to send off guests and prized by the people as one of the eight famous sights of Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ancient Pothong Gate is in good shape thanks to the nation's policy to preserve the cultural relics. \r\n\r\n"
