This dangerous arms buildup stepped up by the U.S. behind the curtain of dialogue gives lie to its oft-repeated idle chatter about dialogue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean peninsula is inching close to the dangerous nuclear war and a big stumbling block lies in the way for independent national reunification due to the Bush forces' adventurous schemes despite the DPRK's sincere efforts for a peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality in which the U.S. military high-handedness and its moves to launch a nuclear war are getting all the more reckless makes it incumbent upon all the Koreans to achieve national cooperation in order to defend the destiny of the nation and give spurs to the cause of the peace and reunification of the country. The north and the south should pool efforts to prevent a nuclear war and defend peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out in an anti-U.S. and patriotic sacred war to give a decisive rebuff to the U.S. imperialists' arms buildup and force the aggression troops out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary urges the U.S. to clearly see the Korean nation's will to achieve national independence, peace and reunification by fighting it out and stop at once its harebrained deployment of sophisticated weapons for a nuclear war against the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

After the exposure of the \"presidential election fund\" scandals the veiled strife between Choe Pyong Ryol and Ri Hoe Chang groups at each other's throats has become fiercer in the GNP. It is obvious that those who fell out of Choe Pyong Ryol's favor for this or that reason can not be nominated for candidacy by the party. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a disgusting act that can be done only by fellows dead to shame to praise this move as something indicating \"the change of the times\" and \"a beautiful chapter\". It is needless to say that this is a crafty trick to calm the reaction of the persons concerned and win popular sentiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP clan should dissolve the party and disappear from the political scene as demanded by the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a reflection of the unshakable will and faith of the heroic Korean people and youth to defend socialism, the ideal of humankind and a symbol of justice and progress, and achieve victory, the statement said, adding: The World Federation of Democratic Youth and all the progressive youth and students worldwide fully support this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sh. D.

This is a valuable review of the historic struggle waged over the past decade, the editorial says, calling on all the Party members, servicepersons of the Korean People's Army and the people to give fuller play to the might of the single-hearted unity to conduct a dynamic revolutionary offensive on the three fronts of building a great prosperous powerful nation and thus glorify this year as a year of a great turn, a year of a proud victory to be recorded forever in the history of the Party and revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the single-hearted unity should be given full play in devotedly implementing the intention of leader Kim Jong Il, the editorial says, stressing that it is his determination and will to conduct an all-out offensive on the three fronts of politics and ideology, anti-imperialism and military affairs and economy and science, so as to make the whole country resound with the drum beating of the Songun revolution and bring earlier a bright future of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a disposition of the Korean army and people to flatten even a mountain and go through thick and thin if they are called upon to do so by the Party and the leader. This is the proud picture of the single-heartedly united people of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to demonstrate the might of the single-hearted unity by the Songun political mode, the editorial calls on all the people to wage a struggle in a do-or-die and offensive spirit and in a big and bold way as required by the mode.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So they, seized with defeatism, turned renegades or surrendered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people and army won a great victory in the struggle to devotedly defend socialism in the last decade of the last century because they fought resolutely against the allied forces of U.S.-led imperialism with invincible revolutionary faith. Immutable is their faith to fight out U.S. imperialism and win a certain victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The confrontation with the U.S. requires strong faith. One can defend the dignity of the country and the nation and emerge victorious in the end when he has strong faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Korean army and people are waging a valiant struggle on the forefront of the struggle against imperialism and the U.S., overcoming manifold difficulties with the revolutionary faith. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a serious lesson taught by the present revolutionary situation that one will fall if one lacks faith and one will emerge victorious if one has strong faith.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It contains 20.6 percent of crude protein, 54.6 percent of essential amino acid and physiological active substances. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Hamgyong Province has already built a mycoprotein feed producer and supplied large quantities of the feed to different fish farms.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
