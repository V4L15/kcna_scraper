It expounds the idea of achieving independent reunification through reconciliation and close unity of the Korean nation, the master of national reunification, rejecting foreign forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the banner of \"By our nation itself\", the Korean nation is confidently carrying on the struggle for great unity without vacillation and frustration in face of internal and external challenges and ordeals of every description. All these are a brilliant fruition of the great idea of the great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the wise leadership of leader Kim Jong Il, the historic Pyongyang meeting, the first of its kind in the history of national division, was realized and the June 15 joint declaration adopted. This opened a new era of independent national reunification in which the reconciliation and unity of the nation are becoming a living reality at a new higher stage under the banner of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fellow countrymen of Korea are overflowing with the conviction and optimism that independent reunification is sure to be achieved by the great unity of the whole nation, for they have the great idea and line of the great national unity and hold in high esteem the brilliant commander of the Songun revolution at the head of the nation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "GNP's Desperate Moves to Keep NSL in Force under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 18 (KCNA) -- The ultra-right conservative forces including the Grand National Party of south Korea have turned the National Assembly into a platform of scramble between the ruling and opposition parties and a centre for fanning up confrontation with the north. The anti-reform moves of the ultra-right conservatives have placed the elementary democracy won by the south Koreans at the cost of blood in the danger of being trampled down upon. Rodong Sinmun Thursday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that the issue of abolishing the \"National Security Law,\" a unanimous demand of the south Koreans from all walks of life, has failed to find a solution due to their desperate moves, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their desperate opposition to the repeal of the NSL is an intolerable mockery of the destiny and future of the south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the south Koreans except a few ultra-right conservatives within the GNP who support the U.S. in its acts against national reunification are falling victim to the draconic NSL. This clearly proves that the NSL is a leftover of the old times which should have already been eradicated and that if this law is allowed to remain in force the north-south confrontation will further deteriorate to spark nothing but a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes without saying that neither dialogue nor national cooperation nor the independent reunification of the country is possible with the NSL remaining in force as it designates the north as an \"anti-state organization\" and the northerners an \"enemy\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean ultra-right conservatives' desperate efforts to keep the NSL in force are aimed to justify their fascist suppression and their moves to escalate the confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The patriotic-minded people in south Korea should go united to completely deter the GNP from desperately working to bring back the old era of confrontation.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

When inspecting the construction site of the Nyongwon Power Station, he told officials that the behests of the President should be implemented without fail. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has continued his Songun-based leadership, saying that he should go anywhere, if it is for the implementation of the President's behests, and that doing so is his unswerving will and invariable creed as he took over the chairmanship of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK and the supreme commandership from the President. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through his uninterrupted inspection of army units he has strengthened the army to be a strong revolutionary army defending the leader at the cost of their lives and an invincible army no enemy can match. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Signal successes have been registered in science and the economy, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTypical of them are the launch of artificial satellite Kwangmyongsong No.1, completion of Juche-oriented iron-making methods, successful cloning, construction of the Anbyon Youth Power Station, Youth Hero Highway and Pyongyang-Hyangsan Tourist Motorway, modern chicken farms and fish farms and standardization of co-op fields.   \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
