            "content": "Japan's Inhuman Legislation under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The Japanese reactionaries' retrogressive revision of the \"law on foreign exchange\" is an unpardonable hostile action taken by them against the DPRK and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon), pursuant to the U.S. imperialists' hostile policy towards the DPRK, as it is aimed to suffocate the DPRK economically and block the free economic activities of Koreans in Japan. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary.\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan adopted economic sanctions against the DPRK as a state policy and is now working hard to put it into practice. This clearly indicates what a grave phase the Japanese right-wing reactionary forces' hostile policy towards the DPRK and their suppressive policy towards Chongryon and Koreans in Japan have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are working hard to introduce the \"bill banning the portcall of specified ships\" in a bid to prevent Mangyongbong-92 and other DPRK ships from entering the Japanese ports. This is also prompted by their base attempt to deprive the Koreans in Japan of their right to visit the homeland in freedom and break the blood ties between people in the DPRK and Koreans in Japan at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries' retrogressive revision of the \"law on foreign exchange\" and \"bill banning the portcall of specified ships\" are, indeed, the most vicious and inhuman brutal actions that can be committed only by those lunatics steeped in hostility and consciousness of confrontation towards the DPRK to the marrow of their bones. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately give up their anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves, bearing in mind that their persistent reckless acts against the DPRK will touch off bitterer resentment of the Korean people at Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

National cooperation is, indeed, the way of bringing earlier independent reunification and common prosperity of the nation.\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the Korean nation which most eagerly wants peace and reunification of the country and it is the party concerned which has the capability to achieve them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation must resolutely reject the domination and interference of outside forces and \"cooperation\" with them and firmly maintain all the time the stand of national independence. It must not deviate from the principle of solving all the issues by the concerted efforts of the nation. It must also put the nation in the foreground and actively seek national cooperation with the view that the Korean nation is the best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the fellow countrymen should block off the danger of war brought by outside forces, defend peace of the country and national security and invigorate the struggle for achieving independent reunification by national cooperation under the banner of the Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The structure of confrontation on the Korean peninsula today is that between the entire Korean nation and the United States. All the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas through national cooperation should decisively smash the U.S. moves to stifle the DPRK and provoke a new war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is the key also to the movement for reconciliation, cooperation and independent reunification. The process of national reconciliation, cooperation and reunification can be promoted at an accelerated pace only when all the Koreans firmly defend the idea of \"By our nation itself\" specified in the June 15 joint declaration and strengthen national cooperation according to this idea. All the fellow countrymen should continue to carry forward the work for north-south reconciliation and mutual assistance and vigorously pave a wide avenue for independent reunification without interruption by national cooperation, not heeding what others say. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If all the fellow countrymen definitely realize national cooperation according to the idea of \"By our nation itself\", a great proposition of independent reunification, they can surely ensure a stable peace on the Korean peninsula and bring earlier independent reunification.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This vividly shows that the Japanese reactionaries are the local agents and special class servants in implementing the U.S. strategy to dominate Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's blind pursuance of the U.S. policy would never be in the interests of Japan. That will only touch off bitterer hatred of the Korean army and people against Japan and disclose to the international community Japan's vulgar political and diplomatic stance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should wake up from absurd illusion and drop at once their anachronistic and unrealistic policy of toeing the U.S. line.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Reckless Ambition for World Supremacy -KCNA News Analyst's Article -\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, February 24 (KCNA) -- The United States is pushing ahead with the reorganization of the U.S. forces and the establishment of a missile defence system.\r\n The U.S. reorganization plan includes the readjustment of its military installations across the world, access to hotspots, formation of a task force with an increased capacity of long-distance sophisticated strike and the establishment of its commanding system. It is aimed to easily seize regions with strategic resources and areas of political and military importance by launching a forestalling attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to the U.S. Defence Department's annual report for 2003 \"Structure of Bases\", the United States, which is keeping about 702 military installations in about 130 countries and some 6,000 in its mainland and colonies, is planning to build new bases for the U.S. forces' access to targets of strategic importance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States thinks that through the readjustment and expansion of military bases, it will be able to tighten the encirclement ring around the major powers in the Asia-Pacific region which was formed after the Afghan and Iraqi wars, heighten the speed of attack on targets of invasion and blockade and control other countries' involvement as it wishes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States, under the pretext of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula and diversified \"security threat\", has intensified arms buildup in the region. It also plans to reshape the operational commanding system into a wartime one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Washington Times February 3 said the U.S. Defence Department was going ahead with the extensive reorganization of the Pacific Command and it seemed that a post of a four-star general commanding all the forces including the south Korea-based U.S. Command and the \"Combined Command\" would be established in south Korea and an army headquarters commanded by a three-star general set up in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day a spokesman for the U.S. Air Force announced that about six B-52s and hundreds of crewmen would be sent to Guam from the mainland, while officials of the Defence Department said other bombers could also be sent to the Pacific region in the future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reorganization of the U.S. forces in the Asia-Pacific region indicates that the danger of a new war is ever increasing on the Korean peninsula and its vicinity in view of the bellicose foreign policy of the U.S. administration and the Afghan and Iraqi wars. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, the United States has persistently pushed ahead with the establishment of a missile defence system, which has already been condemned, wrecking the strategic stability of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. Defence Department is planning to deploy the first elements of the missile defence system in Alaska this summer several months ahead of the schedule. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is envisaged that six interceptor missiles will be installed in underground hangars in Alaska in May and June and an early warning radar station will be set up on Aleutian Islands in around July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States plans to deploy another ten interceptor missiles and some ten Aegis sea-launched missiles in Alaska next year and, at the same time, build a sea-based radar station and recondition the radar system in the territory of Britain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. plans concerning the reorganization of its forces and the establishment of a missile defence system, which threaten peace and stability in the international community, will spark off another arms race and cause confrontation, contradiction and disputes in international relations for the control of strategic resources.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a great success made in the implementation of the rural theses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called for thoroughly implementing the theses as required by the Songun era to glorify Kim Il Sung's idea of socialist rural construction and his exploits for all ages. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agricultural workers should absolutely follow and thoroughly implement the Songun idea based on the Juche idea, the reporter noted, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main task for solving the rural question at present is to bring about a signal turn in agricultural production and technology. The agricultural productive structure of the country should be boldly improved on the principle of a right crop to the right soil and a right crop in the right time as required by the Juche-based method of farming, a radical turn be effected in seed selection and in potato farming and double-cropping be developed on a large scale on the basis of latest science and technology to decisively increase the grain production. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sustained great efforts should be channeled into to the land realignment and the construction of nature-driven waterways be energetically pushed forward in various areas to complete the nation's irrigation system in conformity with the need of the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agro-scientific and technological revolution should be stepped up in keeping with the trend of development in the new century to industrialize, modernize and scientize agriculture and realize its comprehensive mechanization as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all the agricultural workers to implement the theses to the letter, bring about a radical boost in agricultural production and overall socialist rural construction and thus make a positive contribution to glorifying the 21st century as a century of Kim Jong Il.   \r\n\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
