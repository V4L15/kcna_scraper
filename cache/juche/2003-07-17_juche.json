The U.S. should properly understand the will of the Korean nation to fight the U.S. and achieve reunification.    \r\n\r\n"

This clearly reveals its sinister intention to go for north-south confrontation and a war unhindered at the backstage manipulation of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that the GNP is a group of unpardonable traitors and pro-U.S. flunkeyists who go against the desire of the nation for reconciliation, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says the GNP would be well advised to behave with discretion, cogitating about the grave consequences to be entailed by its pro-U.S. treacherous act and its moves to incite inter-Korean confrontation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. urged to make switchover in its Korea policy \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 16 (KCNA) -- U.S. Secretary of State Powell described the DPRK's exercise of right to self-defence as \"bad behavior\", saying that the U.S. will not reward it.\r\n Dismissing such remarks as naive and ridiculous, Rodong Sinmun today says in a commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently, Powell said that the U.S. call for \"North Korea's scrapping of its nuclear program first\" and \"multilateral talks\" enjoys broad-based \"support\" of the international community and that the U.S. would not reward somebody's bad behavior. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We declare once again that the DPRK's possession of nuclear deterrent force is a very just self-defensive measure intended not to get any reward from the U.S. but to cope with its hostile policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK made flexible and innovative, new proposals to hold the bilateral talks first and then the U.S.-proposed multilateral talks. They are the most realistic and just proposals that took into consideration the origin of the nuclear issue between the two countries, the present situation, a solution to the issue and even the U.S. \"concerns\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. has turned down the bilateral talks, insisting on the \"scrapping of the nuclear program first\" and talking about \"effectiveness\" of the multilateral talks. This behavior is of no help to the solution of the issue but will complicate it, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should accept the DPRK's flexible proposal for holding the bilateral talks before the multilateral talks in order to find a reasonable solution to the issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A key to settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. is for the U.S. to respond to the bilateral talks with the will to make a switchover in its hostile policy towards the DPRK. without such measure, any form of talks would be fruitless and meaningless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. truly hopes for a peaceful solution to the issue, there will be neither reason nor pretext for it to shun the bilateral talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is well advised to come out to the talks, properly understanding the nature and peculiarities of the issue and the reality.    \r\n\r\n"
