But this will prove futile in face of the concerted efforts of the Korean nation to implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration regarding it as the only weapon for carving out the destiny of the nation.\r\nRodong Sinmun Sunday says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation is a sure guarantee for protecting peace on the Korean Peninsula and successfully paving the way for the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence, the principle of strongly opposing flunkeyism and dependence on outsiders, represents the main spirit of national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The principle of national independence is the master key to settling the national issue. Peace and reunification on the Korean Peninsula should be achieved at any cost by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation as the master responsible for them because they are an issue related to its sovereignty and destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No illusion and dependence on outsiders should be allowed. They only lead to national ruin. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an essential prerequisite to national cooperation to achieve the great unity of the whole nation based on the love for the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Koreans place the love for the country and the nation, the common denominator of a homogenous nation, above anything else and get united based on it irrespective of ideology and system, it is possible to realize effective cooperation among Koreans whereby they can defeat any formidable enemy in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation calls for unity based on the love for the country and the nation with the principle of national independence as its main spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis provides a sure guarantee for protecting peace and security of the nation and successfully conducting the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation means independence, peace and reunification. Whoever loves the country and the nation and is concerned about their destiny should unite as one irrespective of ideology, political view, religious belief, class and social strata and abode.    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

S. is perpetrating high-handed and arbitrary practices in various parts of the world quite contrary to the common desire of humankind to live in a peaceful and stable world, he noted the reality proves that one's own strong military power alone can protect the destiny of one's country and nation and guarantee social stability and development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed the belief that the visit of the delegation would mark an important occasion in putting the bilateral state and military ties on a new higher level. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Amama Mbabazi in his speech expressed thanks to Supreme Commander of the KPA Kim Jong Il, general secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea and chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK, for having given assistance, material and moral, to Uganda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that no nation can exist without armed forces for self-defence, adding that Uganda has positively supported the stand of the DPRK on increasing its defence capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed solidarity with the Korean army and people in their struggle to achieve the reunification of the country, hoping that the exchange and cooperation between the two countries would grow stronger.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The \"UN Forces Command\" in south Korea, however, let loose balderdash that those nations which signed the 1953 armistice agreement would restore the alliance to continue to perform their role as UN peace-keeping force if the armistice agreement is scrapped and hostile acts are resumed. This reminds one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\r\n Rodong Sinmun Sunday says in a signed article in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the United States that claims its forces in south Korea are \"UN forces\" and let them go under their helmets.\r\n Those U.S. forces are a huge group of aggressors and a strangler of independence and democracy and a wrecker of peace. \r\n The U.S. imperialists have desperately worked to perpetuate the division of Korea and ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has resorted to vicious obstructive moves to bar the DPRK government's proposals for reunification from being materialized. The U.S. forces in south Korea have staged frantic exercises for a war of aggression, deliberately straining the situation in Korea. The Bush forces, in particular, have worked hard to lay an international siege to the DPRK and isolate and stifle it, vociferating about its \"nuclear and missile threat\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Decades have passed since the adoption of the UN resolution calling for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea but the U.S. has not yet implemented it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is a heinous enemy of independence and peace as it has left no means untried to carry out its policy of war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is preposterous for the Bush bellicose forces to try to justify their policy to perpetuate their military presence in south Korea and stifle the DPRK while talking about the \"nuclear threat\" from it .It is a blatant challenge to justice and peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The statement said:\r\n The U.S. has so far hindered its construction by hook or by crook but it is the first time that officials concerned of its government openly let loose a string of nonsensical remarks intended to obstruct the project and pressurized south Korea to adjust the tempo of the project depending on the prospect of settling the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves were prompted by its great displeasure with the fact that the project is set to enter the phase of full-scale construction soon despite the whole gamut of its obstructions and by its sinister aim to woo south Korea to earnestly join in implementing the hard-line policy it has pursued toward the DPRK over the nuclear issue and the human rights issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n .The U.S. is not entitled to say this or that about what the Koreans build on their land, the statement said, urging all the Koreans to be vigilant against the U.S. high-handed moves for domination and interference. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called upon all the Koreans in the north and the south to turn out in the anti-U.S. struggle to defend the dignity and the sovereignty of the nation under the uplifted banner of the June 15 joint declaration and decisively deter the U.S. from obstructing the construction of the zone for the present.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
