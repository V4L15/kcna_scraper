            "content": "KCNA on U.S. anti-DPRK smear campaign \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The U.S. congressional investigation bureau, in a report on South Korea-U.S. relations recently submitted to the congress, claimed that the DPRK \"used\" for a military purpose the money, which was paid for the Mt. Kumgang tourism. This is one more anti-DPRK smear campaign.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The political motive and aim of the report are clear as it has been based on information faked up by the U.S. CIA and the U.S. forces command in South Korea. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a word, such diatribe is part of the evermore undisguised anti-DPRK plot of the U.S. administration to block the implementation of the June 15 North-South Joint declaration and cooperation and exchange between the two sides of Korea. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As everyone knows, the Korean nation will soon mark the second anniversary of the joint declaration, a milestone for national reunification. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On this occasion, the people's will is growing stronger and their efforts are increasing on the Korean Peninsula to reunify the country by the united efforts of the nation in the spirit of the joint declaration. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is against this backdrop that the Bush administration has escalated its smear campaign against the DPRK and wirepulled the intelligence agency and the military to spread misinformation to justify the campaign. This indicates its sinister political aim. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Through this the administration seeks, in the long run, to justify its intention to provoke a new war on the Korean Peninsula, quell the South Korean people's desire to achieve independence against the U.S. and force the South Korean authorities to purchase more U.S.-made weapons. It is also aimed to foil the Mt. Kumgang tourism, a symbol of inter-Korean cooperation, and thus bedevil the relations between the North and the south of Korea. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard, the DPRK has repeatedly warned the U.S. that it should behave itself with reason. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the U.S. continues resorting to such smear campaign to hinder the implementation of the inter-Korean joint declaration and cooperation and exchange between the north and the south of Korea, while insisting on the anachronistic hostile policy towards the DPRK in disregard of its warnings, it will only touch off a stronger anti-U.S. sentiment of the Korean people.   \r\n"

            "content": "Japan's redress for its past urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 8 (KCNA) -- The reactionary media and ultra-right forces in Japan are keeping mum about the issue of redeeming its past crimes, a core issue related to improving the DPRK-Japan relations, while raising a hue and cry over the fictitious issue of \"kidnapping\" by the DPRK.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Japanese reactionaries' much ado about \"kidnapping\" is of no help to improving the bilateral relations. If Japan truly wishes improved relations between the DPRK and Japan it should pay a due attention to the issue of redressing its past crimes, a prerequisite to improving the DPRK-Japan relations, and take an honest approach to the issue. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan's settlement of its past is a key issue related to the improved bilateral relations. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Therefore, the DPRK-Japan relations can never improve unless Japan apologizes and compensates to the Korean people for its crime-woven past. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPRK neither has vital interests in the improved relations with Japan nor pins any hope on it. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It is the legitimate right of the DPRK to get an apology and compensation from Japan. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The DPRK's demand for Japan's redress for its past is by no means an economic and business-like matter of making it pay a petty amount of money. It is a crucial political issue related to the Korean nation's protection of its dignity and the exercise of its sovereign right. It is the unanimous will of the Korean people to employ every possible means and method to force Japan to redeem its past crimes in the present generation. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Japan is well advised to make a bold political decision to settle its past as early as possible, keenly aware of the serious nature of the issue.\r\n"

And he was reelected Chairman of the DPRK National Defence Commission at the first session of the 10th Supreme People's Assembly at which the authority and position were increased to meet the requirements of the developing revolution. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Senior party and state officials were present at the meeting.\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Vice Marshal of the Korean People's Army Kim Yong Chun, member of the DPRK National Defence Commission and chief of the general staff of the KPA, made a report at the meeting. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporter said that with Kim Jong Il held in high esteem as the chairman of the NDC, the Korean people have been able to greet the era of the great army-based policy and strengthen the political, military and economic forces of the country as invincible ones and thus firmly defend the dignity of the country and the sovereignty of the nation despite the stern tempest of history and dynamically push forward the socialist cause of the Juche. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporter further said: \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After singling out the policy of giving priority to national defence, the army-based policy, as the main political method of the state he has exerted primary efforts for increasing the military power and thus developed the Korean People's Army, the core of the forces for self-defence, to be invincible army. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this course he has provided a sure guarantee for ensuring the progress of the revolutionary cause of Juche by force of arms. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Under his army-based leadership and meticulous care, the KPA has grown stronger to be a contingent of loyalists who are single-heartedly united around its Supreme Commander and a-match-for-a-hundred combat ranks capable of defeating any enemy, the whole country turned into an impregnable fortress and a powerful defence industry has been built. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A strong driving force of the revolution has been built up and the single-hearted unity of the revolutionary ranks further strengthened with the KPA as the core and a model to consolidate the socio-political foundation of the country as firm as a rock. This is a distinguished feat performed by Kim Jong Il through his army-based leadership. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporter underscored the need to be fully ready to go into action to cope with the prevailing situation and strengthen our armed forces to be invincible ones. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Noting that it is the primary task facing the KPA to get fully prepared for a battle, he called upon the servicemen of the KPA to wipe out at a single blow any enemy coming to infringe upon the country's sovereignty and reliably defend the socialist motherland and the gains of the revolution. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Referring to the evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. ruling quarters to stifle the socialist system of the DPRK by force of arms, Kim Yong chun stated: the DPRK will never tolerate the U.S. extremely arrogant and high-handed provocative moves but retaliate against them a thousand times. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If the U.S. imperialists and their followers ignite a war in the end, the army and people of Korea will use the military potential they have built up by tightening their belts and give vent to the pent-up grudge and resentment and thereby wipe out the aggressors to the last one and completely destroy the enemy's stronghold no matter where it is located on earth. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He called for consistently making great efforts for the development of the nation's defence industry and thoroughly implementing the Workers' Party of Korea policy for putting all the people under arms and turning the whole country into a fortress. \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The reporter reiterated the need to remain true to the basic spirit of the historic June 15 North-South Joint Declaration, resolutely frustrate the obstructive moves of the anti-reunification forces at home and abroad and achieve as early as possible the country's reunification, the nation's cherished desire by the concerted efforts of the whole nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
