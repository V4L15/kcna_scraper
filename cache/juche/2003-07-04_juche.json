Korea under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 3 (KCNA) -- The \"final results of investigation\" conducted by the \"special inspection team\" in South Korea into what it called \"remittance to the north\" only betrayed its narrow-minded view on the nation and brought shame to it, says Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What merits a serious attention in the \"results of investigation\" is that the team deliberately linked the issue of \"remittance to the north\" to the historic Pyongyang summit meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to the June 15 Joint Declaration that the process of north-south reconciliation has made progress despite such vicious moves of the U.S. to invade the north and the \"Grand National Party\" and other political parties, organizations and people from all walks of life in South Korea have been able to escape from the disaster of war. And they still benefit from it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNo one can deny this reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The attempt to link the issue of \"remittance to the north\" to the historic Pyongyang summit meeting is a foolish act which can be committed only by those who have neither political obligation nor an iota of conscience. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"final results of investigation\" are intolerable as they are an anti-historic and treacherous action to downplay the historic significance of the Pyongyang meeting on the strength of the \"law on special inspection\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This case teaches a serious lesson that if one fails to properly judge and handle all the problems from a national stand, one will play into the hands of foreign forces and anti-reunification forces and put the inter-Korean relations into the danger of collapse. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic Pyongyang meeting recorded a brilliant page in the history of the movement for national reunification as it was a great undertaking that brought about a new turn in the movement. No one can play down its historic significance and great vitality even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"results of investigation\" are intolerable as they diametrically run counter to the vital interests of the nation.    \r\n\r\n"
