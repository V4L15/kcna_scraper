Islands in the near future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration has already mapped out a plan to take emergency measures for the use of nukes and issued an order to develop smaller nukes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n According to it, the research group under the U.S. Department of Energy will complete a design for manufacturing smaller nuclear bombs at the cost of 40-50 million US dollars in 2-3 years to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end the U.S. Senate abrogated a law that has prohibited the development of smaller nukes for the last decade, thus releasing the legal brake on the development of smaller nuclear bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that El Baradei, general director of the International Atomic Energy Agency, complained as regards the U.S. development of smaller nukes that the U.S. is working to complete the development of nukes while demanding other countries not have access to those weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is serious is that missile testfire and the development of smaller nukes by the U.S. are aimed to launch preemptive nuclear attacks and armed invasion of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. undisguised military threat and blackmail behind the screen of dialogue go to clearly prove that the U.S. does not want a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula at all but only seeks a nuclear stand-off. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. attempt to browbeat somebody with a military threat is anachronistic and foolish as it does not know who its rival is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better stop running amuck, properly understanding the firm will of the DPRK ready for both dialogue and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Independence is an avowed idea of its foreign policy. It has made strenuous efforts for its realization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has shaped and implemented its foreign policy with its independent judgement and decision. It has exerted positive efforts to firmly defend the sovereignty of the country in foreign relations, respect and protect the sovereignty of other countries and solve all the issues arising on the international arena independently in the interests of the Korean people, in the common interests of the world people and on the principle of international justice and impartiality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The independent policy of the DPRK has commanded international support and sympathy for its validity and realistic nature and demonstrated its great vitality and influence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Countries which strive to improve and boost relations with the DPRK and the number of its supporters and sympathizers are on a steady increase and international solidarity is growing stronger. This is a clear proof of the validity and the great vitality of the independent foreign policy of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Over the past 55 years the DPRK has enjoyed remarkably high international authority and prestige and steadily boosted friendly and cooperative relations with many countries of the world despite the acute and complicated international situation and the dramatic change in international relations. And the international solidarity with the Korean revolution has grown stronger. These are a clear proof of the validity and the vitality of the independent policy of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
