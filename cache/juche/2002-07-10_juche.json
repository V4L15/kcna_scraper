            "content": "Japan's moves to upgrade defense agency under fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary says that elevating the status of the Japan Defense Agency to Ministry is not just an issue of changing the name. It clearly reflects the Japanese reactionaries' ever-undisguised moves of reinvasion, the commentary says, and goes on:\r\n Now the Japanese reactionaries are seeking to largely expand the rights of the agency and establish a military system similar to that on the eve of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this way they want to realise their ambition for overseas aggression at any cost. it is also motivated by the same purpose that Japan intends to integrate the operation bodies of the chiefs of staff of the three services of the \"Self-Defense Forces\" (SDF) to put them under the control of the joint chiefs of staff of the defense agency. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries claim that these steps are necessary to cope with post-cold war \"threats.\" But this is nothing but a sheer lie to cover up their ambition for aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What they have done under the pretext of coping with \"regional disputes\" and \"threat of terrorism\" are just preparations for a war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But this choice will bring them to death. In the past the Japanese imperialists met their defeat in the war of aggression.\r\n    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA slams Japanese hypocrites' burlesque \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 10 (KCNA) -- Japanese ministers were recently reported to have agreed to donate each about 3,000 u.s. dollars to create what they called \"civilian fund\" for former \"Comfort Women for the Army\". This is fresh hypocrisy to be ridiculed by the international community.\r\n This is, therefore, an intolerable mockery of the international community demanding a thorough investigation into the crimes related to the \"comfort women for the army\" and the Japanese government's state reparation for them and a mean political burlesque peculiar to Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a stark historical fact well known to the world that before and during the second world war the Japanese imperialists sexually abused in battlefields nearly 200,000 Korean women and many other women from such various countries as china, Philippines and Indonesia and cruelly killed almost all of them before Japan's defeat. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At that time the Japanese government and military set up the disgraceful system of \"Comfort Women for the Army\" on the basis of abnormal military logic that \"soldiers' sexual desire must be gratified to sustain the war fever and the combat capability of the army.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community is so critical of Japan for the above-said crimes because they were the most barbarous and hideous crimes against humanity unprecedented in human history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These crimes should be settled on the basis of such judicial relations as \"the Japanese government being assailant and former 'Comfort Women for the Army' being victims\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was by no means fortuitous that Asahi Shimbun May 15, reporting news of the international conference held to demand Japan redress its past, noted that \"the issue of 'comfort women' was an unavoidable task along with the issue of forced drafting\" and \"It was clear that they could never be solved by creating a 'civilian fund'\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the Japanese government has become so shameless as to create a \"civilian fund\" in a bid to evade state reparation for the crimes and stage such farce of paying a petty amount of money collected from its people to a few surviving former \"comfort women\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese ministers were ridiculous enough to join such a shameful farce with a meager amount of money. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This suffices to judge Japanese politicians' political credentials and personality once again Japan is well advised to make an unconditional and honest apology to all the victims of the system of the \"Comfort Women for the Army\" and opt for instituting a law on the state reparation for the crimes, instead of clinging to such brazen-faced farce of adding to the pain of the former \"comfort women\".    \r\n\r\n"

As a result, the 30-year-old treaty has become invalid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The abrogation of the treaty is fraught with the danger of sparking a new arms race and cold war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is mainly aimed to establish the Missile Defense System (MD). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now the united states is free to push ahead with the establishment of the MD in real earnest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This situation compels not only the countries which have neither nuke nor missile but also those which have a comparatively small number of such weapons to take self-defense measures to cope with the U.S. imperialists' nuclear and missile threat. Moreover, big powers will not remain passive onlookers to the U.S. moves for the establishment of MD, but will take counter-measures against them. This will mean the advent of a new era of arms race and cold war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The repeal of the treaty is more dangerous as it was timed to coincide with the U.S. escalation of \"anti-terrorism war\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States seeks to cover the earth with a dense missile defense network through the establishment of the MD and escalate the \"anti-terrorism war\" worldwide. This will further increase the danger of a nuclear war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia will be exposed to greater danger due to the U.S. abrogation of ABM treaty and moves for the establishment of the MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is keen to ignite a nuclear war in this region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is very clear what disaster will come to Asia and the rest of the world when such a war breaks out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. abrogation of the treaty and intensified moves for the establishment of the MD are bound to have a serious impact on the world peace and security.     \r\n\r\n"
