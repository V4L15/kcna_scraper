            "content": "No to Revival of Dark Era in S. Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- On Jan. 23 the south Korean Court declared not guilty the eight persons who had been sentenced to capital punishment on charges of violation of \"emergency measure No.1,\" \"National Security Law\" and \"the anti-communist law\" and \"conspiracy of a rebellion\" after drawing the conclusion that the case of the \"Committee for the Reconstruction of the People's Revolutionary Party\" was faked up through harsh acts including torture. This court ruling once again brought to light the \"Yusin\" dictator's cruel killings of innocent people. \r\n Minju Joson Saturday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The case was a conspiratorial case in which the dictator used again the already disclosed case of \"the People's Revolutionary Party\" in a bid to stay long in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As those who were killed on charges of involvement in the above-said case were declared not guilty more than 30 years later, the Grand National Party of south Korea (GNP) has become the target of public criticism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people are now strongly demanding the GNP and the daughter of the \"Yusin\" dictator, in particular, come out to apologize for the anti-communist cases faked up in the past period of fascist dictatorship. It is quite a just assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the GNP gentry are only keen to grab power, far from uttering even a word of apology.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they are allowed to come to power, they will bring no doubt disastrous consequences to south Korea. It is as clear as a pikestaff that there will rage the same whirlwind of fascist tyranny and confrontation as what was under the \"Yusin\" dictatorship and more cases similar to the above-mentioned case will be fabricated to kill innocent people on false charges. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the only way of preventing the revival of the dark rule of fascist dictatorship to deter the descendants of the dictator from usurping power again.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Anti-DPRK Outbursts of GNP Representative Blasted\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The representative of the Grand National Party of south Korea called a \"New Year press conference\" on Jan. 26, asserting it is allegedly aimed at exercising the \"right to refute\" the \"New Year address\" made by the chief executive.\r\n He went so impudent as to serve a \"warning\" to the north, letting loose a spate of balderdash that \"the north's nukes and missiles pose a threat to the Korean Peninsula and the global peace\" and \"it is necessary to urge the north to dismantle its nukes and opt for peace as early as possible.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A news analyst of Rodong Sinmun Saturday observes in this regard: The representative of the GNP at the \"New Year press conference\" began with slandering and attacking not only the authorities of south Korea but forces for progressive reforms and, not content with this, went the lengths of pulling up and admonishing the DPRK. This was nothing but a spate of vituperation and provocative remarks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When looking back on history, peace on the Korean Peninsula has been threatened by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops and the south Korean warlike forces, the conservative forces opposed to reunification including the GNP in actuality. The above-said U.S. aggressor forces, equipped with all types of ultra-modern weapons of mass destruction including nukes, have watched for a chance to invade the north, pursuant to the U.S. policy of aggression towards the DPRK, and those trigger-happy forces of south Korea have followed the road of confrontation with the north and war, backed by the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has built up the nuclear deterrent despite all hardships, guided by the will of all its servicepersons and people for self-defence because it is possible to counter the enemy equipped with nukes with nukes only. It is a reality that the majority of the south Koreans agree with this and feel proud of the north's nuclear deterrent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The responsibility for compelling the DPRK to have access to nukes also rests with the GNP, a war servant of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Had not the military dictators who ruled south Korea before the GNP allowed the U.S. introduction of nuclear weapons to it, the issue of the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have cropped up and had not they permitted the U.S. interference and domination over south Korea while keeping its occupation forces after faking up a \"resolution on opposing the withdrawal of the U.S. forces\", the independent and peaceful reunification of the peninsula would already have come true. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now is the June 15 era for reunification. To reject pro-north people at a time when the north and the south should get reconciled and cooperate with each other to solve the issue of peace and promote co-existence and co-prosperity is like a declaration of war as it is an open negation of the north and a declaration of continued confrontation with it and a revelation of an intention to scrap the June 15 joint declaration and put an end to the June 15 era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the GNP seeks is to keep everything in Korea divided by perpetuating the territorial division and deepening the social division, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the GNP gentry who are so weak as to cling to the coattails of the aggression forces, taken aback by a mere word of independence uttered by someone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an inveterate habit of the GNP group to depend on outsiders. It feels no shame as its days are numbered. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the final analysis, the GNP gentry staged the above-said charade in a bid to win popularity under the pretext of exercising the \"right to refute\" the above-mentioned \"New Year address\" but it only brought into bolder relief their true colors as traitors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is clear from the recent press conference that the GNP has finally betrayed its ulterior intention and unsheathed its sword to hurt not only the north but the forces supporting the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is nothing but a political cartoon and an ugly conduct for the GNP, the worst party of traitors in history, to pull up others.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Hit for Using Distorted History Novel as Textbook\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 3 (KCNA) -- The United States has used as a textbook for middle school students the book authored by Japanese, a descendant of a war criminal. The book distorts the historical facts, seriously defiling the Korean nation's dignity.\r\n In this regard, a spokesman for the Central Committee of the Union of Educationists and Men of Culture of Korea released a statement on Saturday dismissing it as an intolerable insult and mockery of the Korean nation and an act of going against history and justice that is little short of painting evil as good and an assailant as a victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book \"Story of Yoko\" is an autobiography-novel written by Kawashima Yoko, daughter of a Japanese war criminal. She was 11 years old at the time of the defeat of the Japanese imperialism. The book describes as if Koreans maltreated and sexually assaulted Japanese on their way to the Japan proper. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also asserts that Japan occupied Korea, which was subject to the scramble of big powers, through such legitimate process as the \"Taft-Katsura Agreement.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. application of this distorted novel as textbook for students is designed to cover up the past crimes of Japan and mislead the public opinion to use it as a shock brigade in executing aggression and war. This brings into bolder relief the truth that the U.S. and Japan have been conspiring to launch aggression on Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad should never allow the U.S. and Japan, which cruelly violated the destiny of the Korean nation through their nexus for aggression on it a century ago, to run amuck to invade it again while burying their crime-woven past into oblivion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
