The commentary cites facts to prove how the U.S. backpedalled its commitment toprovide light water reactors to the DPRK, a basic issue of the DPRK-U.S. Agreed Framework. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has advanced a series of constructive proposals to settle the nuclear issue. But the U.S. has thrown obstacles in the way of finding a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue by persistently insisting that the DPRK scraps its nuclear program first. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nUnderlying the U.S. hue and cry over violation of commitments is a sinister aim to disarm the DPRK with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The same aim is pursued by the U.S. in seeking to orchestrate the same developments in the DPRK as what happened in some Mideast countries while shelving the solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and U.S. on the basis of its brigandish logic. What happened in those countries has nothing in common with the DPRK. The DPRK never does such a foolish thing without any principle as unfolding an umbrella looking up to blue sky simply because other countries do so. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States and some of its allies assert the U.S. may give \"written security assurances\" to the DPRK after it is disarmed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTheir assertion is little short of forcing the DPRK to drop arms and enjoy peace as slaves. The army and people of the DPRK will as ever firmly maintain its principle of national independence under the banner of Songun and get fully ready to cope with any\r\nsituation and development.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is necessary to root out any illusion about the U.S., which infringes upon the nation's dignity and right to existence, and national nihilism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation indicates a basic way of taking practical actions to build the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. and also serves as a master key to victory. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Cooperation with the U.S. means cooperation against the north and one intended to perpetuate the division, the appeal noted, calling for heightening vigilance against cooperation with the U.S. keen to invade the north and achieving inter-Korean cooperation to cope with the U.S. moves to estrange Koreans from each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\" This is a slogan of the movement for national reunification the Korean nation should hold up this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also called upon all the Koreans to turn out in the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle to protect the well-being and peace of the nation, thoroughly implement the June 15 joint declaration, positively support and uphold the Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

All this goes to prove that the confrontation over the nuclear issue in Korea is a confrontation between justice and injustice, between forces standing for peace and those standing against peace and between pro-reunification forces and separatists, i.e. confrontation between the Koreans not only in the north but in south Korea and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north, the south and overseas should be proud of the nation's advantages and actively turn out to protect its dignity. The nation should give full play to its high national self-esteem and demonstrate its strong stamina to the U.S. which has brought only shame and disasters to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should place the nation's interests above anything else and achieve national cooperation for peace and reunification without fail from the stand of depending on the nation's strength and unshakable will. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out in an anti-U.S. sacred struggle to protect the well-being of the nation and the peace of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They should implement the June 15 joint declaration to the letter and accelerate the cause of national reunification. It is also necessary for the nation to support and uphold the great Songun policy in order to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Stressing the need to focus on implementing these five tasks to take practical actions to build the structure of the Korean nation's confrontation with the U.S. and pave a wide avenue for independent national reunification under the banner of our nation-first spirit this year the reporter courteously proposed on behalf of the joint meeting to hold nationwide meetings in Pyongyang, Seoul, Mt. Kumgang and other places to be agreed upon on national holidays and anniversaries common to the north and the south this year to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor was taken by Kim Yong Sam, minister of Railways, Ryom Sun Gil, chairman of the Central Committee of the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, and Ri Myong Won, secretary of the C.C., the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called on the north and the south to put the interests common to the nation above anything else no matter what others may say and maintain the principle and stand of solving all the issues in reliance upon the nation's efforts and steadily improve the inter-Korean relations in the idea of \"By our nation itself\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans in the north and the south should turn out in a sacred struggle to foil the U.S. moves to provoke a nuclear war by the concerted efforts of the nation, they urged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n An appeal to the 70 million Koreans was adopted at the meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The appeal noted that the confrontation on the Korean peninsula today is not just a confrontation between the north and the U.S.,adding the confrontation between the whole Korean nation and the U.S. is becoming a reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans should uphold the slogan of the movement for national reunification \"Let us pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation under the banner of our nation-first spirit!\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should turn out in an anti-U.S. patriotic struggle to achieve national cooperation and protect the well-being and peace of the nation from the U.S. moves to estrange Koreans from each other.
