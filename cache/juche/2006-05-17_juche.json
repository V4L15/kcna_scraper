            "content": "U.S. Branded as World's Worst Human Rights Abuser \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- It is not without reason that world people are branding the U.S. as the worst human rights abuser and a barren land of human rights. Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed article dealing with the human rights abuses by the U.S. styling itself a \"protector of human rights\".\r\n The article goes on:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. in its every \"annual report on human rights\" comments on \"human rights records\" of other countries in a freewheeling way according to its \"human rights standards\" based on the American view on value and interferes in their internal affairs over their human rights issues. This is an impudent behavior, an indication of its extreme arrogant and brigandish nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Citing what is happening in Iraq as a good example revealing the hypocrisy of the U.S. much publicized \"protection of human rights,\" the article stresses that the wanton human rights abuses by the U.S. forces in Iraq clearly show how hypocritical and deceptive the U.S. call for \"protecting human rights\" is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the height of folly for the U.S. to falsely claim that human rights are guaranteed well in America whereas they are abused in other countries to raise serious problems, the article notes, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. with the poorest human rights record in the world is acting as if it were a \"human rights judge,\" talking a lot about the \"human rights issues\" of other countries. How brazen-faced it is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Putting up even the signboard of \"protecting of human rights\" would not help the U.S. realize its ambition for world domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Brutal torture perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists more glaringly reveals their true colors as human rights abusers, touching off the unanimous denunciation by the international community. Recently Amnesty International made public a report to be presented to the UN Committee against Tortures in order to indict the U.S. for having set up secrete prisons in different countries and maltreating and torturing a lot of people there. The report accused the U.S. of being a state keen on torture in violation of the UN convention banning torture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As proven the facts, the U.S. imperialists are the heinous forces of aggression who wantonly abuse international law and human ethics and morality under the pretext of \"war on terrorism\", destroyer of human civilization and world's worst human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With nothing can the U.S. cover up its crimes and despicable nature.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They also called for the total withdrawal of the expansion plan and the dissolution of the subordinate south Korea-U.S. \"alliance.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants handed a letter of protest and a written statement addressed to the south Korean \"government\" over to the consulate general. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prior to the press conference, the organizations demonstrated, shouting \"Peace to Phyongthaek!\" and other slogans.    \r\n\r\n \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

She noted she was glad of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She said that during their stay in Korea they visited the Kumsusan Memorial Palace to pay high tribute to Kim Il Sung who lies in state, and the old home in Mangyongdae where he was born and inspected various places. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though our visit was short, we could not only remember the martyrs but also deeply feel the true and warm friendship of Korean comrades, she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She stressed that they would make all efforts to defend Sino-Korean friendship and peace and ensure joint development of the two countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A performance was given by artistes of the KPA Song and Dance Ensemble at the reception.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. \"War on Terrorism\" Violates Religious Freedom \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 16 (KCNA) -- The U.S. \"war on terrorism\" is a hideous war aimed to abuse human rights as it is mercilessly trampling down upon the freedom of religious belief under the signboard of \"liberal democracy.\"\r\n \"War on terrorism\" is based on the extreme hostile policy toward Islam and characterized by ceaseless bloody suppression of religion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has pursued its policy against Islamic countries in the Middle East since the demise of the Cold War, vociferously advocating the \"theory of the clash between civilizations.\" By this theory it means that the Islamic civilization is bound to clash with the fundamentally differing Christian civilization in the West and that it is the only way of terminating this confrontation to remould all the Islamic forces and lead them to the road of Western democracy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Acting upon this reactionary logic hostile to Islam, Washington pursued a one-sided pro-Israel policy in the international arena. It has egged Israel on to military actions against Islamic countries while patronizing its policy for territorial expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the \"September 11 incident\" taken place than the U.S. described Islam as a belligerent religion, holding Islam fully accountable for the incident and launching a \"war on terrorism\" in its desperate bid to Americanize the Muslim world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This frantic \"crusade\" launched by the U.S. against Islam brought war disasters to the two Islamic countries, Afghanistan and Iraq, in a couple of years and this war of genocide took the lives of so many Muslims. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is contemplating expanding the theatre of the war of aggression to such Islamic countries as Iran and Syria, under the pretexts of \"development of nuclear weapons\" and \"support to terrorism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The inhuman nature of the \"war on terrorism\" waged by the Bush administration in violation of the freedom of religious belief is clearly evidenced by the facts that it is busy inciting an atmosphere of chauvinism toward Islam worldwide, arresting and, imprisoning and persecuting guiltless Muslims at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. soldiers are brutally torturing and maltreating Muslims in secret prisons in different parts of the world under the pretext of \"combating terrorism\". In these detention camps reminiscent of the Oswiecim concentration camp operated by German fascists   U.S. law enforcement agents committed such blasphemy as throwing a Koran into a chamber pot under the very eyes of prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"war on terrorism\" has been targeted against Muslims throughout it in the wake of the Afghan and Iraqi wars. The persecution and suppression of Muslims have been openly patronized and encouraged by the administration to reach their height at present. All these facts glaringly reveal the hypocrisy of the U.S. touted \"freedom of religion.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community had already warned of the possibility of the U.S. \"war on terrorism\" leading to \"clash between the two civilizations\" and demanded the U.S. stop such unjust war at once. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The German minister of Interior, speaking at a seminar in October 2004, held that \"the war on terrorism\" should never be a war between the two religions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a letter addressed to the U.S. president some days ago, the Iranian president asserted that the U.S.-style \"freedom\" and \"democracy\" are not of any help to realizing the ideal of humankind, demanding Bush admit the religious diversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-launched brigandish \"war on terrorism\" is bound to meet its shameful fiasco for its reckless nature and injustice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a microbial dispersant consisting of a photosynthetic bacterium, activated humic acid and other microelements and ultra-microelements. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The photosynthetic bacterium, its chief ingredient, makes plants imbibe amino acid and other substances, increase efficiency of luminous energy, and promote their growth, flower bud differentiation, blooming and good fruition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It also ensures freshness of flowers and promotes pigmentary display to increase chlorophyll and pigment content. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When it is applied, flower buds come out seven or ten days earlier than usual and every flower is 1.2 or 1.3 fold bigger than the previous one. And the number of blossoms increases and the flower can be kept fresh. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It gives no ecological and environmental pollution and inflicts no injury upon the human body as compared with auximones of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The research group introduced the auximone into Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia greenhouses across the country and gardens in Pyongyang for several years and has contributed to cultivating flowers more beautifully. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This nutrition liquid can be made from raw materials rich in any part of Korea and is now gaining public favor among gardening officials and experts for its great effectiveness in cultivating Kimilsungia and Kimjongilia, famous flowers.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
