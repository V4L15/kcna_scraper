They also manufactured up-to-date equipment requiring high technology by introducing a new engineering method and built two factories while ensuring the production of modern mining equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Looking round different places of the complex, they were deeply impressed to see the workers of Ranam translating leader Kim Jong Il's plan for building a powerful nation into reality in the steadfast spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the spirit of devotedly implementing his instructions.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK remains unfazed under any situation \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 5 (KCNA) -- The DPRK will deal with the world and the situation from the standpoint of adhering to its ideology, system and cause under whatever situation. It will firmly build up the army and solve all the problems related to the international situation and relations. \r\n This is an invariable independent stand and firm will of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a foolish delusion for the U.S. imperialists to threaten and blackmail the DPRK and hurt it, taking advantage of the \"September 11 Incident\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This incident threw the world into a catastrophic crisis and great confusion in the overall international relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the DPRK that remains unfazed, unaffected by it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no reason for us to read other's face or curry favor with anyone no matter how the world situation may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We are keeping to the road chosen by ourselves, saying what we should do. The Korean people see everything going well and feel quite reassured. This astonishing reality of the DPRK is the result of the army-based policy pursued by leader Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As long as he is following the army-based policy, wisely commanding the army, the DPRK will remain strong for ever and Korean-style socialism steadily advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The lesson drawn by the Korean people under the present complicated international situation is that the destiny of the country and the nation entirely depends on whether a nation has a great leader or not and the nation's security and sovereignty cannot be preserved without strong military forces guided by the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even the slightest slackening of alertness and self-complacency may give the enemy an opportunity of attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to heighten the revolutionary vigilance to the maximum under the prevailing situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As the U.S. long-term war against \"terrorism\" and its plan to stifle the DPRK suggest, the U.S. bellicose forces have not yet abandoned their wild ambition to seize the whole of Korea by strangulating the DPRK by its strong-arm policy, its war strategy in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists try to test its logic of strength on the DPRK as they are using it against some countries, they will be annihilated to the last man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK is also prepared to shatter the Japanese reactionaries' moves for reinvasion.       The escalated moves of the U.S. and Japanese reactionaries to stifle the DPRK in a bid to realize their aggressive designs compel the army and people of the DPRK to closely watch their every move with heightened revolutionary vigilance and alertness. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They will as always defend everything by the might of the army-based politics just as they did their ideology, system and cause with the army-based politics, the commentary concludes.    \r\n\r\n"

Yet, they are persisting in all sorts of evil deeds. These unpardonable crimes are only adding to the crimes committed by Japan in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will surely force them to pay a thousand-fold higher price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries should face up to the trend of the times, behave with discretion, immediately stop the national discrimination and crackdown upon Chongryon and Koreans in Japan and release at once the unreasonably  arrested people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persist in the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon campaign despite the repeated warnings, the Korean people will mete out a thousand-fold severe punishment to the militarists of Japan, the sworn enemy of the Korean people.    \r\n\r\n"
