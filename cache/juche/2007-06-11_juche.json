This is an intensive expression of bellicosity, shamelessness and ferocity of the U.S. imperialism, the kingpin of aggression and war seeking to dominate the world with the military whip. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists also use the carrot strategy in other countries. This does not mean change in their nature of aggression, and it is intended to attain their aims of domination by beating those countries with appeasement policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In recent years the U.S. has intensified the offensive of \"export of democracy\" in different regions and countries of the world including the Middle East region. It is an extension of the carrot strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists regard the bourgeois ideological and cultural poisoning as an essence of the strategy of \"spread of democracy\" and attach great efforts to this. The U.S. is intensifying the psychological and strategic broadcasting towards different countries including the DPRK, Cuba and Iran while spreading through various channels and means the reactionary bourgeois idea and the rotten Yankee way of life and culture among the peoples in an attempt to bring about change in their idea and mentality. It is the calculation of the imperialists that they may easily achieve by carrot what they fail to do by whip. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists would offer \"aid\", \"cooperation\" and \"loan\" to other countries as if they show generosity. But, such offering does not come from their honest mind for sincere help to those countries and it is by no means for their prosperity. It is a means for securing their economic interests and realizing political and economic subordination and domination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the bitter lesson taught by the present international situation that if any country cherishes illusion about the imperialists and implicitly follows them without heightened vigilance against such tactics, it cannot defend its own idea and principle in the revolution and construction and even it will be deprived of its sovereignty.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Refuted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 9 (KCNA) -- Conservative media in south Korea including Dong-A Ilbo and Munhwa Ilbo recently let loose piffles that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is the \"north's strategy toward the south,\" complaining about the stipulation in the joint press release adopted at the 21st north-south ministerial talks of the fact that the inter-Korean relations should be developed in conformity with the spirit of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland said in a statement issued on Saturday refuting such diatribe: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but a rash traitorous act of denying the June 15 joint declaration and inciting north-south confrontation. It only reflects the extreme uneasiness and concern of the United States and the south Korean conservative forces over the fact that the idea of \"By our nation itself\" is displaying ever greater vitality and the spirit of national independence and reunification through alliance with the north is mounting high as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The idea of \"By our nation itself\" is, to all intents and purposes, not for a single party but for all Koreans in the north and the south. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean conservative media's mud-slinging at the DPRK as regards the idea of \"By our nation itself\" not only proves that they represent the political imbeciles but betrays their criminal design to stem the trend of the June 15 era of independent reunification and bring the spirit of achieving reunification through alliance with the north back to that of confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Denying the above-said idea is little short of negating the joint declaration and opposing concord, cooperation, peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what rhetoric one may produce, the idea of \"By our nation itself\" will remain an immortal banner for achieving the country's reunification and carving out the destiny of the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

En tanto, mandan a esos paises a sus espias y saboteadores para arruinar la economia y causar el disturbio economico. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n�@Ademas, aumentan sus fuerzas armadas y despliegan incesantemente los ejercicios militares en varias partes del mundo y anuncian las medidas militares como la declaracion de guerra con la intencion de impedir a los paises mencionados construir tranquilamente su economia, al exacerbar intencionalmente la situacion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Lo clave de ese sabotaje economico es la sancion y la forma mas cruenta de esta es la sancion financiera. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  El objetivo principal, que persigue EE.UU. a traves de la sancion financiera, es convertir a los paises no alineados y en vias de desarrollo en las colonias de su capital e intensificar la dominacion, la intervencion, la explotacion y el saqueo sobre ellos. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Hoy dia, frustrar tales maniobras de los imperialistas deviene una prioridad de la epoca actual. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Igualmente, es preciso erradicar el viejo y desigual orden economico internacional y establecer el otro nuevo e imparcial. Para ello, los paises no alineados y en vias de desarrollo deben ampliar y fortalecer la cooperacion Sur-Sur.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
