The additional dispatch of troops under the cloak of \"reconstruction and stability of Iraq\" is little short of sending troops to the second Iraqi war as mercenaries of the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The government should not kneel down to the interference in the internal affairs by the United States which is giving precedence to south Korea-U.S. cooperation and cooperation in troop dispatch, but lend an ear to the opinion of the people and the world. If it forces troop dispatch, giving priority to its \"promise\" to the U.S., it would face a stern judgment by the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement demanded the \"government\" and the 17th National Assembly withdraw the plan of troop dispatch to Iraq and the U.S. immediately discontinue its pressure for it and interference in the internal affairs of the Korean peninsula.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
