Paektu By the Sun\", four scenes \"We Will Be Responsible for the Korean Revolution\", \"We Will Continue Advancing Along the Road of Juche\", \"We Will Carry Forward the Cause of the Sun As Its Rays Through Generations\" and \"We Will Glorify Korea Under the Leadership of the General\" and the last scene \"Best Wishes for Longevity\".\r\n   It represents well with gymnastic and artistic activities the enduring achievements made under the guidance of Secretary Kim Jong Il, who has built a powerful socialist state of Juche in Korea by creditably carrying forward the revolutionary cause of Juche started by President Kim Il Sung. It also shows the happy and worthwhile life the Korean people enjoy in the socialist society.\r\n   The performers fully demonstrate the Korean people's unshakable faith and iron will to accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche, united in one mind around Secretary Kim Jong Il, true to the behests of President Kim Il Sung.\r\n   The performance, a mixture of various kinds of gymnastics, dances, acrobatics and slide-helped background, is acclaimed by the spectators for its high ideological and artistic value, the tested skill of the performers and good ensemble.\r\n   The mass gymnastic display, which has been enjoyed by many people, was created by the mass gymnastic display production, which takes a big share in the nation's Juche-based sports and art development.\r\n   The production, made up of a section of directors and gymnastic, background, music and other sections, has hundreds of able creators including some 40 people's sportsmen and merited sportsmen.

They touched on the tasks of union organizations to materialise it. \r\n   The meetings discussed concrete measures for invigorating the sacred struggle for national independence and peace and the joint struggle for the cause common to the nation.\r\n   The meetings appealed to South Korean organizations to actively turn out with patriotic stand in the national joint struggle to convene a joint conference of representatives of political parties and organizations in the north, south and overseas. \r\n   They expressed the will to actively arrange contacts and dialogues with all peasant and women organizations in South Korea and adopted relevant decisions.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a mockery of the South Korean people demanding a thoroughgoing probe into the truth behind the Hanbo incident and the full revelation of the crimes of Kim Young Sam and his family, the chief culprits of the incident.\r\n   As is  known to the world Kim Young Sam let his son rake up money from comprador businessmen and enterprises at the time of the \"Presidential election\" and since then, Kim Hyon Chol has had great influence on political and financial circles of South Korea with the backing of his father's power. It is not a secret that Kim Hyon Chol, all the more arrogant on the patronage of his father, has been involved in many scandals and collected \"political funds\" for Kim Young Sam. The puppet prosecution attempted to gloss over the \"investigation\", for the revelation of Kim Hyon Chol's crimes would lead to Kim Young Sam. But there is no one who will be taken in by such a foolish trick.\r\n   The investigation of the puppet prosecution into the Hanbo incident showed the world once again the arrogance of Kim Young Sam, the kingpin of irregularities, and his clan as the saying \"like father, like son\" goes. \r\n\r\n"

The news analyst goes on:  This time the U.S. talked about a \"consultative meeting to examine the situation of the north\", \"proposal for strengthening joint action in the policy towards the north\" and \"joint defense\".   This is far from the attitude the U.S. should take as a direct party responsible for the settlement of the Korean issue.\r\n   The \"cooperation system\" called for by the U.S., South Korean puppets and the Japanese reactionaries is a product of their joint plot intended to stifle the DPRK.   We have strongly opposed it from the beginning and this stand still remains unchanged. \r\n   In order to solve the question of the Korean Peninsula it is necessary to ease the tension and remove the confrontation.\r\n  The U.S. must behave with discretion, clearly seeing what the \"joint action\" and \"cooperation\" will bring about. \r\n\r\n"

He sought in this to shift the responsibility for the scandal on to some of his hirelings.\r\n   The deception cannot go down with any one at all.\r\n   Kim Young Sam should not pay lip-services to \"liquidation of irregularities and corruption\", but make public the truth behind the Hanbo loan scandal as well as the 1992 \"Presidential elections\" fund, step down and face judgement by history and people. \r\n\r\n"
