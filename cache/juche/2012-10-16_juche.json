This goes to prove that it was just hypocrisy and deception when the U.S. said that it has no intent to invade the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. imperialists are the sworn enemy of not only the Korean people but also mankind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t We will fully support the revolutionary anti-imperialist stand of the DPRK to fight it out against the U.S. imperialists under the slogan \"Annihilate the U.S. imperialist aggressors, sworn enemy of the Korean people!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Branding the U.S. imperialists as the world's biggest human rights abuser, plunderer and exploiter, we call upon all the progressives in the world to sharpen vigilance against their arbitrariness and actively work to disclose their nature. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The France-DPRK Friendship Association in its statement said it fully supported the statement of a spokesman for the DPRK National Defence Commission, expressing the will to continue the vigorous solidarity movement supporting the cause of the Korean people for peace and security in the Korean Peninsula, Asia and the rest of the world."
