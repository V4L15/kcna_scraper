Precisely for this reason, they are letting their reconnaissance planes fly in the sky above the DPRK so often to intensify aerial espionage and steadily strain the situation on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. arms buildup and escalating espionage are part of its military operations to ignite a new Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" but, in actuality, stepping up its war preparations, bringing the situation on the peninsula to the brink of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The evermore undisguised moves of the U.S. bellicose forces to stifle the DPRK compel it to bolster its war deterrent to cope with them.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Bellicose Forces' War Exercises against DPRK Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 3 (KCNA) -- As already known, the U.S. staged the large-scale \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercises together with the south Korean military from August 20 to 31. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday in a signed commentary carried in this regard says: Such frantic war exercises staged under the simulated conditions of an actual war with at least 10,000 U.S. forces present in south Korea and overseas and huge south Korean troops and up-to-date war equipment involved were, to all intents and purposes, drills for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. staged extremely provocative war maneuvers against the DPRK despite its repeated warnings and strong opposition and protest from the public at home and abroad. This was an open hostile act against the DPRK and an unpardonable criminal move to stem the trend of the development of the situation on the Korean Peninsula toward detente and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation on the Korean Peninsula is of late developing in the direction of detente and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation's desire for reconciliation, unity, peace and reunification is growing stronger and the points agreed upon at the six-party talks aimed at peace and security on the Korean Peninsula are in the process of implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S., however, staged such provocative joint military exercises against the DPRK against this backdrop. This diametrically runs counter to the cause of peace and reunification of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is putting spurs to such \"arms buildup\" as massively introducing means of nuclear attack while promoting the reorganization of the system of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces present in south Korea aimed at mounting a preemptive attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was busy painting \"Ulji Focus Lens\" as \"annual\" or \"computer mock drills\" but it staged the maneuvers under the simulated conditions of an actual war, thus revealing its adventurous design to examine and round off the preparations for the preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK still remains unchanged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Calling on all the Koreans in the north and the south and abroad to wage a vigorous patriotic struggle for peace of the country and independent national reunification from the stand of attaching importance to the nation, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand on attaching importance to the nation represents the Juche-oriented view and stand on approaching everything from the stand of putting the interests of the nation responsible for carving out its destiny above all, not outsiders, in the struggle for carving out the destiny of the nation. It also represents the genuine stand on reunification and patriotism as it makes it possible to achieve at an early date the country's reunification, the most urgent task in the struggle for independently carving out the destiny of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This stand also represents the stand on national unity as it makes it possible to achieve the unity of the entire nation by pooling efforts of the Korean nation itself and pave the way for national reunification by dint of that strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans have common interests in achieving peace and its reunification while the outsiders are interested in perpetuating the division of the Korean nation and provoking a war of aggression against the DPRK. To attach importance to the outsiders keen to perpetuate division and war is a treacherous act of negating peace and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attaching importance to the nation makes it possible to reject outsiders standing against Korea's reunification, firmly maintain the independent stand in solving the reunification problem and promote the process of national reunification and unity to meet the desire and the interests common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be impossible to solve the problem of national reunification if one read the faces of outsiders and attached more importance to their intention and demand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Attaching importance to the nation helps all the Koreans, who consider national unity and reunification as vital to their destiny, go united as one and work for accomplishing the cause of national independence by their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National cooperation represents a basic mode of carving out the destiny of the Koreans as it helps them unite close for national reunification, proceeding from the stand of attaching importance to the nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They have thus created all conditions favorable for their propagation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The zoo has succeeded in receiving a young generation of Balearica Pavonina in 15 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This achievement will be helpful toward propagating other kinds of birds belonging to the Gruidae living in Korea.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
