Moreover, it is working hard to openly interfere in the internal affairs of the nation and hamstring the process of improving the inter-Korean relations, citing the \"provisions of armistice agreement\" which is gathering dust. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hopes that the north and the south will remain in the relationship of distrust and confrontation and the Korean nation divided into the north and the south. Its intention is to perpetuate the Korean division and fish in troubled waters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Articles related to the crossing of the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) of the Armistice Agreement have lost their validity as the members of the neutral nations supervisory commission withdrew in the middle of the 1990s, leaving the armistice commission  unoperational. The issue raised by the U.S. under this situation is nothing but an absurd pretext to hamstring the process of warming the inter-Korean relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. stand that nothing related to the inter-Korean relations can be solved while leaving the U.S. Forces aside reflects a self-righteous and dominationist way of thinking intended to infringe upon not only the interests of the Korean people and other Asian countries but those of Europe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is seriously mistaken if it thinks its arrogant intention to sacrifice other countries for meeting its interests will go down with the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never allow the U.S. imperialists to meddle in its internal affairs and derail its efforts to develop the inter-Korean relations by its concerted efforts.    \r\n"
