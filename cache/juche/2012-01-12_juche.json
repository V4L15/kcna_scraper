They did not hesitate to commit such reckless act as unilaterally walking out of the venue of the talks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group derailed not only Red Cross talks and contacts between the north and the south for solving humanitarian issues but NGO dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs a result, all cooperation projects between the north and the south were suspended, leaving many non-governmental businesses in south Korea bankrupt or forcing them to stop their operations. The south Koreans who eked out their living through cooperation projects were put on the crossroads of life and death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group made abortive the joint national events slated to take place on the anniversaries of the publication of the historic inter-Korean declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt prevented the Council for the Solution of the Issue of the Volunteers Corps from having communication with the north for discussing a joint declaration of women's organizations in the north and the south to be made public on the anniversary of the March First Popular Uprising. It also disallowed the visit of those concerned of the south side funeral committee to Kaesong to receive a message of condolence sent by the DPRK side on the death of Pak Yong Gil, widow of Rev. Mun Ik Hwan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe crimes of Lee group are proved by the heinous moves to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen and anti-DPRK smear campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year alone, Lee visited the U.S. several times to beg for support to his confrontation policy and openly let loose such reckless remarks that his north policy would remain unchanged despite domestic and foreign criticism.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group imposed a heavy penalty upon Rev. Han Sang Ryol on charge of violation of the \"National Security Law\" after keeping him behind bars for more than a year and suppressed the Youth and Students Solidarity for Implementing the June 15 Joint Declaration and other organizations in south Korea after labeling them as \"enemy benefiting organizations\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors disconnected more than 90 internet websites branding them as \"pro-north ones\" and deleted at least 80 000 notices and arrested all those concerned last year. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey kicked off anti-DPRK plots ceaselessly including spy-ring case and incident of assassination group, infusing confrontation atmosphere. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group's confrontation moves were at maximum late in December last year when the nation suffered the greatest loss. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sooner had the sad news of the great loss to the nation been released than the group of puppets convened a \"state security meeting\" and \"emergency state affairs meeting\" and put Chongwadae and Administration, puppet army and police on \"emergency alert guard and duty\" leveling the gun at the fellow countrymen shedding tears in great grief. They dared foolishly try to break the single-minded unity of the DPRK talking about \"taking counteraction by separating inhabitants from their leadership\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities and the group of the \"Grand National Party\" desperately slandered and insulted pictures of the people in the north expressing condolences and totally banned the Pyongyang visits of south Korean opposition parties and organizations of different social standings. Even the south Korean puppet group brutally suppressed south Korean youths and students and civic organizations for expressing condolences in the incense-burning altars installed by themselves. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey let over 30 right-wing conservative organizations flock to the forefront areas along the military demarcation line to scatter anti-DPRK leaflets whose content was hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK and inciting disturbance on the day of bidding last farewell.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother crime is that the group of traitors escalated the reckless confrontation and war moves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLast year the group created the crisis of grave military clashes and seriously endangered the peace and stability of the Korean Peninsula and the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt committed such unprecedentedly hideous provocations as daringly insulting the supreme leadership of the DPRK one after another last year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll the facts show that the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors is the number one group of maniacs keen on confrontation and war, the white paper said, warning that the group will face only merciless punishment."

Korea at Earliest Possible Date\r\nPyongyang, January 12 (KCNA) -- The building of a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula entirely depends on the attitude of the United States, says Rodong Sinmun Thursday in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt demands the U.S. pull back its aggressor forces from south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPointing to the illegal nature of the U.S. forces' occupation of south Korea, the article notes: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. should accept the resolution of the 30th UN General Assembly and make a bold decision to pull its troops out of south Korea, though belatedly. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat the U.S. forces have done so far since their occupation of south Korea is nothing but acts of threatening the peace on the peninsula and increasing the danger of war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. has reinforced its troops and introduced nuclear weapons in systematic violation of the Armistice Agreement, turning south Korea into the biggest nuclear arsenal in Far East and most dangerous advanced nuclear base. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. troops have become more undisguised in their moves for aggression and war in the new century.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. troops in south Korea are a hot bed of war in the Korean Peninsula and the root cause of threatening and disturbing peace and security in Northeast Asia and the rest of the world. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe withdrawal of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces from south Korea is an irresistible demand of the times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean people are calling for the withdrawal of U.S. troops, holding aloft slogans for independence against the U.S. and national reunification. Voices demanding the U.S. forces' pullback are also heard in the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe world progressives are also demanding the U.S. troops' withdrawal from south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. forces' pullback from south Korea serves as a barometer judging and verifying whether the U.S. has willingness to ensure peace in the Korean Peninsula or not.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf the U.S. truly has a stand to prevent a war on the peninsula and ensure peace in Northeast Asia, it should boldly withdraw its forces from south Korea."
