After the Sept. 11 incident, the U.S. listed those countries falling out of its favor as sponsors of terrorism and put pressure upon them after dividing other countries into a group standing on the U.S. side and the other group standing on the terrorist side as it pleased. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. set out the strategy of preemptive attack and has since put spurs to the development of new type nuclear weapons. This eloquently proves that the U.S. is the world's worst rogue state as it revealed its criminal attempt not to hesitate to exterminate humankind in a bid to realize its ambition for world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. reckless moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK mean the extreme phase of its unilateral and self-righteous foreign policy. The U.S. has frantically stepped up its preparations for the preemptive attack on the DPRK, while giving lip-service to the negotiated peaceful solution to the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. styles itself \"liberator\" and \"guardian of justice.\" But with nothing can it hide its criminal nature as an aggressor, occupationist and harasser of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The world is going in for multi-polarization and independence and no country tolerates U.S. unilateralism and supremacy. China and Russia, too, are swimming with the trend towards world multi-polarization, opposed to the U.S. high-handed practices and unilateralism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. imperialism is standing further isolated worldwide and this is precipitating the collapse of the U.S.A. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a tragedy that the Bush group is incapable of escaping it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Stop to Troop Dispatch to Iraq Urged \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute issued a memorandum on Sept. 17, castigating the U.S. and its followers for forcing dispatch of south Korean troops to Iraq, oblivious of nightmare at the time of the Vietnamese war.\r\n The memorandum said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The overseas dispatch of south Korean troops from the Vietnamese war to the Iraqi war included 8 countries on 14 occasions. The three-occasioned dispatch of troops to Iraq is largest in troop strength ever since the Vietnamese war and ranks first among those countries which dispatched their troops to Iraq, except for the United States and Great Britain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring in detail to the truth behind the participation of south Korean troops in the shameful Vietnamese war forced by the U.S., the memorandum pointed out: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States ignited a war of aggression in Vietnam in the 1960s and involved its satellites including south Korea in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States had already used the south Korean troops as its cannon fodder during the war of aggression in Korea. With this experience it forced the then military fascist regime of south Korea, a special class colony, to dispatch its troops to the Vietnamese war, because the regime was thirsting for the U.S. political and economic aid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Forced by the U.S., the 150-strong south Korean troops consisting of 140-member medical group of the Mobile Surgery Hospital and 10 Taekwon-do teachers were firstly dispatched to the Vietnamese war under the signboard of the \"assisting group\" on Sept. 22, 1964. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities dispatched the \"Dove Unit\" to South Vietnam for the second time in February 1965 under the mask of \"non-combat unit\" and later committed   50,000-strong combat troops including \"Blue Dragon Unit\", \"Fierce Tiger Unit\" and \"White Horse Unit\" to the Vietnamese war on five occasions until June 1967. Therefore, the dispatch of south Korean troops to the Vietnamese war totaled at least 320,000 for nine years. (the south Korean magazine Hangyorye 21, Sept. 25, 2003). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dispatched middle-aged and young south Korean people were used as bullet shields for their master and met a miserable death. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 4,960 south Korean persons were killed and 11,062 others wounded in the Vietnamese war. Over 66,000 out of those troops who managed to come back after the war are at death's door or undergoing troubles owing to the sequela of the GI's defoliant and its aftereffect is being exerted upon their posterity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the south Korean authorities advertised it earned a billion U.S. dollars through troop dispatch to the Vietnamese war, human casualties during the war amounted to 15.4 billion dollars (the south Korean magazine Shin Dong-A, Oct. 1970). This is nightmare and truth behind the shameful Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the dispatch of south Korean troops to the Iraqi war and its aftermath following the nightmare in the Vietnamese war 40 years ago, the memorandum said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States ignited the Iraqi war on March 20 last year following the Afghan war under the pretext of \"anti-terrorist war\" after the \"Sept. 11 incident\" and put pressure upon south Korea by means of threat and appeasement to dispatch its troops to Iraq before the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In particular, the U.S. forced south Korea to dispatch its troops to Iraq at the time when   political foundation of the \"government for people\" was weak and it was faced with a crisis at home and abroad after its appearance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yielding to the U.S. demand, the south Korean authorities dispatched an \"assisting group\" consisting of at least 600-strong engineering battalion and over 100-member medical group in the name of an \"advance party\" under the mask of \"non-combat unit\" afraid of public opinions as they did at the time of the Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Not content with this, the U.S. forced the south Korean authorities again to dispatch large additional combat troops as it did in the Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Submitting to the U.S. pressure in different sectors , the south Korean authorities decided to additionally dispatch 3,000-strong combat troops of the \"Jaitun unit\" including 800 soldiers to Iraq under the \"command of special war\" and sent a 900-strong advance party this year on August 3 this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. is continuing to force the south Korean authorities to increase the number of dispatched troops and their equipment, saying that the scale, combat readiness and equipment of the south Korean troops dispatched to Iraq are insufficient and there should be at least a ten thousand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts show that dispatch of south Korean troops to Iraq is forced by the U.S. according to the method and scenario it used in the Vietnamese war for scores of decades ago and that the more south Korea submits to the U.S. demand for troop dispatch to Iraq, the more miserable end it meets as it did in the Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though the south Korean authorities advertise as if they will get some \"benefit\" from the troop dispatch to Iraq, it is a day dream, the memorandum said, adding: The U.S. was seducing the south Korean authorities to dispatch additional troops, asserting that it would promote sincere negotiations on the nuclear issue and would not launch a war in the Korean peninsula, but now that thousands-strong combat troops of south Korea are expected to be dispatched there, the U.S. anti-DPRK nuclear campaign is growing stronger and more vicious and the danger of war is increasing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that south Korea's extension of the period of the stationing of south Korean troops in Iraq and continued dispatch of additional combat troops only betray its position as a colonial stooge of the U.S., the memorandum urged an unconditional stop to the south Korean troop dispatch to Iraq.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA on Nuclear Scandal in S. Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 18 (KCNA) -- The recent disclosure of nuclear-related secret experiments in succession in south Korea is stirring up a big furor in the international community.\r\n South Korea made a clandestine laser-aided uranium enrichment experiment in 2000 and a series of plutonium extraction experiments in 1982. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the nuclear scandal been disclosed than the United States and the south Korean authorities lost no time to assert that the experiments had nothing to do with the development of nuclear weapons only to arouse a bigger suspicion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is open secret that south Korea decided in the 1970s when it was under military dictatorship to develop nuclear weapons and its researchers have since pursued nuclear experiments at the \"Taedok Research Center\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the 1990s it made uranium enrichment experiments in secrecy and 150kg of metal uranium was churned out from a nuclear facility out of three nuclear facilities whose existence was not reported to the IAEA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The continued disclosure of experiments in south Korea clearly proves that they were directed by the U.S. as they are aimed to develop nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is quite impossible for south Korea to make such nuclear-related experiments for years without the U.S. knowledge as it has a dense intelligence network serving the U.S. which has the prerogative of supreme command over the south Korean army. The experiments recently brought to light in south Korea were made with U.S. technology and the uranium with the concentration purity of up to 80 % has no other purpose than developing nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is strange enough is that even before the IAEA investigation came to an end, U.S. State Secretary Powell and Defense Secretary Rumsfeld came out to assert one after another that they were just at the experimental stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis indicates that the U.S. was aware of the inside story of south Korea's nuclear activities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Korea's clandestine nuclear experiments go to prove that the U.S. double standards are a fundamental factor of the nuclear proliferation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. transfers nuclear technology to its allies and connives at their development and access to nuclear weapons. Meanwhile, it makes far-fetched assertion without any convincing evidence that the DPRK has pursued landestine uranium enrichment program in a bid to hold in check its nuclear activities for a peaceful purpose for the mere reason that it has differing ideology and system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is by no means fortuitous that French, German and other media claimed that the U.S. was accountable for the nuclear suspicion in south Korea, commenting that had the similar incident occurred in north Korea the U.S. would be the first to make an outcry over it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is only the U.S. that tries to hush up the case, asserting that there is no cause for concern, though the international community is unanimously demanding a thorough probe into the truth behind the nuclear-related secret experiments in south Korea. This reveals the U.S. intention to wink at south Korea's nuclear weapons development as it did Israel's. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What infuriates the DPRK is that the U.S. has so far shut its eyes to the secret nuclear activities of its allies under its nuclear umbrella but has pressurized the DPRK to accept the CVID. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This means that the six countries having either access to nuclear weapons or perfect capability to develop them sat at the negotiating table to discuss the DPRK's nuclear issue only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. hard-line conservative forces' deliberate provocation have already overturned the groundwork of dialogue, it is self-evident that the resumption of the talks can no longer be discussed unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy based on double standards toward the DPRK and that the latter can never dismantle its nuclear deterrent force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the U.S. is craftily working to pressurize the DPRK to accept the version of Libyan-style solution, saying that Pyongyang should follow Seoul's example as regards the nuclear-related secret experiments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to avert an arms race and ensure lasting peace and security in Northeast Asia it is necessary for the U.S. to come out to dialogue with willingness to drop its double-standards, the root cause of the nuclear issue, and renounce its hostile policy toward the DPRK in practice.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The \"U.S. has opened the Pandora's box. A door to hell is open in Iraq.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hostile policy pursued by the Bush administration toward the DPRK prompted by its implacable rejection of the latter's political system only reinforces the DPRK's conviction that the toughest counteraction is the only recipe for the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is as foolish an act as trying to sweep the sea with a broom for the U.S. to hurt man-centered Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people's perfect unity will grow stronger no matter what the U.S. may cry out.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
