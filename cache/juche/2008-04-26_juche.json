They say that the foundation of the Korean People's Revolutionary Army by President Kim Il Sung on April 25, Juche 21 (1932) was a historic event which declared the birth of revolutionary army of new type guided by the Juche idea, the Songun idea in the era of independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun says: The nearly 80 year-long history of the KPA is a history in which it has won one victory after victory as a mainstay and a main force for the revolution, true to the idea and leadership of the party and the leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of devotedly defending the leader, the core in the mental power of the KPA, has been fully displayed on the noblest level in the Songun era led by Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Victories on all fronts of the revolution and construction have been firmly guaranteed thanks to the great victory won on the anti-imperialist military front in the Korean revolution that was started and has advanced with arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Based on the victory and feats performed during the hard-fought great anti-Japanese war for Korea's liberation our party and the state were founded and the driving force for the revolution has grown remarkably stronger and the great victory won in the grim Fatherland Liberation War helped lay a reliable socio-political ground and military and economic foundation for the socialist revolution and socialist construction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present stirring reality of Songun Korea which is dynamically advancing toward the bright morrow of a great prosperous powerful nation would be unthinkable without the devoted struggle of the Korean People's Army that has built lots of monumental edifices in the Songun era in different parts of the country overcoming manifold difficulties in the revolutionary soldier spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n General Secretary Kim Jong Il's Songun politics serves as an all-powerful treasured sword for the revolution and construction in our era and an ever-victorious banner for frustrating the imperialists' hegemonic strategy because it helped defend socialism and usher in the dawn of a great prosperous powerful nation despite the worst adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the banner of Songun provided by the great brilliant commander of Mt. Paektu, the KPA has demonstrated its might as an invincible revolutionary army matchless in ideology, mentality and combat capacity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is an invincible revolutionary army strong in ideology and faith, being possessed of indefatigable mental power, invincible Juche-based war methods and powerful striking capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KPA is invincible revolutionary armed forces strongly supported and helped by all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that it is the immense honor and pride of the Korean people to have the KPA which has demonstrated its might as a powerful revolutionary army of Mt.

Minju Joson Friday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The seminar brought to light the intention of the U.S. military chiefs to make the south Korean forces more faithfully serve it as puppet forces and use them as a shock brigade in carrying out the war against the DPRK. It also disclosed the idea of the south Korean pro-U.S. conservative ruling groups subservient to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korea-U.S. \"alliance\" is an \"alliance\" for aggression and a war \"alliance\" against the DPRK in every aspect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the alliance the U.S. seeks to make south Korea increasingly dependent upon it politically and militarily and use the south Korean puppet forces as servants in executing its war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Lee Myung Bak group is running wild, talking about \"priority to south Korea-U.S. alliance\" and tightened relationship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality proves that the U.S. is talking about \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" before its dialogue partner but working hard to do harm to it in collusion with the south Korean warhawks behind the scene. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean pro-U.S. conservative ruling group should clearly understand that they will get nothing but a shameful destruction if they keep acting puppets and henchmen of the U.S. with their backs turned on fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
