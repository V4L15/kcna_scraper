            "content": "Criminal Nature of \"U.N. Command\" Exposed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Panmunjom Mission of the Korean People's Army today issued a statement assailing the unreasonable assertion of the United States about the \"U.N. forces\" and the \"U.N. Command\" in south Korea.\r\n The statement said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already reported, in July the chief of the KPA Panmunjom Mission sent a letter to the U.N. Secretary General as regards the grave danger of war created on the Korean peninsula owing to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and its arms build-up in south Korea under the signboard of the \"United Nations\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter was officially distributed as an official document S/2004/592 of the U.N. Security Council. A spokesman for the UN Headquarters, referring to the letter on July 27, made clear its official stand that the U.S. forces in south Korea are not \"U.N. forces\" but the \"U.S.-led allied forces\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Considering that the U.N. frank clarification of its stand on the \"U.N. forces\" and the \"U.N. Command\" in south Korea has legal validity, we take this opportunity to disclose before the world people once again the criminal nature of the \"U.N. Command\" illegally fabricated by the U.S., deceiving the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By clarifying its stand on the \"U.N. forces\" the spokesman for the U.N. Headquarters confirmed the truth that the \"U.N. forces\" as claimed by the U.S. till now are not the forces created and dispatched by the U.N. but troops of 15 satellite nations the U.S. put under its command after hurling them into the Korean war and exposed the absurdity of the U.S. assertion about the \"U.N. forces\" and the \"U.N. Command.\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.N. had never dispatched even a squad of \"U.N. forces\" to the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  During the three-year Korean war the U.N. was not involved in providing forces and financial aid, to say nothing of operation command. Commanders of the U.S. forces including MacArthur, Ridgway and Clark who also commanded the troops of the satellite nations never reported to the U.N. in the entire period of carrying out operations in Korea and admitted that they had nothing to do with the U.N. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The UN secretary general clarified in December 1998 that the UN had never permitted any country to let the U.S. forces present in south Korea go with the name of UN. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a well known fact that the U.S. and its satellite forces that had participated in the Korean war were commanded by the U.S. Defence Department and the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There remains in south Korea not a single soldier of satellite countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is only U.S. forces that still stay there despite opposition of all Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous and brazen-faced window-dressing for the U.S. to allow its forces in south Korea to go under the helmet of the U.N. forces and maintain the \"U.N. Command\" which exists in name only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has worked hard to perpetuate the presence of the above-said forces and maintain the above-mentioned command, lost to all sense of shame, though more than 50 years have passed since the ceasefire. Its ulterior motive is to convince the world public that the belligerent relations between the DPRK and the U.S. are those between the U.N. and the DPRK in a bid to intensify the false propaganda that the DPRK is ostracized and isolated internationally. It is a sinister and crafty calculation of the U.S. that in case the U.S. preemptive attack on the DPRK brings the truce in Korea to collapse and sparks a new war this development will automatically compel the U.N. to intervene in it. This cannot but be the world's most wicked political chicanery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean People's Army side will no longer overlook the U.S. act of abusing the inviolable name of the U.N. in a bid to attain its sinister aim to invade the DPRK. It will not sit at the negotiating table with the U.S. forces as long as they go under the helmet of the \"U.N. forces.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face up to the reality, dismantle the \"U.N. Command\" as unanimously demanded by the U.N. and the international community and true to the resolution adopted by the U.N. General Assembly and take a measure to pull back its forces from south Korea at the earliest possible date, the forces that have committed the whole gamut of crimes going under the U.N. helmet.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "DPRK FM. Spokesman on British Foreign Office Delegation's DPRK Visit\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, September 16 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA today as regards the DPRK visit of the delegation of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland:\r\n The delegation led by Bill Rammell, deputy secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, visited the DPRK from September 11 to 14 at the invitation of the DPRK Foreign Ministry.\r\n During its stay the delegation had contacts and meetings with the DPRK side at various levels at which they had an in-depth exchange of views on the issue of bilateral relations, the nuclear issue, the human rights issue and other issues of mutual concern. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There surfaced some differences at the talks but both sides had an exhaustive discussion on the issues taken up and reached certain understanding. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The British side admitted that there was some reason in the DPRK's stand on the nuclear issue, the human rights issue, etc. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Concerning the six-party talks the DPRK side said that its stand is to consistently pursue the talks but the U.S. evermore undisguised hostile policy toward the DPRK and the recent disclosure of a series of secret nuclear experiments in south Korea, in particular, have thrown great hurdles in their way. It, therefore, clarified its stand that it can never sit at the table to negotiate its nuclear weapon program unless truth about the secret nuclear experiments in south Korea is fully probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As regards the rumor that the DPRK links the settlement of the nuclear issue to the presidential election in the U.S., the DPRK side clarified the stand that it does not care who becomes U.S. president and that it considers the U.S. policy towards the DPRK as the only yardstick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In other words, whoever is willing to renounce the hostile policy towards the DPRK and coexist with it can surely seek a negotiated solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Though there were differences between the two sides, the recent DPRK visit of the British foreign office delegation could be described on the whole as a very fruitful and successful one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides agreed to continue dialogue and cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, what the delegation said about the results of the visit upon its return home makes us feel that it was not honest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n. Moreover, it is very strange that the delegation has uttered no word about south Korea's secret nuclear experiments, a focus of world attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nPerhaps, it did so as this is a matter related to an \"ally\" of the United States. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Whatever the reason, it is by no means normal for Britain to turn aside from the clandestine experiments, which created quite a stir worldwide, as it is so interested in the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There was another matter clarified. During the British delegation's stay in the DPRK, some media spread a false report that the recent big blasting in a power station construction site in the northern part of the DPRK was an \"explosion accident\" and a \"nuclear test\". In this connection, the British side hoped that an on-field inspection of the site would be arranged for the diplomatic corps here, and the DPRK side met this request with pleasure out of good faith.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
