            "content": "Holding high torchlight of Ranam called for \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 22 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today devotes one whole page to an editorial captioned \"Let us vigorously beat drums to step up drive for building powerful nation, holding high torchlight of Ranam.\"\r\n It says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recently leader Kim Jong Il highly praised the indomitable revolutionary spirit and heroic feats of the workers of the Ranam coal mining machine complex and called on all other workers and people of Korea to learn from their fighting spirit and work style in the efforts to build a powerful and prosperous country in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight of Ranam lit in the first year of the new century, in which our country entered a phase of prosperity, is a proud declaration giving origin to the great revolutionary upswing in the era of army-based policy and represents a turning point in vigorously beating drums of revolution in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight Kim Jong Il lit in Ranam is calling on the whole party and country and all the people to effect fresh leap and innovation in the general advance to build a powerful nation in the new century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il unrolled a grandious plan to bring about a great turn in the efforts to build a powerful nation and has energetically led the drive for its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is aimed to achieve prosperity unprecedented in the national history spanning 5,000 years and build a people's paradise on this land at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight of Ranam is revolutionary in its meaning as it reflects the new need of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic meaning of the torchlight is the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the do-or-die spirit which means unconditionally implementing the tasks given by the party to the letter, not just saying empty words or shouting empty slogans.     It is the creative spirit of the workers of the Ranam coal mining machine complex to attain any target by their own efforts, combating defeatism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight represents a clear symbol of intense loyalty and patriotic devotion of the Korean workers who regard Kim Jong Il's plan and determination to build a powerful nation as their faith and put them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight Kim Jong Il lit in Ranam in the first year of the new century is a follow-up of the Kanggye spirit and torchlight of Songgang which brought about victory in the \"arduous march\" and the forced march in the 1990s of the 20th century and a manifestation of their new high stage. \r\n The torchlight of Ranam is a demonstration of inexhaustible strength of Juche Korea in which the whole party and army and all the people are single-heartedly united around Kim Jong Il and making a steady leaping advance despite ordeals of the revolution.   It is a striking manifestation of tremendous potentials and might our people have built up century after century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the torchlight in the revolutionary storm which the working class in the era of army-centered policy should hold high. This torchlight represents the strong determination to increase the national power tens of thousands of times and demonstrate Korea's might to the world, the unshakable awareness and enthusiasm to show the mettle of the Koreans once again in carving out the new century and the militant spirit of socialist Korea which does not know impossibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The torchlight means the gunfire heralding great victory as it inspires all the Korean people to speed up the advance to build a paradise under the far-sighted plan of Kim Jong Il for a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Let us accelerate the revolutionary advance in the new century, holding high the torchlight of Ranam lit by the great leader Kim Jong Il\", this is the militant slogan the Korean people should put up in their onward movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important in making the torchlight of Ranam flare up throughout the country is to let all sectors and units give full play to the spirit of devotedly defending the leader and the spirit of devotedly implementing the party policy to the letter displayed by the workers of Ranam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to earnestly learn from the noble ideological and moral world of the workers of Ranam who do admirable things without being known to others, considering deeds more important than words, and translate the plan and intention of the party and the leader into a brilliant reality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also necessary to have the same national self-respect and the revolutionary stamina as possessed by the officials and workers of Ranam who are confident that there is nothing in the world the Koreans cannot do and there is no fortress they cannot conquer. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Clear is our goal of struggle and sure is victory in the new historic advance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will surely fly the red flag on the peak of a powerful nation as we are inspired by the great army-based idea and the energetic leadership of Kim Jong Il, the party, the army and people are single-heartedly united around the leader and there is a strong foundation of independence, self-reliance and self-defence which has been consolidated in the protracted and arduous struggle.    \r\n\r\n"
