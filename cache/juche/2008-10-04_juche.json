It is something unprecedented in history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its moves to rewrite history textbooks are unpardonable as they are designed to serve the criminal purpose of reinforcing the foundation of the pro-U.S. conservative forces and openly implanting bitterness towards compatriots into the minds of the rising generation in a bid to block reconciliation and unity of the nation and weaken and dampen the desire for independence, democracy and reunification which has grown stronger in south Korea since the publication of the June 15 declaration."

            "content": "Denuncian revision del manual de historia por banda de Lee Myung Bak\r\nPyongyang, 3 de octubre (ATCC) -- El vocero del Ministerio de Educacion de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica este viernes una declaracion con motivo de que ultimamente, la banda de Lee Myung Bak habla tanto de cambiar el contenido del manual de historia, que se utiliza en las escuelas superiores del Sur de Corea, en sentido proyanqui y \"anticomunista\" bajo pretextos de la \"liquidacion de los residuos de la fraccion izquierda\" y el \"fortalecimiento de la educacion en la seguridad publica anticomunista\".\n\t\t\t\t\tSu texto resumido sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa revision del manual de historia, que pretende la banda de Lee Myung Bak, consiste en tergiversar y borrar la historia contemporanea de la nacion coreana coronada con la lucha patriotica contra la invasion y el colonialismo de las fuerzas foraneas y por el logro de la soberania nacional y en censurar siniestramente el muy digno regimen socialista de la RPDC y fomentar la conciencia hostil a esta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIgualmente, se encamina a tergiversar y enturbiar la verdad de los sucesos politicos y crimenes antinacionales cometidos por los imperialistas norteamericanos y en los anteriores regimenes de los dictadores fascistas titeres del Sur de Corea, inclusive el genocidio de los participantes en la Sublevacion Popular del 3 de Abril en la isla Jeju, y a justificar su politica anti-reunificacion e invalidar la importancia de los historicos encuentros cumbres de Pyongyang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual conducta repugnante de la banda de Lee resulta la locura sin precedentes y mas siniestra y malsana que las acciones antinacionales y antihistoricas cometidas por los sucesivos gobernantes fascistas del Sur de Corea.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas maniobras de la banda de Lee para modificar el contenido del manual de historia son nunca tolerables porque parten del intento criminal de impedir la reconciliacion y la unidad de la nacion y de sofocar el clima por la independencia, democracia y reunificacion, que se acentuo en el Sur de Corea despues de la aprobacion de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, al consolidar la base de las fuerzas conservadoras proyanquis y sembrar abiertamente en las nuevas generaciones la conciencia hostil a los connacionales."
