Since then, the U.S. has run amuck to realize its ambition for invading the DPRK with south Korea as an advanced post.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In essence, the Trump's administration's DPRK policy billed \"maximum pressure and engagement\" is a brigandish and aggressive one for stamping out the DPRK's sovereignty through military threat and high-level military pressure and realizing its attempt at invading the latter.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the policy, the U.S. has frantically staged the largest-scale joint military drills against the DPRK by introducing huge nuclear strategic assets including nuclear carrier task forces and special warfare forces and has tightened the siege against the latter with the use of south Korea, Japan and other vassal forces while deploying the reinforced nuclear carrier task forces in the waters around the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities engrossed in submission to the U.S. and dependence on outsiders are openly joining in the U.S. moves for igniting a nuclear war against the DPRK while talking about the \"settlement of the north's nuclear issue\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owning to the U.S. and south Korean authorities' frantic moves for kicking off a nuclear war against the DPRK, dark clouds of a nuclear war are heavily hanging over the Korean peninsula and the inter-Korean relations are still in the mire of catastrophe."
