He said that the soldiers of the division are still demonstrating its might at defense posts, inheriting the proud traditions of the unit, and highly praised the heroic exploits of the soldiers of the division who left remarkable marks in the history of the Fatherland Liberation War.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He went to an artillery company under the division.\r\n   At a position of the company, he learned how soldiers are standing sentry and saw their weapon-handling training.\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction with this and set forth  highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines in increasing the combat capacity of the division to the maximum.      He went round the education room, the bedroom and other places of the company and warmly looked after the life of the soldiers.   He met soldiers to learn about conditions of their clothes and shoes and said that special attention should be paid to the life of precious soldiers who are devoting themselves to the defence of the country at the forefront.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n      He also looked round the field newly brought under cultivation by KPA combined unit no. 549.   Seeing a vast expanse of field in which crops and vegetables of various species are growing, he set forth tasks to tend the field.\r\n   After concluding the inspection of the division, he appreciated a performance given by an art propaganda squad of KPA combined unit no. 549.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed great satisfaction over the fact that the art propaganda squad gave an art performance of high ideological and artistic level suited to the character of a revolutionary army and highly estimated the members of the squad for visiting forefront heights to instill strength and courage into minds of soldiers. \r\n\r\n"

All the fellow countrymen want to achieve the independent reunification of the country at an early date through great national unity and are rising up in the nationwide reunification movement to this end.   At the time when more than half a century has passed since the territory and the nation were divided by outsiders, the chief executive of South Korea made these irresponsible remarks against the nation and history, showing that he has no national conscience and sentiment of the  times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Particularly, his remarks are a politically sinister piffle as he is the ruler of the  present regime which self-proclaims itself as \"people's government\" different from the preceding dictatorial \"governments,\" anti-national and  anti-democratic.   By doing so, he not only denied again all the sincere and realistic proposals of the north for reunifying the country independently and peacefully but also threw away all his political commitments to the South Korean people as regards the unification question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This is a shameless deception and perfidious deed.\r\n   The most urgent problem for reunification is to diffuse and put an end to political and military confrontation between the north and south. Ignoring, this nevertheless, the chief executive of South Korea is talking about \"exchange\" and \"peaceful coexistence\" as if they were a matter for relations with other countries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This only shows that he has no will for reunification at all but is dreaming of fixing, perpetuating and internationalizing the division of the nation  so as to maintain the power in reliance upon outsiders.\r\n   The Korean nation will never tolerate the separatist, anti-reunification acts of the South Korean authorities. \r\n\r\n"

To this end, they concluded the updated \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" with the Japanese reactionaries and are putting the U.S. forces  present in Japan including the U.S. marines in Okinawa and the U.S. forces in the pacific on emergency alert for action.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They are now deploying massive armed forces in and around South Korea on the plea of filling up the \"vacuum of military power of the U.S. forces\" on the Korean peninsula caused by the Yugoslav crisis.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The former operation plan envisages five stages -- \"deterrence, strikes for neutralization, ground offensive operation, expansion of success in war and conclusion of war\". But the new \"operation plan 5027-98\"  is composed of six operation stages  including a stage of \"occupation rule after conclusion of war.\"   According to the plan, the U.S. have already formed the so-called \"South Korea-U.S. combined civil affairs command\" which will take charge of \"occupation rule\" under the South Korea-U.S. \"combined forces command\" in December last year.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The plan is also supplemented with \"formation of a second front\" and other operations for aggression on the DPRK.   The plan is a very bellicose, dangerous scenario and document of war designed to invent some pretext  for an preemptive attack and stamp out the socialist system of the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. are now extensively hurling armed forces equipped with all kinds of war means into Yugoslavia which is similar to the Korean peninsula in topographic features and examining the feasibility and effectiveness of the operation plan for a war of aggression on the DPRK, using even the mass-destruction weapons the use of which is banned internationally.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Yugoslav crisis is a test war to carry into practice \"operation plan 5027-98\" in Korea and a preliminary war for a second Korean war.\r\n   However the u.s. are making a misjudgment. The Korean peninsula is not the Balkans.\r\nIt is the unshakable faith and character of the Korean people and army to meet a challenge with thousand-fold annihilating strike and a war of aggression with a liberation war of justice.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. misjudge the quality of the Korean people rallied around the great brilliant commander in one mind in the spirit of human bomb and unleash a war of aggression, the Korean people will not miss the opportunity to rise up as one in the spirit of annihilating the enemy, the spirit of \"you shall die and I will stay alive,\" , deal a thousand-fold blow to the aggressors and accomplish the historic cause of national reunification, the cherished desire of the nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. aggressors and their followers  involved in carrying on \"operation plan 5027-98\" will be reduced to ashes  by flames of justice in the life and death war.\r\n   They  should clearly see  who is their rival and act with discretion. \r\n   \r\n"

So, narcotics can be found nowhere and smuggling it into other countries is not imaginable at all.\r\n   The DPRK is shocked by the Thai newspaper's faked-up propaganda that the DPRK processes and smuggles drug into Asia. What astonishes us all the more is the fact that the newspaper described the DPRK as a \"drug nightmare\".\r\n   In the article the newspaper again touched on the ephedrine issue that had  occurred in Thailand  in January last year.  At that time, our competent organ legally imported ephedrine through official proceedings under the approval of the UN international drug control council from the outset.
