            "content": "KPA navy command spokesman on S. Korea's anti-DPRK campaign \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the navy command of the Korean People's Army (KPA) issued a statement today over the armed conflict that took place on the west sea on June 15.   The spokesman says:   The South Korean authorities are continuing a vicious anti-DPRK smear campaign, misleading world opinion over the armed conflict that took place on the west sea on June 15.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They talk as if they had had no other choice but to respond to the gunfire started by KPA soldiers.   This is a sophism of those who have no shame.   The exchange of fire was an adventurous act for provocation of war which the South Korean authorities had planned, prepared in secrecy and promoted.   This is illustrated by the fact that \"Defence Minister\" Jo Song Thae, \"chairman of the joint chiefs of staff\" Kim Jin Ho and other  military leaders discussed the \"bump-and-push operation plan\" for the fighting and commanded the operation on the spot.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They staged a drill for the operation with many warships in the waters off Yonphyong Islet from June 4. They began making test naval provocations by ramming our warships on June 9 and escalated the degrees of the provocations from June 11.   Naval warships of the KPA contained their provocations each time with high vigilance and displayed strong patience and self-restraint lest the situation should develop into an exchange of gunfire.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Defence Minister, Jo Song Thae, swollen-headed with war fever, visited bellicose elements involved in the \"bump-and-push operation\" on June 12, gave them a \"pep talk\" and goaded them into more reckless provocations.   The  President, Kim Dae Jung, sent them a \"congratulatory message\" on a \"successful\" operation on June 10. Kim Jin Ho and other military leaders who were directing the operation called for not only ramming the northern warships but firing first and sinking them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   From the 11th the South Korean authorities began massing a big group of warships including tank-landing craft, destroyers and escort ships in the waters of the west sea where the incident took place.   From the morning of the 15th, they attempted to \"block the advance\" of our naval ships, disturbing their routine patrol on the basis of these preparations. When this proved to be futile, they entered into the \"bump-and-push operation\" accompanied by firing bullets and shells, according to the prearranged scenario from 9:12 of the same day.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In face of these reckless armed provocations of the  army, naval warships of the heroic Korean People's Army took a self-defence measure to deal crushing blows to them.   In that engagement, more than ten enemy battleships were either burned or severely damaged and they had no alternative but to flee, taking many dead bodies and remnants with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   No matter how hard the army may try to shift the blame for the incident onto us, they can neither conceal their steadily escalated armed provocations nor flee from their responsibility for having led the situation on the Korean peninsula to the brink of war under any circumstances.    In order to hide their shameful defeat in the engagement the enemy has instructed those officers and men who had participated in the \"operation\" to stay indoors and ordered them  to \"take such measures to keep military secrets\" as putting camouflage covers on the badly damaged battleships and military equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   However, they can never conceal their crimes as provocateurs and their miserable plight, no matter how strictly they may enforce press censorship and gag the witnesses, as it is impossible to hide the gimlet protruding from a sack.   The South Korean authorities should immediately stop such sinister anti-DPRK smear campaign as distorting the incident to mislead public opinion, and apologize to the nation, taking full responsibility for all the grave consequences arising from their intentional armed provocations.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We state once again clearly that we will never pardon anyone who encroaches upon our territory, even a blade of grass.   Our warning is that if the South Korean authorities persist in military confrontation, misjudging our self-restraint, they will suffer a bitterer defeat in face of merciless retaliatory strikes by our servicemen. \r\n\r\n"

According to Japan's newspaper Yomiuri Shimbun Thursday, the U.S. is scheming to continue dispatching warplanes including RC-135, EA-6b, AWACS and P-3C and warships of the 7th fleet such as a nuclear-powered submarine of \"Los Angeles\" class and aegis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Under this plan, the U.S. warplanes will all be flying to South Korea over June 17-18 while those vessels arriving to waters around the Korean peninsula in some days, the paper reported.  On Wednesday they also instructed an aircraft carrier, Kitty Hawk, in the Persian gulf after Yugoslav crisis, to move toward Yokosuka, Japan, to \"cope with the tense situation of the Korean peninsula.\"   Such massive reinforcement of the United States clearly reveals the invariable, aggressive nature of the U.S. war hawks seeking to ignite a war in Korea at any cost. \r\n\r\n"

Ever since the very day he began his revolutionary activities in his early years he has put his soul and life into the work to develop the WPK founded by the President Kim Il Sung into an invincible party.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this course he has prepared all the party members to be true loyal subjects and dutiful sons  and confidently ensured the oneness of the leader's idea and leadership within the party under the slogan of modeling the whole party on the Juche idea.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has made a glorious history of a statesman of brilliant commander type who has resolutely defended our socialism with the unique policy of giving priority to the army.

In this period he covered more than 300,000 km to give on-site guidance and it took him over 3,900 days, which is tantamount to over 10 years, to visit at least 7,400 units.   These units included party organs at all levels, construction sites of revolutionary places, units of the people's army, industrial establishments, co-op farms, scientific, educational, cultural, health and press institutions.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this period he took a short and uncomfortable sleep and took rice-balls as his meals, not having any holidays and rests.    In order to build an ideologically powerful socialist country, he proclaimed the program to model the whole society on the Juche idea in February, Juche 63 (1974), the first time of its kind in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe toured  in three days of July, Juche 57 (1968) over 10 revolutionary sites in Ryanggang Province which are associated with the President Kim Il Sung's exploits in the anti-Japanese revolutionary struggle.   Kim Jong Il gave on-site guidance on more than 1,900 occasions for the development of literature and arts, thus ushering in a great heyday of Juche-oriented literature and arts.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over the past 35 years he has guided the work at more than 1,900 units of the people's armed forces on the spot. In recent 5 years alone he traveled over 48,000 km to inspect more than 430 army units, thus significantly increasing the country's defence capabilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to make country rich and powerful, he gave valuable instructions to the hwanghae iron and steel complex more than 100 times in a little over one year and sent automation devices, elements and equipment on 30-odd  occasions, thus creating a model of comprehensive automation and seeing to it that it was followed by the nation's metal, chemical, building material and other industrial fields.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   For the development of agriculture, he guided the work on 10 co-op farms of 5 counties in a day. He traveled 800 km overnight to learn about the farming in 3 provinces and elaborate on the orientation and ways of applying Juche farming methods.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It was thanks to his on-site guidance that the world's famous west sea barrage was built in 5 years, Kwangbok Street, the May Day Stadium and 260 other construction projects were completed in a little over 2 years and a miracle of the 90s was reported in the first-stage construction site of the Anbyon Youth Power Station.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In January last year, he covered 2,400 km despite severe snowstorm to give on-site guidance to 19 industrial establishments in Jagang Province, thus proving the validity of self-reliance.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His historic guidance reached also scientific and research institutions. Recent years witnessed  more than 100 scientific and technological achievements of global significance, among them the successful launch of the first  satellite 100 percent with our own strength and technology. \r\n\r\n"

But, in this period, the revolutionary army of Korea has  been blessed with the wisest leadership of the great WPK and the party has enjoyed the most creditable backing and support of the revolutionary army.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Without this, our socialism would have collapsed and the country gone to ruin in  face of the unprecedented difficulties and trials.   But the Korean people are now dynamically accelerating the 2nd grand Chollima march  to build a powerful nation of Juche. Underlying this march is the might of the invincible party and the strong army that have been  built simultaneously  since 35 years back.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A review of the whole history of  Marshal Kim Jong Il's revolutionary activities shows that he has always given utmost importance to the revolutionary army while  guiding the work of the WPK.   It is his noble leadership over the revolution with priority given to the army to strengthen the party by strengthening the army and to establish the party trait through the display of revolutionary army trait. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n     It is thanks to this leadership that the army has grown to be an invincible one and its might and model have become the quality and  appearance of the WPK, with the result that the entire party membership have been prepared as stalwart soldiers.\r\n   Both the Worker's Party and the revolutionary army of Korea are now standing like an impregnable fortress in the confrontation with all class enemies including the imperialists, in checking the poisoning of corrupt capitalist ideas and in foiling the despicable slanders of the imperialist reactionaries.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe last 35 years  in the history of the Korean revolution are the history of the victory of the great revolutionary philosophy that the party means the army and vice versa. It is the great history in which the party building  has been pushed ahead along with the army building in accordance with this steel-like will and a sure guarantee has been provided for accomplishing the cause of Juche and building a powerful nation.   The Korean revolution which has the great history that began with rifles and the great party built with rifles will always emerge victorious. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

All this is due to the humiliating \"status of forces agreement\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pointing out that the U.S.  forces present in South Korea are allowed to occupy many facilities and areas  free of charge for an indefinite period, the statement  demanded return of them and payment of rent. Noting that the environment pollution in and around the U.S. military bases is  very serious, it urged the South Korean authorities to take measures to solve this problem. \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "There is no limit to our retaliatory blow to enemy\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 19 (KCNA) -- The South Korean authorities committed armed provocations against the north at the west sea of Korea at the instigation of the United States.   They infiltrated scores of warships of the army for more than ten consecutive days from June 4 for a \"bump and push operation.\"   On the 15th, they dispatched a group of reinforced warships to intentionally bump against warships of the navy of the Korean People's Army and fire some 150 shells and more than 7,000 machine-gun bullets at them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to a statement of the spokesman for the KPA navy command, in face of these armed provocations of the enemy, naval warships of the KPA took a self-defence measure to deal crushing blow to them.   In that engagement, more than ten enemy battleships were either burned or severely damaged and they had no alternative but to flee, taking many dead bodies and remnants with them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to hide their shameful defeat in the engagement, the enemy has instructed those officers and men  who had participated in the \"operation\" to stay indoors and ordered them to \"take such measures to keep military secrets\" as putting camouflage covers on the badly damaged battleships and military equipment.\r\n   However, they can never conceal their crimes as provocateurs and their miserable plight, no matter how strictly they may enforce press censorship and gag witnesses.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities should apologize to the nation, taking full responsibility for all the grave consequences arising from their intentional armed provocations.   It is our quality to answer \"retaliatory blow\" of the enemy with retaliatory blow, an all-out war with all-out war.   There is no limit to our retaliatory strike at the enemy and it is merciless. \r\n  \r\n"

Jon Pyong Ho, politburo member and secretary of the WPK Central Committee, made a report at the meeting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The start of the respected Kim Jong Il's work at the WPK Central Committee, the supreme headquarters of the Korean revolution, on June 19, Juche 53 (1964) was a historic event which provided a sure guarantee for strengthening and developing the WPK and carrying to completion the revolutionary cause of Juche, the reporter said, and went on:   He is an outstanding leader of the revolution and  a most experienced veteran statesman in the present times, who has 35 year-long career as head of the party, state and army.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHis greatest feat for the Korean revolution is that he has strengthened and developed the WPK into a revolutionary party of Juche type named after the great leader comrade Kim Il Sung and cemented the single-hearted unity of the party and the revolutionary ranks as firm as a rock.   His greatness has been more fully demonstrated especially in the recent five years of struggle.   His distinguished leadership over revolution with priority given to the army is a model of socialist politics and provides a decisive guarantee for victory of the Korean revolution.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe reporter said all the party members and other people and servicemen should single-heatedly uphold his ideas and leadership with loyalty and filial piety, cherishing deep in mind the unshakable faith that the bright future of the country and the nation and the final victory of the revolution are firmly guaranteed by his guidance.   Attending the meeting were Kim Yong Nam and other senior party and state officials. \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
