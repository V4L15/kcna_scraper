            "content": "Violation of human rights in \"ROK army\" disclosed\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Pyongyang, July 30 (KCNA) -- The propaganda department of the central committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea issued an indictment on July 21, disclosing ruthless violation of human rights in the \"ROK army,\" Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The indictment brought to light the facts that the successive dictators of South Korea conscripted a large number of patriotic students and brutally tortured and killed them.  It continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe forcible conscription of progressive patriotic students began in 1971 under the Park Chung-Hee dictatorship. It became all the more undisguised under the military dictatorial government of the \"fifth and sixth republics.\" Over 20,000 patriotic students were forcibly conscripted in one year of 1981 by Chun Doo Hwan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The authorities separated them from other conscripts   and treated them like criminals, putting  them to brutal torture and death. Nearly 2,000 students have been killed since 1980. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Over 1,500 youth and students were brutally punished on charges of the \"case of illegal organization\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe present barracks of the \"ROK army\" are the Oswiecim concentration camp of South Korean version, a medieval slaughter house where progressive and patriotic youth and students were brutally tortured and killed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is in the \"ROK army\" in which human rights violation is licensed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Human rights violation in the army is becoming all the more undisguised. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A death toll in the army alone by assault and physical torture which are encouraged under the pretext of \"establishing military discipline\" has stood at over 1,000 every year since 1995, or three cases on a daily average. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe physical torture in \"ROK army\" includes the \"Ppanppara\" that forces one in shorts only stand on one foot with arms spread in the midnight of cold winter, \"Ongdalsaem torture\" that induces one to break ice and jump into stream water, and \"frog catch\" that makes one lick an  ordure box and cesspool, with one's hands behind one's back. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Unable to bear human rights abuses in the army, many soldiers suicide or deserted barracks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   According to an official publication by the \"Ministry of National Defence,\" over 8,900 soldiers, nearly one division strong, were killed in accidents in the army for 16 years from 1980 to 1995. Most of them died because of violence and suicide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   9,339 soldiers deserted barracks from 1993 to august of 1998 and 70 percent of them fell victim to harsh violation of human rights in the army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The criminal acts of the successive dictatorial groups can never be pardoned. The Kim Dae Jung group should open to the public all the brutal slaughter in the army and stop criminal military violence and human rights violation immediately. \r\n\r\n\r\n"
