            "content": "DPRK Sends Back Japanese Woman \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 3 (KCNA) -- As already reported, Kazumi Kitagawa, a Japanese woman, illegally entered Sinuiju area of the DPRK after throwing herself into the River Amnok from a sighting boat during her tour of Dandong, China, and asked it to accept her request to seek refuge on Aug. 24, 2003.\r\n The results of the investigation made by the organ concerned said: Born in Usuki City, Oita Prefecture of Japan, she had been living in Naniwa Ward, Osaka City of Osaka Prefecture. She was forced by investigators of the Kyoto Public Security Investigation Department of the Japanese Public Security Investigation Agency to spy on the Aum Shinrikyo and the General Association of Korean Residents in Japan (Chongryon) from the spring of 2000. She was even mentally distressed due to sexual abuses by them. This prompted her to decide to come to the DPRK to evade the repeated persecution by the public security organ. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK side enabled her to live a stable life in an international hotel despite her illegal entry into the DPRK. While staying in the DPRK, she felt that she could no longer cause trouble to it and gave up her intention to seek refuge and expressed her wish to go back to Japan. From a humanitarian point of view, the DPRK took a measure of sending her back to Japan on Nov. 3. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Before her departure for home, she deeply reflected on her illegal intrusion into the DPRK border and apologized for it and thanked its government for warm treatment and lenient measure.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

The DPRK's unilateral abandonment of its nuclear program alone will not lead to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will closely watch how the U.S. will behave at the phase of \"action for action\".    \r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The policy has become a unique Korean-style policy of establishing a university. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The establishment of Kim Il Sung University on Oct. 1, Juche 35 (1946) provided a dependable base for training native cadres of the worker-peasant origin through its own efforts and opened up a bright prospect of expanding the base for training native cadres with it as a matrix.\r\n Referring to the exploits performed by Kim Il Sung for developing the university, he noted that the university has entered a new high stage of its development thanks to the wise guidance of leader Kim Jong Il who has successfully carried forward Kim Il Sung's Juche-based idea on education and his immortal leadership exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il wisely led the work of the university with his extraordinary wisdom, outstanding leadership ability, enthusiastic pursuits and energetic ideological and theoretical activities and converted the university into a genuine university of the party, the leader and the people both in name and reality as it has trained core cadres for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Juche as intended by Kim Il Sung. In this course Kim Jong Il has performed undying feats before the times and the history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter underscored the need for all the educational workers to give full play to the vitality of the famous work and effect a revolutionary turn in the university education as required by the Songun era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting was attended by Yang Hyong Sop, Kim Ki Nam and Ri Kwang Ho, department director of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, Kim Yong Jin, minister of Education, and Pyon Yong Rip, president of the Academy of Sciences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The KSDP has also conducted positive activities to achieve independent and peaceful reunification of the country through the great unity of the nation, he said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KSDP has energetically conducted external activities and established friendly and cooperative ties with foreign democratic political parties to create a favorable international environment for defending the country's sovereignty and achieving independent and peaceful reunification, thereby contributing to raising the voices of support and solidarity for the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KSDP has victoriously covered its 60 year-long path. This would be unthinkable without the noble benevolent politics and unbounded magnanimity of President Kim Il Sung and leader Kim Jong Il who reposed trust and showed deep care for the political parties and organizations which value independence and patriotism irrespective of their ideology and political views. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The KSDP should in the future, too, creditably discharge its noble mission and duty before the country and the people with ardent patriotism in order to push forward the building of a great prosperous powerful socialist nation and achieving solidarity and alliance with political parties and organizations in south Korea through the three forms of cooperation for national independence, peace against war and for reunification and patriotism under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\", the main spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, he concluded.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is arousing serious concern and vigilance among the public at home and abroad. \r\n Rodong Sinmun Thursday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: This is a clear proof that the Japanese reactionaries' moves for overseas aggression have reached an extremely reckless phase. This, at the same time, brings to light their reckless design for reinvasion aimed at realizing their wild ambition to dominate the DPRK and other Asian countries, availing themselves of the U.S. imperialists' war moves against the DPRK.  \r\n Their moves to stage a comeback to Korea under the pretext of taking a swift and efficient countermeasure to cope with \"the contingency in the areas surrounding Japan\" with main emphasis  on  \"the emergency on the Korean Peninsula\" have assumed unprecedentedly undisguised and substantial nature, going beyond the tolerance limit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their ulterior motive is to preempt an armed attack on the DPRK and, furthermore, fight a war of aggression against its other neighboring countries. Japan's claim to Tok Islet can be interpreted as part of their war scenario. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said war games under the simulated conditions of attacks on the DPRK are a grave provocation to the Koreans and other Asians and a danger signal hinting at reinvasion against the DPRK and other neighbors. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should the Japanese reactionaries launch a war of aggression against the DPRK and other neighbors at any cost, they will meet only self-destruction, the commentary warns.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n"
