We will answer a war with a war, says Rodong Sinmun today.\r\n   The news analyst says:\r\n   The dangerous military action of the U.S. is a mockery of and threat to the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. It is tantamount to a declaration of war.\r\n   The U.S. has no justification whatsoever to use armed forces against the DPRK. \r\n   The fiction of \"infiltration of an armed agent by north Korea\" advertised by the U.S. Military and the South Korean authority is a product of their anti-DPRK smear campaign and a pretext invented by them to use pressure and armed forces against the DPRK.\r\n   Through the military action the U.S. seeks to throw a wet blanket over the political zeal of the Korean people which has gained further momentum in the elections of deputies to the Supreme People's Assembly and tarnish the daily rising international prestige and influence of the DPRK.\r\n   If the enemies dare infringe upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK even a bit, the Korean people and the People's Army will mercilessly annihilate the aggressors with the iron hammer they made, tightening their belt, over the past 50 years. \r\n\r\n"

Among them are Ri Su Bok College of Chemical Engineering in Sunchon, Su Bok Senior Middle School, Ri Su Bok Youth Cooperative Farm and Su Bok-Dong.\r\n   There are many literary and art works including a feature film \"Eternal Youth\" which gives a vivid description of his feat in battles and a song \"Age of hero was 18.\"\r\n   He proved the valuableness of the party, the leader and the fatherland by laying down his life.

Korea's unemployment problem\r\nPyongyang, July 29 (KCNA) -- The Propaganda Department of the Central Committee of the National Democratic Front of South Korea (NDFSK) released a statement on the unemployment problem of South Korea, Seoul-based radio Voice of National Salvation said.\r\n   It offered detailed materials showing the serious unemployment situation, conditions of jobless people and the cause of the disaster.\r\n   The statement said in part:\r\n   Unemployment had been confined only to producers until South Korea was put under trusteeship of the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Since then, however, it has swepted all domains of South Korea.\r\n   More than 16,000 people have lost their jobs at city and country banks and some 8,700 public servants were dismissed from their jobs as of the end of May. Tens of thousands of public servants are likely to be dismissed soon throughout South Korea.\r\n   According to an official announcement made by the authorities, the number of the unemployed reached 1.6 million as of the end of June. But more than 2 million people who are able to work but find it very difficult to get jobs, 1,960,000 people who do housework, unable to get jobs, and 400,000 people who have had no occupation since they graduated from universities and colleges bring the number to some 6.3 million.\r\n   If some 1.7 million people who get jobs only four or five days on a monthly average are included, the number reaches more than 8 million.\r\n   The figure is more than 17 percent of the South Korean population. This means that South Korea tops the world's list in unemployment.\r\n   The unemployment problem will continue uninterruptedly and become all the more serious in South Korea.\r\n   Due to business bankruptcies caused by the economic \"restructuring,\" 500,000-600,000 workers are likely to be dismissed from big businesses alone this year and massive layoffs are also expected from minor businesses.\r\n   South Korea, under the control of the IMF, has turned into a veritable hell, hit by waves of unemployment.\r\n   The number of those who sleep in the open air has jumped more than ten times that before the introduction of the IMF trusteeship. The number of those who are unable to pay tuition fees has increased 59 percent in Seoul and those who leave university in mid-course are more than 19,000 throughout South Korea or up 70 percent than those last year.\r\n   Those who eke out a living at the cost of their blood and internal organs have increased 67 percent over last year and those who commit crimes to make their living jumped 6 times.\r\n   As of the end of June, some 600 people starved to death in Seoul and 5,700 in all parts of South Korea. South Korea has led the world in suicide cases, too.\r\n   The United States is the very one who has brought economic bankruptcy and waves of unemployment to South Korea.\r\n   It intentionally brought a financial crisis to South Korea for the purpose of reforming in the American way its crippled, bubble economy dependent on foreign monopoly capital and swallowing it up lock, stock and barrel.\r\n   It is the present regime of South Korea that allowed the U.S. infiltration into the South Korean economy through the IMF.\r\n   Suffering from massive layoffs, the South Korean people have drawn a serious lesson that colonial subordination and dependence on foreign capital bring them to doom and seeking independence and self-reliance is their only choice.\r\n   They should turn out in the struggle for putting an end to the U.S. colonial rule, the IMF trusteeship and the traitorous regime. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
