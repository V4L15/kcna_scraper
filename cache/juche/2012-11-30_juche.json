They held a \"ceremony for victorious battle\" on Yonphyong Island on the second anniversary of the Yonphyong Island shelling incident, making the tensions run high on the Korean Peninsula once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group resorted to tightening military tie-ups with foreign forces, while raising a hue and cry over someone's \"threat\" and \"provocation.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the outset of the year, the military warmongers including Jong Sung Jo, chairman of the puppet joint chiefs of staff, went to the U.S., their master, and signed the \"guidelines for strategic plan\" for the \"plan for jointly coping with local provocation\" the content of which is the involvement of not only the U.S. forces in south Korea but those in Japan and the Pacific in any local armed conflict on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfterwards, the master and his stooge had a confab in Seoul and concluded a contract on standard enforcement of the \"agreement on mutual military support\" which drastically simplified the procedures of wartime military support.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReaffirming the guidelines which were specified in \"2015 strategic alliance\" at the recent U.S.-south Korea military committee, the Lee group said that it would not pardon someone's provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt the annual security consultative council meeting, they had a confab over the issues of promoting mutual operation of the command control system of the allies and intensifying joint military exercises on islands in the West Sea of Korea, staging joint military exercises in south Korea for demonstrating improved alliance, reviving the now defunct \"UN Forces Command\", hurling the U.S. forces from around the world in case of contingency on the Korean Peninsula and beefing up the extended deterrent.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Lee group initially signed the military agreement with Japan in secrecy early in May under the backstage manipulation of the U.S. It brought this issue up for discussion at the \"State Council meeting\" under the general command of Chongwadae in late June and actively dealt with it at the \"governmental\" level.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt introduced into the waters off south Korea the Japan \"Self-Defense Forces\" under the pretext of the exercise for \"proliferation security initiatives of weapons of mass destruction\" aimed at blocking maritime blockade on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn October the group of traitors made public a \"missile guidance agreement\" in which it declared that it would extend the missile range to 800 km from the previous 300 km so as to strike the entire areas of the northern half of Korea, increase the weight of warhead for the higher striking efficiency and develop and possess new unmanned attack plane. This was an open provocation little different from its declaration to preempt an attack on the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tScenarios for the invasion of the DPRK have been rounded off down to the details and the arms buildup has been stepped up. At the same time, joint military exercises have been staged with the U.S. imperialist aggression troops one after another the year round. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPeace and stability have not settled on the Korean Peninsula and the worst crisis persisted in which a war may break out any time this year due to the confrontation and war moves of the Lee group which put the successive puppet rulers into the shade."
