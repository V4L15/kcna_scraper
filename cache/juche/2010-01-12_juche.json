Very satisfied to hear that its employees have been producing various kinds of quality processed meat by making use of all by-products to supply them to the servicepersons, he appreciated their merits.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The servicepersons boundlessly loyal to the Party and the revolution have built many edifices of the Songun era in different parts of the country under the slogan \"Let us take upon ourselves both the defence of the country and socialist construction!\", making enormous contributions to building a rich and powerful nation, he noted, saying: The feats performed by our army will go down with the history of building a thriving nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He advanced important tasks that would serve as guidelines in managing and operating the farm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The recently-built pig farms are modern livestock bases of practicability as they were designed through strict application of the principle of scientific accuracy and rely on stable feed sources, he said, adding that they provide a sure guarantee for considerably increasing the livestock production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to produce more pork in the farm, it is important to thoroughly establish a scientific management system based on the advanced technology, he said, underlining the need to put the pig raising on a scientific basis to this end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that it is essential to secure ample anti-epidemic facilities and establish the strict anti-epidemic system as anti-epizootic work is of special importance in increasing the livestock production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Today our country has such solid material and technical foundations for radically increasing the pork production as the well-organized breeding system able to supply enough piglets of good breed, he said, calling for conducing the raising of pigs in a big way by taking advantage of such favorable conditions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He earnestly urged all units of the KPA to launch on a wide scale the drive to further develop the stockbreeding and provide abundant diet to the precious soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Generals of KPA Hyon Chol Hae and Ri Myong Su."

Minju Joson Tuesday observes in a signed commentary in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said findings go to clearly prove the undeniable historic facts that Japan set up the above-said system for the Imperial Japanese Army during the Second World War, the first of its kind in world history, and enforced the policy of sexual slavery.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is more than 20 years since the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army began to be brought up for discussion in the international arena but still remains unsettled. This is attributable to the behavior of Japan which has not only refused to admit its crimes it committed in the past but run the whole gamut of tricks to evade the responsibility for them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The truth of history is sure to be clarified whether the Japanese reactionaries like or not and their evil doings will rebound on themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that it has become clear the most evil doings in history were perpetrated by the Japanese government and military in an organized manner Japan can never evade its state responsibility for them and it deserves a stern punishment under international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The word play being resorted to by Japan over its past crimes only betrays its moral vulgarity in the eyes of the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Japan would be well advised to promptly opt for redressing its past crimes as required by justice and human conscience and bear in mind that this offers it the last chance of resurrection."

The question bewildered him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il said that every house of the farm villages had usually hung out an electric light under the eaves in summer evenings with the family members sitting in a circle, making straw ropes and chattering away happily, during which chickens had pecked at feed in the lighted yard. He then said they should make use of the chicken's behavior to fatten it up.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that chickens would not go to roost early in the evening and keep feeding when coops were kept lighted, he noted that it did not need much work. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After his guidance the official began raising chickens in the way indicated by the leader and came to know that a 63-day-old chicken gained 600 to 800 more grams in weight than in the previous way."

            "content": "Minju Joson revela nuevos datos de las ex \"consoladoras sexuales\"\r\nPyongyang, 12 de enero (ATCC) --   Recientemente, los investigadores del \"Centro japones sobre la responsabilidad por la guerra\" abrieron una pesquisa sobre 2 mil libros, que contienen los registros de guerra y las reminiscencias, archivados en la biblioteca de la dieta.\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun su resultado, aparecieron en 260 libros los datos sobre las ex \"consoladoras sexuales\" para el ejercito japones, que llaman la atencion de la sociedad internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el rotativo Minju Joson publico en su edicion de este martes un comentario individual que sigue: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun las fuentes extranjeras, los datos recien revelados tienen gran valor historico porque narran en detalles que los gendarmes japoneses estaban a cargo del examen medico sobre las \"consoladoras\" y operaban las \"casas de cita\" con ellas, en particular, el ejercito japones estuvo profundamente involucrado en el abuso sexual y otras vejaciones provenientes de ese sistema de esclavitud sexual. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe esta manera, se confirmo claramente como innegable hecho historico que en el periodo de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, Japon practicaba la politica de \"esclavizacion sexual\" tras establecer el regimen de \"consoladoras\" para su ejercito, nunca visto antes en este planeta. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa pasaron mas de 20 anos desde cuando se comenzo a tratar en la arena internacional el problema de \"consoladoras\". Sin embargo, este problema no ha sido resuelto hasta la fecha, porque Japon se niega a reconocer sus crimenes historicos eludiendo de una manera u otra las responsabilidades por el respecto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Quieran o no los reaccionarios japoneses, la verdad de la historia sera aclarada y a los culpables les tocaran castigos correspondientes a sus crimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que quedo claro que esa fechoria peor de la historia fue organizada y ejecutada por el gobierno y la capa militar de Japon, este no puede evadir nunca la responsabilidad estatal sino debe ser enjuiciado en virtud del derecho internacional. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi Japon recurre hasta a estas alturas a la charlataneria en cuanto a sus crimenes del pasado, demostraria por si solo a la sociedad internacional su bajeza moral. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl escuchar la demanda de la justicia y la conciencia de la humanidad, Japon debe proceder ahora mismo a la liquidacion de sus crimenes del pasado dandose cuenta de que en ella esta el ultimo chance de su renacimiento."

Tales maniobras insinuan abiertamente que las autoridades surcoreanas pretenden seguir marchando tambien nuevo ano por el camino de enfrentamiento y guerra contra el Norte como lo hicieron el ano pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa situacion comprueba claramente quien es el obstaculizador del mejoramiento de las relaciones Norte-Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAgravar continuamente las relaciones intercoreanas con los ejercicios de enfrentamiento y guerra no es mas que una tonteria de los que no pueden prever el cambio de la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana ni el futuro de si mismos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas fuerzas anti-reunificacion del Sur de Corea deben actuar con prudencia reflexionando seriamente de la grave consecuencia que emanara de sus ejercicios militares vendepatrias que desafian a la epoca."
