Being a group of such political charlatans, the GNP came out to take issue with the summit and oppose it, far-fetchedly asserting that it is to serve the \"election purpose\" for fear that it may fail in its bid to seek \"presidency\" due to this event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is rather good that the GNP gentries have not shown any will to come to Pyongyang. The event for reunification would be more meaningful without traitors keen to spoil it.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
