            "content": "S. Korea's Inhuman Act against DPRK Inhabitants Condemned\r\n Pyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- The south Korean puppet group kidnapped a boat and inhabitants of the DPRK who had gone adrift in the West Sea of Korea, unreasonably detained them, conducted an operation to force them to \"defect\" to the south and finally refused to repatriate some of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t The C.C., the Red Cross Society of the DPRK Monday released a statement disclosing the truth about the inhuman act perpetrated by the group. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Referring to the brigandish abduction of inhabitants of the DPRK by the puppet forces, the statement said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 31 inhabitants left Tongpho-ri port in Kangryong County, South Hwanghae Province aboard a 5-ton fishing boat (27 hp) on February 5 to gather shellfish. They anchored their boat close to the Jincho lighthouse near Tak Islet and Taesuap Islet in the waters off Pupho of Kangryong County under the control of the DPRK due to bad weather. But when they found themselves in danger, they lifted anchor and made desperate efforts to get rid of the unfavorable situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was exactly at that time that three high speed boats of the south Korean puppet navy appeared all of a sudden and threw hooks on the fishing boat, pulling it to their boats in a twinkle of an eye.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The crewmen and inhabitants of the DPRK repeatedly told the soldiers of the puppet army that they went adrift owing to the bad weather and they were in the waters under the control of the DPRK at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the soldiers of the puppet army, paying no heed to their assertion, recklessly jumped over the fishing boat before breaking the gate and windows of the steering room with butts and clubs and mercilessly beating the inhabitants. They tried to pull the boat and flee away southward in a bid to forcibly transfer the inhabitants to warships of the puppet army which had been on standby.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the inhabitants made a strong protest against such act, chanting \"We will stay on our boat until our death. We will go back home,\" the soldiers of the puppet army threatened them with arms. After pouncing upon the inhabitants in group, the soldiers of the puppet army transferred them to one of their warships before taking flight towards Inchon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t More than 10 warships of the puppet navy were combat-ready in the nearby waters at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The truth that the fishing boat was in the waters under the control of the DPRK is clearly proved by the fact that the puppet soldiers kidnapped the fishing boat and inhabitants before taking them southward for a long while and transferring them to their warship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The inhabitants of the DPRK never crossed the \"northern limit line\", an illegal line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They explained in detail how they went adrift from the outset and were unanimous in demanding that they be repatriated to the DPRK, the statement said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bringing to light the puppet group's mean operation to force the inhabitants to \"defect\" to the south, the statement went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities of Chongwadae, the Ministry of Defence and the Ministry of Unification admitted that the inhabitants and boat of the DPRK went adrift due to the bad weather and all the 31 inhabitants wished to return home. South Korean media reported as it happened.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the puppet group kept them in custody for more than 50 days in south Korea, refusing to send them back to the north. It talked about \"investigation\" after forming a \"joint investigation group\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then they were busy with a sinister operation to force the detainees to \"defect\" to the south. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the inhabitants did not comply with their demand, they threatened and blackmailed against them. They took girls to a secluded room before pressurizing them to \"defect\" to the south. They made no scruple of threatening them with sexual abuses and insulting them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Craftily taking advantage of family relations, they told the parents of the children that they wished to stay in the south while telling the children the same lie that their parents wanted to remain there. This was aimed to create distrust and discord between kinsmen and put them to extreme psychological and mental torture. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Finally they let human scum persuade the inhabitants to \"defect\" to the south and plugged even agents for psychological warfare of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces into the \"defection operation\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement dismissed the \"will for defection\" allegedly expressed by four detainees as a fabrication. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When inhabitants of the DPRK made a request to meet the four people, the puppet group told the lie that \"they can meet with each other in Haeju as they would be repatriated via Panmunjom and the four people would go back aboard their boat.\" They even did not allow the elder brother to meet his younger brother who was among the four people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Needless to say, the puppet group behaved so for fear of the truth about the above-said operation being brought to light. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement referred in detail to the fact that the group used the unexpected disaster the inhabitants met for its sinister purpose of confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group insisted on discussions of the issue of the confirmation of face-to-face meeting after the repatriation of 27 inhabitants and the repatriation of 27 inhabitants via Panmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK side sent a notice again accusing the south side of its unreasonable attitude and demanding that it send back all the detainees aboard their boat through West Sea of Korea and allow the face-to-face meeting. But the south side's authorities were opposed to the demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The aim sought by the puppet group through this provocation was to escalate confrontation with fellow countrymen, scuttle the north-south dialogue and chill the atmosphere of improving the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group's operation was prompted by its sinister intention to hurt the high prestige of the DPRK and disturb the mind-set of its people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Red Cross of south Korea had better not to allow itself to serve the purpose of the puppet group's despicable policy of confrontation with compatriots and to be reduced to a plaything."

Debido a malas condiciones climáticas, vararon en las inmediaciones del faro de Jincho, cerca de las islas Tak y Taesuap en el mar frente a Pupho del distrito de Kangryong en la zona marítima de la RPDC. Al encontrarse en la crisis, volvieron a zarpar e hicieron ingentes esfuerzos por liberarse de la situación desfavorable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquel entonces, aparecieron de repente tres lanchas de alta velocidad de las fuerzas navales títeres, que en un santiamén pusieron en gancho el barco norcoreano y lo arrastraron. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos tripulantes y pobladores norcoreanos insistieron reiteradamente en que el barco se fue a la deriva por mal tiempo y que estaban en la zona marítima de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los marinos títeres subieron sin qué ni para qué al barco, rompieron con culatas y garrotes la puerta y las ventanillas de la cámara de timonel y dieron golpes a los habitantes norcoreanos. Y arrastraron el barco hacia la parte Sur como si escaparan y pretendieron trasladarlos a la fuerza a los buques títeres que lo esperaban. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los habitantes norcoreanos protestaron que \"quedaremos hasta la muerte en nuestro barco y regresaremos a la patria\", los soldados surcoreanos les apuntaron el fusil, se arrojaron en grupos sobre ellos para trasladarlos a sus buques y los llevaron a Inchon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn aquellos momentos en esa zona marítima estaban en la disposición de combate más de 10 buques de las fuerzas navales títeres. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho, de que los marinos títeres secuestraron a los norcoreanos y su barco y los trasladaron a sus buques después de llevarlos por algún tiempo a la parte Sur, muestra que en aquel entonces nuestro barco estaba en la zona marítima de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos pesqueros norcoreanos no pasaron el ilícita \"línea de límite al Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos moradores norcoreanos, secuestrados forzadamente por los títeres surcoreanos, explicaron detalladamente desde el principio el curso de la deriva y exigieron por unanimidad devolver a sí mismos a la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Casa Azul y las autoridades de los ministerios de Defensa Nacional y de Reunificación reconocieron que 31 pesqueros norcoreanos y su barco se dieron a la deriva por el mal tiempo y que todos ellos desearon regresar. Y los medios de prensa surcoreanos también lo informaron. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los títeres surcoreanos organizaron un \"grupo de investigación conjunta\" y retuvieron a los norcoreanos durante más de 50 días bajo el pretexto de la \"averiguación\" de la verdad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe aferraron groseramente al \"sometimiento\" a los retenidos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los ciudadanos norcoreanos no aceptaban su demanda de quedarse en el suelo surcoreano, les ejercieron amenaza y chantaje, y a la larga, llevaron a las muchachas a los lugares apartados, donde les cometieron crímenes sexuales o insultos personales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos títeres aprovecharon astutamente las relaciones familiares de los retenidos: mintieron a los padres que sus hijos tienen la voluntad de quedarse en el Sur de Corea, y a los hijos que sus padres quieren hacerlo. Con tales palabras mentirosas sembraron la discordia y la desconfianza entre los consanguíneos y les dieron sufrimientos psicológicos y mentales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemás, movilizaron a las escorias humanas e introdujeron hasta los agentes psicológicos de tropas agresoras norteamericanas para \"someterlos\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa parte Sur dice que los 4 de los retenidos norcoreanos expresaron la \"voluntad de sometimiento\", pero esto también es una pura mentira. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCuando los habitantes norcoreanos preguntaban de los 4 restantes, los títeres dijeron que \"ustedes regresarán por vía de Phanmunjom y los demás 4 volverían con el barco, y por fin, se encontrarán en Haeju\". Y negaron el encuentro entre los hermanos separados en esos dos grupos, porque se preocuparon de la revelación de su intriga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de los títeres abusa de tal desastre inesperado de los habitantes norcoreanos al malsano objetivo de confrontación fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Insistió en que después de devolver ante todo a las 27 personas a sus casas puede consultar el problema de la afirmación de entrevista de otros 4 y discutir el regreso de 27 por vía Phanmunjom.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t La parte Norte envió de nuevo un aviso en el cual se refirió a la injusta actitud de la parte Sur y exigió a las autoridades surcoreanas el regreso de todos ellos con su barco por las aguas del Mar Oeste y la afirmación de entrevista de 4 personas, pero, la parte Sur lo rechazó sin ton ni son.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA través de tales atrocidades provocativas, los títeres surcoreanos intentan agravar más la confrontación fratricida, frustrar el diálogo con el Norte y desalentar el ambiente de mejoramiento de las relaciones N-S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTambién, tratan de difamar el alto prestigio de la RPDC y confundir el sentir de los norcoreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Sociedad de la Cruz Roja del Sur de Corea no debe convertirse en el servidor y ejecutor de la política de confrontación fratricida de los títeres."
