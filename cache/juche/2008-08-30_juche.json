            "content": "S. Korean Authorities' Farce of \"Inviting Divided Families\" Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, August 29 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society issued a statement on Friday to denounce the south Korean authorities for recently holding a \"function of inviting divided families on the occasion of August 15.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Referring to the fact that the south Korean puppet Ministry of Unification, a Red Cross organization and the so-called \"Committee for the People from the Five Provinces in North Korea\" were busying themselves \"consoling divided families\" in different parts of south Korea from August 13, the statement said that this is, in fact, nothing but a clumsy trick and a burlesque to evade the blame for bedeviling the inter-Korean relations and suspending the reunion of separated families and their relatives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such humanitarian work as the reunion of separated families and their relatives had been brisk between the north and the south since the publication of the historic June 15 joint declaration, it said, and noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was envisaged this year to more extensively conduct such humanitarian work as increasing the number of those involved in the reunion of separated families and their relatives and its frequency, arranging June 15 special reunion and video exchange of correspondence and completing the reunion centre at Mt. Kumgang resort according to the October 4 declaration and the agreement reached upon between the Red Cross organizations of both sides to implement it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As soon as the Lee Myung Bak group came to power, it totally negated the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration supported by all the fellow countrymen and obstructed their implementation, thus mercilessly dampening the hope of the separated families and their relatives and destroying the foundation for settling the humanitarian issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The group of traitors claimed that the \"purpose of the function\" was \"to explain their policy toward the north and seek the understanding of it\" only to reveal themselves that it is to justify their confrontation with the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The deceptive \"invitational function\" was an intolerable mockery of the separated families and their relatives and it would only add pain to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is more serious is that the south Korean authorities are abusing the \"function\" as a platform for conducting extremely malignant anti-DPRK propaganda in a bid to incite hostility toward the DPRK under the pretext of \"consoling\" the \"divided families.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their moves to escalate confrontation with the DPRK are further deteriorating the inter-Korean relations and beclouding the prospect of settling the humanitarian issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities are truly interested in the issue of separated families and their relatives, they should roll back their treacherous policy for confrontation with the north and opt to implement the historic June 15 joint declaration and October 4 declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The legend being handed down orally, \"Arirang\" came into being.\r\n People had widely sung \"Arirang\", creating local varieties such as \"Sodo Arirang\" (Phyongan Province), \"Tanchon Arirang\" (Hamgyong Province), \"Kangwondo Arirang\" (Kangwon Province) and \"Milyang Arirang\" (Kyongsang Province). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical among them is \"Arirang\", which has been known to the world as the symbol of the Korean folk songs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Arirang\" is played in various forms including an independent song, orchestra music, film music and dance music. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Many folk songs like \"Arirang\" have been created one after another in the DPRK, where the Juche-oriented literature and art are efflorescing as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Among them are \"Arirang on Pass Chol\", \"Arirang for Army-People Unity\", \"Arirang for Prosperity\", \"Arirang of National Reunification\" in reflection of the sentiment of the Songun Korea. These songs with rich ideological content are wide in thematic spheres and strong in national coloring, which are run through with gentle melody and solemn and earnest tone colour. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n \"Arirang\" and songs of its genre, precious cultural inheritance of the nation, are powerfully encouraging the Korean people in their efforts for achieving the reunification of the country and building a great, prosperous and powerful nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
