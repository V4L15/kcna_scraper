Esto es el castigo merecido a sus crimenes inauditos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas lagrimas de cocodrilo de los conservadores surcoreanos constituyen un insulto y desafio a las otras de sangre derramadas por la poblacion surcoreana durante 4 anos de mandato de Park Geun-hye. En este periodo, los habitantes sufrieron incontables desgracias y sufrimientos siendo victimas de las politicas antipopulares de la traidora. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante mil 73 dias desde el hundimiento del ferry \"Sewol\", los familiares de victimas derramaron lagrimas de sangre. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, Park Geun-hye y la camarilla conservadora les ofendieron con expresiones como \"intento de recibir mas retribucion\" y describiendolos de \"fuerzas malvadas\" y \"agitadores politicos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta el momento de expulsarse de Chongwadae, la diabla Park desafio a la poblacion levantada en la lucha por su dimision disparateando que \"sera esclarecida la verdad\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los complices de ella intentan absurdamente fabricar el segundo \"poder\" de Park Geun-hye. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs inocultable la naturaleza abominable de la banda conservadora que en complicidad de Park, convirtio la sociedad surcoreana en el lugar donde campea la injusticia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos habitantes de diferentes estratos del Sur de Corea deben frustrar tajantemente el intento de reagruparse de las fuerzas conservadoras sin dejarse enganar ante las lagrimas de cocodrilo de estas."
