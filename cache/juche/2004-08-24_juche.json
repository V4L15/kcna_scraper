            "content": "DPRK Foreign Ministry Spokesman Blasts Bush's Reckless Remarks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 23 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Monday as regards the recent vituperation let loose by U.S. President Bush against the supreme headquarters of the DPRK:\r\n Bush during his recent election campaign in Wisconsin State again let loose such outbursts as hurling malignant slanders and calumnies at the supreme headquarters of the DPRK. He asserted that it is necessary for the U.S., China, Japan, south Korea and Russia to unite and they are urging \"the tyrant\" to disarm himself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This can not be construed as remarks made by a politician with sound reason and sensibility to reality but as a base tongue-lashing that can be made only by the stupid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush who styles himself president of a super power went the lengths of decrying the supreme headquarters of a sovereign state and saying this or that of it unbecoming for his position. This clearly proves that the DPRK was quite right when it commented that he is a political imbecile bereft of even elementary morality as a human being and a bad guy, much less being a politician. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was none other than Bush who started wars in Iraq and other parts of the world to commit genocide as he pleases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's assumption of office turned a peaceful world into a pandemonium unprecedented in history as it is plagued with a vicious circle of terrorism and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush is a tyrant that puts Hitler into the shade and his group of such tyrants is a typical gang of political gangsters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is, therefore, by no means fortuitous that Bush is ridiculed and censured as an idiot, an ignorant, a tyrant and a man-killer not only in the U.S. but in various parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's recent remarks openly demanding the DPRK to disarm itself clearly indicate that his utterances that the U.S. has no intention to invade north Korea and it would never attack north Korea are nothing but a gimmick as they are hypocrisy and a deceptive artifice to fool the world public. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He, in the final analysis, clearly disclosed that it is the real intention of the U.S. to bring down the system in the DPRK by force though everything in the world may change. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Bush's assertion that the U.S. is demanding the DPRK disarm itself in unity with other countries participating in the six-party talks once again discloses the real aim sought by the U.S. in the framework of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The meeting of the working group for the six-party talks can not be opened because the U.S. has become more undisguised in pursuing its hostile policy towards the DPRK, backtracking from all agreements and common understanding reached at the third round of the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush group has betrayed its true colors once again though it is directly responsible for properly laying a foundation for the talks. This made it quite impossible for the DPRK to go to the talks and deprived it of any elementary justification to sit at the negotiating table with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality today substantially convinces the army and people of the DPRK that the Songun policy of the Workers' Party of Korea is entirely just and heightens their faith and confidence in it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No one can and will replace them in defending the country and the nation and Korean style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will increase thousand times its capability for self defense, the people's life and sole, to frustrate the extremely escalating moves of the U.S. to isolate and stifle it.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

With nothing can their will and desire be checked and frustrated, Rodong Sinmun Monday stresses in a signed article.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The historic June 15 joint declaration solemnly clarified at home and abroad that the reunification of the country would be achieved independently by the united efforts of the Korean nation responsible for it. This reflected the unanimous aspiration and will of all the Koreans to reunify the country by the nation itself, rejecting any domination and intervention of outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independent reunification can only be achieved by the struggle to smash the outside forces' moves for aggression, domination, interference and obstructions. The idea of \"By our nation itself,\" the core of the June 15 joint declaration, exceptionally enhanced all Koreans' consciousness of national independence and rapidly fanned up the anti-U.S. atmosphere nationwide. The south Korean people have vigorously turned out in the struggle against the U.S. that is running amuck to stifle the fellow countrymen in the north and bring a disaster of a nuclear war to the Korean nation and interfering in and hindering the issues of north-south relations such as north-south cooperation and exchange. This is the offspring of the unprecedentedly enhanced consciousness of national independence and desire for independent reunification after the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the June 15 joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the realistic task for implementing the cause of national reunification to further strengthen national cooperation and continue to develop national reconciliation, cooperation and the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Koreans should firmly unite and resolutely conduct a nationwide struggle to check and frustrate the maneuvers of the outside forces and anti-reunification forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The whole Korean nation should bravely stage a movement to achieve national reconciliation and cooperation and independent reunification by the concerted efforts of the nation, holding higher the banner of \"By our nation itself.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Since then, it has remained true to the idea and principle of the movement and exerted positive efforts for its unity and development.\r\n President Kim Il Sung contributed a treatise titled \"The Non-aligned Movement Is a Mighty Anti-imperialist Revolutionary Force of Our Times\" to the inaugural issue of the Argentine magazine Guidebook to the Third World dated December 16, 1975. In the work, he expounds in a comprehensive way not only the character, position, significance and role of the movement but also tasks and ways to expand and develop it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He saw to it that the First Conference of Ministers of Education and Culture of Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries, the Second Conference of Ministers and Top Officials in Physical Education and Sport of Non-aligned Countries and several other meetings were successfully held in Pyongyang. At the meetings he made public various works including \"Non-aligned And Developing Countries Should Solve the Agricultural Problem through Their Own Efforts\" (August 26, 1981), \"The Non-aligned And Developing Countries Must Build National Cultures under the Banner of Independence And Sovereignty\" (September 26, 1983), \"For the Development of Physical Education And Sport in the Non-aligned Countries\" (July 8, 1986) and \"For the Development of the Non-aligned Movement\" (June 20, 1986). He thus gave clear-cut answers to the questions arising in increasing economic and technical cooperation and exchange among the Non-aligned and other developing countries and realizing the global independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President also took measures to dispatch able experts to Non-aligned and developing countries so as to render sincere assistance to their agriculture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK was elected as vice-chairman country in the 12th Non-aligned Summit held in September 1998. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now it is striving to strengthen and develop the movement as member nation of the Coordinating Bureau of Non-aligned Countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under support of the DPRK government, the Pyongyang Film Festival of the Non-aligned and Other Developing Countries has been held once every two or three years since 1987 under the slogan \"For Independence, Peace and Friendship\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Non-aligned and developing countries fully support the independent foreign policy of the DPRK and the efforts of the Korean people for the independent and peaceful reunification of the country.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
