Kumgang areas, ensuring speedy and smooth communications and cutting down the time of customs clearance with a view to contributing to the inter-Korean cooperation projects in those areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The talks also discussed the issue of fixing peaceful waters and waters for joint fishing in the West Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side advanced a fair and aboveboard proposal for setting the waters between the maritime boundary guarded by the KPA and the \"northern limit line\" asserted by the south side as peaceful waters and fixing waters for joint fishing inside them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This proposal based on the recognition of the complicated situation in the West Sea reflects the desire of all Koreans to make the West Sea a peaceful one free from source of conflicts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a landmark proposal as it makes it possible to fix a \"special zone for peace and cooperation in the West Sea\" as required by the June 15 era of reunification and reenergize north-south cooperation and exchange and thus promote to the full the interests and prosperity common to the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side, however, set forth a proposal for fixing waters for joint fishing reflecting its intention to set them deep inside the territorial waters of the north side on the basis of the illegal \"northern limit line.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south side's unreasonable proposal met a strong rebuff from the north side. As a result, they failed to reach an agreement on fixing waters for joint fishing and peaceful waters in the West Sea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The north side brought to light the injustice of the south side's proposal and vehemently denounced the south side for its improper attitude of persisting in its old stand dating back to the era of confrontation, going against the era of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Both sides agreed to further discussions on matters related to fixing those waters in the future.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
