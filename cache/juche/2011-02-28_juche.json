They should also clearly show the praiseworthy appearance of the Korean young people who are brilliantly translating the behests and the ideal of the leader into reality, fluttering the flag of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League."

Food experts warned that the food shock would be a more serious economic problem than the oil shock.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The international community has made efforts for solving the food problem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Some time ago, the vice president of Burundi said at an agricultural meeting that the government has launched on a new plan for increasing the agricultural production. Saying that the country has potentialities enough to raise the agricultural production, he underscored the need to improve the farming methods to produce more grains.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Venezuela has set it as one of the government's main tasks to ensure food security. The government plans to establish a regular food supply system and boost the agricultural production this year by increasing state assistance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t From the beginning of the year, China has directed much effort to developing agriculture. The country issued an urgent notice for ensuring a stable agricultural output and adopted a decision for reconditioning electric power networks in the countryside.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Other countries have also taken measures for solving the food problem with increased agricultural production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Discussions and measures concerning the food crisis have been made worldwide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Bilateral and multilateral cooperation and exchange have also been brisk in the fields of agricultural production, science and technology."
