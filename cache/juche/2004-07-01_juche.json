            "content": "Precious Cultural Heritage of Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson on June 27 ran an article titled \"Mural paintings dating back to the period of Koguryo are precious cultural heritage which the Korean nation boasts before the world\" written by the History Faculty of Kim Il Sung University.\r\n These mural paintings are precious artifacts created and developed by the Korean nation, the article said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ancient Korea or Tangun Korea was founded by Tangun early in the 30th century B.C. and its descendents built Koguryo, the first feudal state in Korea, in 277 B.C. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At least 100 mural paintings believed to belong to the period of Koguryo have been found so far. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n Each mural painting created in the period of Koguryo vividly and truthfully reflects the life of the Koguryo people and details of the custom peculiar to the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Women's coats with multi-colored sleeves, rainbow-colored pleated skirts and their hairstyles seen on a Twin Pillar Mural Painting and the Kamsin Mural Painting and those found in Susan-ri and Tokhung-ri were peculiar to Koguryo as they were completely different from other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Depicted on many of those paintings are Korean wrestling and Supakhui, traditional martial art games dating back to the period of Koguryo. Almost all mural paintings belonging to the period of Koguryo including mural paintings found on the interior walls of tombs in Yaksu-ri and Tokhung-ri and Tomb No. 1 in Jangchon, Dance Tomb and Hunt Tomb portray scenes showing Koguryo people on horses hunting animals with bows in high militant spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are listed as precious treasures of the Korean nation for their rich and diverse themes, vivid and truthful depiction and original state preserved until today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The paintings extensively and deeply represent politics, economy, military affair, culture, religious belief and all other aspects of life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A drawing depicting a dwelling house in the Dance Tomb and a painting dealing with lotuses in the Twin Pillar Tomb and a drawing portraying a strong man in the Three Chamber Tomb vividly represent the objects by bold yet free strokes and by delicate and soft yet sharp and elastic lines. \r\n In the drawing of a mythological turtle in particular, thin lines were used to depict ganoid scales of a snake when it winds up its body around the turtle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The drawings depicting four Gods and a yellow dragon found in Three Tombs in Kangso and in the Fourth and Fifth Tombs of the Five Tombs in Jipan mean the zenith of the mural paintings in Koguryo for their rich colors, truthful depiction, perfect combination of line and color and the skillful representation of the light and dark sides of glassy and glossy skins of animals when they get wet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These paintings have retained their distinct colors for thousands of years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They originated from Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The oldest tombs among the tombs having these mural paintings dating back to the period of Koguryo were found in areas around Pyongyang: The tomb with a mural painting in Kumok-ri is believed to date back to about the first to second century A.D. and Tomb No. 2 in Usan-ri was built before the second century A.D. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These tombs resulted in the appearance of the Mural Painting Tomb of King Ko Kuk Won in the mid-fourth century, the same style tomb in Yaksu-ri in late fourth to early in the fifth century, a similar tomb in Tokhung-ri early in the fifth century and three tombs with mural paintings in Three Tombs in Kangso in late Koguryo. They represented the climax in the development of mural paintings in Koguryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n More than 100 mural paintings are found distributed in areas around Hwanin, Jipan and Pyongyang, former capitals of Koguryo. Nearly 80 tombs with mural paintings including King Tongmyong's Mausoleum, Twin Pillar Tomb, Four Gods Tomb in Honam-ri, Mural Painting in Tongam-ri and Kaema Tomb were surveyed and excavated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most of the tombs with mural paintings including the Tomb of King Ko Kuk Won, those tombs in Tokhung-ri, Yaksu-ri and Susan-ri listed as masterpieces for their thematic contents and portrayal are concentrated in areas around Pyongyang. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The mural paintings belonging to the period of Koguryo that had developed with Pyongyang as centre reached the highest level of their development in the period of Koguryo. They had a strong impact on the development of drawings in Paekje, Silla, Kaya and other kingdoms of the same race and even surrounding countries and became a source and a model of mural paintings in Korea in medieval ages.    \r\n\r\n"

However, the danger of war has not dispelled but is growing day by day.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in an article says the U.S. policy of military occupation of south Korea is a concentrated expression of the criminal design to dominate whole Korea and establish its control over an extensive region of Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The author of the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. occupation of south Korea was a prearranged act to invade and dominate whole Korea and it led to the Korean war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Still today the U.S. imperialists are pursuing the policy of military occupation and domination over south Korea under the cloak of \"security\" and anxiously watching for a chance of another war of aggression in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration is seeking in Korea not peace but a war, not reunification but division. After branding the DPRK as part of the \"axis of evil\" it is trying to start another war on the Korean peninsula, come what may, under the pretext of the DPRK-U.S. nuclear issue. Today the danger of war is daily growing on the Korean peninsula and the peace of the country and the security of the nation are exposed to a grave threat. \r\n If the U.S. ignited a war in Korea, it would not be beneficial to the U.S. either. It is the temperament of the Korean People's Army and people never to beg for peace, though they do not want a war, and to show no mercy to the aggressors. Boundless is their might built up with matchless arms of Songun and there is no place out of the reach of its strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is no way out for the U.S. but to give up its design of domination of Korea and withdraw its aggression forces from south Korea.    \r\n    \r\n"

They are going mad with RSOI and Foal Eagle exercises aimed to ignite another war. They are the very source of all misfortunes and sufferings of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will certainly force the U.S. imperialists to pay for the crimes committed against them generation after generation. If the U.S. warmongers ignite another war on this land, the Korean people will mobilize all the war deterrent force and wipe out the aggressors to the last man and thus achieve the historic cause of national reunification without fail.    \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Termed Enemy Common to Humankind \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 30 (KCNA) -- The U.S. imperialists are a wicked enemy common to humankind. The United States is neither an apostle of peace nor a guardian of democracy nor a protector of human rights. Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says this in a signed article.\r\n The article cites facts to disclose the true colors of the United States as the arch criminal that infringed upon independence and sovereignty and blocked social progress, a chieftain of aggression and a kingpin of state-sponsored terrorism and a harasser of peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has engineered at least 100 military coups worldwide to wipe out the movement for national liberation and stifle those countries aspiring after independence against imperialism for over 40 years since the end of the Second World War. Its mean schemes to topple legitimate governments aspiring after independence against imperialism are going on even today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. criminal true nature finds its vivid expression in its frantic moves to destroy socialism, a progressive society and hope and ideal of humankind in which man's independence is fully realized. The U.S. imperialists' offensive to isolate and stifle the DPRK proves that their moves have reached their height. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. true colors as a harasser of peace finds its vivid manifestation in the fact that it committed 114 wars and at least 8,900 cases of military intervention up to early in the 20th century since it launched the bloody war of aggression on the American continent and perpetrated 185 military invasions against developing countries up to early 1991 since the end of the Second World War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists' brigandish and bellicose nature has become all the more undisguised in the new century. Their Iraqi war was most hideous state-sponsored terrorism, typical act of aggression and a crude violation of sovereignty and peace in the 21st century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the only nuclear war criminal in the world as it developed and used nuclear weapons for the first time in human history and the world's worst nuclear fanatic as it poses constant nuclear threat and the danger of a nuclear war to the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the world's worst exploiter, plunderer and human rights abuser. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Multi-national companies were a main form of international monopoly that appeared after the end of the Second World War and they served the U.S. as a major means for exploitation and plunder. The multi-national companies belonging to the U.S. made their way to developing countries facing economic difficulties under the pretext of \"aid\" to rake up profits per dollar 4-5 times or even 10 times what it had invested. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Economic chaos and crises including the financial crisis in Asia that occurred worldwide by the end of the 20th century were directly or indirectly related to the U.S. which seized this opportunity to meet its unlimited selfish interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In another development, the U.S. is dumping its surplus commodities into the developing countries while putting pressure upon them to open markets. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n\"Aid\" and \"loan\" on the lips of the U.S. are a leverage for international exploitation and plunder and lead to economic and political subjugation because it takes away a hundred things after giving one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The criminal human rights abuses committed by the U.S. imperialists are clearly proved by their acts of killing or wounding civilians in the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the 1999 Balkan War and the recent disclosure of the U.S. occupation forces' inhuman torture and maltreatment of Iraqi prisoners. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is now employing all sorts of fig-leaves to cover up its crimes committed in the past and its criminal nature. But the U.S. imperialists' aggressive and brigandish nature can never change, the article says, urging everybody not to pin any hope on the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is most important in the anti-U.S. struggle in the present times is that one must build up one's own military force and if all those countries aspiring after independence increase their own military force they can certainly stop the U.S. from running wild, the article says.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They defended the freedom and independence of the country by giving full play to their matchless bravery and self-sacrificing spirit.
