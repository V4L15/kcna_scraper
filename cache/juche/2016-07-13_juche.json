This is stunning the world public as it triggers off serious concern.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is one of the principles recognized by international law that all sovereign states can never become targets of domestic jurisdiction of other countries and this principle is explicitly specified in the \"UN convention on exemption of a state and its properties from jurisdiction\" adopted on Dec. 2, 2004.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Paragraph 9 of Article 2 of the \"code on crimes against human peace and security\" written by the 6th United Nations Commission on International Law in 1953 clearly stipulates that if a country forces its will upon another country, takes steps to put political and economic pressure upon it and interferes in its internal affairs in a bid to seek interests, such acts are crimes against human peace and security.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The respect for sovereignty among countries is an elementary international practice before being a requirement of international law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is also a moral foundation for establishing international relations, which is vividly manifested through respect for the top representative of the dignity and interests of a country concerned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even the Bush II administration which earned an ill-fame for frequent invectives and diplomatic gaffes against leaderships of other countries didn't perpetrate such acts beyond common sense as invoking the domestic act of the U.S. against the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK that represents the destiny of its service personnel and people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the Obama administration did amounts to the self-acknowledgement of the total flop of its policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It became universally accepted understanding long ago that the present U.S. administration's \"strategic patience\" is, in essence, a hands-off approach and Obama and his staff had neither ability nor will to handle the Korean issue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Obama bragged that he would \"bring down\" the social system of the DPRK, at the meeting with the YouTube video manufacturers in January last year, its subscribers in the U.S. aired their views that his careless words revealed his real intention and admitted to his failure in the policy towards the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. administration employed such a base method as hurting the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK in a bid to conceal its failure in the policy towards the DPRK but it brought to light its strategic incompetence and awkward position.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On July 6 a spokesperson for the U.S. State Department, when asked by a reporter if the recent sanctions measure would bring a boomerang effect, was reported to have answered that they took the step out of a lot of consideration. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S., however, failed to consider the catastrophic consequences to be entailed by the reckless action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government clarified its stand in the statement of the Foreign Ministry that the DPRK considers the U.S. act of hurting the dignity of the DPRK's supreme leadership as a declaration of a war and will take corresponding measures including the shut-down of all diplomatic contacts and channels with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. provocative sanctions have driven the rock-bottom DPRK-U.S. relations into an inescapable mire and marked a new starting point in further escalating the vicious cycle of tension on the Korean peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK is now left with no option but to take new tough measures to defend the dignity of the supreme leadership and interests of the DPRK under the present situation in which the U.S. political and military provocations to stifle it have reached an extreme phase and there is the only way for it to settle accounts with the latter by force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no guarantee that Ulji Freedom Guardian joint military drill to be staged when the situation on the peninsula remains tenser than ever before and the DPRK-U.S. relations are at the lowest ebb will not create another explosive situation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. wrong option is bound to boomerang."

            "content": "Sancion anti-RPDC de EE.UU. traera consecuencias catastroficas\r\nPyongyang, 13 de julio (ACNC) -- El investigador del Instituto para Asuntos Norteamericanos del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea, Jong Nam Hyok, hizo publico el dia 13 un comentario intitulado \"La imprudente sancion de EE.UU. traera consecuencias catastroficas\". \n\t\t\t\t\tEl texto senala:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pasado dia 6, la administracion norteamericana publico el \"informe de DDHH\" y la \"lista de objetos de sancion especial\" ofendiendo mas brutalmente que nunca la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs otro grave error estrategico de la administracion Obama en visperas del fin de su mandato. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa violacion de la soberania de la RPDC es expresion mas coherente de la politica de hostilidad a la RPDC y el resultado del criterio egoista y extremado de EE.UU., segun el cual son \"justas\" todas las cosas que convengan a sus intereses y gusto, sean acciones ilicitas internacionales o inmorales. Esto causa gran preocupacion de la opinion publica mundial. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUn Estado soberano no puede ser objeto del poder judicial de otro pais, lo cual es el principio reconocido por la ley internacional. Tal principio esta indicado claramente en el Convenio de la ONU sobre el Derecho a la Exencion Judicial del Estado y sus Propiedades\", aprobado el 2 de diciembre de 2004.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa clausula 9 del articulo 2 del Codigo sobre el Crimen contra la Paz y la Seguridad de la Humanidad, elaborado en 1953 por la 6a Comision de la Ley Internacional de la ONU,  tambien estipula que intervenir en los asuntos internos de otro pais tomando las medidas coercitivas politicas y economicas imponiendole su voluntad para satisfacer sus propios intereses resulta un crimen contra la paz y la seguridad de la humanidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl respeto a la soberania entre los paises es una costumbre internacional y fundamento moral para el establecimiento de las relaciones internacionales, antes de ser una demanda de la ley internacional. Y esto se expresa concentradamente a traves del respeto al maximo representante de la dignidad e intereses del pais correspondiente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNi la administracion Bush II, que se gano la mala fama por sus erroneos discursos diplomaticas sobre las direcciones de otros paises, se atrevio a movilizar la ley nacional para difamar directamente nuestra maxima dignidad, lo todo de nuestro destino. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, el insulto de la administracion Obama sobre la maxima dignidad de la RPDC significa reconocer por si mismo el fracaso total de su politica sobre el pais socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHace mucho tiempo, se ha establecido en la arena internacional la concepcion de que la \"paciencia estrategica\" de la actual administracion norteamericana no tiene remedio alguno y de que Obama y sus asesores no tienen la capacidad ni voluntad de tratar el problema coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn enero del ano pasado, Obama se reunio con los productores de \"YouTube\" y les dijo con fanfarroneria que \"derrumbara\" el regimen de la RPDC. Entonces, en el interior del territorio norteamericano se escucharon las opiniones de que el presidente mostro su verdadera intencion al hablar sin pensar en las consecuencias y sus palabras reconocen el fracaso de la politica sobre Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, la administracion norteamericana recurrio a la sucia manera de menoscabar la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema de la RPDC para disimular el fracaso de su politica sobre esta. Al contrario, demostro por si misma su incapacidad estrategica y situacion miserable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl dia 6, el portavoz del Departamento de Estado de EE.UU. respondio a un reportero, quien le pregunto si las recientes medidas de sancion no traerian resultado contraproducente, que \"hemos tomado esas medidas despues de pensar mucho\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, EE.UU. no se imagina del todo las consecuencias catastroficas que emanen de su conducta imprudente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tYa el gobierno de la RPDC patentizo por conducto de la declaracion de su cancilleria su posicion de que considera como declaracion de guerra el acto de EE.UU. de difamar la dignidad de la Direccion Suprema y tomara las contramedidas, incluso el cierre de contacto diplomatico con EE.UU. y sus canales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas sanciones de caracter provocativo de EE.UU. han sido el nuevo punto de partida que lleva al abismo sin salida las relaciones bilaterales casi en el nivel cero y empuja la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana al circulo vicioso de agravacion de tension.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de hoy, en que llego al extremo la provocacion politico-militar de EE.UU. destinada a aplastar a la RPDC y les queda a ambas partes la liquidacion de cuentas mediante el uso de la fuerza, obliga a la RPDC a tomar nuevas medidas intransigentes para defender la maxima dignidad y los intereses del Estado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNadie puede asegurar que no ocurrira otro incidente, que conduzca la situacion a la fase de explosion, con motivo de los ejercicios militares conjuntos \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" que se efectuaran cuando estan en el peor estado la situacion de la Peninsula Coreana y las relaciones RPDC-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTodos los desastres, que produzca la opcion erronea de EE.UU., recaeran sobre este imperio."
