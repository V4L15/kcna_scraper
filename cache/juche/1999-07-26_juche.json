S.-led imperialist allied forces and won the great victory in the Fatherland Liberation War  (June 1950-July 1953).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Before the Korean War, victories of 114 times had been recorded in the U. S. history of war.   The U. S. imperialists  hurled into the Korean War over two million-strong armed forces including one third of their army, one fifth of their air force, most of their pacific fleet, troops of 15 satellites, the South Korean Army and Japanese militarist armed forces. They employed most brutal means and methods of war with modern weapons and a large amount of the latest combat material and technical equipment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But the Korean people and people's army, united close around the party and the leader, wrought an unprecedented military miracle by defeating the imperialist allied forces led by the U. S. imperialists  who boasted of being the \"strongest\" in the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The victory of the Korean people in the Fatherland Liberation War  was the fruition of the outstanding military strategy and idea, war tactics and seasoned leadership of the President Kim Il Sung.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He put forward the most right strategy and tactics in each time and stage of the war with his clairvoyant military wisdom and led the army and the people to victory in the war with his steel-like courage and outstanding commanding art.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He set forward operations for the liberation of Taejon, the formation of the second front behind the enemy's line, assaults, aircraft hunters movement and other military methods. The enemy's \"summer and autumn offensives\", \"new offensives\" and other military operations were foiled by the outstanding far-sightedness of the President.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In the Korean War the U. S. imperialists  sustained a great loss of manpower and materials and a serious fiasco. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The damage of the U. S. imperialists  in the Korean War was as much as nearly 2.3 times that in the four-year pacific war during World War II.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean people achieved a brilliant victory in the three-year Fatherland Liberation War  and started the U. S. imperialists  on the downhill for the first time in history. \r\n\r\n"

Worse still, this campaign is being joined by the United States and the South Korean authorities.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Theirs is nothing but a sheer lie which was invented for the purpose of attaining their ulterior design to disparage achievements of the DPRK's highly-developed science and technology and brand it as a source of \"military threats.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We reclarify that the carrier rocket and artificial satellite launched into orbit by DPRK scientists and technicians at one fire were part of the Juche-based scientific and technological achievements.

            "content": "U.S. urged to show faith \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 26 (KCNA) -- A spokesman of the DPRK Foreign Ministry today issued a statement assailing the ever more undisguised attempt of the United States to disarm the DPRK under the cloak of \"improved relations.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Accusing the United States of its absurd assertion that the DPRK nuclear and missile development pose a threat to the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nAnd it is, therefore, possible to \"improve relations\" with the DPRK only when it abandons the development, and that the DPRK-U.S. relations are at a low ebb owing to this, the spokesman stated:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis is intended to mislead public opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. hard-line conservative forces went the length of crying that once the DPRK launches a satellite or a missile, they will reduce a budget to finance the supply of heavy oil and the construction of Light Water Reactors, the U.S. commitments under the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This compels us to make our stand clear once again.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We do not want to regard the United States as the sworn enemy and if the U.S. recognizes our sovereignty and the freedom of option and approaches us with good faith, we are ready to develop relations with the U.S. on the principle of equality and mutual benefit.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   What we cannot overlook is the fact that the United States professes \"improved relations\" before us but behind the scenes it is persistently trying to wrest a unilateral concession from us, while pursuing a hostile policy to isolate and stifle us at any cost.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We, who are exposed to constant threat due to the U.S. policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK, are left with no option but to increase our own defence capabilities and develop missiles as its means.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Moreover, the missile development pertains to the sovereignty of an independent state, which allows no slanders from anyone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As for the DPRK's satellite launch, over which the United States is raising a hue and cry, it is meant for a peaceful scientific research into the space and there is no need to be afraid of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The same can be said of the \"nuclear development\" over which the United States is making a fuss.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A \"nuclear issue\" does not rest at all with the DPRK, that has sincerely implemented the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework and the \"suspicion about the underground nuclear facility\" was cleared through the visit to the Kumchang-ri tunnel.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of \"probe into the past nuclear activities\" of the DPRK raised by some of the U.S. forces can be satisfactorily clarified in the course of implementing the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework, in other words, at a time when the delivery of Light Water Reactors will make successful progress and reach a certain phase.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The solution of both the issue of \"transparency\" as regards the DPRK's nuclear activities and the missile issue will depend, after all, on the attitude of the United States.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK has so far sincerely implemented its commitment under the DPRK-U.S. agreed  framework.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The United States, however, has neglected the implementation of the DPRK-U.S. agreed  framework and staged joint military drills one after another in a bid to mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK, thus posing potential threat to its dialogue partner with ceaseless military pressure and anti-DPRK \"cooperation\" moves.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States is really interested in the peace and security of the Korean peninsula and desirous of \"improved relations\" with the DPRK, it should, above all, take practical steps to totally lift economic sanctions against the DPRK, a specific manifestation of its hostile policy towards the DPRK, and refrain from taking \"cooperation\" moves against the DPRK and posing military threat to it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Furthermore, it should pull its forces out of South Korea and respond to signing a peace agreement with the DPRK so as to root out whatever source of threat to the DPRK.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States shows good faith in such a way we, too, will do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK states explicitly that if the United States wishes to abrogate the DPRK-U.S. agreed  framework, it may do as it pleases.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the business of the United States, not the matter about which the DPRK should say this or that.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the United States wishes to abrogate the agreed framework on the pretext of the DPRK's satellite launch, which has nothing to do with the framework, we will be compelled to take a relevant measure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIf a brake is put on the implementation of the agreed framework such as the suspension of financing for the KEDO (Korean peninsula Energy Development Organization), we will feel no need to pin hope on it any longer. \r\n\r\n"
