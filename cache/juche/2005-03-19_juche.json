This reveals its hostile attempt to threaten and stifle the DPRK by force of arms at any cost. It is a criminal act against peace and the nation as it is driving the situation on the Korean Peninsula to the brink of a war. Rodong Sinmun Friday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the south Korean authorities are following and colluding with the U.S. in its frantic moves to ignite a nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are unhesitatingly joining the U.S. in its dangerous play with fire aimed at aggravating the military confrontation on the Korean Peninsula and pushing the inter-Korean relations to the phase of catastrophe in disregard of the interests of the nation and in violation of the June 15 joint declaration, not away from flunkeyism towards the U.S. and submission to it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nuclear stand-off between the DPRK and the U.S. has reached an extreme phase and the latter is working hard to launch a nuclear war against the DPRK at any cost, taking advantage of this.  This being a hard reality, the south Korean authorities are joining the U.S. in its large-scale combined war exercises to invade the DPRK, challenging the unanimous desire of the nation for peace and reunification. This is intolerable because this means becoming war servants for outsiders to kill their fellow countrymen and colluding with them in their nuclear war to destroy the inviolable territory of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should abandon their servility to the U.S. and the anti-north confrontational stand and stop at once their reckless collusion with it in its war moves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland Thursday answered a question put by\r\nKCNA as regards the U.S. hasty moves to reorganize the Second Division of its forces in south Korea. He said:\r\n The commander of the division, when interviewed by the U.S. force's newspaper Stars and Stripes recently, said that the bulk of its division would be combat ready by this summer through an increase in its air and artillery power for an independent long-range operation. He disclosed that the division has already formed a new heavily-armed brigade-level combat team, started organizing a multi-mission air brigade and will form a battalion-scale special unit within the coming months. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reorganization of the U.S. forces in south Korea to be made two years earlier than scheduled is another blatant challenge and a grave provocation against the six-party talks and the sincere efforts of the DPRK to seek a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Some days ago U.S. President Bush cried out for \"punishment,\" after revealing its hostile intent towards the DPRK by terming it a \"tyrannical state\" and a \"rogue state.\" This goes to patently prove that there is no change in the U.S. hostile policy towards the DPRK and the former is getting more undisguised in its attempt to mount a military attack on the latter to stifle it at the phase of its implementation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This fact suffices to clearly tell that it is quite natural for the DPRK to possess nuclear deterrent. The U.S. is stepping up its moves to reorganize its forces in south Korea prompted by its strategic purpose to hold military supremacy in Northeast Asia. The U.S. should not reorganize its aggressor forces in south Korea but totally withdraw them from it at an early date and immediately stop the reckless arms buildup and joint military exercises aimed to invade the DPRK, clearly mindful that the reorganization of its forces and the moves for a war against the DPRK, which drive the situation to confrontation and to the brink of war, will only precipitate its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Japanese imperialists were, indeed, a gang of most vicious and ferocious robbers and a rare fabricator of an international treaty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" was nothing but a false document totally ignoring the elementary requirement of the international law related to the signing of a treaty and an illegal sheet of paper without any legal validity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is stipulated in the U.N. Charter and the Vienna Convention that a treaty contradictory to the main principles of the international law is not effective. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n International treaties are usually signed to ensure the interests of the countries and the nations concerned and develop state relations with other countries on the principle of equality and reciprocity. The Japanese imperialists, however, quite contrary to the universality and publicly recognized principles in adopting international treaties, arbitrarily rigged up the \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" by coercion and pressure in an atmosphere of violent threats, without any mutual agreement. Moreover, they committed such unprecedented fraudulence against the international law as forging even the ratification of the sovereign of Korea, the most important condition for a treaty to come into effect. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Sunjong, the last emperor of feudal Korea, in his verbal will in his deathbed said: \"The ratification of the 'Korea-Japan annexation' in the past was arbitrarily promulgated by traitorous subjects. I did not do it.\" \"At the time of 'the conclusion of the treaty' the Japanese imperialists confined and threatened me.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\" forged by the Japanese imperialists was an illegal \"treaty\" without any legitimacy and validity. For the shamelessness of the treaty and the predatory nature of its content, it was already branded as an illegal and invalid \"treaty\" at the United Nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With no subterfuge can Japan justify the extra-large crimes it committed against the Korean people during its colonial rule over Korea for over 40 years, including the fabrication of the aggressive and brigandish \"Korea-Japan Annexation Treaty\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But they are of aggressive and provocative nature as newly developed sophisticated war equipment will be involved in these maneuvers and they are designed to meet the requirements of the recently worked out war scenario to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis once again clearly indicates how hypocritical the U.S. assertion that it has no intention to attack or invade the DPRK is. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Through the war exercises, the U.S. also seeks to develop the U.S. forces in south Korea into \"task forces operating in the wide region\" and thus extend anytime their operational scope to the areas around the Korean Peninsula, not confining it to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. projected adventurous military drills are aimed to steadily escalate the tensions in the peninsula and finally make a preemptive strike at the DPRK and, furthermore, achieve its sinister strategic design on Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for escalating the nuclear crisis in the peninsula and driving the situation to confrontation and the brink of a war in a bid to strain the tensions in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality goes to prove that it is very just for the DPRK to have opted for bolstering its self-defensive nuclear arsenal in order to protect the peace of the country and the fate of the nation from the U.S. moves for aggression and the DPRK's nukes serve as powerful deterrent to keep the balance of forces in Northeast Asia, prevent the outbreak of a new war and preserve peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK will take all the necessary countermeasures including the increase of its nuclear arsenal to cope with the extremely hostile attempt of the U.S. to bring down its system chosen by the Korean people themselves.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
