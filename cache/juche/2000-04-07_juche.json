This is the view and demand of the DPRK side, Rodong Sinmun today says in a signed article entitled \"just stand on the settlement of the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations,\" as regards the principled stand Clarified by the DPRK side at the first day sitting of the 9th intergovernmental talks between the DPRK and Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTouching on the issue of Japan's redressing of its past, our side held that this should be taken up as the main topic and the most important task at the talks, the article says, adding: The DPRK side clarified that this issue, including four points--apology and Compensation for human and material losses, return of cultural treasures and Compensation for them and improvement of the legal status of the Korean nationals in Japan--should be discussed as a core issue at the talks. The article hails this as a very just position. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThere were 8 rounds of talks between the two sides in the past but the two sides only argued pro and con, mixing the key issues related to the settlement of the issue of the DPRK-Japan relations with irrelevant issues. As a result, the talks failed to make any progress and ended up in rupture. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Noting that there are indisputable theoretical propriety and reason in the DPRK's stand that Japan's redress of its past should be made a main topic and a most important task of the talks, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The DPRK and Japan have been in the relationship between the assailant and the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan has a century-long history of aggression and hostility against Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of Japan's past crimes should be redressed to pave a new way for improving the relations between the DPRK and Japan which have existed as the sworn enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan has a will to admit and redress its past crimes, it, first of all, should make an apology for all the misfortunes, pain, disasters and losses inflicted by it upon the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's apology should be a political one clearly  expressive of the will to sincerely repent of its past crimes and not to repeat them. The apology must be made by the head of the Japanese government and it must be specified in the final document to be adopted as regards the establishment of the relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan's apology, in its essence, must have state formality and legal validity. This is the invariable demand of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Any material compensation without apology is little different from economic deal or business. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the stand of the DPRK, the victim, that Japan, the assailant, should compensate the victim with repentance and sincerity so that this may be a cornerstone for establishing good neighborly relations between the two countries and Japan should make compensation enough to fully convince the DPRK of its sincerity and effectively pay it in the shortest possible time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of Korean cultural treasures was proposed by the DPRK side for the first time at the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Our position concerning the settlement of the issue of cultural treasures is that Japan should formally apologize for the destruction and looting of cultural treasures committed by it in the past, make adequate compensation for the destroyed ones and, at the same time, return all those it took away. This is very just demand because imperial Japan's act of obliterating Korean culture was committed as part of its state policy and Japan should fulfil its state responsibility for that. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is one of the important requirements of Japan's liquidation of its past crimes against Korea to solve the issue of legal status of Korean nationals in Japan.\r\n   From a historical point of view, the issue of legal status of the Koreans in Japan was a product of Japan's past military occupation of Korea and the unprecedentedly harsh rule of the occupationists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the Japanese authorities are clamoring about \"prefectural suffrage\" in a bid to pursue a vicious policy aimed to deny the DPRK nationality of the Koreans in Japan, assimilate them to Japanese and thus split and disintegrate Chongryon (General Association of Korean Residents in Japan). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The issue of legal status of the Koreans in Japan now poses itself as a very acute and urgent political and national one. Japan should find an early solution to the issue within the framework of the liquidation of its past and take a measure for its settlement at the DPRK-Japan talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese side has a will to pull down the abnormal barrier lying in its ties with the DPRK and normalize them it had better sincerely accept our just position and demands and take a constructive position at the talks, the article  concludes. \r\n\r\n"
