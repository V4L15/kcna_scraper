It is necessary, therefore, to seek a negotiated settlement of differences and disputes among them and not to allow the imperialists to perpetrate military intervention and aggression against sovereign states under any circumstances. Differences and disputes among developing countries are the issues to be solved among those countries in the course of advancing hand in hand to achieve their common goals and, therefore, they should not allow any fight among themselves or invite foreign forces to intervene in them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a most vivid expression of independence to defend and consolidate the Juche character and national character. Only by doing so, is it possible to achieve and defend the independence of the popular masses and realize the independent development and prosperity of the nation. For a country and nation it is a main lever for exercising sovereignty to pursue an independent policy in the external relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All countries and peoples should wage an uncompromising struggle against any infringement upon their independence. One should neither take a fence-sitting attitude towards any aggression against any other country for the mere reason that it is not against one's own country nor support the imperialists in this practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending independence serves as a common slogan of struggle every country should hold aloft in the new century and a guarantee for its independent development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will as ever wage a dynamic struggle to defend independence in the international arena under the banner of Songun, the banner of independence, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He dared slander the dignified DPRK as a \"criminal regime\" and worked hard to tarnish its image, even citing sheer fabrications shortly ago. He went the lengths of openly threatening and blackmailing the DPRK, blustering that in case the north creates \"instability\" over the nuclear issue the U.S. has a plan to cope with it. Timed to coincide with his outcry, U.S. hard-line hawks let loose a whole string of nonsense and outcries, driving the situation to a complicated phase.\r\n As seen above, the solution to the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S. and the process to achieve peace and stability in the region are facing bigger challenge due to the self-righteous hostile policy pursued by the Bush administration to stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a daydream of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. As already clarified by the DPRK, it is sticking to its stand to seek ways of overcoming difficulties lying in the way of the six-party talks and of achieving progress in the talks. The U.S. should refrain from misinterpreting and disregarding the stand and efforts of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should face up to the reality with a cool head and stop at once such criminal moves to throw obstacles to the efforts for peace and security on the Korean Peninsula. Otherwise, it would be hard to expect any progress in the six-party talks and the settlement of the pending issues between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is a grave threat to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula and peace and security in Northeast Asia, the statement noted, and continued:\r\n The decision clearly proves what dangerous phase the U.S. preparations for a preemptive nuclear attack on the DPRK have reached.\r\n As the reality shows, the U.S. is chiefly responsible for having strained the situation on the Korean Peninsula and hamstrung the solution to the nuclear issue. It is none other than the U.S. that grossly reneged on its international commitments and obligations under international law.\r\n The U.S. said more than once that it has no intention to launch a military attack and invasion against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It committed itself in the joint statement adopted at the fourth round of the six-party talks that it has no intention to attack or invade the DPRK with nukes or conventional weapons and it would respect its sovereignty and peacefully co-exist with it and take measures to normalize the relations with it.\r\n As for Japan, it is the only country in the world which suffered the tragedy of nuclear holocaust caused by the U.S. The Japanese people do not want to face such tragedy again and preceding governments of Japan considered the three non-nuclear principles which prohibit the production of nuclear weapons in Japan, the introduction and deployment of those weapons in its territory as their state policy, though nominally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the moves of the forces hostile to the DPRK have reached their extreme phase, the DPRK is left with no other option but to bolster its nuclear deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and Japan had better stop at once such reckless moves, well aware that they can never evade the responsibility for having strained the military and political situation on the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and created new difficulties in the way of denuclearizing the peninsula with their undisguised nuclear arms build-up.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
