Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The constitution fixed by law the successes made by the Korean people in socialist revolution and construction under the banner of Juche idea, and lays down all the principles to be adhered to by the socialist state in the fields of politics, economy, culture and national defence as well as the tasks of struggle and basic rights and duties of citizens.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It fully reflects the will and interests of the people and grants all the people genuine freedom and rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  The institution of the constitution provided by law the Korean people with all the conditions for fulfilling their responsibilities and roles as masters of the state and society, and it also provided them with a powerful weapon for safeguarding the socialist gains won at the cost of lives and achieving the prosperity of the country and the nation, the reporter said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Thanks to the energetic leadership of the great Generalissimos Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il, the socialist constitution was amended and supplemented several times in conformity with the continuous development of the revolution and construction to become a more popular and revolutionary one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The first session of the 10th SPA was a historic occasion which serves as a milestone to be specially recorded in the history of constitution of the DPRK as it made the socialist constitution the great socialist code of laws in our era which is replete with the revolutionary outlook on the leader and embodies the Songun politics of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Il saw to it that the undying idea of the President on building state and his feats is specified in the preamble and formulated the constitution as Kim Il Sung's Constitution, reflecting the firm will of the army and people to hold in high esteem Kim Il Sung, founder of the DPRK and father of socialist Korea, as the eternal President of the DPRK and accomplish the revolutionary cause of Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based socialist constitution was thoroughly embodied in all fields of state and social life under the wise leadership of the party and leader, bringing about a great turn in the consolidation and development of the Korean-style socialist system and the Korean people's life.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based idea of the peerlessly great persons of Mt.

This is a result of the noble loyalty and sense of moral obligation of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The adoption of the Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il's Constitution provided the army and people of the DPRK with a powerful legal weapon for holding in high esteem Kim Il Sung as the eternal President of the DPRK and Kim Jong Il as the eternal chairman of the National Defence Commission of the DPRK for all ages and advancing along the road of independence, Songun and socialism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Juche-based socialist constitution which comprehensively reflects the patriotic cause of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il is the ever-victorious great programme for accomplishing the Korean-style socialist cause, the reporter said, calling for bringing about a fresh revolutionary turn in building a thriving socialist nation and further glorifying Korean-style socialism centered on the popular masses."
