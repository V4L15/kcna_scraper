And the successful test-fire of ICBM Hwasong-14, a final gateway to the completion of the country's nuclear force, proved that the U.S. mainland is within the striking range of the DPRK's weapons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t After 20-odd days, the DPRK carried out the second test-fire of Hwasong-14, dealing a telling blow at the empire of evils which is slapping extreme sanctions while letting out senseless war rhetoric.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The day when the DPRK is provoked means the end of the U.S. This is our stern warning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To the DPRK, the call for military pressure made by the U.S. without reason sounds no more than rubbish and shriek of aggressor and rogue state stunned by the rapid development of the former's nuclear force and its might.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The policy-makers of the U.S. are so mean in their thinking faculty as they desperately try to check the DPRK's rapid progress toward the modernization of nuclear force while making bluff.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should judge the trend properly, though belatedly, and make a responsible option.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. provokes the DPRK by brandishing the nuclear club, despite its warning, the latter will clearly show its mettle with the nuclear strike means of justice."
