All these facts made me fear that if I had stayed in such country any longer, I might have died even before having the chance to reunite with my children. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When Japanese officials asked me if I had an intention to bring my children to Japan, I said no to them and told them that I should go back to the DPRK. I finally decided to go back to it after making up my mind to do so several times, thinking that even if I am to breathe my last, I should die by the side of my children.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The former is contemplating plugging even civilian enterprises into the development of technology in this field. All these facts go to prove that Japan is using every possibility to establish MD. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now inching closer to the development of nuclear weapons through a mock nuclear experiment based on computer technology without using a nuclear test ground. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is that the Japanese reactionaries are justifying all these wrong doings under the pretext of the DPRK's deterrent for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their preoccupation is to turn Japan into a military giant as early as possible in a bid to contain its neighboring powers and emerge an Asian leader. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can never remain a passive onlooker to this grave situation in which the dark clouds of war are gathering thick due to the above-said moves of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to behave themselves, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is foolish of the Japanese reactionaries to persistently work to deny Japan's inglorious past history and justify it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Tuesday says this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany declared it had completed the payment of compensation to those who had been forced to toil in the days of the Nazi regime during the Second World War. Japan, however, is becoming so foolish and brazen-faced as regards this matter quite contrary to Germany's behavior. The Japanese reactionaries have gone the lengths of asserting that the issue of the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army has never existed and Japan has done nothing wrong. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These are the most shameless remarks aimed at tampering with history. And these outbursts can be let loose only by the Abe group bereft of ethics and morality and ignorant of the trend of the times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are busy these days with the campaign demanding the removal of photographs showing massacres committed by the Imperial Japanese Army from the memorials of the anti-Japanese war in China, claiming they are meant to \"distort\" history. And they are floating the sheer sophism that Ulung and Tok islets had been regarded as \"parts of the Japanese territory\" in the then era of \"Edo\". All these are typical examples revealing the militarist character of the Abe group and its shameless and dastardly nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should honestly admit its crime-woven history and compensate for it, abandon its military wild ambition and turn over a new leaf. This would be the only way for Japan to become a decent member of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to judge what is going on in the world in a sound way of thinking, honestly reflect on its crime-woven history and redress it just as Germany did, the commentary urges.\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It liberated Seoul, the den of the enemies, within 3 days and over 90 percent of the southern part of country after a month following the start of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Seamen of the Navy of the KPA, with four torpedo-boats, sank to the bottom of the sea the heavy cruiser \"Baltimore\" of the U.S. imperialists and beat back a light cruiser in the sea off Jumunjin in the early July Juche 39 (1950).\r\n A fierce battle took place on Wolmi Islet covering 0.66 square kilometers from September 13 to 15, 1950. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Wolmi Islet defenders, armed with four guns, displayed the unparalleled bravery and self-sacrifice spirit in the battle with about 1,000 aircrafts, hundreds of warships and huge armed forces over 50,000 strong to delay the landing of the enemies in Inchon. They thus made a great contribution to ensuring the victory of the KPA in the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists who had boasted of their \"victory\" in more than 110 wars of aggression made every desperate effort to recover the heavy defeat they had sustained in face of the KPA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The soldiers of KPA defended the Height 1,211 even in the \"wave-like attacks\" which the enemies mounted showering over 30,000 or 40,000 bombs and shells in a day. They took back the Height 351 only within 15 minutes, on which the enemies had built a strong defensive position for two years and more. All the miracles were beyond the existing militant knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, \"B-29\" aircraft about which the U.S. imperialists bragged as \"fortress in the sky\" were shot down by the heroic pilots of the KPA from the beginning of the war. The strategic aircraft were rejected from the order of combat at the end of being mobilized only into night bombing. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the leadership of President Kim Il Sung, the ever-victorious iron-willed brilliant commander, the KPA defeated the numerical and military technical superiority of the U.S. imperialists with its ideological and mental power and won the victory in the war, miracle of the 20th century on July 27, 1953.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena a Japon por eludir la liquidacion del pasado\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, 26 de junio (ATCC) -- El periodico Rodong Sinmun publico este martes un comentario individual dando enfasis en que los reaccionarios japoneses nunca podran tergiversar, ni negar ni tampoco justificar su sucia historia del pasado. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japon actua tan descaradamente en contraste con Alemania que anuncio el termino de la indemnizacion a todas las personas sometidas al trabajo forzado bajo el regimen nazi durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, critica el comentarista y prosigue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Los reaccionarios japoneses mienten que el problema de las \"consoladoras sexuales\" para las tropas japonesas del siglo pasado no existio desde el principio y su pais no ha hecho nada malo en este caso. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Esto deviene una cinica tergiversacion de la historia y un sofisma que puede proferir solo la banda de Abe que ignora las normas de la etica y moral ni la corriente de la epoca. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ultimamente, los reaccionarios islenos lanzan una campana para eliminar las fotos sobre el genocidio cometido por las tropas japonesas, exhibidas en los museos conmemorativos de la guerra antijaponesa de China, insistiendo en que ellas \"distorsionan\" la historia. Tambien, circulan una sofisteria de que en la \"epoca de Edo\" las islas Ulrung y Tok pertenecian a Japon, lo cual demuestra la naturaleza militarista, el cinismo y la vileza de la horda de Abe. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Si Japon desea vivir como un digno miembro de la sociedad internacional, debe indemnizar sus multiples crimenes del pasado tras reconocerlos con sinceridad y comenzar de nuevo al abandonar su ambicion militarista. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Ademas, debe ver el mundo con un sano modo de pensar y seguir el ejemplo de Alemania.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
