To be involved in this muscle-flexing are various type strategic assets such as striking groups of U.S. nuclear carriers Ronald Reagan and Carl Vinson, nuclear submarines, nuclear strategic bombers, stealth fighters and Aegis destroyers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lots of U.S. war operation groups and nuclear strike means deployed in south Korea and in its vicinity have already begun moving to the positions for invasion of the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The enemies openly announced that Key Resolve and Foal Eagle this year would involve rehearsals for putting into a more concrete shape the 4D operation for preemptive attack on the DPRK and, at the same time, drills under the simulated conditions of deployment of THAAD.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said saber-rattling assumes ever-growing danger as it is under way after the U.S. imperialists secretly introduced at least 6 million tons of ammunition and war hardware into south Korea from the end of last year and took recently even the measure for urgent evacuation of  families of U.S. forces in south Korea and those with U.S. citizenship staying there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In view of the prevailing grave situation the General Staff of the KPA clarifies the following principled stand of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 1. Now that the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet forces again kicked off the dangerous nuclear war drills against the DPRK at its doorstep, our army will counter them with the toughest counteractions as it had already declared.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This stand of ours clarified before the world is by no means an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t 2.

They are, at the same time, pressurizing the south Korean puppet regime to cancel the plan for erecting the statue of girl sexual slave on Tok Islets whose project is being promoted by Kyonggi Province and change the name of the statue into \"statue of comfort girl\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, they are insisting that they would not send back their ambassador and consul general unless the girl statues are removed. They are putting pressure on the south Korean puppet regime almost every day to implement the \"south Korea-Japan agreement on the comfort women\" while claiming that \"there is no evidence proving the forcible drafting by the Japanese army\" and \"south Korea should not expect the normalization of Japan-south Korea relations unless it shows moves to remove the statues.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement said that the Japanese reactionaries' moves for removing the girl statues in lieu of apologizing for their past crimes before the Korean nation are nothing but brigandish logic and height of shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the south Korean puppet group are behaving more cowardly towards the Japanese reactionaries, refraining from lodging any protest against their shameless and gangster-like demand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Traitors including Yun Pyong Se, puppet foreign minister of south Korea, are yielding to the pressure of Japan, saying that \"they would respect and faithfully implement the agreement on comfort women\" and \"they would positively consult with Japan through diverse diplomatic channels.\" They went the lengths of sending the local self-governing bodies informal notice to the effect that \"it is necessary to pool wisdom as regards the proposal for removing statues to the appropriate places.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despite strong protest and denunciation from people of various circles of south Korea, they are asserting that it is \"the stand of the authorities that erecting any statue in front of diplomatic premises is not in line with international practice concerning the protection of diplomatic missions.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not content with shutting their eyes to the past crimes of the Japanese imperialists by signing the humiliating \"agreement\" on the issue of sexual slavery with the Japanese reactionaries, the puppet group are complying with Japan's shameless demand for removing the girl statues. They are modern day \"five traitors in 1905\" who ceased to be members of the Korean nation and the most despicable group of traitors steeped in sycophancy towards Japan to the marrow of their bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The heinous traitors should be mercilessly buried in the graves of history in the name of the nation as they are working hard to sell the dignity and interests of the fellow countrymen to the Japanese reactionaries, lock, stock and barrel, till the last moments of their dirty lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the Koreans will surely force Japan to make a thousand-fold apology and reparation for all sorts of inhumane acts committed by Japan against the Korean people in the past by carrying forward the spirit and stamina of the March First Popular Uprising."
