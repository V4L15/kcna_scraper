To this end the international solidarity should be solid unity and disinterested support. Therefrom, it is important to provide the international solidarity on the basis of the socialist idea. Only doing so makes it possible for the revolutionary parties to cement their ideological and political unity and solidarity and closely cooperate and support with each other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international solidarity should be based on independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary party should respect independence of other parties while maintaining its independence. It is the principle and rule that should be strictly observed in the relations between the revolutionary parties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There can never be a superior or inferior party and an instructing party or a party being instructed among the revolutionary parties, and the comradely relationship based on independence and equality should be always maintained among them. Solidarity based on independence only can remain a solid international solidarity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists are now getting desperate, through international collaboration, to check the popular masses' cause of independence. Under this situation, it is important for the non-aligned and developing countries to positively support the peoples struggling for national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To support the people's struggle for independence and sovereignty is a noble international duty of the peoples of the non-aligned and developing countries out in the struggle to accomplish the cause of independence against imperialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is a treachery negating peace and reunification to attach importance to the outsiders who are pressing for division and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stand of attaching importance to the nation is inseparably linked to the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" The stance and stand of attaching importance to the nation cannot be expected from one bereft of this idea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defending peace is a vital task related to the destiny of the nation and a crucial task on which hinges the victory of the movement for independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The struggle to defend peace against war is a just and patriotic struggle to defend the foundation of the life of the Korean nation and, at the same time, a positive struggle for reunification to drive back the desperate challenges of the warlike forces opposed to reunification at home and abroad, promote national reconciliation and unity and achieve a shining victory of the cause of national reunification. To defend peace against war is a fighting task common to the nation to which it should give priority this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of the entire nation is a basic factor guaranteeing victory in this year's struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National unity is an important task which the Korean nation should consistently maintain in the whole process of the cause of national reunification as it is a decisive guarantee for independent reunification and constitutes its essence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To achieve the unity of the whole nation is the basic way of building the driving force of national reunification and enlarging and strengthening it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Putting fresh muscles into the great alliance against the conservatives in south Korea tallies with the purpose of the movement for a great unity of the nation to closely rally broad patriotic forces for reunification as one and meets the present requirement to carry out a progressive reform in south Korea.      \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Its application makes it possible to speed up the construction tempo considerably, while enhancing the quality of construction objects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The concrete mortar treated with the accelerator is stronger in fluidity, resistance to cold and corrosion and density than other ones. And the accelerator raises concrete intensity by 20-25 percent so as to save a large amount of cement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The accelerator has been widely used in the construction of the Samjiyon area, power stations in different parts of the country and dwelling houses in Thongil Street.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the Korean people vigorously rose up without any vacillation with a firm resolution and will to build a great, prosperous and powerful socialist nation on their land by their own efforts, technology and natural resources. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their efforts resulted in launching an artificial satellite, a complex of updated science and technology, having a powerful deterrent for the national sovereignty and building the Kaechon-Thaesong Lake Water-way and other monumental edifices. The upsurge unprecedented in all sectors is the fine fruition of the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proud victories and changes achieved in the construction of a great, prosperous and powerful nation under the Songun revolutionary leadership of the Party harden the Korean people's confidence that self-reliance is best. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Unswerving are the determination and will of the Korean people to accomplish the revolution with their own efforts no matter how the world may change and no matter what grave trials they may face. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will bring about the dawn of greater victory in the vigorous general march of Songun revolution with self-reliance, the theory of the revolution and a powerful wherewithal guaranteeing the construction of a socialist economic power, as a weapon.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
