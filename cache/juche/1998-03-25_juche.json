Only then can they side with the people calling for politics of national independence, politics of reunification. \r\n   This will do good to them.    \r\n     \r\n\r\n"

And there are steel gates with automatic opening and shutting device through which tanks, armoured vehicles and armed forces can advance toward the north any time.\r\n   Heavy weapons in the pillboxes are ready to open fire at the north any moment.\r\n   The United States did not spare financial and material \"assistance\" to  the construction of the wall.\r\n   In the fiscal 1980 when the laying of the wall was at the final stage, the U.S. invested 362.75 million dollars in the project.\r\n   The wall is a single product of the Cold War in the world.\r\n   The world public urges early demolition of the concrete wall, saying that with the wall remaining, the reunification of Korea cannot be achieved nor can its peace be ensured.\r\n   In view of national independence and the trend of the times, the concrete wall runs counter to the aspirations of the Korean people for peace and reunification.    \r\n \r\n"
