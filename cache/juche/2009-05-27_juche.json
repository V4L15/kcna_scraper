Korea's Full Participation in PSI as Declaration of War against DPRK\r\nPyongyang, May 27 (KCNA) -- The Lee Myung Bak group of south Korea keen on the moves for confrontation and war against the DPRK in league with foreign forces on May 26 officially declared at last it would fully participate in the PSI despite the unanimous opposition of all Koreans and public opinion at home and abroad. \n\t\t\t\t\t The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement on May 27 in this regard. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The so-called PSI is a mechanism for a war of aggression built by the U.S. against the DPRK under the pretext of intercepting and blockading ships and planes, etc. suspicious of transporting weapons of mass destruction including nuclear weapons and missiles.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The PSI has been criticized and repudiated at home and abroad for its aggressive nature and illegality.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Moreover, full participation in the PSI by a side on the Korean Peninsula where the state of military confrontation is growing acute and there is constant danger of military conflict itself means igniting a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK, therefore, has already seriously warned the south Korean authorities against the above-said moves and repeatedly clarified its stand that it would strongly counter those moves of the Lee group, in particular, regarding them as a declaration of a war as it is pursuant to its American master's policy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the Lee group undisguisedly took a step of fully participating in the PSI, which former regimes dared not do so, bringing the situation on the Korean Peninsula and inter-Korean relations beyond the uncontrollable danger line of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is preposterous for the Lee group to have opted to fully participate in the PSI under the pretext of the underground nuclear test of the DPRK for self-defense.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is nothing strange and quite natural for a nuclear weapons state to conduct a nuclear test.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The anti-DPRK racket kicked up by the U.S. and its followers under that pretext is not truly aimed at the nuclear non-proliferation but prompted by their black-hearted intention to stifle the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the south Korean puppets were so ridiculous as to join in the said racket and dare declare a war against compatriots through their full participation in the PSI, the DPRK is compelled to take a decisive measure, as it has already warned.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK solemnly declares as follows in view of the prevailing situation:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, The DPRK will deal a decisive and merciless retaliatory blow, no matter from which place, at any attempt to stop, check and inspect its vessels, regarding it as a violation of its inviolable sovereignty and territory and a grave provocation to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, The DPRK will take such a practical counter-action as in the wartime now that the south Korean authorities declared a war in wanton violation of its dignity and sovereignty by fully participating in the PSI.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon the south Korean puppet group of traitors for going mad with confrontation and war, bereft of any reason as servants for outside forces in the moves for a war of aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group will be held wholly accountable for the disastrous consequences to be entailed by its reckless hostile acts against the DPRK."

In view of this situation the Panmunjom Mission of the KPA clarifies the following principled stand of the revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t1. Our revolutionary armed forces, as they have already declared, will regard the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors' \"full participation\" in the PSI as a declaration of war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accordingly, they will regard any hostile actions against the DPRK, including checkup and inspection of its peaceful vessels, as an unpardonable encroachment on the DPRK's sovereignty and counter them with prompt and strong military strikes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2.  The Korean People's Army will not be bound to the Armistice Agreement any longer since the present ruling quarters of the United States, keen on the moves to stifle the DPRK, plugged the south Korean puppets into the PSI at last, denying not only international law but the AA itself and discarding even its responsibility as a signatory to the agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In case the AA loses its binding force, the Korean Peninsula is bound to immediately return to a state of war from a legal point of view and so our revolutionary armed forces will go over to corresponding military actions.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3.  For the present, we will not guarantee the legal status of the five islands under the south side's control (Paekryong, Taechong, Sochong, Yonphyong and U islands) in our side's territorial waters northwest of the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea and safe sailing of warships of the U.S. imperialist aggression forces and the south Korean puppet navy and civilian ships operating in the waters around there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is illogical for the DPRK to unilaterally meet the requirements of fair international law and the bilateral agreement since the U.S. imperialists and the Lee Myung Bak group of traitors have reneged on them. Nothing is graver mistake than to calculate that the American-style Jungle law can work on the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should bear in mind that the DPRK has tremendous military muscle and its own method of strike able to conquer any targets in its vicinity at one stroke or hit the U.S. on the raw, if necessary.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who provoke the DPRK once will not be able to escape its unimaginable and merciless punishment."

It was, therefore, a poor trick to gratify his political ambition to consolidate his political base. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was pushed to the margin of the society for revealing his vulnerability as the prime minister, besmirching the political landscape but his greed for power remains unchanged. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What should not be overlooked is the political landscape in Japan where such guys as Abe are allowed to ride roughshod. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such practices of Abe as going busy to bring the past back are painted as \"patriotic acts.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The process of turning politics rightist, the society reactionary and conservative is being accelerated as the days go by. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The peace and security of Asia are being jeopardized by those who seek to stem the trend of history. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No future is in store for Japan as its moves for militarization are frantically stepped up by the militarist maniacs."

A definite end should be put to it. \n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday urges this in a signed article.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group has quelled the aspiration and desire of the popular masses for the independence, democracy and reunification, bringing to light its treacherous nature, and followed in the footsteps of the preceding dictators who committed so many crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The above-said policy pursued by the Lee group is nothing but a sycophantic and treacherous policy and a fascist repressive policy aimed to maintain and strengthen outside forces' system of colonial domination, to all intents and purposes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee group has mercilessly cracked down upon the protests of people from all walks of life against its treacherous moves, while going busy with its moves to upgrade the south Korea-U.S. relations to the \"relations of strategic alliance in the 21st century\". The group of traitors is perpetrating such acts of treachery as allowing the U.S. to escalate its domination and interference into all fields including politics, economy and military affairs of south Korea and offering the whole of south Korea to it as an outpost for carrying out its strategy for invading the DPRK. These acts are now being zealously pushed forward under the backing of the above-said fascist dictatorship.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What such dictatorial rule of the Lee group has brought to the south Korean people over the past little more than one year is nothing but subordination and the absence of rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The said fascist dictatorship has bedeviled the inter-Korean relations and done serious harm to the national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present ruling forces of south Korea have worked with blood-shot eyes to bring to naught the successes made in the June 15 era of reunification, vociferating about \"the lost decade\". The Lee group has intensified the fascist suppression of the pro-reunification democratic forces of various circles in south Korea desirous of national unity and the reunification through an alliance with the north, while stepping up the policy of confrontation towards those compatriots calling for the sincere implementation of the north-south joint declarations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Free discussion of the issue of national reunification by the pro-reunification patriotic organizations and people and their activities for it are hardly thinkable nor it is possible to expect reconciliation and unity between the north and the south as long as the above-said dictatorship is allowed to go on in south Korea, concludes the article."

Seguro que no.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Es que sus acciones anti-RPDC parten de su sucia ambicion politica de ganar el terreno politico al alzar su popularidad inyectando en los habitantes el sentimiento a favor de la confrontacion entre las naciones y la conciencia hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Aunque fue destronado mientras producia una revuelta en el circulo politico de Japon, ese vulnerable ex premier sigue abrigando la ambicion del poder.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lo peor del caso esta en el terreno politico de Japon que deja pasearse libremente a los tipejos de la calana de Abe.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy dia, ahi son calificadas de \"patrioticas\"  las acciones de los elementos como Abe que andan ajetreados para reproducir su pasado lleno de crimenes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Con el paso del tiempo, se aceleran el proceso de derechizacion de la politica y la transformacion de la sociedad de manera reaccionaria y conservadora.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  La paz y la seguridad de Asia son amenazadas por ellos que intentan dar marcha atras a la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  No hay futuro a Japon que impulsa a toda fuerza la militarizacion a instigacion de los maniacos del militarismo."
