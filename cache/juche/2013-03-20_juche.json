He also set forth important tasks in making full combat preparations of the KPA as required by the prevailing situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He once again called on all the service personnel of the KPA to maintain high alert posture and wait for his order for the grand advance for national reunification. He had a photo session with the soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by Choe Ryong Hae, Ri Pyong Chol, Pak Jong Chon and Son Chong Nam."

The U.S. abused its hand-raising machine UN Security Council to openly invade the country, defying the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t Right after the September 11, 2001 incident, the U.S. stirred up \"terror-phobia\" in the world and braced up for a worldwide war called a \"war on terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It, at the same time, manipulated the passage of anti-terrorism resolution at the UNSC by employing a gamut of appeasement and deceptive tricks in a bid to elicit international support.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t U.S. President Bush at a conference of the UN General Assembly spoke loudly of the duty of all the countries to wage an \"anti-terror war\" to implement the UNSC resolution. He threatened to call to account those countries providing assistance or havens to the terrorists.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was a declaration of a war to attack any country of its choosing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Afghanistan was the first to fall victim to the \"war on terrorism\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The madcap \"anti-terror war\" waged by the Bush Administration was aimed at aggression and conquest of the world, pursuant to the neo-conservatives' design of establishing a \"uni-polar world\" dominated by the U.S. This gravely jeopardized the world peace and security. This is everyone's knowledge.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Tragic is that the UNSC professing assuming responsibility for world peace and security moved at the beck and call of the U.S. imperialists, entailing the serious consequences.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The same was the case with Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the West have been engaged in a smear campaign to topple the government in Iraq after the Gulf War. They set Iraq as the target of attack next to Afghanistan and inveigled the UNSC into the campaign against the country while peddling the story of \"threat by weapons of mass destruction.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As a result of pressure by the U.S. and the West and a political bargaining among big powers, UNSC's Resolution 1441 on the inspection of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq was adopted in November 2002.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The resolution said that it gives Iraq the last chance to fulfill its duty to disarm in line with the UNSC's relevant resolution and threatened that the country will face a serious end in case it again fails to comply with the duty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This, as commented by the world public, was a \"pass to a war\" that gave the U.S. the green light to disarm Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On the strength of this ultimatum, the U.S. forced Iraq to completely disarm itself and confirmed that it does not have any weapons capable of mounting fatal attack on the U.S. At a UNSC session in February 2003, the U.S. presented false data on Iraq's possession of weapons of mass destruction and the relations between the then Iraqi government and terrorist organizations, securing the pretext for invading Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At last in March the same year, the U.S. launched military invasion of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world was shocked at the U.S. gangster-like act which invaded a sovereign state with impunity by abusing the UNSC. The world complained that \"UNSC was dead\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then Nepalese newspaper Katmandu Post said but for the UN, the previous Gulf War and the present Gulf War would not have broken out."

It also turned down all proposals made by the DPRK government, including a proposal for conclusion of a peace treaty between the DPRK and the U.S. and a proposal for convening four-party talks aimed to replace the armistice agreement with a peace accord.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. turned south Korea into its biggest military base and nuclear arsenal in the Far East, intensifying DPRK-targeted war rehearsals year by year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Since the U.S. war maneuverings against the DPRK, a belligerent party, have reached an extreme pitch, interwoven with persistent economic blockade, nobody can predict what and when would break out on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that it became clear that AA can not avert the outbreak of war on the peninsula, DPRK's decision that it will be no longer committed to AA is a self-defensive measure taken to cope with the possible war by the hostile forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Therefore, the U.S. assertion is little different from a thief crying for a thief.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK army and people will mete out stern punishment to the war maniacs who finally made AA ineffective."

Korea as Regards Cyber Attacks on DPRK\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\n Pyongyang, March 20 (KCNA) -- Some days ago, leading internet websites of the DPRK were hit hard by virus attacks.

On Mar. 15, it \"served such warning that the north may cause a Ddos attack in the light of the fact that it targets mainly websites of military generals different from the attack made to gather financial information, etc.\" This propaganda is aimed at implanting anti-DPRK hostility into the minds of south Koreans and justifying the policy for confrontation with fellow countrymen and war. This goes to prove that the cyber attacks on the DPRK were perpetrated according to the carefully worked out scenario in advance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The rumor floated by the south Korean regime about cyber attacks on the DPRK is little short of another anti-DPRK farce orchestrated by it with the backing of the U.S. to secure a pretext for igniting a war against the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ceaseless ridiculous plots hatched by the puppet forces for a war of aggression against the DPRK would only bring into bolder relief their true colors and precipitate their self-destruction."

It blasted the U.S. imperialists' moves to ignite a new war on the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t The article said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Why has north Korea withdrawn from an armistice agreement that has kept overt hostilities on the Korean Peninsula at bay since 1953? The withdrawal serves, instead, as a signal of North Korean resolve to defend itself against growing U.S. and south Korean harassment, both military and economic.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Sanctions against North Korea are multi-form, and include a trade blockade and financial isolation. Significantly, no country in history has been menaced by such wide-ranging sanctions for so long. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Led by Washington, the UN Security Council has authored a number of resolutions to deny North Korea rights of self-defense and other rights that other countries are free to exercise: the rights to: build ballistic missiles; launch satellites; and transfer nuclear technology to other countries. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t On top of besieging North Korea, Washington and south Korea have for decades kept up a campaign of unrelenting military harassment in the form of regular war games. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While labeled defensive, the war games force the North Koreans onto a permanent war footing. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There are three reasons to regard the armistice agreement as existing in form alone, and not substance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the purpose of the agreement was to set the stage for a permanent peace. Despite North Korea repeatedly asking Washington to enter into a peace agreement, none has been struck. After one North Korean entreaty for peace, then U.S. secretary of state Colin Powell said. We don't do non-aggression pacts or treaties, things of that nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, the agreement was to be followed by the withdrawal of all foreign troops from the Korean Peninsula. The Chinese withdrew, as did most members of the UN forces. But the U.S. forces, which have remained in south Korea for the last 60 years, have become a permanent fixture on the peninsula. Incredibly, south Korean forces remain under the U.S. command.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Third, the agreement prohibits the introduction into Korea of reinforcing combat aircraft, armored vehicles, weapons and ammunition. The U.S. violated the agreement by introducing nuclear weapons into south Korea in 1958.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recalling that the Korean War was imposed by the U.S. and its lackeys on the north, the article continued: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Had the United States not intervened the country would have been re-united.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The article noted that the U.S. goal was to ruin North Korea's economy oriented to channeling all its efforts to people's welfare and development, destabilize its society and bring it to its knees."

Al fijarlo como blanco de ataque despues de Afganistan, difundio el rumor de \"amenaza de armas de exterminio masivo\" de dicho pais y sometieron ese asunto a la consideracion del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo resultado de la presion de EE.UU. y otros paises occidentales y del regateo politico entre las potencias, fue aprobada en noviembre de 2002 la resolucion no. 1441 del Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU sobre la inspeccion de armas de Iraq.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl documento dio a Iraq la ultima oportunidad de cumplir el deber de desarme, que demandan las resoluciones concernientes de dicho Consejo y declaro que en el caso contrario, ese pais persico se encontrara en el dilema sin salida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto fue para EE.UU. el \"permiso de guerra\" contra Iraq, estimo la opinion publica mundial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl imperio obligo a Iraq el desarme total y confirmo que ese pais no tenia las armas de exterminio masivo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn febrero de 2003, presento en el Consejo de Seguridad de la ONU los datos falsificados sobre la posesion de las armas de exterminio masivo en Iraq y la vinculacion del gobierno iraqui con las organizaciones terroristas.
