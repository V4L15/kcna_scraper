This is entirely attributable to the ruinous policies pursued by the authorities under the watchwords of globalization and internationalization. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In recent years tens of thousands of enterprises went bankrupt  and one million more workers lost their jobs because of the layoff and restructuring by the authorities who gave in to the mandate of the International Monetary Fund. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Tens of thousands of people destroyed themselves and psychopaths numbered over one million in a year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The ever-growing number of emigrants fully proves that South Korea is least fit for human habitation and it is a thrice-cursed society with no future. \r\n\r\n"

In this sense socialism of Korea should be defended not only by the Korean people but also by the revolutionaries and progressive people the world over. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He expressed the belief that under the wise leadership of Kim Jong Il the Korean people would smash the imperialists'  moves, more firmly defend their own socialism and achieve a brilliant victory in the building of a powerful nation. \r\n\r\n"

It is by no means fortuitous that he made hysteric remarks seriously provoking the DPRK. What merits particular attention is that his war outcries came at a time when the theory of preemptive attack on the DPRK is more openly advocated by the Japanese reactionaries and the reorganization of the Japan self-defence forces and their redeployment are going in full gear pursuant to its military strategy of paying attention to attack from west. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this lays bare the real aim sought by officials of Japan in kicking up the row about missile threat from the DPRK and the anti-DPRK smear campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Ishihara's outcries lash the Korean People's Army and people into great fury. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their hearts are burning with the resentment and hatred for the Japanese. They possess strength and capabilities more powerful than A-bombs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries dare mount a preemptive attack on the DPRK, defying its repeated warnings, the KPA and the people will throw them into the bottom of the sea so that Japan may not exist on this earth any more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese reactionaries had better shut up and drop their attempt at reinvasion. \r\n\r\n"
