Is it possible to properly calculate the action?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is something shocking that the ministry looking after \"the policy towards the north\" and its boss took the lead in kicking up the \"sanctions\" row.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present catastrophic phase is entirely attributable to those elements who stand in the way of inter-Korean relations to escalate the confrontation with compatriots.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their trumpeting about \"sanctions\" against the KIZ is as foolish an act as pricking its own eyes.

This is mainly attributable to the military confrontation policy and arms buildup of the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is busy giving spurs to maintaining and bolstering up its military muscle and developing latest weapons. This is driving the world into a pitfall of arms race. And this amounts to a serious challenge to the world peace and development. The nightmare of arms race dating back to the Cold War era is reviving today due to the U.S. arms buildup. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is, indeed, an arch criminal disturbing world peace and stability and a chieftain of arms race."

Y siempre que se creaba la situacion tensa, restringia e impedia la entrada del personal y materiales del Sur de Corea con el fin de asfixiar la zona industrial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda traidora dio espaldas y obstaculizo los esfuerzos de la RPDC por activar la gestion de la Zona Industrial de Kaesong. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSueltan las palabras absurdas como si la RPDC se beneficiara mucho de esta zona. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tConcedimos la Zona Industrial de Kaesong para la reconciliacion, la unidad y la reunificacion y con el sentimiento fraternal por las empresas pequenas y medianas y los habitantes pobres del Sur de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo mas estupefacto es que al frente de la campana de \"sancion\" anti-RPDC estan el Ministerio de Unificacion y su titular que auspician la \"politica sobre el Norte\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales tipejos enloquecidos por la confrontacion fratricida impiden las relaciones intercoreanas y trajeron la situacion catastrofica de hoy. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa \"sancion\" sobre la Zona Industrial de Kaesong sera un acto igual a caer en su propia trampa y traera las consecuencias indecibles. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSeria un calculo absurdo si los titeres surcoreanos piensan en que podrian ejercer la presion a la RPDC con la \"sancion\" sobre la Zona Industrial de Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDeseamos mantener la Zona Industrial de Kaesong en el principio de observar el espiritu de la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio. Pero, si uno quiere abusarla para su mala intencion aun en lo minimo y en cualquier forma, lo consideraremos como una \"sancion\" anti-RPDC y tomaremos las contramedidas rotundas de retirar todos los privilegios en esta zona y convertirla  otra vez en una region militar. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa responsabilidad por el respecto recaera enteramente sobre la banda del traidor Lee Myung Bak. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos traidores surcoreanos deben actuar con prudencia dandose clara cuenta de la grave consecuencia que se emane de su imprudente \"sancion\" sobre la Zona Industrial de Kaesong."
