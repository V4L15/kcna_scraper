It goes on:\r\n The U.S. embarked upon the road of war to conquer the world after declaring a \"war of aggression to combat terrorism\" before the world. It has since committed unimaginable monstrous human rights abuses in different parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is the chieftain of aggression and plunder and the kingpin of human rights abuses at present. The hideous human rights abuses committed by the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in Iraq go to clearly prove that they are, indeed, the most ferocious beasts and murderers in the present times.\r\n Regulations of the International Military Court and the Far Eastern International Military Tribunal stipulate that the disturbance of peace and massacres of innocent people shall become a crime against humanity, one of the gravest crimes under international law. The U.S. is obsessed by shameless way of thinking and extreme arrogance that any action of it will not pose any problem in meeting its greedy demand and interests.\r\n The U.S. is not a \"human rights champion\" as it claims but the worst human rights abuser in the world and heinous enemy of humankind. The U.S. imperialist aggression troops do not treat the people of other countries as human beings but regard their life as not more than that of a fly.\r\n GIs' human rights abuses in different parts of the world are attributable to their violation of state sovereignty committed due to the aggression policy of the present U.S. administration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists advocate \"defence of human rights\" while placing human rights above state sovereignty. This is aimed at playing down the importance of state sovereignty as much as possible and wantonly violating state sovereignty under the pretext of \"human rights\".\r\n By placing human rights above state sovereignty the U.S. seeks to justify its criminal \"anti-terrorist war\" and aggression policy. The \"anti-terrorist war\" committed by the U.S. is not to defend \"human rights\" but is aimed at invading and dominating other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to make a clean breast and reflection on its human rights abuses before the world and stand trial for them before advocating the \"defence of human rights\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
