Last year it committed a total war of aggression against Iraq at last defying the opposition of not only the United Nations but its allies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the war the U.S. massively used up-to-date WMD, killing a large number of innocent Iraqis. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. troops used about 1,700 tons of depleted uranium bombs in the war, though it is condemned worldwide for being another type of nuke, just as it did in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and the wars in Bosnia, Kosovo and Afghanistan. In consequence, many Iraqis were indiscriminately killed or wounded, all parts of the country were contaminated with radioactive substance and leukemia, lung cancer and various other incurable diseases broke out among its inhabitants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. inhumane sanctions against Iraq and massacres are criminal acts breaching international law on human rights. The convention on prevention and punishment of massacre stipulates that it is the mass killing to kill members of the collective, inflict serious physical and mental damage upon them and deliberately force the living conditions which may bring a total or partial physical destruction to the collective. The international convention on economic, social and cultural rights also stipulates that one cannot deprive people of their means of existence in any case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. violated and obliterated the national sovereignty and people's right to existence, the basic human rights, in a bid to monopolize the oil resources in Mideast including Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is keen to install a pro-U.S. regime under the pretext of \"rebuilding Iraq\" in a bid to establish a safe monopoly on the oil interests. Such plot is likely to bring bigger disasters to the state of Iraq and the nation in the days ahead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is happening in Iraq, the focus of the world's attention, goes to prove that the U.S. should be brought to a trial of human rights for its most hideous human rights abuses.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
