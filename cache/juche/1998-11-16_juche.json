Kumgang \r\n  Pyongyang, November 16 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF) in a statement expressed the expectation that the tour of Mt. Kumgang, the first of its kind in history of national division spanning half a century, will help achieve national reconciliation, unity and great national unity and promote national reunification.\r\n   The tour of Mt. Kumgang for South Koreans will soon start as a result of the Workers' Party of Korea's idea of great unity of the entire nation, its benevolent politics and a compatriot step of the DPRK government.\r\n   The statement was issued today in this regard.\r\n   It says:\r\n   For successful promotion of the tour of Mt. Kumgang in conformity with the desire and interests of the entire nation there should nothing different from the tour.\r\n   Particularly, great efforts should be made to create an atmosphere for smooth tour which conforms to its original purport.\r\n   If there still remain distrust and escalating confrontation between the north and south of Korea, the smooth tour cannot expected.\r\n   This  is a lesson drawn from the history of inter-Korean relations.\r\n   The South Korean authorities should stop provocative anti-north military manoeuvres and all sorts of confrontation with the north which cast a shadow over or endanger the tour which will soon begin amidst the interest and expectation of the entire nation.\r\n   Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we hope that all South Korean visitors to Mt. Kumgang will be grateful, with sincere love for the nation, our noble love for compatriots and magnanimity which provided them with a chance to tour Mt. Kumgang, value and love a tree and a blade of grass of the superbly beautiful mountain, a pride of the nation and make joint efforts to convey the mountain, a wealth of the nation, to posterity. \r\n\r\n \r\n"
