But it was nothing but wordplay.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities justify Japan's colonial rule over Korea under the signboard of \"modernization\" in middle school textbooks on social subjects which went through the screening in 2011. They deleted from most of the textbooks published in the past such hideous crimes against humanity as the massacre of Koreans during the great Kanto Quake and the issue of \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army in a bid to conceal them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey are also bringing to light Japan's attempt to grab Tok Islets, part of the inviolable territory of Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey passed through screening middle school textbooks on social subjects raising a claim to Tok Islets in March. Japan released a diplomatic blue book in April and the \"defense white paper\" in August, shameful behaviors asserting that Tok Islets belong to Japan. Such moves touched off towering indignation among the Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is also becoming evermore undisguised in its unreasonable discrimination and political persecution of the Koreans in Japan, victims of the Japanese imperialists' colonial rule and their descendants.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities also excluded only Korean schools in Japan from the \"tuition-waiver program for senior high schools.\" They are stepping up such anti-human rights and unethical discriminating policies as excluding them from assistance to the work for recovering from the damage done by the massive quake that hit East Japan and the ensuing tsunami.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is infringing upon the territorial sovereignty of the neighboring country and discriminating against the Koreans in Japan while distorting and hiding its war of aggression and colonial rule in the past, far from making apology and reparation for them. This is an indication that Japan's policy of aggression is going on.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, stop at once its moves to grab Tok Islets!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan has persisted in its attempt to make the issue of the islets an international dispute with the far-fetched assertion that the islets belong to it and the U.S. is taking the attitude of conniving at and sympathizing with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBut many data including maps and old records dating back to several centuries ago prove that the islets are actually part of the territory of Korea from a historical and legal point of view.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan's scheme to reduce the islets to a disputed region is absolutely intolerable as it revealed its wild ambition to reinvade Northeast Asia and Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, make apology and reparation for its war of aggression and all other crimes it committed during its colonial rule!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe hypocrisy of \"reflection\" uttered by the Japanese prime minister last year was brought to light by Japan's repeated claims to Tok Islets and distortion of its past history of aggression.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan can never forge relations of peace and cooperation with any country without making apology and reparation for its war of aggression and colonial rule in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese government, make a formal apology and reparation to the victims of its war of aggression and colonial rule including the victims of the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tStop distorting history in textbooks but educate the young generation in peace and human rights by use of textbooks telling truth about Japan's war of aggression and colonial rule!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities, immediately stop all acts of hostility toward the Koreans in Japan and national discrimination against them and ensure their human rights, the right to existence and the right to national education!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us courageously turn out in the struggle to force Japan to redress its past crimes and check its moves to seize Tok Islets!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a common task for all the Koreans to force Japan to redeem its crime-woven past and foil its moves to grab Tok Islets. But the south side's \"government\" is preventing the people in the north and the south from meeting each other by putting the \"May 24 measure\" into force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is very regretful that the north-south cooperation and solidarity to denounce Japan failed due to the present \"government\" as evidenced by the fact that the north side's delegation could not attend the international seminar on the issue of the comfort women for the Imperial Japanese Army held in Seoul and the seminar could not be held in Kaesong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to reenergize at an early date cooperation and solidarity among the organizations and figures of all social standings in the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe political parties, organizations and personages at home and abroad!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us force Japan to redeem its past crimes and foil its moves to seize Tok Islets in order to protect the dignity and honor of the nation."

There are in every residential district shops, restaurants, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, hospitals, cinema houses and other cultural and educational facilities. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDrawing the attention of visitors in the center of the city are the schoolchildren's palace, stadium, swimming pool, theatre and other modern buildings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Daqing oil fields have produced a total of more than 2 billion tons of oil for the past 50-odd years. This accounts for about 40 percent of the total oil output of the country.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAt least 8 250 scientific research achievements were made in the oil fields and more than 1 700 of them were awarded state prizes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe oil produced here is greatly contributing to speeding up the economic development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMany cadres and workers of the oil fields were dispatched to other newly developed oil fields across the country and are now working as core forces to push ahead with the nation's oil industry.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTherefore, the Chinese people say today's economic development would have been unthinkable without the Daqing Oil Fields.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe experience accumulated by workers in Daqing and their responsible work style are giving spurs to achieving the strategic goals for socialist economic construction of the Chinese people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe red banner of Daqing will remain vigorously fluttering in the dynamic advance of socialist China."

Pero, esto no fue mas que una buena combinacion de palabras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDe hecho, en los manuales de asignaturas sociales para las escuelas secundarias, aprobados en 2011, las autoridades japonesas justifican su dominacion colonial sobre Corea bajo el rotulo de \"modernizacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, encubren sus crimenes de lesa humanidad como el genocidio de coreanos durante el gran terremoto de Kanto y el caso de ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones, los cuales habian sido incluidos en la mayoria de los manuales anteriores.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, exponen abiertamente el intento de arrebatar el islote Tok, una parte del sagrado territorio coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn marzo ultimo, dieron luz verde a los manuales de asignaturas sociales de la secundaria que insisten en la \"soberania japonesa sobre el islote Tok\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVolvieron a insistir lo mismo en la carta azul diplomatica publicada en abril y la \"carta blanca de defensa\" circulada en agosto, lo cual causa vehemente indignacion de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe tornan cada vez mas brutales la discriminacion y el acoso politico a las victimas coreanas del coloniaje japones y sus descendientes que residen ahora en Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEntre otras medidas anti-DDHH y anti-eticas, las autoridades japonesas excluyeron unicamente a las escuelas coreanas de la lista de escuelas superiores subsidiadas y de objetos de reconstruccion del gran terremoto y subsiguiente tsunami que azotaron la zona Tohoku de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl atentado contra la soberania del pais vecino y la discriminacion de los coreanos, acompanados de la tergiversacion y disimulacion de las guerras de agresion y el colonialismo del siglo pasado, demuestran que sigue en pie la politica de agresiones de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que Japon pare ahora mismo sus acciones para despojar el islote Tok!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, Japon vino pretendiendo hacer del islote Tok una zona litigiosa internacional difundiendo su absurda opinion de que este le pertenece. Y EE.UU. toma la actitud de tolerar y simpatizar tal insistencia de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, bastan los datos como mapas hechos varios siglos atras y registros de historia que comprueban en lo historico, legal y practico que el islote Tok forma parte del territorio coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede tolerar jamas las citadas pretensiones de Japon que exponen la ambicion de agredir de nuevo al nordeste asiatico y a Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que Japon pida disculpas por todos sus crimenes relacionados con las guerras de agresion y dominacion colonial y los indemnice!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo falso del \"remordimiento\" referido el ano pasado por el premier japones se ha revelado a todo el mundo en los persistentes intentos de Japon de usurpar el Tok y en la tergiversacion de la historia de sus agresiones del pasado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon no puede establecer con nadie las relaciones pacificas y de cooperacion sin que pida disculpas e indemnice los danos causados por sus guerras de agresion y coloniaje.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que el gobierno japones pida disculpas oficialmente e indemnice a las victimas de sus guerras de agresion y dominacion colonial incluso a las ex consoladoras sexuales para el viejo ejercito japones!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Suspenda la tergiversacion de manuales e imparta la educacion de paz y DDHH a las nuevas generaciones con los manuales que narren tal como fueron las guerras de agresion y la dominacion colonial! \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Que las autoridades japonesas pongan de inmediato fin a los actos hostiles de toda indole y a la discriminacion nacional contra los coreanos residentes en Japon!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Levantemonos para saldar la cuenta de los crimenes del pasado de Japon y frustrar sus maniobras agresivas sobre el islote Tok!\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque eso es la tarea comun de toda la nacion, el \"gobierno\" surcoreano impide el encuentro de distintos sectores del Norte y el Sur aplicando las \"medidas del 24 de mayo\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRealmente, la delegacion nortena no pudo asistir al seminario internacional sobre el problema de ex consoladoras, celebrado en Seul, y el presente seminario no pudo abrirse en Kaesong como se habia previsto.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs muy lamentable que no se lograran la cooperacion y la alianza entre ambas partes coreanas para denunciar los actos de Japon por culpa del actual \"gobierno\" surcoreano. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHay que activar lo mas pronto posible la cooperacion y la alianza entre las entidades y personalidades de distintos estratos del Norte y el Sur. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos partidos politicos, entidades y personalidades en el interior y exterior del pais, \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t!Liquidemos los crimenes del pasado de Japon y frustremos sus maniobras agresivas sobre el islote Tok por la dignidad y honor de nuestra nacion!"
