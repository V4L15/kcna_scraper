This is recognized by the world community, to say nothing of the U.S. and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe national organizations in the north and the south and abroad should seek the best way of defending and glorifying the dignity of the nation through national cooperation which helps the north and the south become one, with the pride of being descendants of the proud ancestors of Tangun which have inherited the great intention of the sacred ancestors of Tangun and in the spirit of patriotism and unity, his noble teachings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWe should inherit the forerunners' noble spirit of anti-Japanese independence and anti-imperialism, and the north and the south and overseas Koreans should rise up as one to shatter the evermore undisguised outrages and moves of crafty Japan under the banner of unity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Council for the Peaceful Unification of Tangun's Nation, the Council of Bereaved Families of Men of Merit for Independence, the Federation of Homogeneous Nation Movement Organizations and 73 odd national organizations and patriotic religious delegates will take the lead in the resolute and dynamic anti-Japanese struggle. They will strongly oppose any form of war on the Korean Peninsula and, to this end, wage a strenuous movement to defuse the danger of war on the peninsula and achieve peace on this land.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLet us firmly support the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and dynamically advance to achieve the peaceful reunification of the country by pooling efforts and wisdom in the spirit of \"By our nation itself\"."
