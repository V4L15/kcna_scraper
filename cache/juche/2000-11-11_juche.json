Korean Red Cross president\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 11 (KCNA) -- Those who are due to go to Seoul as members of the second visiting group of separated families and relatives are bitterly denouncing the recent outburst and irresponsible behaviour of the president of the South Korean Red Cross. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Yong Hwang, teacher of the Korean linguistics department of Kim Il Sung University, said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe inter-Korean relations are switching to those of trust and reconciliation from those of distrust and confrontation following the historic Pyongyang meeting and the publication of the north-south joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Multi-faceted dialogues and contacts are now under way between the north and the south and the work for the exchange of visiting groups of separated families and relatives is making progress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that the President of the South Korean Red Cross at an interview with a magazine censured as an ultra right-wing magazine in South Korea described the meeting of separated families and relatives, a noble humanitarian undertaking, as an issue of confrontation between the systems in the north and the south. This cannot but be construed otherwise than a sinister remark beyond imagination. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter what he meant by such remark, this should never be uttered by a Red Cross official. His remark is contrary to the basic spirit of the historic north-south joint declaration and deliberately lays an obstacle to the settlement of the humanitarian issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the Koreans in the north and the south who have long lived in confrontation are going in for reconciliation, unity and reunification. If those who are directly responsible for dialogue, cooperation and exchange behave against common sense instead of respecting the other party and keeping etiquette before anyone else, it will bring irrevocable consequences. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The president of the South Korean Red Cross should frankly admit his wrongdoing and own full responsibility for what he has done, forgetful of his duty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We together with all the people in the North Korea greatly angered by his anti-DPRK diatribe will closely follow his future behaviour. \r\n\r\n"
