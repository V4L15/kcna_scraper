This is intended to cover up Japan's past crimes and evade the apology and compensation for them and, furthermore, infuse the idea of aggression into the younger Japanese for overseas aggression and thus attain its wild design for \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere\" at any cost it failed to do in the past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After all, the \"decision adopted in deep consideration\" means that the Japanese authorities have taken everything into serious consideration to achieve their ambition for overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should lend an ear to the voices of the Asian people who suffered immeasurable damage due to the Japanese imperialists in the past, and drop their shameless position not to redress and apologize for the past crimes while distorting them.    \r\n\r\n"
