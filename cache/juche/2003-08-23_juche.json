Korea Joint Military Drill Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, August 22 (KCNA) -- The U.S.-south Korea \"Ulji Focus Lens\" joint military exercise now underway in south Korea is a military drill aimed to step up the preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK, threaten and pressurize it and fan up hostility toward it and war hysteria among south Koreans, says Minju Joson today in a signed commentary.\r\n Recalling that the U.S. is staging this joint military exercise at a time when the situation on the Korean peninsula is getting tenser than ever before, the commentary says that it will only bring dark clouds of a new war to hang over the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that the joint military exercise is being staged despite the fact that the six-way talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean peninsula are expected to open thanks to the broad magnanimity and initiative of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There should be an atmosphere favorable for the smooth progress of the six-way talks and their good results. To this end any party to the dialogue should refrain from doing anything that may provoke or threaten the other party. The U.S. is, however, staging a war exercise to threaten the DPRK, its dialogue partner, and chill the atmosphere of dialogue, while giving lip-service to \"dialogue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This compels one to doubt the U.S. stand and attitude toward the dialogue for the settlement of the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its reckless acts of threatening peace in Korea and souring the atmosphere of the dialogue and give up its wild ambition to invade the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean military bellicose forces are well advised to bear in mind that they would be cursed and condemned by all the countrymen and meet self-destruction for their involvement in the U.S. imperialists' war moves against the DPRK and war rackets intended to harm the fellow countrymen.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
