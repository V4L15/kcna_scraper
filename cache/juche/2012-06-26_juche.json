The national liberation struggle and democratic forces grew stronger in all regions of Asia including Korea and Vietnam. The U.S. ruling quarters were busy shifting the responsibility for the failure of their Far East strategy onto each other. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe influence of the socialist camp steadily grew in the international arena and the anti-imperialist struggle for national liberation mounted in many countries which had been under the domination and yoke of imperialists. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, the U.S. military industrial complexes and the financial situation of Wall Street badly needed a war of aggression. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. economy greeted a heyday after raking up huge profits through massive production and sale of weapons during World War II. But, it began gradually sinking into depression in 1946. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was against the backdrop of a start of arms race and extreme horror of economic depression, the worst in the U.S. history that the U.S. political and military authorities decided to launch the Korean War as a way out of this. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe British magazine Economist said that the U.S. needed an opportunity of weathering the crisis and had no option but to invent a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. option for the Korean War to tide over the economic crisis spurred the revival of Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe article \"U.S. policy for colonizing Japan\" written by Prof. Konstantin Popov carried in Izbestiya of the then Soviet Union said: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"From a military viewpoint, the U.S. is encouraging the development of Japanese industry to be effectively used for arming the Japanese forces now being revived by the MacArthur command. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"This policy of the U.S. occupation authorities stemmed from the policy of the U.S. ruling quarters keen to turn Japan into their military bridgehead in the Far East. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"As of early 1950, the total amount of the U.S. investment in Japan reached 2.5 billion U.S. dollars. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"The U.S. war provokers plan to use Japan as a springboard for carrying out their Far Eastern military strategy while the Japanese ruling quarters hope to use the Korean War for implementing their scenarios for revenge.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe U.S. ignited the Korean War as it was much upset by the daily growing political, economic and military potentials of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFive days before the outbreak of the Korean War, a correspondent of the Swiss paper Neue Zurcher Zeitung said in his Far East report as follows:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"From an economic point of view, south Korea is in a difficult situation. Most of the profit-making industrial establishments and major power stations are located in the northern half of Korea.

He was inspecting fully battle ready troops of south Korea, surrounded by American officers and soldiers of the mercenary army of Syngman Rhee. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tZhou Enlai, the then premier and foreign minister of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, on June 28, 1950 issued the following statement as regards Truman's June 27 statement on intervention in Korea:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTruman's statement openly disclosed his military plan and, at the same time, was aimed at putting it into practice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn fact, the Syngman Rhee puppet regime's attack on the DPRK through the agitation of the U.S. government was kicked off by the U.S. for the purpose of securing a pretext for invading Taiwan, Korea, Vietnam, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is the U.S. imperialists' renewed interference in Asian affairs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to a TASS report dated June 29, 1950 from New York, a member of the House of Representatives from the Workers' Party of the U.S. said that the U.S. was unnecessarily fighting a war against the north Korean government. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe predicted that Truman's actions would bring miserable consequences to the American people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll these facts provide historical evidence proving that the U.S. is the provoker of the Korean War and the U.S. can never evade the responsibility for it."

            "content": "ACNC comenta la pasada guerra coreana\r\nPyongyang, 26 de junio (ACNC) -- ?Como se desato la guerra coreana (25 de junio de 1950-27 de julio de 1953) de la decada de 1950?\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 26 de junio de 1950, MacArthur remitio un mensaje al premier japones Yoshida, en la cual le ordeno suspender durante los 30 dias desde el dia 27 de junio el Akahata, organo del Partido Comunista de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl entonces periodico transmitio que \"MacArthur hizo suspender temporalmente el organo Akahata porque este periodico transmitio el hecho de que el ejercito titere de Syngman Rhee agredio ilegalmente a  la zona de la parte norte del paralelo 38 de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto no es mas que un minimo ejemplo del intento del imperialismo yanqui, caudillo de la provocacion de la guerra coreana, de ocultar su naturaleza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl estallarse la guerra coreana, la situacion politica internacional y la formacion de las fuerzas en las relaciones internacionales se hallaban en la condicion muy desfavorable en realizar la estrategia de dominio al mundo de Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDespues del fin de la Segunda Guerra Mundial, quedo proclamada la Republica Popular China, se concerto la alianza amistosa URSS-China, se aumentaron y se desarrollaron notablemente la lucha por la liberacion nacional y las fuerzas democratas en Corea, Vietnam y todas las regiones asiaticas. Tambien la capa en el poder norteamericana se entrego a imputar uno a otro la responsabilidad del fracaso sobre el Extremo Oriente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe amplio incesantemente en la palestra internacional la influencia de la esfera socialista y se puso en gran auge la lucha antiimperialista por la liberacion nacional en numerosos paises sometidos a la dominacion y la subyugacion de los imperialistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, los complejos de industria militar de Estados Unidos y la situacion financiera de Wall Street necesitaban apremiantemente la guerra de  agresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa economia estadounidense, que acogio la era dorada al adquirir los fabulosos provechos mediante la produccion y la venta de gran cantidad de pertrechos belicos durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, inicio a sufrir poco a poco la depresion economica desde 1946.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe inicio la expansion de gastos militar sin precedente en la historia de EE.UU, y el pavor extrema de la crisis economica, los cuales obligaron a las autoridades politico-militares del imperio decidirse a desatar la guerra coreana como remedio para superarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa revista britanica Economist revelo que \"Estados Unidos necesitaba la oportunidad para superar la crisis, razon por la cual no podia menos de fabricar la guerra\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa opcion del imperio de superar con la guerra coreana la crisis economica incito el renacimiento de Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn el articulo \"Politica de Estados Unidos para colonizar a Japon\" insertado en entonces periodico Izbestiya, el Prof. Constantin Popov senalo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Desde el punto de vista militar, Estados Unidos fomenta el desarrollo de la industria japonesa que se aprovechara facilmente para armar al ejercito japones en reconstruccion actualmente por la comandancia de MacArthur. Esta politica de las ocupantes autoridades estadounidenses parte de la politica de la capa norteamericana en el poder tendente a convertir a Japon en su trampolin militar en el Extremo Oriente. Hasta los principios de 1950, el valor total de la inversion de EE.UU. en Japon llego a 2 mil 500 millones de USD. Los provocadores de guerra estadounidenses planean aprovechar Japon como su trampolin militar-estrategico en el Extremo Oriente y la capa gobernante japonesa intenta utilizar la guerra coreana en realizar sus planes de venganza\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. desencadeno la guerra coreana por el temor ante el cada dia mas creciente poderio politico, economico y militar de la parte Norte de la Republica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t5 dias antes del estallido de la guerra coreana preparada por EE.UU., el reportero del periodico Neue Zurcher Zeitung de Suiza transmitio la siguiente informacion procedente del Extremo Oriente:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\"Desde el punto de vista economico el Sur de Corea se halla en el estado dificil porque casi todas las empresas industriales y las centrales electricas principales que adquieren el ingreso, estan situadas en la parte Norte de Corea. La banda de Syngman Rhee busca en la ocupacion del Norte de Corea la salida de la situacion catastrofica\", \"En el Sur de Corea hay mucha gente que busca resolver el dificil problema economico en la agresion miliar al Norte de Corea. El ejercito de cien mil militares y la policia de 50 mil adiestrados bien por los norteamericanos superaran al ejercito del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a una foto tomada en el Sur de Corea por el reportero de AP, Yukorolkov, reportero de TASS en Berlin transmitio como sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl reportero norteamericano saco en el paralelo 38 una foto que demuestra la primera etapa de la agresion al Norte de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la foto se ve claramente el aspecto de John Foster Dulles, uno de los traficantes de guerra y asesor del secretario de Estado norteamericano, quien con la cara sobre la trinchera observaba bien el estado de inminente accion de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDulles rodeado por el oficial norteamericano y los soldados de la tropa mercenaria de Syngman Rhee, verificaba personalmente el ejercito surcoreano dispuesto a combatir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl 28 de junio de 1950, Zhou Enlai, entonces premier del Gobierno Popular Central y ministro de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular China, hizo publica una nota con respecto a la declaracion de Truman, fechada 27 de junio, sobre la intervencion agresiva en Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa declaracion de Truman expuso de modo abierto su plan militar y al mismo tiempo, lo puso en practica, subrayo la nota.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEfectivamente, el ataque contra la RPDC, lanzado por el gobierno titere de Syngman Rhee a instigacion del gobierno de EE.UU., lo inicio este para procurar el pretexto de la agresion a Taiwan, Corea, Vietnam y otros, revelo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es precisamente otro acto de intervencion del imperialismo norteamericano en los asuntos de Asia, preciso.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun el reporte de TASS difundido el 29 de junio de 1950 desde Nueva York, un representante del Partido del Trabajo de EE.UU. dijo asi en la Camara de Representantes: \"estamos en combate innecesario con el gobierno norcoreano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tVaticino que tal conducta de Truman \"dara un resultado tragico al pueblo norteamericano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos susodichos hechos historicos comprueban que EE.UU. no puede eludir nunca la responsabilidad del estallido de la pasada guerra coreana."

            "content": "Minju Joson comenta desfile de militaristas japoneses\r\nPyongyang, 26 de junio (ACNC) -- El dia 12, mas de 10 uniformados de las \"Fuerzas Terrestres de Autodefensa\", con caras pintadas de camuflaje y equipados con mochila militar, rifles automaticos y bayonetas, marcharon por las avenidas de los distritos de Itabashi y Nerima de Tokio.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn un comentario individual publicado este martes, el periodico Minju Joson opina que ese suceso insolito, que hace recordar los tiempos previos a la guerra, comprueba el renacimiento del militarismo en Japon, y prosigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, el militarismo de Japon estuvo disfrazado detras de las consignas de \"paz\" y \"seguridad\". Pero, hoy en dia, Japon lo promueve abiertamente sin ningun tapujo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl restituir los derechos que tenian antes de la derrota en la Segunda Guerra Mundial como el de participar en la guerra y combate y el de contar con fuerzas armadas regulares, los reaccionarios japoneses quieren realizar su anejada ambicion politica de conformar la \"esfera de coprosperidad de gran Asia Oriental\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese contexto, ellos vienen impulsando la transformacion del pais en potencia militar y el renacimiento del militarismo enganando a la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que ultimaron los preparativos para emerger como Estado de guerra, lo que hace falta ahora es eliminar las barreras institucionales y sociales que impedian el expansionismo militar a ultramar, he aqui la intencion de reaccionarios japoneses.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy marcharon mas de 10 uniformados nada mas por la parte centrica de Tokyo, pero manana retumbaran esta metropoli las botas de millones de tropas agresoras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi los reaccionarios japoneses retoman por fin el camino de agresion desoyendo la demanda de la sociedad internacional y la opinion publica en contra de militarizacion, volveran a confirmar la leccion de historia de que los agresores se arruinan en las guerras desatadas por si mismos."
