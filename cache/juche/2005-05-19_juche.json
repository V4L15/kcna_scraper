And it was a bloody all-people resistance which demonstrated the unyielding spirit of independence, strong mettle and indomitable fighting spirit of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resistants brought a raging storm against the U.S. and opened a broad way of the movement for independence to south Korea by their heroic fight.\r\nThe uprising, however, left a grievous and painful tragic wound owing to thrice-cursed brutal massacre by the U.S. and its stooges, the south Korean military fascist clique. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the aegis of the U.S., the south Korean military fascists put down the uprising in cold blood by letting loose heavily armed south Korean soldiers administered with hallucinogen, insulting the resistants as \"mobs\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is none other than the United States which converted Kwangju into a city of death and a sea of blood. It is a disgrace and tragedy for the Korean nation to leave south Korea under the occupation of this U.S. till today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n May is a month of struggle and an anti-U.S. month in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean youths, students and people, carrying forward their proud tradition of struggle, should bring again a volcanic eruption against the U.S. in this stirring May and thus realize at any cost the desire left unrealized by the resistants of Kwangju. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggressor forces in south Korea should go back to their den at an early date, withdrawing their blood-stained hands from south Korea in response to the unanimous demand of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We express the belief that the south Korean youths, students and people of all social standings will set off another fierce anti-U.S. storm in the same fighting spirit as was displayed during the Kwangju Popular Uprising and usher in a turning phase in accomplishing the patriotic cause of justice to put an end to the U.S. military occupation and colonial rule and open a new era of independence.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It was the first time that a massive anti-U.S. protest took place\r\nin front of a U.S. military base as part of the commemorations of the May 18 Kwangju resistance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Shouting angrily \"U.S. forces in south Korea, the source of war, get out\", the protesters tried to pull down the multi-row barbed wire entanglements surrounding the base. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They trampled upon the broken barbed wire entanglements and, bursting into cries, poured polluted water flowing from the base upon the combat police.\r\n Much upset, the U.S. forces even called the south Korean army in addition to the combat police in the crackdown on the protest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Defying the water guns of the police, the protesters surrounded the entanglements of the base and chanted \"Let us crush the U.S. forces in south Korea.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n At about 5 p.m. they held a concluding meeting.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It asserted a more high-handed and excessive role of the U.S. in handling global issues and let loose a whole string of provocative remarks such as an \"axis of evil\" and \"outposts of tyranny\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The April 26 issue of the New York Times in a by-lined article noted that the Bush administration committed the biggest mistake in its foreign policy in handling the north Korean issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its writer claimed that Bush's Korea policy triggered off resentment of north Korea, pushing it to the manufacture of nuclear weapons, resulted in increasing the possibility of the outbreak of the second Korean war and boosted the danger of Japan and other Asian countries going nuclear and the possibility of terrorists acquiring nuclear substance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As already known, the DPRK resolutely pulled out of the NPT to cope with the evermore undisguised moves of the Bush administration to isolate and stifle it and had access to nukes for self-defense. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ever-increasing U.S. pressure over the nuclear issue and the reality today proved that a powerful force alone can defend justice and uphold truth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This being a hard fact, the U.S. again raised a hue and cry over the DPRK's abrogation of the AF. This is little short of a foolish attempt to evade its blame for having created the present complicated situation and justify its moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is chiefly to blame for scrapping the AF. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The basic spirit of the AF calls on both the DPRK and the U.S. to put an end to the long-standing abnormal bilateral relations and fully normalize the political and economic ties on the basis of respecting each other's sovereignty and giving up hostile intentions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, however, has not stood for a peaceful solution to the issues related to the relations between the DPRK and the U.S. but has worked hard to bring the DPRK to its knees, disarm it and swallow up it by force of arms in the end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nWhat the U.S. has sought in the several rounds of the six-country talks in the past is nothing but leverage for stifling the DPRK.\r\n These facts clearly indicate that the responsibility for having scrapped the AF entirely resides with the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the common understanding of the international community that the nuclear issue can never find a solution unless the U.S. drops its hostile policy toward the DPRK and has a political will to co-exist with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how hard the U.S. tries to label somebody as a \"war-like state\", it can never conceal its true colors as the chief criminal who reneged on the points agreed upon between the two sides and disturbed world peace and stability.    \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Accused of Its Double Standards \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- It was disclosed by words of a senior official of the U.S. government that the United States has a \"plan\" for limiting the right to uranium enrichment to Japan and four other non-nuclear states and allowing only Japan to conduct reprocessing aimed at extracting plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, according to a recent report of the Japanese paper Asahi Shimbun.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun Wednesday says in a signed commentary: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This has once again brought to light the brazen-faced nature of the U.S. unjust double standards concerning its nuclear policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S.-proposed \"plan\" is, in essence, a self-righteous move to deprive non-nuclear states of their rights to use nuclear energy for peaceful purposes.\r\n The United States has connived at and encouraged its allies in their development of nuclear weapons in violation of the principle of impartiality in international relations. Japan's moves for nuclear weaponization have reached a very grave phase due to the U.S. connivance and patronage. Japan is keen to secure at least 15,000 tons of plutonium by carrying out its plan for massive reprocessing of plutonium. Had the U.S. been fair in its stance, it would have called Japan's nuclear ambition to task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is, however, fanning up Japan's nuclear weaponization. Its \"plan\" is designed to justify Japan's moves to go nuclear and encourage them.\r\n The U.S. is pulling up those countries which incur its displeasure merely because of their differing ideologies and social systems. It is working hard to stop them from conducting even nuclear activities for peaceful purposes under the pretext of groundless \"information\" faked up by it against them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nMeanwhile, it is transferring nuclear technology to pro-U.S. and allied forces and conniving at and supporting their development and access to nuclear weapons. This is a clear proof of the biased and unreasonable nature of the U.S. policy of applying double standards. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. is truly concerned for the nuclear non-proliferation, it should abandon its unjust double standards over the nuclear issue.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson Wednesday says this in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is making a strong pitch for permanent membership of the UNSC by taking advantage of the trend of the UN reform. It strongly covets a responsible post at the UN in a bid to create favorable conditions for realizing its design for militarist overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is indifferent to peace, security and development of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Germany, once a war criminal state, is taking the road of a new development after drawing a lesson from its past wrongs. This helped Germany gradually improve its image and win deep confidence of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis can be viewed as a positive and desirable development in the light of peace and development of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But quite different is the case with Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan has evaded its honest repentance and settlement of its past criminal acts though nearly 60 years have passed since the defeat of the Japanese imperialists in the war. On the contrary, it has worked hard to revive militarism while whitewashing and distorting history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Supporting the Japanese reactionaries' bid for a permanent seat on the UNSC may entail such grave consequences as giving the green light to their attempt at overseas aggression.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This caused individualism to prevail in all sectors of the state and social management, including politics, economy and culture, and led to the collapse of socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today our country has become a forefront of the most acute struggle against imperialism and the United States. \r\n While intensifying the moves for military aggression, the U.S. imperialists and other reactionaries have made desperate efforts to infuse individualism into our country by all means and methods such as the infiltration of bourgeois idea and culture in an attempt to disintegrate our socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the sinister intention of the U.S. imperialists to foster egoism among people by spreading the corrupt bourgeois lifestyle and weaken the principle of collectivism in all spheres of social life and thus undermine our socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The might of the Korean-style socialism precisely means the might of the single-minded unity and collectivism constitutes a fundamental cornerstone of the single-minded unity of the Party, the army and the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the consistent policy and unshakable will of the Workers' Party of Korea to hold fast to collectivism as the lifeline for accomplishing the socialist cause.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Hill, U.S assistant secretary of State who is also chief delegate of the U.S. side to the talks, argued that the prospect of north Korea returning to the talks remains untransparent. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is a gangster-like assertion reminding one of a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\" It glaringly shows the impudent double-dealing nature of the U.S., a past master of plot and deception. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt is none other than the U.S. which is chiefly to blame for the deadlocked six-party talks and the delay in the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ever since the outset of the talks the U.S. has insisted on its assertion that the DPRK scrap its nuclear program first, sticking to its wrong stand that \"dialogue is possible but not negotiation\", thus deliberately rendering the talks fruitless. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No sooner had the third round of the six-party talks ended in June last year than the U.S. instructed senior officials of its administration to appear to insist on CVID and clarify its official stand that there would be no reward unless the DPRK dismantles all its nuclear programs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. went the lengths of creating an unprecedented atmosphere hostile to the DPRK, completely destroying the groundwork of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after the appearance of the second-term Bush administration, the U.S. did not drop its hostile policy toward the DPRK but totally rejected its system, terming it \"a tyrannical regime\", thus making it impossible for it to participate in the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality indicates that the U.S. has shown no interest in settling the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. through the six-party talks but sought to keep the talks going on without any result in a bid to buy time to achieve its black-hearted purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has already clarified through statements of the DPRK Foreign Ministry and statements of a spokesman for the ministry that if the U.S. truly wants the settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S., it should stop disregarding and insulting its dialogue partner and doing so would be helpful to creating an environment for the resumption of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. propaganda falsifying all these facts is aimed at dragging on the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula at any cost in a bid to invent a pretext for its sustainable interference in the Northeast Asian issues. For the present, it is designed to bring up the nuclear issue of the DPRK for discussion at the UN Security Council in an effort to create circumstances necessary for sanctions against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. lip-service to the negotiated peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue without any effort to rebuild the groundwork of the talks and the resumption of the talks is nothing but a cheap trick to evade its responsibility. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK still remains unchanged in its will to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula and seek a negotiated settlement of the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Blood-Purifying Finger Ring\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 18 (KCNA) -- A blood-purifying finger ring is attracting great interests of visitors at the ongoing 8th Pyongyang International Commodity Fair.\r\n The patented ring has been put on show by the Samhung Koast Joint Venture Company of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.\r\n It is popular at home and abroad for its potent efficacy for hypertension, hypotension, cerebral thrombosis, myocardial infraction, arteriosclerosis and other diseases causing ischemic brain and heart disorder. Of late it has been proved to be efficacious for diabetes, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also called \"Pitsam\" because its efficacy is not less than that of Koryo insam (ginseng). It controls immunity, kills inflammation, pain and stress and promotes vasodilatation and tissue regeneration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The ring gives no harmful effect to human body. It is made with the application of the bio-physical action of sun-rays or light of incandescent electric lamp passing through a specially processed natural jewel. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The company has developed various other kinds of blood-purifiers to treat malignant diseases. \r\n The blood-purifying finger ring, bracelet and treatment apparatuses made by the company have obtained patents at home. They have applied for international patent and their indications translated into seven languages to be introduced in 107 countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The finger ring was highly appreciated at the International Exhibition of Patented Technologies and Goods held in China in August last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is popular in China, Russia, Pakistan and other countries and regions.   \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
