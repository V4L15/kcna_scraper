Meanwhile, the South Korean rulers have pushed ahead with secret plans to introduce all types of missiles and their technologies from the United States and other countries and increase the range and efficiency  of their missiles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Their move to develop ballistic missiles poses a potential threat as it reveals their criminal design to threaten the north with missile attack and take a preemptive strike at the whole area of the north any time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will not remain a passive onlooker to the reckless act of the South Korean rulers who are reacting to the north's peaceloving efforts with the moves to develop ballistic missiles aimed at invading the north. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We are fully ready to mercilessly annihilate the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean rulers who are keen on invading the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the South Korean rulers persist in their desperate moves to develop ballistic missiles despite our warnings, we will take a stronger countermeasure against it.    \r\n\r\n"
