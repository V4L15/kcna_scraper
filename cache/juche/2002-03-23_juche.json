He denounced the U.S. as an empire of evil, the root cause of all evils and the biggest sponsor of international terrorism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He warned that if the U.S. attacks the DPRK with nukes, it will suffer disastrous consequences.    \r\n\r\n"

This is a thrice-coursed criminal act. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK can neither pardon nor show any mercy to the U.S. imperialists who are keen to stifle the DPRK by force of arms, while making nuclear blackmail and staging sabre-rattling, and the South Korean war hawks subservient to them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the revolutionary spirit and the unshakeable will of the DPRK to return fire for fire, react to retaliation and answer an all-out war with an all-out war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists and the South Korean war hawks make a preemptive attack on the DPRK at last, ignorant of its warning, they are sure to be burnt to death in the fire kindled by them.  \r\n\r\n"

It is no doubt that share his tour is aimed to encourage the joint military drills and the moves for a war against the peninsula, it noted. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, citizens' and public organizations in Taegu and north Kyongsang provincial area, the preparatory committees of the people's solidarity of Taegu and North Kyongsang Province and the reunification solidarity of Taegu and North Kyongsang Province and other organizations, 46 in all, jointly issued a press release at the press conference on March 21 denouncing Koizumi's trip to South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

But this is a foolish trick. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her remark merits more serious attention as it came at a time when the U.S. is escalating moves to stifle the DPRK in the wake of its announcement of a dangerous plan for nuclear attacks on some countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is nothing but another political cartoon revealing Japan's vulgar political mode of following and fawning upon the U.S. in its persistent moves to isolate and stifle the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For this Japan will only stand rejected and censured by the international community.     \r\n\r\n"
