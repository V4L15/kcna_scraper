And a note published by the supreme command of the allied forces after the defeat of Japan confirmed that Japan's sovereignty did not reach the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What is Japan after in insisting in a far-fetched manner that Tok Islet is \"an inseparable part\" of it, distorting hard historical facts, and in kicking up quite a row with outcries that it will \"establish its dominium over the islet\"? &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The current claim to the islet following the distortion of the history of its colonial rule over Korea and refusal to settle the past is nothing but a grave provocation urged by designs to revive militarism and invade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The Korean people will never forgive the Japanese reactionary forces which are now again seeking to invade and rule Korea, far from apologizing and compensating for the grave crimes Japan committed reducing Korea to a colony and forcing all misfortunes and pains upon it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should stop distorting history and give up the ambition for territorial expansion and sincerely come out to totally settle its past crimes this year in which falls the 60th anniversary of the liberation of Korea, the statement urged.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
