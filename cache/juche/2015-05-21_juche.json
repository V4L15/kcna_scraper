            "content": "S. Korean Puppet Forces Slammed for Abusing Humanitarian Issue for Their Sinister Political Purpose\r\n Pyongyang, May 21 (KCNA) -- Park Geun Hye in a \"congratulatory speech\" on May 19 urged the DPRK to \"resume the reunion of divided families\", talking about \"pain of divided family members at advanced ages\" and \"government-level efforts\". Earlier, she brought together riff-raffs of delegations of \"people of provinces in the north\" at which she talked rubbish that the above-said reunion has not taken place due to the north, claiming that \"the north is refusing even the proposal for dialogue\" though the divided families are suffering bitter pain.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet forces are letting the \"10 million divided families committee\" and other human scum organizations and conservative media mislead public opinion at home and abroad, asserting that the north is to blame for the failure to hold the reunion of divided families and their relatives. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are claiming that they would try to do something to substantially settle the issue of reunion but have blocked the way of all contacts and visits between the north and the south. Yet, they are calling for \"responsible steps\" on the part of someone in a bid to stir up the atmosphere of confrontation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Central Committee of the DPRK Red Cross Society in a statement on Wednesday termed it shameless sophism of those who derailed the reunion of divided families and an unpardonable politically-motivated provocation against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean belligerent forces are talking about \"pain of divided families\" and \"their sufferings\" while staging the north-targeted nuclear war drills strongly denounced and rejected at home and abroad. This is the height of hypocrisy and brazen-faced red herring, the statement said, and noted:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A flurry of rhetoric let loose by the Park Geun Hye group is nothing but a cynic ploy to paint itself as \"humanitarians\" in a bid to evade the blame for having driven the inter-Korean relations into a catastrophe and mislead public opinion at home and abroad and thus tide over the serious crisis of the regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group is behaving so disgustingly as to vociferate about Natural Law and \"pain\" while incriminating the meeting of fellow countrymen. It is little short of rubbing salt into the wounds of the divided families and their relatives once again.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With no rhetoric can the puppet group evade the blame for having derailed the above-said reunion."

            "content": "ACRC acusa a Sur de Corea de abusador de asuntos humanitarios\r\nPyongyang, 21 de mayo (ACNC) -- En su llamada palabra de felicitacion pronunciada el dia 19, Park Geun-hye se refirio al \"sufrimiento de los familiares separados de la edad avanzada\" y a los \"esfuerzos en el nivel de gobierno\" y exigio absurdamente a la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea la \"reapertura del encuentro de los familiares separados en el Norte y el Sur de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\tCon anterioridad, Park en una reunion con la delegacion compuesta por \"habitantes de provincias del Norte de Corea\" dijo que \"el Norte niega siquiera la propuesta del dialogo\" dando vista gorda al dolor de los \"familiares separados\". De esta manera, desvia la opinion publica imputando a la RPDC la responsabilidad del fracaso del encuentro de los familiares separados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere surcoreana lanza a las entidades de las escorias humanas como el \"comite de diez millones de familiares separados\" y los medios de prensa conservadores  a dar publicidad como si la RPDC asumiera la responsabilidad  de la no apertura del encuentro de los familiares y parientes separados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY parlotea como si hiciera algo para la mejora practica del problema de encuentro e impide todos los contactos y los viajes entre ambas partes coreanas, mientras crea perversamente el clima de confrontacion insistiendo en las \"medidas responsables\" de alguien. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn una declaracion fechada 20, el portavoz de Comite Central de la Asociacion de la Cruz Roja de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea califico los dichos y hechos de la banda surcoreana de sofisteria descarada de quienes fracasaron el encuentro de familiares y parientes separados y de provocacion politica imperdonable contra la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos belicistas surcoreanos desarrollan cotidianamente los ejercicios de guerra nuclear de agresion a la RPDC, rechazados fuertemente por el interior y exterior del pais, por una parte y por la otra, hablan de la \"tristeza y penalidad de los familiares separados\", lo que es el climax de la hipocresia y el engano de la opinion publica, senalo el portavoz y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa verdadera intencion de la banda de Park es para eludir  las responsabilidades de haber llevado las relaciones intercoreanas a la fase catastrofica hablando del \"humanitarismo\" y salir de la crisis del \"poder\" desviando la opinion publica del interior y exterior del pais.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLanzar sofisterias tales como \"moralidad\" y la \"penalidad\" al criminalizar el encuentro de los compatriotas es un acto malvado antietico destinado a dar sablazo dos veces a la  triste alma de los familiares y parientes separados.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda titere del Sur de Corea no puede liberarse con cualquiera charlataneria de las responsabilidades de haber fracasado el encuentro de familiares y parientes separados."
