Korean Authorities' Unethical Actions\r\nPyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- The Seoul Central District Court of south Korea on Feb. 8 issued a warrant of arrest for two members of the Council for Promoting the Reunification of Our Nation by Federal Formula on the charge of violating the \"National Security Law\" (NSL). They were reported to have tried to set up an incense-burning altar in December last year. \n\t\t\t\t\tMeanwhile, the prosecution is also mulling arresting members of the Association of Victims of NSL on the same charge. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMinju Joson Sunday observes in a bylined commentary in this regard: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was a just deed reflecting the mindset of the people that the above-said members tried to set up incense-burning altars to mourn the passing of leader Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is an elementary moral obligation for Koreans to express condolences on the demise of Kim Jong Il, the commentary notes, and goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe members of the above-said organizations tried to set up altars as required by the mindset of the people. This deed should be encouraged in the light of not only ancestral beautiful manners and customs but also the desire of the Koreans for improved inter-Korean relations. Nevertheless, the group of traitors is set to suppress them on the charge of violation of the NSL. These are unpardonable acts against ethics and reunification that only add to its crimes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe suppression of the progressive forces for reforms intensified by the group by invoking the NSL is nothing but desperate efforts of those in the grip of a crisis. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe aim sought by the group is to create fascist terror-ridden atmosphere under the pretence of security and harshly suppress the progressive forces for reforms in a bid to tide over its ruling crisis and win the forthcoming \"National Assembly\" election come what may. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, it is sadly mistaken. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group of traitors would be well advised to step down of their own accord before facing a stern punishment by the people."
