It is very instrumental in safeguarding the country and the revolution and ushering in the new era of the building of a powerful and prosperous nation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The faith of the Korean people in the ongoing struggle for the building of a powerful nation is that there is neither them nor a powerful nation without him.\r\n   The monolithic unity is a source of creating something out of nothing and of effecting a second Chollima great upswing.\r\n   The building of Korea into a socialist powerful nation is not an empty talk nor a thing of the distant future. The Korean people is crowned with the might of ideology and unity with which any material and economic potentials cannot stand comparison. The monolithic unity makes the people forerunners of creation and miracles who have nothing impossible.  It makes a nation a powerful nation who makes a bold attack in face of whatever adversity.\r\n   The Korean people, who rallied close around him with one ideology and purpose, will surely follow up the \"arduous march\" with a cheerful advance and build a Juche-based powerful nation in this land to be envied by the world people in a few years to come.  \r\n\r\n\r\n"
