The south Korean authorities should not deliberately wag their tongues.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is none other than the south Korean authorities that take the lead in mud-slinging at the DPRK in gross violation of the agreement made at the north-south high-level contact.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The minister of Foreign Affairs is persistently letting loose such very provocative and reckless remarks as the north is conducting a dialogue offensive \"but, in actuality, it is busy with such provocations\" as demanding a halt to the joint military exercises \"while showing no sign of change.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The minister of Unification is obsessed with such accusations against compatriots that he is letting loose base and disgusting outbursts that \"even soup would not be offered\" to the north in case it fails to keep a promise. What he uttered is lashing the service personnel and people in the north into fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It is no exaggeration to say that it is none other than the bosses of ministries and agencies in charge of the north affairs of south Korea who recklessly wag their tongues to turn its whole into a theatre of anti-DPRK smear campaign. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If they are truly concerned for the improved north-south relations, the authorities should stop their reckless mud-slinging, though belatedly, as it is the root cause of all disasters.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t2. The south Korean conservative media had better behave themselves.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When Choson Ilbo, Choongang Ilbo, Dong-A Ilbo and other conservative newspapers release misinformation on the basis of sheer lies, KBS, MBC, SBS and other broadcasting services kick up a smear campaign by adding silly stories to it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Mass media in south Korea should not act as organizations of hack writers inciting distrust and enmity and fostering division after being reduced to waiting maids serving the wrong regime but act as a patriotic guide contributing to national reconciliation and peaceful reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t3. The south Korean authorities should stop resorting to such foolish acts as protecting despicable human scum by force of arms and hurling them into scattering anti-DPRK leaflets.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as human scum called \"defectors form the north\" are concerned, they are good-for-nothings worse than dogs as they took to flight, forsaken even by their kith and kin for perpetrating all kinds of evils such as murder, robbery, a dissipated and corrupt life and scandals. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t How poor and mean the south Korean authorities' attitude is as they use such disgusting dregs of the times for their smear campaign and confrontation with the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK sent meaningful warning notices to Chongwadae twice that south Korea would get nothing in future if it doesn't stop such mud-slinging as scattering leaflets against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear deep in mind that the more persistently they insist that \"they cannot restrict the mud-slinging at the north as long as there is no clear reason\", making absurd excuses such as \"freedom of expression, rally and association,\" the more clearly they will reveal their incompetence, much less shirking their responsibility for bedeviling the north-south relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Although the north-south high-level contact was held and a precious national agreement was reached amid the great expectation and concern of all Koreans, the situation prevailing at present less than a month since then is so beyond imagination. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities should bear deep in mind that there can be confidence-building touted by them and a bright prospect for improving the inter-Korean relations when they respect the other party and honestly implement the agreement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present time does not allow fooling the nation with an empty talk.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will closely watch the attitude and moves of the south Korean authorities."
