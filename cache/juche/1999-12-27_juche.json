It is top priority of the nation which brooks no further delay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Korean peninsula has not yet been reunified because of the U.S. troops' presence in South Korea and the separatist policy by the South Korean authorities who ask for permanent presence of the U.S. forces in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. military presence in South Korea is the main obstacle to national reunification and a root cause of division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. media, keeping mum about the U.S. military presence in South Korea, asserted that the increased national defense capabilities of the DPRK are likely to delay the reunification of Korea. The allegation reminds the people of a thief crying \"stop thief.\"   The potentials of the invincible and solid anthropocentric socialist system of Korean style under which the monolithic unity of the party and the popular masses has been achieved and all the people form a large harmonious family represent a basic guarantee for the promotion of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The basic way of national reunification is to put into practice a proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal is quite realistic, reasonable and just one with which to solve the issue of Korea's reunification most easily and most quickly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the U.S. truly wants peace and stability on the Korean peninsula, it should not stop spreading ill-intentioned rumour harmful to the reunification of Korea, but pull its troops out of South Korea and respond to the DPRK's proposal for reunification by confederacy formula at an early date. \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Utterances meant to justify bio-chemical war preparations \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, December 27 (KCNA) -- Recently high-ranking military officials of the U.S. reiterated \"anti-bacillus anthracis vaccine\" on an unreasonable pretext of \"possible use of bacillus anthracis by the DPRK.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They highlighted the needs to inoculate the U.S. forces and South Korean Army with the vaccine. The U.S. department of defense made public that the U.S. is discussing the supply of vaccine to South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All this is designed to justify bio-chemical war preparations against the DPRK. The foolish act causes apprehensions among the people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. loudmouthed \"possible use of bacillus anthracis by the DPRK\" is a fabrication and a base rigmarole designed to do harm to the DPRK and tarnish the image of the peace-loving people. It is also a trick to cover the true colors as the source of development and proliferation of bio-chemical weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the U.S. that produced a large number of bio-chemical weapons, deployed them in different parts of the world and used them on a large scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S.-supplied radioactive and depleted uranium bombs and mass destruction weapons of poisonous virus were used in the air raids on Yugoslavia by the U.S.-led NATO forces, which shocked the world this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This indicates, in the final analysis, that the U.S. is likely to provoke a war against the DPRK and to use the above-mentioned bio-chemical weapons there on a large scale. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. is the chief culprit of the use of bio-chemical weapons. That is fully evidenced by the recently-disclosed spraying of defoliant, a poisonous substance of mass destruction, in the Demilitarized Zone along the Military Demarcation Line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The spraying of defoliant that posed threat to existence of living things and claimed so many human lives is the continuation of the atrocious bacteriological war waged by the U.S. in the Korean War of the 50s. So, it invites the unanimous denunciation from the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S., guilty of a long list of evil deeds, is taking issue with the DPRK over the \"possible use of bacillus anthracis.\" That is the height of impudence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. that threatens humankind with bio-chemical weapons as well as nuclear arms is doomed to face a stern judgement by history. \r\n\r\n"

Japan is beautifying its past crimes and trying to flee from its responsibility for them, far from admitting the heinous crimes committed against many countries in Asia in the past, the Korean people in particular. As a result, only Japan has not yet shaken off the ill fame of the \"enemy state\" and the world views it as a \"political dwarf\" and a \"morally backward child\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If Japan truly wants to improve its image as a member of the international community and enjoy trust, it must show an honest attitude in liquidating the crime-woven past before anything else. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
