            "content": "KCNA refutes Japan's sophism about its spy satellites \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 7 (KCNA) -- Director general of the Japan Defense Agency Ishiba at a press conference held at the end of a ministerial meeting on April 1 let loose the sheer sophism that spy satellites launched by Japan are not contrary to the spirit of the DPRK-Japan Pyongyang Declaration as they are for a peaceful purpose.\r\n This is nothing but a crafty attempt to conceal the goal of the spy satellites to contain the DPRK and other Asian countries by force and cover up Japan's wanton violation of the spirit of the declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is universally known that Japan launched two spy satellites by use of large delivery rocket H-2A at the end of march, defying the DPRK's warning, in order to meet Tokyo's purpose of military espionage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan seeks to realize its ambition to emerge a military power even in the space in a bid to establish its supremacy not only over the Korean Peninsula but over the rest of Asia. That is why the Korean and other Asian people are strongly protesting and denouncing Japan's launch of spy satellites. \r\n It is needless to say that Japan's spy satellites are targeted against the DPRK as evidenced by Japan's open talk that the satellite launch was to cope with the missile threat from North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, Ishiba asserted that it was for a peaceful purpose. This is intolerable as it is a foolish attempt to mislead the unbiased public opinion opposed to the launch of spy satellites. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that he was so brazen-faced as to claim that the satellite launch was not contrary to the basic spirit of the Pyongyang declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By launching the spy satellites targeted against the DPRK Japan seriously violated the spirit of the declaration that calls on both sides to refrain from threatening each other and sparked a new arms race in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are now watching for a chance to stage a comeback to Korea by taking advantage of the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and intensifying espionage on different sectors to this end. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The dangerous military moves of the Japanese bellicose forces keen to revive militarism and launch reinvasion are escalating the military tensions on the Korean peninsula and compelling the DPRK to further beef up its self-defensive capability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the DPRK is exposed to a grave threat owing to the reckless moves of the Japanese reactionaries, the people and the army of the DPRK will deal merciless blows at the aggressors by mobilizing the tremendous defence capability to the maximum. \r\n\r\n"

But Kim Jong Il recommended white radish kimchi, one of the Korean dishes for them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That evening the guests were briefed on the kimchi and tasted it. They emptied their bowls of kimchi and wanted more. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Told about the fact, Kim Jong Il said some people were thinking that such national dishes as kimchi and peppered bean paste were not suitable for foreigners but would hurt the honor of the country. He also said those who did not value their own things but willy-nilly respect others' things were blind fools and those who felt proud of their own things, even though small, which others did not have were patriots.    \r\n\r\n"

Its history is characterized by plunder, massacre, armed intervention in others' internal affairs, plots to topple other governments, aggression and war.\r\n The U.S. imperialists, who stop at nothing to satisfy their desire for aggression, unleashed the Iraqi war, typical of state terrorism, irrespective of international law and world public opinion. Such high-handed practice of theirs has trampled down humankind's dream of living in a peaceful and prosperous world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In 130 years since its appearance the United States expanded its territory more than ten times in the way of terrorism through 114 big and small wars of aggression and some 8,900 military interventions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Even after World War II the U.S. imperialists, in all parts of the world, ignited or intervened in some 20 wars including the Korean war and the Vietnamese war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have thousands of military bases and facilities and hundreds of thousands of soldiers in about 140 countries and regions, backing state terrorism by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the termination of the Cold War, they have stretched their tentacles of aggression and plunder to every corner of the world by means of undisguised nuclear threat and blackmail and hot war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is none other than the United States that has deployed sophisticated military equipment including more than 1,000 pieces of nuclear weapons in South Korea and staged joint military manoeuvres with it, threatening peace and security on the Korean Peninsula and in Asia and the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation clearly shows that the United States, the headquarters of state terrorism, is the root cause of aggression and war and as long as the U.S. imperialists exist, genuine peace can never be ensured on the globe.    \r\n\r\n"

Worse still, the moves, the anti-peace acts, are sparking a new arms race and Cold War. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThat's why some countries will not remain a passive onlooker to Japan's moves to establish a space spy system but take corresponding steps. It is as clear as noonday that the moves will invite a new arms race and cold war. The Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia will be exposed to the greatest danger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have already warned that Japan's launching of spy satellites is a hostile act, a grave threat to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nNevertheless, Japan launched spy satellites targeted on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The moves of Japan will bring grave consequences to the worldwide efforts for peace, disarmament and detente and adversely affect peace in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia. Japan should bear full responsibility for the grave consequences to be entailed therefrom.    \r\n\r\n"
