Their moves are a deliberate and premeditated provocation to drive the DPRK-Japan hostile relations to a military conflict. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly, their theory of \"preemptive attack\" on the DPRK is a move as dangerous as a declaration of war to reinvade Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The successive Japanese regimes have enforced their hostile policy toward the DPRK, but they have never openly agitated a war, threatening the sovereignty of the DPRK with the theory of \"preemptive attack\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Herein lies the greater danger of Japan's moves for reinvasion of Korea.\r\n The history of the Japanese imperialists' sanguinary aggression and colonial rule of Korea can neither be forgotten nor be erased no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. Their 40-odd year-long colonial rule was the unheard-of fascist rule to obliterate the soul and resourcefulness of the Korean nation and its five thousand year-long history and cultural tradition and Japanize the whole of Korea. The Korean people are burning with indignation at the crimes of the Japanese imperialists in Korea. The Korean people can never forget the past crimes of Japan no matter how much water may flow under the bridge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is the sworn enemy of the Korean people. It is the firm will of the Korean people to settle accounts with Japan at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We have many things to settle accounts with Japan. The more Japan tries to evade the liquidation of the past crimes and intensifies its moves for reinvasion of Korea, the more the Korean people's hatred for Japan grows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the Korean people will wreak their inveterate grudge against Japan in unity under the banner of national cooperation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

His Songun leadership has opened a new heyday in the history of the development of self-defensive military power and single-minded unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The editorial refers to the tasks to resolutely defend and eternally glorify the immortal exploits performed by the President in the struggle for the liberation of the country and its prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It calls upon the entire Party, all the army and people to uphold the Songun revolutionary leadership of Kim Jong Il with one mind, devotedly defend the headquarters of the revolution and make a fresh leaping progress in the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the reunification of the country is the supreme cause of the nation for which the President had worked heart and soul to the last moments of his life, the editorial calls upon all the fellow countrymen in the north and the south and overseas to conduct a vigorous patriotic movement for independent reunification, peace against war and great national unity under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\" to resolutely frustrate the U.S. imperialists' new war provocation moves and open a new phase for the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson lays stress on defending the dignity and sovereignty of the nation generation after generation under the banner of Songun.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
