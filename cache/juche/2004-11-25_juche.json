Korean Authorities' Ban on Operation of Internet Sites Denounced \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- The Reunification Solidarity and other organizations of the reunification movement of south Korea on Nov. 19 reportedly called a press conference in front of the general building of the government, denouncing the government authorities' action to cut off the operation of Internet sites.\r\n Chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification Ra Chang Sun, Representative of the Jinbo Network Ri Jong Hoe and Permanent Representative of the Reunification Solidarity Han Sang Ryol charged at the press conference that the action taken to cut off Internet sites' connections with compatriots in the north and overseas is an act of suppressing the freedom of expression and laying another obstacle to the south-north relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a matter provoking the world's derision for the government authorities to deprive Internet sites of the right to receive information for the mere reason that they have \"pro-north\" tendency, they noted, declaring they would form a committee of measures for the abolition of the \"National Security Law\" and the freedom of information with civic and public organizations and Internet media organizations to conduct joint counter-actions.    \r\n \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\n"

            "content": "U.S. Can Never Cover Up Illegality of Its \"War against Terrorism\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- The United States is taking much pain to justify its \"war against terrorism\" under the signboard of \"spread of democracy\". Lurking behind this is a sinister intention to cover up the illegality of the \"war against terrorism\" and include even the human rights issue in its category, says Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed article.\r\n The U.S. efforts to veil its \"war against terrorism\" with the \"spread of democracy\" are attributable to the international community's strong opposition to and rejection of the war, the article observes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. much publicized \"spread of democracy\" is aimed to fight a fiercer \"war against terrorism\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is trying to justify its undisguised interference in the internal affairs of other countries and its wanton violation of their sovereignty with the slogans of \"democracy\" and \"protection of human rights\". Whenever an opportunity presented itself the U.S. has found fault with human rights performances in other countries which incur its displeasure and threatened to put political, diplomatic and economic pressure upon them if they do not settle the \"human rights issue\". Through this the U.S. seeks to instigate counter-revolutionary elements to cause social chaos and uneasiness and realize regime changes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. \"strategy against terrorism\" and human rights offensive conducted under the guise of \"spread of democracy\" is targeted against the DPRK today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. ruling quarters are escalating their moves to bring down the political system in the DPRK and stifle it under the pretext of its non-existent \"sponsorship of terrorism\" and \"human rights abuses\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But the U.S. human rights offensive and its moves to stifle the DPRK are bound to go bankrupt. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. hands are stained with the blood shed by too many people to talk about the \"spread of democracy.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, indeed, are hideous aggressors, destroyers of world civilization and biggest abusers of human rights in the world as they have wantonly violated international law under the pretext of \"war against terrorism\" and resorted to acts quite contrary to the universally recognized human ethics and cultural common sense.    \r\n\r\n   \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Ban on Operation of Internet Sites Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, November 24 (KCNA) -- The south Korean authorities have taken an action to ban the operation of Internet sites after branding them as \"pro-north sites.\" This is a grave act contrary to the era of reunification after the publication of the June 15 joint declaration and an intolerable crime against the nation as it is aimed to quell the people's mind-set toward national reconciliation, unity and reunification, Minju Joson Wednesday says in a signed commentary.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is something beyond common sense that Internet sites' connections are cut off in south Korea though it is the IT age in which the operation of Internet sites has become a global trend. This is little different from the suppression of the press in the period of the military fascist dictatorship when the \"movement to properly know about the north\" was under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This goes to clearly prove that the south Korean authorities' loudmouthed \"south-north reconciliation and cooperation\" is nothing but hypocrisy and their real intention is to stand in confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the south Korean authorities keep cutting off Internet sites' connections defying the unanimous demand of the times and the nation, they will be held fully accountable for all the consequences to be entailed by the action.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This self-exposes before the world the fact that south Korea is a closed society in which elementary freedom and right of communication for everybody are abridged and suppressed on charges dating back to the Cold War era. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It strongly demanded the south Korean authorities revoke at once its action to cut off Internet site connections. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement expressed the conviction that all compatriots in south Korea and abroad would turn out in a positive struggle to foil the authorities' action and get the disconnected sites relinked.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
