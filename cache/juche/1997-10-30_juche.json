            "content": "Shameless excuse\r\nPyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- Kim Young Sam issued an \"order\" at the \"enlarged meeting of ministers in charge of economy\" on October 27, according to a report.\r\n   At the meeting, he, pretending to be interested in the economy and public welfare, prattled that they must do their utmost to clear away the anxiety of the people and entrepreneurs and revitalize the economy.\r\n   He also cried that the authorities' decision on court receivership of the Kia group was an inevitable measure and, accordingly, if illegal acts were discovered in the course of its implementation, they must be strictly dealt with and that workers and trade unions must cooperate with the authorities in this work.\r\n   This order is a shameless excuse to evade the responsibility for economic bankruptcies caused by the \"civilian\"-reiled authorities, an unbearable mockery of the workers, victims, and an open revelation of the intention to crack down upon the labour movement.\r\n   As is known, the present south Korean economic crisis is a product of the misrule of Kim Young Sam, the kingpin of irregularities and corruption. This is proved by the Hanbo incident, the ensuing bankruptcies of the Sammi group, the Kia group and other big business groups and the chaotic crisis of finance and stock market.\r\n   This is why the Kia motors co. Trade union and other unions under the south Korean confederation of trade unions brand the authorities' court receivership of the Kia group as a scheme to hand the Kia motors co. Over to specific businesses after deliberately leaving the bankruptcies as they are.\r\n   This notwithstanding, Kim Young Sam let loose a string of hokum about \"clearing away the anxiety of people and entrepreneurs\" and \"revitalization of the economy\". This reveals his ulterior intention to conceal the slush funds he received from specific business groups.\r\n   No sooner had the crisis of the Kia group occurred than he revealed again his intention to crack down upon the labour movement as he did at the time of the incident of the \"labour law\". \r\n   All this clearly shows that Kim Young Sam is a truculent fascist tyrant who violates even the elementary vital rights of workers.    \r\n\r\n"

It is an intolerable mockery of the entire fellow countrymen and an open challenge to justice and conscience.\r\n   He is seeking a way out of the worsening ruling crisis with florid phraseology about confrontation and war and \"policy\", but it is no more than last-ditch efforts of those at the point of death.\r\n   He must renounce a foolish design to secure the ruling security and his safety after retirement with shameless intrigues and trickery, step down from power at once and stand trial before the nation, the bulletin stressed.   \r\n\r\n"

Kim Jong Il's matchless grit\r\n Pyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) - General Secretary Kim Jong Il with matchless grit fights against the enemy, not wavering in any adversity. \r\n   He is overcoming any difficulties and trials with composure. He is not yielding to the threat and blackmail of hundreds of thousands of aggression troops. \r\n   When pueblo, an armed spy ship of the U.S. imperialists, was captured in early Juche 57 (1968), the enemy threatened the Korean people, prattling that they did not spy on the DPRK.  At that time General Kim Jong Il decisively declared that the DPRK would never send back the captured military personnel before the U.S. made an apology, though they were threatening the DPRK with aircraft carrier and aeroplanes. They were compelled to admit their criminal act and knelt down before the Korean people.\r\n   By faking up the \"Panmunjom incident\" in August Juche 65 (1976), the U.S. were getting frantic as if they would make Korea a sea of fire, with fighter bombers and warships carrying nuclear weapons. At that time General Kim Jjong Iil said he thinks nothing of the enemy's threat.  \r\nAnd he visited the construction site of the Mansudae Art Theatre, saying that no matter how frantically the enemy may resort to war rackets we will answer them with extraordinary speed of construction with our own principle.\r\n   He made the enemy shudder by facing their reckless military manoeuvres with decisive self-defensive steps.\r\n   They shipped nuclear strike means to the Korean Peninsula and its waters and staged nuclear war exercises by mobilizing the aggression troops more than 200,000 strong in March Juche 82 (1993). They prattled that if north Korea did not allow a \"special inspection\" of military objects, it will suffer the same as Iraq. General Kim Jong Il ordered the whole country, all the people and the entire army to enter into a semi-war state and declared that if the enemy ignite a war we will deal an annihiliating strike to them. \r\nAnd then he made sure that the DPRK government published a statement to declare its withdrawal from the NPT.\r\n   Showing a decisive resolution with practical actions, he saw to it that the strong armed forces of the DPRK were deployed at the attack starting point. Upset by this, the enemy gave up.\r\n   Under the tense situation in those days he gave on-the-spot guidance to the newly-built Songdowon International Children's Camp in Kangwon Province.\r\n   The world was surprised when he lifted the semi-war state in only 16 days while huge armed forces of the enemy were concentrated on the surroundings of Korea.\r\n   His matchless grit has always won victory, startling the world.    \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\nPyongyang, October 30 (KCNA) -- The secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland (CPRF), gave a news briefing to home and foreign reporters here today over the war preparations of the south Korean authorities.\r\n   Han Si Hae, Director of the CPRF secretariat, said:\r\n   The south Korean puppets, backed by the U.S., are frantically building up armaments for invasion of the north.\r\n   They drastically increased military budget. It has grown to 17,940 million dollars this year from 11,380 million dollars in 1992, or an increase of 58 percent.\r\n   South Korea is the third in the import of arms in the world.\r\n   The funds for import of military hardware was 3.5 billion dollars in 1992 and rose to five billion dollars in 1997, or an increase of 41 percent.\r\n   The south Korean rulers in league with the United States are hastening to round off preparations for adventurous war against the north.\r\n   In 1993, they worked out \"new operation plan 5027,\" a revised version of the anti-DPRK war plan they had drafted in the 1980s.\r\n   While resorting to the established strategic plan of invading the north with the backing of U.S. military strength under U.S. command, the puppets have worked out a plan of free response to war, in which they plan to unleash war against the north before asking the U.S. to intervene in it.\r\n   Recently they set up a \"team for all-out review of war preparations\" and issued a war document called \"concept of joint war theatre operations\" to all puppet army units. \r\n   The U.S. and the south Korean rulers are seeking an excuse for war, frequently staging military exercises and armed provocations.\r\n   Under the plan of war against the north, the south Korean rulers hold foal eagle, Hwarang, Ulji focus lens and other joint military maneuvers with the U.S. Every year and incessantly stage separate military drills.\r\n   Large-scale military maneuvers numbered eight in 1992 before the Kim Young Sam regime came into being. They increased to sixteen in 1993, 37 in 1995, 88 in 1996 and many more in 1997.\r\n   The south Korean puppets recklessly resort to war moves, because they think the north's strength has become weak for temporary difficulties and they try to seek a way out of the crisis in war.\r\n   The Kim Young Sam regime is on the verge of total collapse after anti-social misrule and corruption.\r\n   They must discard the foolish dream of seeking a way out in war and discontinue the adventurous war exercises and provocations at once.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
