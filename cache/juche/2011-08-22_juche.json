            "content": "DPRK Side Takes Steps for Legally Disposing of Properties of South Side in Mt. Kumgang Resort\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, August 22 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang issued the following statement Monday: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA series of contacts were made between the north and the south of Korea recently to adjust the properties of the south side in the Mt. Kumgang area.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe adjustment is a compatriotic step taken by the DPRK to protect the properties of enterprises of the south side in Mt. Kumgang resort by law and ensure their profit-making activities according to the DPRK Law on Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to protect the properties of enterprises of the south side which have suffered a big loss due to the south Korean authorities' unilateral suspension of tour, the DPRK has so far provided several opportunities for negotiations and made every sincere effort, advancing a variety of choices so that the properties may be dealt with according to the will of enterprises of the south side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean authorities, however, viciously obstructed the adjustment of properties, groundlessly asserting that it is a \"violation of agreement\" and \"encroachment on the right to properties.\" In the end they resorted to undisguised delaying tactics, running the whole gamut of sleight of hand.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK side tried to settle the issue through negotiations while repeatedly postponing the date. Now that the south Korean authorities are persistently disturbing the adjustment of properties, the DPRK side, as already declared, notified the south side on July 29 that the properties of the south side would be legally dealt with according to the DPRK law and in case the enterprises of the south side do not witness the adjustment within three weeks, the former would consider that the latter totally forfeited the right to properties and strictly dispose of them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEven in that case the DPRK side showed such magnanimity as extending the delay of legal disposal as requested by the enterprises which responded to the proposal for witnessing the adjustment and giving time to choose the method of dealing with properties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group not only ignored even the last opportunity given by the DPRK but challenged it, talking about \"lawsuit\" like a thief crying \"Stop the thief!\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was the puppet group which scrapped the agreement between the DPRK and the Hyundai Group on tour of Mt. Kumgang and blatantly defied the DPRK's patience and sincere efforts to protect the right to properties of enterprises of the south side. It is the height of shamelessness for the group to talk about \"violation of agreement\" and \"encroachment upon the right to properties\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group has unilaterally kept the tour of Mt. Kumgang in suspension for three years and, consequently, there is no hope of making it afloat in the future. Yet, it is talking about 'bringing a lawsuit\" against the DPRK side. This would bring only disgrace to it and become laughing stock. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThrough the August 19 contact the DPRK side finally confirmed that the puppet group has no intention to resume the tour of Mt. Kumgang and respond to the adjustment of properties but is keen to realize its sinister intention to use noble tourism  for the purpose of confrontation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is needless to say that there will be neither magnanimity nor generosity for such hooligans who behave as they please without having their business registered in the area where the DPRK's sovereignty is exercised.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the south Korean authorities finally refused to resume tour of Mt. Kumgang and register properties despite the sincere efforts of the DPRK, the Guidance Bureau of Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang of the DPRK solemnly declares the following steps according to the relevant law including Article 26 and Article 40 of the Law on Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFirstly, the DPRK considers that the south Korean authorities totally abandoned the protection of properties and interests of enterprises of the south side and from now on makes a real legal disposal of all the properties including real estates, equipment and vehicles of the south side in the Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSecondly, the DPRK bans taking materials and properties of enterprises of the south side out of Mt. Kumgang resort from 00:00 on August 21.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThirdly, personnel from the south side in the Special Zone for International Tour of Mt. Kumgang should leave it within 72 hours.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet conservative group is entirely to blame for the situation today when the tour of Mt. Kumgang has reached such a deplorable pass though it had been under way amid the attention of all Koreans and the whole world and its crimes will be denounced and cursed by them for all ages."

            "content": "Declara la disposicion legal de bienes de la parte Sur en el monte Kumgang\r\n\n\t\t\t\t\tPyongyang, 22 de agosto (ACNC) -- El portavoz de la Direccion de la Zona Especial del Turismo Internacional al Monte Kumgang de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea publico este lunes la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecientemente, entre ambas partes coreanas tuvo lugar en varias ocasiones el contacto sobre el ajuste  de los bienes de la parte Sur en la zona del monte Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta labor es una medida fraternal tomada por nuestra parte (Republica Popular Democratica de Corea) para defender las propiedades de las empresas surcoreanas y garantizar sus actividades lucrativas en virtud de la ley de la zona especial del turismo internacional al monte Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara proteger los bienes de las empresas surcoreanas que sufren enormes perdidas debido a la suspension unilateral del turismo por las autoridades surcoreanas, nuestra parte realizo todos los esfuerzos sinceros como preparar hasta ahora varias veces la oportunidad de negociar y plantear diferentes opciones para que aquellas puedan disponer sus propiedades como les convenga.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, las autoridades surcoreanas obstaculizaron siniestramente esa labor cuestionandola absurdamente como supuesta \"violacion del acuerdo\" y \"violacion del derecho sobre las propiedades\" y a la ultima hora, recurrieron abiertamente a la tactica dilatoria inventando subterfugios.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra parte trato de resolver el problema mediante negociaciones posponiendo repetidamente la fecha de limite. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, dado que las autoridades surcoreanas siguen obstaculizando ese trabajo, nuestra parte, como ya habia avisado previamente, notifico el 29 de julio que segun su ley correspondiente, se ve obligada a ejecutar el ajuste de las propiedades de la parte Sur y que las tratara severamente si las empresas surcoreanas no asisten a esa tramitacion dentro de tres semanas, reconociendo que ellas renunciaron completamente su derecho a las propiedades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAun en esa ocasion, hemos mostrado el gesto de magnanimidad dilatando el periodo de moratoria en el caso de las empresas que acepten asistir a la tramitacion de disposicion legal de sus propiedades y dandoles la posibilidad de escoger el metodo conveniente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA pesar de ello, la banda de titeres surcoreanos desestimo hasta esa ultima oportunidad ofrecida por nuestra parte y se muestra desafiante hablando de la supuesta \"apelacion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs una conducta muy cinica que ellos hablaran de la \"violacion del acuerdo y del derecho sobre las propiedades\" porque ellos mismos rompieron el acuerdo entre nuestra parte y el Grupo Hyundai sobre el turismo al monte Kumgang y despreciaron nuestros esfuerzos sinceros y pacientes por ese derecho de las empresas surcoreanas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSera avergonzada y ridiculizada esa banda si se atreve a \"apelar\" porque ella ha suspendido unilateralmente por 3 anos el turismo al monte Kumgang y lo ha dejado sin perspectivas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA traves del contacto sostenido el dia 19, hemos confirmado definitivamente que la banda surcoreana no tiene la intencion de reiniciar el turismo al monte Kumgang ni quiere aceptar la disposicion de propiedades sino persigue unicamente el siniestro intento de malemplear la noble labor turistica en los fines conflictivos con la connacional RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsta claro que no se aplicara mas la indulgencia ni la magnanimidad a los bribones que actuan a sus caprichos sin registrar sus negocios en nuestra zona jurisdiccional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPuesto que las autoridades surcoreanas negaron hasta el final el reinicio del turismo al monte Kumgang y el registro de propiedades pese a nuestros esfuerzos sinceros, la Direccion de la Zona Especial del Turismo Internacional al Monte Kumgang de la RPDC declara solemnemente que tomara las siguientes medidas segun los codigos correspondientes como los articulos 26, 40, etc. de la ley de dicha zona especial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPrimero, considerando que las autoridades surcoreanas renunciaron completamente la proteccion de propiedades e intereses de las empresas de la parte surcoreana, ejecutamos desde ahora la disposicion legal de todos los bienes, incluyendo los inmuebles, equipos y medios de transporte de la parte Sur en Zona Especial del Turismo Internacional al Monte Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegundo, suspendemos desde la hora 0 del dia 21 la salida de los materiales y bienes de las empresas surcoreanas introducidos en el monte Kumgang.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTercero, el personal surcoreano, que se queda en la zona especial, debe salir de este lugar dentro de 72 horas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de conservadores titeres es totalmente responsable de la actual coyuntura del turismo al monte Kumgang, que se desarrollaba centrando la atencion de todos los coreanos y el mundo, y tal crimen de ellos sera condenado y denunciado por nuestra nacion de generacion en generacion."

Es danar a la parte connacional en contubernio con los reaccionarios japoneses. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs por eso que Japon se desespera tan freneticamente para usurpar el islote Tok durante el mandato actual de la banda conservadora surcoreana."
