Its mountains and streams remain unchanged through generations and the people are none other than the descendants of Tangun. But, its masters are not the Koreans but foreigners. Its politics is controlled by outsiders, its economy is run with foreign capital and its national culture is exterminated by foreign patterns.\r\n   The northern half of the country never tolerates any foreign domination and interference and is recognised as a model of independent nations, while the southern half is a prototype of colonies which cannot make its existence even a single day without outsiders' patronage.\r\n   Dictatorship has continued in south korea devoid of independence since the country was liberated. As long as there exist the \"National Security Law\" and the \"Agency for National Security Planning\", two pillars which support dictatorship, neither democratic politics nor free discussion about reunification nor national unity can be ensured in the southern half.\r\n   My defection to the north is a determined action for reunification.\r\n   While in the north, I am moved to see that the desire of the people for reunification is ardent and the will of the authorities for reunification is steadfast.\r\n   Any member of the divided nation must work for reunification of the country.\r\n   Only those who are worried about the tragic division of the country and take part in the reunification movement can be praised as true patriots of the country and true statesmen of the nation.\r\n   Indeed, old generations have committed serious crimes before the nation by keeping the country divided for more than half a century.\r\n   Judging from the South Korean political situation before the \"Presidential election\", we can see the reunification issue in vacuum. \r\n   Availing myself of this opportunity, I would like to say that, by taking a bold decision in the soon-to-be-held \"15th Presidential election\", You should not follow in the footsteps of the \"14th election\" which resulted in Kim Young Sam taking office at Chongwadae.\r\n   I request you to bear it in mind that your wise choice is to build an independent democratic government in the south. \r\n\r\n"
