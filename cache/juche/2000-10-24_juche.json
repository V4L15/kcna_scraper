If it repeats such threadbare fiction as \"suspected kidnapping\", the talks will come to an end without any progress. The talks can make progress only when Japan adopts a bold decision to redress its past crimes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK-Japan relations are basically different from the ordinary ties between countries. The DPRK and Japan are in the relationship between the assailant and the victim. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan inflicted all sorts of misfortune and sufferings upon the Korean people after its military occupation of Korea and the DPRK is entitled to get compensation for huge human and material losses. Japan should not be allowed to improve these relations with the DPRK in the same way as it does with other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan is to improve its relations with the DPRK it should find a definite solution to such fundamental issue as redressing its past crimes. There can be no improvement of the bilateral relations without Japan's redeem for its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nJapan's redeem for its past crimes is a prerequisite for near yet far off Japan to become a friendly neighbor of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persistently seeks a sinister political aim, raising a hue and cry over \"suspected kidnapping\" and \"missile threat\", the DPRK-Japan relations will never improve. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly wants to improve relations with the DPRK, it should make an option to settle its past crimes, though belatedly, and show it at the forthcoming talks. \r\n\r\n"

It is vociferous about them even these days with the 11th round of the DPRK-Japan intergovernmental full-dress talks at hand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This makes the DPRK skeptical about Japan's stand on the issues of redressing its past crimes and improving the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  While talking about the improvement of the Japan-DPRK relations, Japan is putting a brake on its process. This clearly shows its crafty double-dealing attitude. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's redress for its past crimes should include apology and compensation, solution of the issue of cultural treasures and guarantee of special status to the Korean residents in Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should not hush up the issue of redressing its past nor seek other aim through the normalization of the bilateral relations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan truly wants to improve the relations with the DPRK it should turn over a new leaf and make a bold decision to settle its past crimes. \r\n\r\n"

He also made sure that early ripening potatoes and grapes were sent to the members of the youth shock brigades so that they might taste them before anyone else. He saw to it that they were specially served at renowned restaurants in Pyongyang several times and sent them TV sets and other entertainment apparatuses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In June last year when the project was still under way he made sure that state citations including orders and medals were awarded to them in high recognition of their exploits. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis was something unprecedented. His loving care and trust were the only source of the courage with which they could overcome rigorous ordeals and manifold difficulties. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the whole period when the project was carried out the country's economic situation was so hard that the builders were short of construction machines and vehicles and fuel and there was an acute shortage of cement, steel, timber and even food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the slogan \"self-reliance is the only way out \" the youth shock brigaders used stretcher-live carrying means, plastic bags, hammers and chisels day and night to lay roadbeds. They removed at least 14 million cubic meters of earth. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In this course they presented a 50,000-strong chorus, something unprecedented in history, to demonstrate the faith and spirit of the young Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The motorway was successfully completed in a matter of two years thanks to their unremitting efforts as the best one in all aspects including architectural style and technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The motorway was named \"Chongnyonyongung Motorway\" to convey long the exploits of the youth shock brigade members and soldier-builders. \r\n\r\n"

It is one of important ways of building the trust of the international community in the UN for the UN to redress those matters which were dealt with wrong by a strong arm and a high hand on the contrary to the purpose and principles of the UN Charter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When the UN remains faithful to its charter and discharge its mission and duty in conformity with the changing situation at the turn of the century, the  trust of the world people in the UN will be built. \r\n\r\n"

And they should put a collective pressure so as to dismantle the existing nuclear weapons and stop the development of new nuclear weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important to establish the nuclear-free, peace zones in different parts of the world and expand them steadily. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic People's Republic of Korea will resolutely struggle in defence of peace against the arms race of the imperialists in the future, too. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
