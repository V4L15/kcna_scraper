Today the U.S. military bases and facilities are exposed to the threat of bomb attacks. They will be blown up tomorrow. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. should withdraw its aggression troops from South Korea to put an end to its anachronistic policy of military presence there.

            "content": "Japan urged to drop nasty trick \r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, May 2 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ruling party is going to submit to the diet a \"bill on payment of compensation\" to some Koreans in Japan who served as soldiers or employees in units of the Japanese imperial army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"bill\" calls for the payment of \"condolence money\" or \"comfort money\" to the Koreans in Japan who served as soldiers or employees in units of the Japanese imperial army. This is no more than an insincere and nominal compensation to the Koreans in Japan as the bill seriously discriminates against them, as compared with the Japanese who served as soldiers or employees in units of the Japanese imperial army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"bill\" is chiefly aimed to cover up Japan's crime-woven past and calm down the growing domestic and foreign public opinion pushing for Japan's settlement of its past by paying a petty amount of money to them under the name of \"condolence money\" and \"comfort money,\" the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This poor trick of Japan can convince no one in this civilized world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The so-called presentation of the \"bill on payment of compensation\" is an intolerable hypocrisy and insult to the Korean people who demand Japan redress its past, and a mockery of justice and human conscience, the commentary says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not for the sake of others but for Japan's sake to make a sincere apology and compensation with a proper attitude and stand on the redress of its past. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Japan is seriously mistaken if it thinks it can cheat the world people by such a cunning and nasty trick.   Japan is well advised to take a right stand and approach to the issue of redressing its past, though belatedly. \r\n\r\n"
