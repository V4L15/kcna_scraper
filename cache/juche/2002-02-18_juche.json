people and international democratic organizations was held here yesterday.\r\n Present there were representatives of international organizations, delegations and delegates of regions and different countries who participated in the \"Meeting to Congratulate the Sun of the 21st Century.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Also on hand were Mun Jae Chol, chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, and other officials concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Jitendra Sharma, president of the international association of democratic lawyers, made an opening address, which was followed by a report of Christer Rundgren, vice-chairman of the Sweden-Korea Friendship Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The recent situation on the Korean peninsula is, in a word, characterized by the struggle of the Korean people to achieve the reunification of the country and defend its security and peace despite the high-handed and arbitrary practices of the united states, the reporter said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The experience and lesson in the movement for the promotion of the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea conducted on the Korean peninsula and on a worldwide scale tell that in order to reunify the country, it is necessary to put forward the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration as the eternal landmark for reunification and implement it to the letter. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He expressed his belief that the current meeting will mark an occasion in reviewing the precious experience and lesson of international organizations and organizations of all countries which have promoted the international solidarity movement for supporting the reunification of Korea and putting forward important ways of activating the movement for supporting Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The floor was taken by Juan Carretero Ibanes, secretary general of the organization of solidarity of the peoples of Africa, Asia and Latin America, Otete Gaston Mboyo, chairman of the democratic Congo-Korea Friendship Association, Marisol Luis, delegate of the Venezuela-Korea Friendship and Solidarity Association, Sumiko Shimizu, delegate of the Japanese Women's Liaison Society for Solidarity with the Korean Women, Gazi Shahzahan, secretary general of the Chittagong branch of the Bangladesh-Korea Friendship Association, Om Prakash Mantri, secretary general of the Asian Regional Committee for Supporting Korea's Reunification and secretary general of the All India Indo-Korean Friendship Association, Viktor Yegorov, delegate of the Russia Kareli-DPRK Friendship Association, Ibrahim Shamieh, chairman of the General Union of Syrian Peasants, Athanasios Pafilis, executive secretary of the world peace council, Yuri Sesar Castro Romero, secretary general of the Peru-Korea Institute of Culture and Friendship, Jyun Shimizu, representative member of the Japan Committee for Supporting the Independent and Peaceful Reunification of Korea, Alejandro Cao De Benos, chairman of the Spanish Association for Friendship with the Korean People, Alexandr Brezhnev, delegate of the Russian Union of Writers, and Muhammad Kamel El Kadi, delegate of the Egypt-Korea Friendship Association. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers bitterly denounced the U.S. military presence in South Korea and underscored the need to vigorously conduct various movements such as a signature campaign for supporting Korea's reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Speaking next, Kim Jin Bom, vice-chairman of the Korean Committee for Solidarity with the World People, said that the cause of national reunification will surely be achieved because we are holding leader Kim Jong Il, who is universally recognized as a distinguished politician, in high esteem as the lodestar of national reunification and because we have the correct reunification programme. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A resolution of the Pyongyang joint meeting was adopted there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The resolution stressed the need to dynamically conduct the international signature campaign for supporting the Korean people in their just struggle to reunify the country and get the U.S. troops withdrawn from South Korea, strengthen international pressure on the separatists at home and abroad to dampen the atmosphere of reconciliation, unity and reunification on the Korean peninsula and obliterate the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and more valiantly conduct the international solidarity activities to check the aggression and war moves of the hostile forces who threaten the peace and security on the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A letter of protest to the U.S. President was read out at the joint meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter denounced all the hostile policies of the present U.S. administration toward the DPRK as the war policy threatening world peace and security. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It demanded the present U.S. administration commit itself to immediately withdraw its troops from South Korea, the troops which are a stumbling block in achieving the reunification by the concerted efforts of the Korean nation, discontinue all the joint military exercises and provocation moves targeted against the DPRK and thus contribute even a little to removing the danger of war from the Korean peninsula and achieving the reconciliation of the Korean nation and its independent and peaceful reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The participants in the meeting signed the signature paper supporting the three charters for national reunification and the joint declaration and demanding the U.S. military pullback from South Korea.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
