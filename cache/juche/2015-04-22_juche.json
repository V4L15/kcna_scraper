This is a proof that a lot of successes have been made in the efforts to implement the party's policy on locally producing building materials, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The longer I watch the baby home and orphanage, the more fashionable they look both in interior and exterior, he said, noting the construction of these splendid edifices prove that designing and building are making a leap forward in the country with each passing day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He underscored the need to make good preparations for operating the baby home and orphanage including the work to build up well the ranks of nurses and kindergarteners and sufficiently provide school things, utensils, materials for their operation, etc. as their construction is near completion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Enjoying a bird's-eye view of the baby home and orphanage again and again, he said with joy that they stand impeccable when they are viewed from their front and back. He noted he was pleased to see a nice palace for children to be proud of in the world, crystal of the party's love for the rising generation and future. He added that he felt as if he had seen orphans cheerfully playing free from worries and as if he had plucked a star.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the soldier-builders made a lot of efforts, working hard day and night to bring joy to the people, he asked officials to convey his greetings to them. He extended the thanks of the KPA Supreme Commander to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called upon the soldier-builders to perfectly finish the remaining project so that they may take responsibility for the safety of the project and guarantee its absolute quality for all eternity and thus hold a ceremony for the completion of Wonsan Baby Home and Orphanage with splendor on June 1, the international children's day.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was accompanied by KPA Vice Marshal Hwang Pyong So, director of the General Political Bureau of the KPA."

Korean Regime Accused of Justifying Deployment of THAAD\r\nPyongyang, April 22 (KCNA) -- Recently, a high-ranking official of the U.S. military made public that the U.S. has started a discussion on deployment of THAAD in south Korea. Earlier, the south Korean puppet authorities, when meeting with the U.S. military heavyweights on a visit to south Korea, called for \"strengthening joint deterrent\" to cope with the \"ever more escalating nuclear threat from the north\", crying out for making a \"comprehensive judgment and decision\" on the deployment of THAAD with the \"nuclear threat from the north\" as its primary subject.\n\t\t\t\t\t Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a commentary observes in this regard:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean puppet regime has neither face nor qualifications to talk about \"nuclear threat from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime has worked hard to invent a pretext for the deployment of THAAD by putting up the stereo-typed signboard of \"nuclear threat from the north.\" This is such a foolish act as helping outsiders ignite a nuclear war against the Korean nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t To launch a high-altitude missile to intercept an opponent's flying object with the short-depth Korean peninsula as an operational sphere is something hardly understandable with even common military knowledge. So, THAAD is not necessary in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is needless to say that THAAD the U.S. wants to deploy in south Korea is targeting the neighboring countries of the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Consequently, the projected deployment of THAAD in south Korea is just a product of the U.S. strategic goal to contain the neighboring countries by establishing its MD system on the Korean peninsula and in other parts of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the south Korean puppet regime is zealously supporting the U.S. deployment of THAAD, noisily talking about \"nuclear threat from the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now that the U.S. deployment of THAAD in south Korea has become a fait accompli, south Korea has undoubtedly turned into the most dangerous nuclear outpost of the U.S. and the worldwide hotbed of a nuclear war."

Con anterioridad, las autoridades surcoreanas se reunieron con los caudillos de la capa militar norteamericana, de visita en el Sur de Corea, ocasion en la cual insistieron en \"consolidar el disuasivo conjunto\" frente a la \"creciente amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\" y \"juzgar y decidir comprensivamente\" el emplazamiento de THAAD teniendo en cuenta la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\tLos titeres surcoreanos no tienen la cara ni la calificacion para hablar de la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenala el diario Rodong Sinmun en un comentario individual de este miercoles y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs incomprensible con conocimientos militares elementales lanzar el misil contra la parte Norte tomando como escenario operacional la Peninsula Coreana de poca profundidad. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPues, para el Sur de Corea no se le hace falta el THAAD. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa verdadera intencion de EE.UU. es mantener a rayas a las potencias perifericas de Corea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn fin de cuentas, el emplazamiento de THAAD en el Sur de Corea es el producto de la meta estrategicas de EE.UU. de establecer el sistema de defensa antimisil en la Peninsula Corana y el resto del Nordeste Asiatico y mantener a rayas a las potencias perifericas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSin embargo, los titeres surcoreanos instigan el emplazamiento de THAAD hablando de la \"amenaza nuclear del Norte de Corea\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIndudablemente, el Sur de Corea es la zona avanzada nuclear mas peligrosa de EE.UU. y origen de la guerra nuclear mundial."
