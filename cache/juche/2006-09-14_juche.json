            "content": "U.S. Sub-Critical Nuclear Test Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, September 13 (KCNA) -- The U.S. recently conducted the 23rd sub-critical nuclear test since 1997 in the underground nuclear test ground in Nevada despite strong rebuff and protest of the international community.\r\n Rodong Sinmun Wednesday in a signed commentary terms this a challenge to humankind's desire for peace and an anti-peace act of sparking off a nuclear arms race.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is sheer sophism for the Bush administration to assert that the sub-critical nuclear test does not violate the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty, the commentary says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. continued sub-critical nuclear test is aimed to put into practice its doctrine of preemptive nuclear strike. The Bush administration, obsessed by nuclear hysteria, set out the doctrine of preemptive nuclear strike and adopted it as a basic \"national security strategy.\"  On this basis it is getting ready to make a preemptive nuclear strike at other countries any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush bellicose forces have simplified even the procedure for using nuclear weapons. Acting upon the doctrine of a preemptive nuclear attack, the U.S. is working hard to manufacture smaller nuclear weapons of high explosive power and use them as conventional weapons in all wars. The U.S. continues conducting sub-critical nuclear test to develop new type nuclear weapons after setting up a comprehensive nuclear substance production centre. This is part of its moves to modernize nuclear weapons and bolster them as required by the doctrine of preemptive nuclear attack, contain other nuclear powers and dominate the world by retaining an unchallenged nuclear edge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All facts go to clearly prove that the U.S. is chiefly to blame for proliferating nuclear weapons and technology and posing a nuclear threat to mankind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. had better drop its nuclear ambition and stop conducting nuclear tests and developing nuclear weapons.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
