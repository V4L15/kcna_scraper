At the contest, attended by master shots selected from KPRA units, she won top marks in all events -- shooting with a rifle a round target and five bottles 100 meters away, bobbing bust-target 200 meters away and full-length target 300 meters away, and shooting with a pistol a round target and turning back and instantly hitting three bottles. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the contest, guerrillas lauded her marksmanship as a gifted one. She, with a smile on her face, said that her marksmanship was not a gifted one but what she attained through strenuous practice, out of the resolution to guard President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are many legend-like stories about her marksmanship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Indeed, Kim Jong Suk guarded President Kim Il Sung during the glorious revolutionary struggle for the liberation of the country and the freedom and emancipation of the people and thus made an undying contribution to the victory in the anti-Japanese war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is evidenced by the fact that acting Secretary General of the Liberal Democratic Party Abe, a standard-bearer of the Japanese ultra-right conservatives, is spearheading the anti-DPRK campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, it is impossible for the fact-finding committee to performs its duty as the  Japanese ultra-right conservatives are wickedly mocking at the DPRK�fs investigation to confirm the whereabouts of those persons whose fate the Japanese side claimed unknown and misusing it for their anti-DPRK moves. Now that they insist her remains are �gfalse�h in disregard of the sincere efforts made by the DPRK it has no option but to demand Japan return the remains as they are together with the test data. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more frantic they are getting in their anti-DPRK campaign while floating the fiction about �gfalse remains�h the higher the hatred of the Korean people against Japan will mount and their will to force it to settle its past grow stronger. In case �gsanctions�h are applied against the DPRK, it will decisively react to this action by exercising its right to strong option.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
