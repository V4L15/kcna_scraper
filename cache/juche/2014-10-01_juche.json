            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Urged to Support Proposal for Achieving Reunification by Federal Formula\r\n Pyongyang, October 1 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Disarmament and Peace Institute of the DPRK Foreign Ministry Wednesday released the following statement:\n\t\t\t\t\t We will soon greet the 34th anniversary of the proposal for founding the Democratic Federal Republic of Koryo advanced by President Kim Il Sung, the eternal sun of the Korean nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The President clarified the proposal at the historic Sixth Congress of the Workers' Party of Korea on October 10, Juche 69 (1980), indicating the most correct orientation and way for achieving national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The proposal calls for setting up a reunified national state, keeping the ideologies and social systems that exist between the north and the south as they are, through the establishment of a unified national government, a government under which the north and the south exercise regional autonomy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Differing ideologies and social systems have existed in the north and the south for nearly seven decades and they preserve their own social systems. Under this situation the proposal for achieving reunification by federal formula is the most realistic one to reunify the country peacefully and fairly in line with the will, wishes and interests of the whole nation. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Leader Kim Jong Il deemed it a sacred national duty to successfully achieve the cause of national reunification true to the behests of the President. With his noblest patriotism he ushered in the June 15 era of reunification and opened a rosy prospect for national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the June 15 joint declaration the north and the south recognized that there is commonness in the north-proposed low-level federation and the south-proposed confederation and agreed to work for reunification in this direction. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is the only agreement on the reunification formula in the long history of national division and it received unanimous support and welcome not only from the Koreans but also from the international community. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK government has made strenuous efforts to improve the north-south relations and achieve national reunification under the leadership of the respected Marshal Kim Jong Un who is faithfully carrying out the last instructions of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il for national reunification. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But the whole nation's desire and efforts for the reunification of the country are facing a grave challenge of the anti-reunification forces, and big obstacles and difficulties still lie in the way of reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula still remains divided not because there is no way of achieving reunification but because of the south Korean authorities' moves for achieving \"unification through absorption.\" They are keen to internationalize the reunification issue, an internal affair, after coming out with varieties of \"theories of unification\" in a bid to stay in power whenever one \"government\" is replaced by another in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The present south Korean puppet President Park Geun Hye let loose all sorts of sophism such as \"confidence-building process on the Korean Peninsula\" and \"Dresden declaration\" while peddling the reunification issue here and there.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She deliberately linked the reunification of Korea with German unification at the UN arena, openly disclosing her ambition for \"unification through absorption.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Her behavior of  peddling her own \"theory of unification,\" seized by the idea of depending on foreign forces in total negation of the reunification formula on which the north and the south had already agreed is a revelation of disregard of the other party and policy of confrontation and a serious provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The danger of the moves pursued by the south Korean authorities lies in that they not only repeat the confrontational racket kicked up by their predecessors but seek a sinister intention to stoke anti-DPRK atmosphere through \"international cooperation\" while dreaming of achieving \"unification through absorption,\" a dream which will only escalate the confrontation between fellow countrymen and bring a war to the Korean Peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the international community truly hopes for reunification, stability and reunification of the Korean Peninsula, it should clearly understand that the present north-south confrontation precisely means the confrontation of the formulae for reunification and the anachronistic attempt of the south Korean authorities at achieving \"unification through absorption\" is bound to bring a war, and support the reunification by federal formula agreed upon by the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the south Korean authorities are truly interested in reunification, they should not peddle the issue abroad but clarify their stand on whether they can respond to the national discussion on the issue of reunification by federal and confederal formulae agreed upon by the north and the south, to begin with.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will make consistent efforts to foil by the concerted efforts of the nation the reckless confrontational racket being kicked up by the south Korean puppet forces in collusion with outside forces, being indifferent to the interests of the nation, and pave a wide avenue for independent reunification."

Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea hizo publica el dia primero la siguiente declaracion:\n\t\t\t\t\tPoco despues, celebraremos el 34o aniversario de la presentacion del proyecto de fundacion de la Republica Federal Democratica de Coryo por el Presidente Kim Il Sung, eterno Sol de la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Presidente la expuso el 10 de octubre del 69 (1980) de la Era Juche en el historico VI Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea e ilumino el mas correcto rumbo y remedios para la realizacion de la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa propuesta toma por contenido principal fundar un gobierno unido nacional en el que el Norte y el Sur, sobre la base del reconocimiento y tolerancia reciprocos de las ideologias y regimenes existentes, instruyan un estado unido nacional con la participacion igualitaria y, bajo la jurisdiccion de este gobierno, ejerzan autonomia regional con iguales facultades y obligacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn las condiciones de que en el Norte y el Sur de Corea existen durante casi 70 anos diferentes ideologias y regimenes y ambas partes mantienen sus sistemas, el proyecto de sistema federal constituye la mas real de reunificacion que posibilita realizar de manera pacifica e imparcial la reunificacion del pais conforme a la voluntad, demanda e interes de toda la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl Dirigente Kim Jong Il, quien presento como sagrado deber nacional la realizacion brillante de esa empresa en acato al proposito del Presidente, ofrecio con el sublime amor a la nacion la epoca del 15 de junio para la reunificacion y abrio una clara perspectiva para el particular.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio, el Norte y el Sur de Corea reconocieron que tienen los puntos comunes entre la propuesta de federacion de la etapa baja de la parte Norte y la de confederacion de la parte Sur y acordaron orientar la reunificacion en ese rumbo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEsto es el acuerdo logrado solamente por ambas partes en la larga historia de la division nacional en relacion con el modo de la reunificacion, lo cual fue apoyado y aplaudido unanimemente por parte de todos los connacionales y la sociedad internacional.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy en dia, bajo la direccion del Mariscal Kim Jong Un quien apoya el legado de los grandes Generalisimos alusivo a la reunificacion de la patria, el gobierno de la RPDC hace ingentes esfuerzos por la mejora de las relaciones del Norte y el Sur y la reunificacion de la patria.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, el deseo y los esfuerzos de toda la nacion por la reunificacion del pais se tropiezan con el desafio grave de las fuerzas anti-reunificacion y se interponen todavia un gran obstaculo y dificultades.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAhora en la Peninsula Coreana perdura el estado de division, lo cual no se debe a la carencia de remedios de reunificacion sino a las maniobras de la \"reunificacion mediante la absorbicion\" de las autoridades surcoreanas tendentes a internacionalizar este problema interno de la nacion abogando por supuestas \"teorias de unificacion\" de varios tipos para mantener el poder cada vez que cambiaba el \"gobierno\" en el Sur de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa actual autoridad surcoreana Park Geun-hye enumera sofismas como \"proceso de confianza de la Peninsula Coreana\" y \"Declaracion de Dresden\" discutiendo aqui y alla sobre el asunto de reunificacion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara colmo, ella puso abiertamente su ambicion de \"reunificacion mediante la absorbicion\" relacionando a la fuerza el problema de reunificacion de nuestro pais con la unificacion de Alemania hasta en la escena de la ONU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTales conductas devienen el desprecio sobre la contraparte, muestra de la politica conflictiva y provocacion grave.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa peligrosidad de las maniobras, a que recurren las autoridades surcoreanas, no solamente reside en repetir la campana conflictiva del predecesor sino tambien en perseguir el objetivo malsano de poner en auge el ambiente anti-RPDC mediante la \"cooperacion internacional\" sonando con la \"reunificacion mediante la absorbicion\" que causara solo la confrontacion fratricida y la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi la sociedad internacional desea la paz, la estabilidad y la reunificacion de esta region, debe darse clara cuenta de que el actual enfrentamiento Norte-Sur es el de medio de reunificacion y de que el intento anacronico de las autoridades surcoreanas desencadenara solo la guerra y apoyar el proyecto de reunificacion mediante la formula federal, acordado entre ambas partes de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi las autoridades surcoreanas tienen de verdad interes en la reunificacion, no deben discutir sobre la reunificacion en el extranjero sino aclarar su posicion de aceptar o no el debate nacional sobre el asunto de reunificacion por el medio federal, ya acordado entre el Norte y el Sur.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHaremos ingentes esfuerzos invariables por abrir el camino de la reunificacion independiente frustrando con las fuerzas unidas de todos los coreanos las maniobras de los titeres surcoreanos que recurren a la imprudente campana conflictiva en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras, sin hacer caso de los intereses de la nacion."
