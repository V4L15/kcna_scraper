            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry on Issue of Implementation of February 13 Agreement  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, July 6 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Foreign Ministry gave the following answer to the question put by KCNA Friday as regards the issue of the implementation of the February 13 Agreement: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n After the settlement of the issue of the remittance of the funds frozen in the Banco Delta Asia in Macao, the DPRK is implementing its commitments under the agreement much earlier than the promised time and order. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was agreed at the six-party talks that the DPRK would suspend the operation of its nuclear facilities within 30 days after the lifting of the financial sanction against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The delayed remittance of the funds procrastinated on the start of implementation of the February 13 agreement but the DPRK allowed a delegation of the International Atomic Energy Agency to visit the DPRK just one day after the completion of the fund remittance proceeding from a goodwill stand to make up for the loss of time, substantially kicking off the process to suspend the operation of its nuclear facilities. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said agreement calls for providing 50,000 tons of heavy oil to the DPRK in the same period, but it was reported that the shipment of the total quantity is expected to be completed early in August. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prompted by the desire to facilitate the process of the six-party talks, the DPRK is now earnestly examining even the issue of suspending the operation of its nuclear facilities earlier than expected, that is from the moment the first shipment of heavy oil equivalent to one-tenth of the total quantity is made, without waiting for the total quantity of heavy oil to reach its port and making preparations for the job. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The parties concerned have already been informed of this. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, some elements are now spreading misinformation that the DPRK is raising a new demand as regards the implementation of the agreement.  This indicates that the forces displeased with the smooth implementation of the agreement are still at work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The agreement should be honored not only by the DPRK but by all the countries participating in the six-party talks on the principle \"action for action\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Other participating countries are also obliged to hasten the preparations for honoring their commitments including energy aid amounting to 950,000 tons of heavy oil, the remaining quantity to be provided. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a stark fact already known to the world through the agreement that the DPRK cannot unilaterally suspend the operation of its nuclear facilities unless other participating countries fulfil their commitments. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK may not trust them if steps are not taken to make political and economic compensation as promised, even after it has taken to suspend the operation of its nuclear facilities. In that case, the resumption of its nuclear activity will assume legitimate nature.\r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This was an immortal exploit as it brought about a landmark turn in the history of the movement for national reunification. Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said three principles laid down by the President are the most fair and scientific programme for reunification as they indicate the fundamental stand and basic ways to be consistently maintained by the Koreans to accomplish the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National independence is the main principle and fundamental stand for accomplishing the cause of reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The cause of national reunification is, in essence, the cause of national independence. The issue of national reunification is the issue pertaining to the national sovereignty as it calls for rejecting foreign domination and interference in south Korea and establishing national sovereignty throughout Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to advance the movement for national reunification strictly on the principle of national independence in order to put an end to the outsiders' domination and interference and the history of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To achieve national reunification peacefully is the most reasonable and realistic principle of achieving reunification which reflects the unanimous desire of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There are differing ideologies and systems in the north and the south of Korea but they can never be an obstacle in the way of achieving peaceful reunification. No matter how big the disparity between the north and the south is, they can certainly overcome it if they put the common interests of the homogenous nation above anything else. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Reunifying the country peacefully is the most reasonable and realistic way of national reunification in view of the requirements of the reunification movement and the unanimous desire of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The great national unity provides a sure guarantee for achieving the independent and peaceful reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans in the north and the south and overseas are responsible for accomplishing the cause of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No outside forces can be more interested in the issue of national reunification than the Koreans or replace them in accomplishing its cause. In order to achieve national reunification the Koreans should never allow foreign domination and interference but settle the issue of national reunification by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To this end it is necessary for all Koreans in the north and the south and overseas to achieve great national unity, transcending the class and partisan interests.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is the truth of history that the Korean people have experienced in the protracted revolutionary struggle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe history of army building is associated with the sacred life of President Kim Il Sung. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe started his revolutionary activities in his early years and realized keenly that it was necessary to found a national army in order to save the destiny of the fellow countrymen from the harsh rule of the Japanese imperialists. He, thus, embarked upon the road of accomplishing the sacred cause of building the army with the two pistols handed down by his father Kim Hyong Jik as the wherewithal. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIn the course of struggling to implement his Juche-oriented line and policies advanced at the Kalun meeting, he founded the Korean Revolutionary Army (KRA) on July 6, Juche 19 (1930). &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe stated at the inauguration ceremony that the KRA was a political and paramilitary organization of the Korean revolutionaries to make preparations for the anti-Japanese armed struggle, and that regular revolutionary armed forces would be organized in future on the basis of the KRA. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFor nearly two years since then, the pivotal force had been trained, the mass foundation laid and full military preparations made for the formation of the anti-Japanese armed ranks under his outstanding and tested leadership. As a result, the Anti-Japanese People's Guerrilla Army was founded in Antu on April 25, 1932. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThanks to such revolutionary armed forces, the anti-Japanese national liberation struggle of the Korean people could be crowned with victory through many arduous and complicated ordeals unprecedented in history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe President had attached the greatest importance to the arms even after the war, to say nothing of the liberation of the country (August 1945) and the Fatherland Liberation War (June 1950 - July 1953), and thus frustrated the armed aggression and provocations of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe policy of attaching importance to arms has emerged victorious over the last 77 years since the formation of the KRA. This proud history has been brilliantly carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nHe has won victory after victory and glorified the destiny of the nation with the policy of attaching importance to arms.
