A member of the first party organization, he worked as chief editor of Bolshevik, a revolutionary publication, and a commanding officer of the Korean Revolutionary Army. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   He energetically conducted propaganda about the greatness of Kim Il Sung among the people of broad segments including youth and students in rural areas. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A revolutionary poet with burning passion, he created the revolutionary hymn \"Star of Korea\" carrying the ardent wish of all the fellow countrymen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This song was the first hymn dedicated by the Korean people to their leader. It was a great revolutionary song heralding a new history of the Korean revolution in which Kim Il Sung was acclaimed as its leader and the leader and the masses were united as one in mind. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   While carrying out the task assigned to him by President Kim Il Sung, he encountered with the enemy who surprised him at a secret rendezvous in Harbin. Having exchanged fire with the enemy, he jumped from the third floor of the building, resolved to die for the President's safety. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A national memorial service for him was held at the People's Palace of Culture today to commemorate his 70th death anniversary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Il Chol, Minister of the People's Armed Forces, said in his memorial address: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The noble revolutionary life of Kim Hyok, a communist of younger generation, is a brilliant model for all of us, which tells how a revolutionary soldier of Juche type should safeguard his leader and live and fight for the country and revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the servicemen and working people including the party members should vigorously travel a new long journey of the revolution, actively learning from the steadfast revolutionary outlook on the leader and the total dedication to the revolution Kim Hyok, Cha Kwang Su and other fighters of the first generation of the Korean revolution had. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Present at the memorial service were Hong Song Nam and other senior party and state officials. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Pyongyang-based newspapers today dedicate articles to this anniversary. \r\n\r\n"

Peace can be won only through struggle. This is a bitter lesson taught by the human history stained with dark smoke of war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   In order to defend peace it is imperative for all countries and nations to firmly maintain independence and struggle against the wrong ideas and policies designed to violate the independence of other countries and nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The paper underscores the need to settle the internal affairs of their countries and nations by their own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The imperialists' policy of strength should never be tolerated, it says, adding there can be genuine peace only when people fight against the imperialists' policy of strength at the risk of their lives. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All the peace-loving forces should unite and never tolerate the high-handed practices and privilege of the imperialists in the international arena but struggle to achieve the independence and democratization of the international community, it concludes. \r\n\r\n"

Boilers are being reconditioned. Fuel is gasified to ensure more than 98 percent combustion efficiency. Designing an automatic control system for the production of soybean malt has been completed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Jagang and Kangwon provinces are pushing all the projects ahead of schedule, hastening the projects to enlarge the existing buildings and the disassembling of the equipment and manufacture of new modern ones to replace them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   South Hwanghae and north Phyongan provinces and other provinces are finding package solutions to all problems in the construction of those centers such as manpower organization, guidance to construction and manufacture of equipment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Enormous is the work to be done. Scores of tanks each weighing 10 tons should be dismantled, several storehouses and set-ups be built and at least 100 sets of equipment of scores of types be manufactured. Not a few difficulties and bottlenecks lie before the builders. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   But builders in all the provinces are successfully pushing ahead with the projects in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance with a goal to complete them before the founding anniversary of the party. \r\n\r\n"
