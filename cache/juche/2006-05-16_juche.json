This is aimed at retaining a military monopoly and dominating the world with nuclear and other sophisticated weapons. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said moves and other reckless war scenarios of the U.S imperialists are unpardonable criminal acts as they disturb the world peace and stability, strain the international situation and spark off a new nuclear arms race. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The situation still remains tense on the Korean Peninsula due to these moves for a nuclear war. It is their unchangeable scenario to ignite a nuclear war in Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists are staging frequent nuclear war maneuvers after massively deploying nuclear strike means in south Korea and in its vicinity, posing a grave threat to the DPRK. It is not hard to guess which country their new type nuclear and laser weapons target against. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. bellicose forces' moves to deliberately coil up the military tension on the peninsula and increase the danger of a nuclear war cannot but arouse vigilance among its neighboring countries. It is clear to everyone that in case a nuclear war breaks in Korea what disastrous consequences it will bring. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to give up its criminal design to update nuclear weapons, militarize the outer space and impose a nuclear disaster upon humankind.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The Koreans can pave the way for independent reunification and heyday of prosperity of the country when all of them struggle with such national pride and patriotic mettle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pride of the Korean nation is the source of the spirit of independence in the whole course of the reunification movement and the main factor of powerful impetus to the process of great national unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Independence is as precious as life and soul in the reunification movement of the Korean nation for achieving the nation's independence on a nation-wide scale. A strong wall protecting the nation is built and an upswing is brought in the movement for national reunification when a full scope is given to the unswerving spirit of independence for solving all problems from the stand of giving priority to the nation and displaying Korean nation-first spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The spirit of \"By our nation itself\" represents the immovable truth that real reconciliation and unity is achieved and the cause of independent reunification is accomplished when all the fellow countrymen struggle with the pride and honor of a homogeneous nation. The last-ditch wriggle of the separatist forces and the strong-arm tactics, arbitrary practices and moves for aggression of the \"only super power\" prove impotent in face of the torrential flow of history in which the 70 million Koreans are advancing, united in single mind, along the way indicated by the spirit of \"By our nation itself\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n National pride has a great effect on mental and moral traits of the members of the nation in the struggle for the reunification of the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their noble traits in their efforts to shape the destiny of the nation by themselves with confidence and vigor can make even a nuclear weapon impotent. \r\n All the fellow countrymen are dynamically waging the worthy patriotic struggle for national reunification to implement the June 15 joint declaration with unshakable fighting spirit and grit, convinced that no force on earth can break the united strength of the Korean nation.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
