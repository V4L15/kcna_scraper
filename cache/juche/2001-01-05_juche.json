They even asserted that the \"SDF\" should be renamed \"national army.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They, in fact, fabricated a wartime law. A good example of this is a \"law on inspection of ships\" instituted in the Japanese diet last November. The law legally allows the Japanese \"SDF\" to restrict, control and  inspect ships of other countries sailing along recognized international sea route and in open seas and use weapons in case of \"emergency.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries visited the United States one after another from early last year and had confabs with its top brasshats at which they called for \"closer ties\" between the two countries to counter North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They worked hard to strengthen their position as a military power and convert the \"SDF\" into first class armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They pushed forward their plan to introduce up-to-date \"F-2\" support fighters, air refuelling tankers, \"Aegis\" warships and build large warships of aircraft carrier type under the pretexts of \"coping with emergencies in surrounding areas\" and \"increasing defence capabilities\" of the \"SDF.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now giving a finishing touch to their commanding system so as to carry out military actions for aggression worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls for heightening vigilance against Japan and foiling the Japanese militarists' moves for overseas expansion.    \r\n\r\n"
