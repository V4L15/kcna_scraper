            "content": "Joint New Year editorial published \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 1 (KCNA) -- The newspaper of the Workers' Party of Korea central committee Rodong Sinmun and the newspapers Joson Inmingun and Chongnyon Jonwi carried a joint editorial titled \"Glorify this year greeting 55th anniversary of the party foundation as a year of proud victory in the flame of great Chollima upsurge \" . The editorial describes Juche 88 (1999) as a historic year of a great turning-point in the building of a powerful nation, a fruitful year in which the dynamic second Chollima advance was made and a proud year in which a shining victory was won in the political and military confrontation with the imperialists.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Saying that last year was marked by the great Kim Jong Il's energetic guidance to the cause of building a powerful nation, the editorial notes that the perfect unity between the leader and the people which had been strengthened amidst an arduous struggle fully demonstrated its tremendous strength. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It describes the New Year juche 89 (2000) as a year of general advance to effect a significant stride forward in the building of a powerful nation under the leadership of the great WPK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The 55th anniversary of the foundation of the Workers' Party of Korea is a grand festival of victors of socialism who successfully made the \"arduous march\" and forced march, the editorial says, calling for giving full play to the spirit of socialist Korea this year which marks the 55th anniversary of the WPK foundation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It stresses:\r\n   \"Glorify this year greeting the 55th anniversary of the party foundation as a year of proud victory in the flame of great Chollima upsurge \" This is a militant slogan that the WPK and the people should put up this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should step up the general march this year, firmly maintaining the line of giving great importance to ideology, arms and science and technology. ideology, arms and science and technology are the three major pillars for the building of a powerful nation. steadfast ideology, powerful arms and upgraded science and technology represent a powerful socialist nation of Juche. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The line of attaching great importance to ideology should be firmly maintained. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To attach great importance to ideology is the life and soul of the WPK and the mainstay of Korean-style socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The kernel of the socialist idea is the spirit of defending the headquarters of the revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The idea of attaching great importance to arms should be thoroughly applied. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   To attach great importance to arms is a strategic line that should always be held fast to as long as imperialism remains and the revolution goes on. It is the most important state affair to which top priority should be given by all units. attaching great importance to national defence is the most correct way of defending the destiny of socialism in the world today. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The idea of attaching great importance to science should be held fast to. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the fixed stand of the WPK to construct socialism in reliance upon science. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should put the Juche-based science and technology on the world's level in the shortest possible time and settle urgent scientific and technological problems in the building of a powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Big efforts should be directed to socialist economic construction this year, the editorial says, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We should work harder under the slogan \"Let us all become heroes in a drive to glorify the 55th anniversary of the party foundation \" . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The editorial sets forth the tasks to develop power, coal and metal industries, railway transport, light industry and agriculture and step up major construction projects. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is imperative to strengthen the party, preserve the Juche character and the national character in the revolution and construction and do oneself justice in work for the successful fulfilment of the militant tasks this year, the editorial notes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The great unity of the entire nation is the prerequisite for the reunification of the country, the editorial says, and continues: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   A master key to opening an epochal phase of national reunification is to firmly defend the three principles of national reunification, the ten-point programme of the great unity of the whole nation and the proposal for founding the Democratic Confederal Republic of Koryo, and struggle to carry them into practice. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We will in the future, too, fulfil our honorable international obligations in the human cause of independence and the cause of socialism under the uplifted revolutionary banner of independence against imperialism, concludes the editorial.    \r\n\r\n"
