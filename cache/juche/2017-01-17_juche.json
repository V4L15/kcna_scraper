            "content": "Line of Simultaneously Building up Economy and Defence Is Banner of Victory: KCNA Commentary\r\n Pyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- The international community is hardly repressing admiration at the miraculous outcome brought about by the DPRK's line of simultaneously pushing forward the economic construction and the building of nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t Doug Bandow, a U.S. expert on Korean affairs, said that the DPRK keeps successfully pushing forward the line on simultaneous development of the two fronts despite international sanctions, adding that the U.S. has faced the situation in which the supreme leader of the DPRK has set up firm leadership system and brought about sustained prosperity and turned the country into a nuclear weapons state possessed of capabilities for attacking the U.S. mainland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world media including those of Russia and China give wide publicity to the fact that the DPRK's possession of inter-continental ballistic rocket has become an undeniable truth, stressing that its missile and nuclear tests have made much greater progress beyond expectation of experts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an expression of admiration at the reality in the DPRK making shining successes in economic construction and the building of a nuclear force, a clear proof of the validity and vitality of the Workers' Party of Korea's line on simultaneous development of the two fronts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The strategic line is a scientific truth and banner of victory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line calls for cementing the defence capabilities as firm as an iron by bolstering the nuclear force for self-defence and at the same time building a socialist power by putting greater efforts on economic construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has been exposed to decades of nuclear threat and blackmail due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK and this has rendered the situation on the Korean peninsula constantly tense in which a thermo-nuclear war may break out any moment.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean people now face a historic task to end the U.S. nuclear threat, safeguard peace and security in the Korean peninsula and the region and build a prosperous country on this land at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line on simultaneous development of the two fronts has become the most just strategic line and truth for its accurate reflection of the prevailing situation and the requirements of the developing revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The victory of our strategic line is certain as it is based on the single-minded unity of the army and people working hard in the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and fortitude, rallied close around the party despite the enemies' harsh obstruction and grim hardship, and the great capacity for self-development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has towered as a nuclear power in the East which others dare not provoke and a country of Mallima which brings about changes each moment, under the banner of the great line.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Those who challenge the truth are bound to ruin.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As long as the U.S. and its vassal forces continue applying nuclear threat and blackmail against the DPRK and as long as they keep waging nuclear war rackets every year at the doorstep of the DPRK, the latter will continue to bolster the capabilities for self-defence with a main emphasis on the nuclear force, and a preemptive attack.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will certainly emerge as a great political power, military power, socialist economic power and a highly civilized nation with a firm hold on the line on simultaneous development of the two fronts."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary on Unfair Double-dealing Standard\r\nPyongyang, January 17 (KCNA) -- Some countries are vying with each other to test-fire inter-continental ballistic rockets and all other types of rockets.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe international community is taking note of the fact that the U.S. and the UN Security Council have kept mum about those test-fires while cooking up brigandish \"sanctions resolutions\" over the regular rocket test-fire by the army of the DPRK and its exercise of the right to launch satellites for peaceful purposes, justified by international law, after labeling them \"provocation\" and \"threat.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActing by the double-dealing standard unilaterally set by the U.S. in its interests, the UN brands the legitimate exercise of the sovereignty by an independent country as \"illegal\" and its measure for self-defence \"provocation\". But some countries are allowed to conduct such test-fires, unhindered. This is a reality on the UN arena at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis cannot but be the height of partiality and double-dealing standard and an expression of serious prejudice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEach country and nation has the same commitments and the same right to exercise in international relations before the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe application of double-dealing standard amounts to hideous arbitrary practices and it is nothing beneficial to the development of international relations at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA sovereign state's measures for bolstering up its military capabilities to defend its independence and territorial integrity can never be subject to criticism and interference by the world body under any circumstances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHowever, the U.S. has unhesitatingly used its double-dealing standard against those countries aspiring after independence against imperialism with differing ideologies and social systems, utterly disregarding the mission and role of international law and international organizations in pursuance of world hegemony.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOwing to the U.S. reckless moves for bolstering up its nuclear force and modernizing them, the instability and danger of a nuclear war are now escalating on the earth and nuclear weapons states are improving their strategic nuclear forces both in quantity and quality to cope with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was inevitable and entirely just for the DPRK to have had access to nuclear deterrent for self-defence and bolstered up it as it is always exposed to the direct nuclear threat of the U.S. at a time when even those countries having vast territories and big populations and huge economic potentials are giving top priority to the measures for reinforcing nuclear forces for state development and security. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn order to cope with the evermore escalating U.S. nuclear threat and blackmail, the DPRK succeeded in the test of first H-bomb, test-fire of various offensive means and nuclear warhead explosion and entered the final stage of the preparations for the inter-continental ballistic rocket and achieved signal successes in the field of strategic nuclear force.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK's measures for bolstering up nuclear force are self-defensive ones to cope with the U.S. vicious nuclear threat and blackmail. They reflect the determination of the army and people of the DPRK to counter nukes and ICBM in kind.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe DPRK has never recognized the unreasonable resolutions adopted by the UNSC against it with the U.S. double-dealing standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs long as the imperialists and hegemonic forces scheme to bring down the socialist system in the DPRK, it will further increase its military muscle, protect the peace and security of the country by its own efforts and invariably pursue its line in the future, too."
