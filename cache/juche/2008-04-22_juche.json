            "content": "Anniversary of April Joint Conference Marked \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- A national meeting was held at a plaza of the United Front Tower in the Ssuksom Revolutionary Site on Monday to mark the 60th anniversary of the historic Joint Conference of Representatives of Political Parties and Public Organizations in North and South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present there were Yang Hyong Sop, Kim Ki Nam, Vice-Premier Ro Tu Chol, the chairpersons of the friendly parties and other officials concerned, recipients of National Reunification Prize, former unconverted long-term prisoners who are pro-reunification patriotic fighters, officials of national institutions, people from all walks of life in Pyongyang and overseas compatriots staying in the socialist homeland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Yang Hyong Sop, alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and vice-president of the Presidium of the Supreme People's Assembly, in a report said that the joint conference held in Pyongyang on the initiative of President Kim Il Sung and under his guidance in April Juche 37 (1948) was a historic grand meeting of the nation for achieving the great national unity under the banner of reunification and patriotism to reject the outsiders' interference and domination and save the destiny of the country and the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that thanks to the outstanding guidance of Kim Il Sung and his energetic activities the joint conference took place in a grand style in Pyongyang from April 19 to 23 in Juche 37 (1948), the reporter continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The President at the conference made a historic report titled \"The Political Situation in North Korea\" on April 21. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the report he made a lucid analysis of the political situation prevailing inside and outside the country and clearly indicated tasks facing the Koreans in the north and the south to foil the separatist moves of the U.S. imperialists and set up a unified democratic government. In the wake of the conference the patriotic and democratic forces in the north and the south under his wise leadership courageously turned out in the struggle to shatter the plots to hold a treacherous \"separate election\" and set up a \"separate government,\" dealing heavy blows at the moves of the U.S. imperialists and their stooges to split the nation and laying a solid foundation for founding the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the glorious motherland. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was the imperishable great exploit performed by the President in his efforts to achieve the reunification of the country that he indicated the fundamental principles and ways for it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His Juche-based idea of great national unity and cause of national reunification are being firmly upheld and successfully carried forward and accomplished by General Secretary Kim Jong Il. A particular mention should be made of the fact that Kim Jong Il provided the historic Pyongyang meeting in June Juche 89(2000) and the June 15 joint declaration and made sure that the October 4 declaration, a programme for fully implementing the above-said declaration, was published last year. This constitutes an undying great exploit as it brought about a new phase for the development of the inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n South Koreans from all walks of life and other Koreans at home and abroad should resolutely foil the anti-reunification forces' acts of denying the June 15 joint declaration and the October 4 declaration and open up a new phase of inter-Korean relations and peace and prosperity through their concerted efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter called on all Koreans in the north and the south of Korea and abroad to wage a dynamic anti-U.S. and anti-war struggle to remove the root cause of hindering the national unity and reunification once and for all, resolutely frustrate the south Korean conservative ruling forces' anti-reunification policy and their moves for confrontation with the DPRK and positively support and uphold the great Songun policy.    \r\n\r\n"

You have a greater cause to attend to. Don't you think you should carry out your father's will? Don't worry about me, but hurry along your own way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The next morning she gave 20 yuan to him, saying that a man must have money in his pocket in case of emergency. The 20 yuan she had earned and saved penny by penny by working her fingers to the bone doing washing and sewing for pay. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Her words strongly touched the heartstring of the President. Though she could claim filial piety of her children as their mother, she, enduring the serious pain with a mind for the lost country and nation, gave up the paternal right and made no scruple to inspire her son to take the road of revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recollecting his mother, the President said: The love she showed me was not simply motherly love. It was true revolutionary affection with which she regarded me as the son of the nation rather than her own son and awakened me to the need to give priority to loyalty to the country over filial piety towards my parents.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Reckless Moves of Japanese Reactionaries for Overseas Expansion under Fire \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The Ministry of Defence of Japan recently released a report on \"the strategic prospect of East Asia for 2008\" in which Japan underscored the \"necessity\" of its overseas expansion, expressing uneasiness at Russia's bolstering its forces in the Far East and China's moves to increase its military muscle. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Earlier, Japanese Prime Minister Fukuda called for instituting a law on the overseas dispatch of the Japan \"Self-Defence Forces (SDF)\" without ratification. Meanwhile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in its \"white paper on disarmament\" for 2008 let loose sheer sophism that nuclear tests and missile test fires, etc. by neighboring countries pose a grave \"threat\" to Northeast Asia and other parts of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underlying the above-said assertions made by the Japanese reactionaries is a sinister aim to make preemptive attacks on other countries under the absurd pretext of someone's \"threat\" and realize their ambition for overseas expansion at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary cites facts that Japan has long persisted in their moves for overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the invariable ambition of the Japanese militarists to realize overseas expansion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the sphere of activities of the SDF is now gaining in scope worldwide, going beyond the boundary of the areas around Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have become so emboldened that they are putting spurs to the moves to round off the preparations for mounting preemptive attacks for aggression in a bid to conquer not only Northeast Asia but the rest of the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese militarists' moves for overseas expansion are assuming more dangerous and reactionary nature as the days go by. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries would be well advised to drop their foolish and reckless intention because Japan's overseas expansion will only lead to self-destruction, warns the commentary.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the number of those killed is believed to be much bigger when the cases in which all family members were killed or bereaved families moved to other areas in those days and some did not apply for probe are taken into consideration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Mass killings took place in Hamphyong, too, late in 1950. Another unit of the same division mercilessly killed all the inhabitants of a village there during its mobile operation under the pretext that all of them \"cooperated with guerrillas.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The committee, opening to the public such atrocity, said that it was inhumane and barbarous to massacre such defenseless civilians without any procedure though it was the wartime.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
