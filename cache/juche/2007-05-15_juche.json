Kumgang Resort, May 14 (KCNA) -- The 15th reunion of separated families and relatives from the north and the south of Korea, which began on Mt. Kumgang Resort on May 9, came to a close. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those from the north side had a group reunion with their kin from the south side on May 12. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recollecting with deep emotion the worthwhile life they have led under the care of the Workers' Party of Korea and the state, they told their kin from the south side that they and all members of their families are making positive contributions to the reunification of the country and the building of a rich and powerful country true to the Songun policy of Kim Jong Il.  Separated families and relatives from the south side were deeply impressed to see the orders and medals and certificates of honorary titles and academic degrees their kin from the north side received. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They called upon their kin from the south side to make positive efforts to achieve the sacred cause of reunification under the uplifted banner of \"By our nation itself\", holding that the June 15 joint declaration should be implemented to the letter to put an end to the tragedy of division at an early date. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Red Cross of the south side gave a reception for the separated families and relatives from the north and south sides on the same day. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They had a family reunion again on May 13 and spent a pleasant time, talking to each other and posing for photographs and having meals together. They toured the area around scenic Samil Lagoon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those from the north bid farewell to their kin from the south on May 14.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- The south Korean Defense Ministry is now pushing forward at a rapid pace a plan to build a military base of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces covering 146,000 phyong (one phyong equals about 36 square feet) in Kunsan, North Jolla Province to host an Apache unit and more than 2,000 troops of them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun Monday observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: This is a treacherous move to help the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces step up their preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK and reduce south Korea to their war base, and it is an anti-reunification act of throwing a wet blanket over the inter-Korean process of reconciliation and unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The commentary goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist aggression forces in south Korea are keen to abandon their old military bases and occupy new land for their new bases, while putting spurs to the transfer of their military bases. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is their black-hearted design to turn Kunsan into a new base for a preemptive attack upon the DPRK, a forward base for their war of aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is clearly evidenced by the fact that Kunsan has been chosen as one of \"future key bases\" for the U.S. troops in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The stalled inter-Korean relations are now entering the phase of reconciliation thanks to much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the results of the patriotic efforts exerted by the DPRK to promote the process of reconciliation and unity that the suspended inter-Korean ministerial talks resumed and undertakings for national reconciliation and cooperation have become brisk again. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nation will never pardon the south Korean military authorities' treacherous and anti-reunification moves to chill the desire for national reconciliation and unity and push the favorably developing north-south relations to confrontation and war.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Achieving the unity of the whole nation, therefore, provides a basic way of building and bolstering the driving force for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said struggle is very important in the light of the need of the present times. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is also very important to create an atmosphere favorable for achieving the unity of the whole nation. The Koreans should successfully hold events for reunification on such significant days of the nation as June 15 and August 15 to stir up the atmosphere of reconciliation and unity across the country and make their desire for independent reunification grow stronger. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of the whole nation can be achieved and consolidated only when all the Koreans actively promote solidarity and alliance and strengthen their organizational cohesion, prompted by their desire for reunification and patriotism. The national unity will steadily grow stronger at a new stage when different organizations for the reunification movement and people of all strata at home and abroad briskly conduct contact and dialogue, boost cooperation and exchange and intensify their common struggle for national reunification with the June 15 All Korea Joint Committee as an umbrella body. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is an important part of the drive to achieve national unity to realize a great alliance against the conservative forces in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is impossible to achieve national unity and accelerate the cause of national reunification as long as the gentries of the Grand National Party in south Korea are at large, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Rodong Sinmun on Japan's \"Cooperative Diplomacy\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, May 14 (KCNA) -- Japanese Prime Minister Abe, during his recent junket to Mid-east countries including Saudi Arabia, blustered that Japan would open up a \"new era\" in the Middle East, waxing eloquent about \"cooperation\" in the oil realm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the main purpose of his Mid-east trip was to obtain a secure oil supply, a Rodong Sinmun analyst Monday says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To barter technology for oil was one of the means employed by Abe in drawing oil producing Mid-east countries closer to Japan. These countries are now in urgent need of technology and fund. Japan is going to barter its outdated technology for oil by craftily taking advantage of such situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What Japan seeks is to further subjugate the Mid-east oil producers economically and deprive them of their oil to the last drop at cheap prices. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Particularly noteworthy in the roving diplomacy of Japan is that Abe's trip to Mid-east countries was timed to coincide with a visit to Kazakhstan by a large group of businessmen led by the minister of Economy and Industry of Japan. One of the purposes of its trip was to take away rich oil and natural gas of Kazakhstan under the cloak of \"cooperation.\" But the purpose of greater importance was to monopolize its nuclear energy resources including uranium. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is set to turning itself into a military giant and a nuclear power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By the \"new era\" in the Middle East Abe meant, in essence, an era of domination and subjugation, exploitation and plunder of the countries in the region. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aggressive and predatory nature of Japanese militarism will never change.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
