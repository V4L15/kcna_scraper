But the United States is seriously mistaken again.\r\n   It is the revolutionary spirit of our people's army and people to answer strength with strength and war with war.\r\n   If the U.S. continues resorting to the method of strength and trying to encroach upon the sovereignty of the DPRK, in disregard of our repeated warnings, it will entirely be blamed for all the consequences arising therefrom and have to pay dearly for them.    \r\n    \r\n  \r\n"

Set up there is a notice-board with pictures of 18 heroes and explanations on their exploits, the heroes who were produced by the school in the period from the 1950s to the 1990s. Its students write articles on the theme of \"Hero and I\" in which they express their determination to become the 19th hero.\r\n   The former teacher of Kim Kwang Chol, the first DPRK hero of the '90s, is a woman with a teaching career of 34 years. \r\n   She found distinguished friendship and pursuit in Kim Kwang Chol during his school days and registered his name at the top of the class roll. After this, she taught that he must not only reply with yes to the call of the teacher before other students but also fully prepare himself to devote himself to the motherland before anyone else.\r\n   The former teacher of hero Kil Yong Jo, a pilot, was not only his stern teacher but also a man like his father.\r\n   After being enlisted as a pilot, Kil Yong Jo used to visit his teacher's house before his. His teacher implanted intense loyalty to the motherland into his mind.\r\n   The director of the training centre for teachers' reeducation in Kosong county, brought up three heroes while engaging himself in teaching for more than 40 years.\r\n   The number of heroes is increasing in Korea thanks to the unknown efforts of educators who devote their sincerity to bringing up true men of the times.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It also described the rash act of the South Korean authorities as an act of doing harm to the fellow countrymen with the backing of outsiders and of destroying themselves.\r\n   Such developments which go against the independent and peaceful reunification of the country are entirely attributable to the anti-north policy of confrontation the  South Korean \"people's government\" is pursuing with the backing of outsiders.\r\n   Those developments prove that what the present ruler of South Korea said as if he were interested in the improvement of inter-Korean relations was a sheer lie and that his loud-mouthed \"North Korea policy\" is, in essence, a revamped version of the foolish \"policy of unification by prevailing over communism\" pursued by his preceding dictators.\r\n   In a nutshell, Chon's remarks and the \"sunshine policy\" on the lips of the present ruler of South Korea are an offspring of their foolish attempt to stifle the north by force of arms with the backing of outsiders and lead it to \"reform and the opening to the outside world.\" They are revelation of an ulterior intention to achieve  \"unification by prevailing over communism.\"\r\n   The \"Defence Minister,\" who is deprived of the prerogative of the supreme command, is now describing the fellow countrymen as the \"sworn enemy\", keeping mum about the pullout of the U.S. aggression forces from South Korea.\r\n   It is not hard to see through what the self-styled \"people's government\" over which such a rascal as Chon holds sway and its prospects are like.\r\n   Anti-north confrontation will only precipitate self-destruction. This has already been proved by the history of the successive puppet governments of South Korea which met a disgraceful end.\r\n   The South Korean ruler must be aware that as long as such servants of the preceding dictatorial regime as Chon Yong Thaek and Kang In Dok are engaging themselves to incite anti-north confrontation as  \"ministers of the people's government,\"  the present regime will certainly be overthrown.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And the \"restructuring\" of the financial bodies will leave  30,000-40,000 people jobless at the Korea First Bank, the Bank of Seoul and other four banks  by the end of the year.\r\n   There are more than 8 million jobless people in South Korea. Among them, the unemployed are more than 6.3 million and over 1.7 million working people get jobs for 4-5 days on a monthly average.\r\n   In another development, the industrial production decreased 10.8 percent in May as against the same period of last year. \r\n   South Korea has not gotten 8 billion dollars of agreed bailout fund from the United States and other countries.\r\n   The fact shows that the IMF is nothing but a tool executing the U.S. strategy for domination over the world economy.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"
