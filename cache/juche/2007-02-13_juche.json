            "content": "Japan Urged to Fulfil Its Commitment under Intl' Law to Settle Its Past Crimes \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 12 (KCNA) -- Members of the U.S. House of Representatives recently presented to Congress a resolution demanding the Japanese government make a clear formal apology for the crimes related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army committed during the period of the Second World War. This can be interpreted as one reflecting the public mindset demanding Japan redress without delay the crimes perpetrated by it in the past. Rodong Sinmun Monday observes this in a signed commentary. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is a criminal state which brought unspeakable sufferings, misfortune and disasters to the Korean people after illegally occupying Korea in the past, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become an international trend for any country to reflect on its past wrongs and redeem them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fair world public is, therefore, lifting its just voices demanding the Japanese government own its responsibility for the above-said crimes and make a state compensation for them. It was quite natural for the U.S. lawmakers to have presented the above-mentioned resolution to Congress. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any country which fails to fulfil its commitment under international law and a moral obligation can hardly get the trust of the international community. Japan should fully settle its past crimes including those related to the \"comfort women\" for the Imperial Japanese Army. This is the only way for Japan to live in peace with a clean conscience, trusted by the international community. For Japan to settle its past wrongs is not a business-like matter but a political and moral issue and a matter related to international law, an issue of redressing the crimes committed against humanity and purifying its blemished conscience. This serves as a yardstick to judge whether Japan is willing to turn over a new leaf, drawing a lesson from its crime-woven history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the Japanese authorities continue playing sleight of hand in a bid to flee without redressing the crimes committed by Japan in the past, they will stand marooned by the public and the times for good.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

On the other hand, it openly commits brigandish wars of aggression and military intervention to seize independent countries and military strategic vantages under the cloak of \"anti-terrorism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists have adopted the strategy of preemptive nuclear attack as the main mode of war and are making haste with the miniaturization of nukes geared to it, considering that it is now possible to use nukes safely and effectively today when there is no more military rival in the international arena unlike in the Cold War era when the East and West stood in an acute military standoff. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It results from the policy of strength and policy of aggression forced by the United States that the global situation is getting more complicated and many countries are embroiled in wars to suffer huge losses, human and material. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. policy of strength, a leftover of the Cold War era, is doomed to go bankrupt. The faster the Bush administration races along the road of war, clinging to the anachronistic policy of strength, the deeper it sinks into a political crisis. The Bush administration would be well advised not to run about madly in aggression and war, regarding strength as the almighty means, but to follow the flow of the times toward peace.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
