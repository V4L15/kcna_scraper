The Japanese imperialists were driven out from Korea but, in place of them, the U.S. imperialists are present in south Korea. With the reactionaries running amuck, the situation of the country has become very complicated. So, General Kim Il Sung is working hard without sleep. Under such circumstances, how can I leave to find out them without helping him in his work? I won't do it until the situation of the country is stable. I have only one mission of safeguarding him as I did before."
