These facts that reveal the terrible human rights situation of the U.S are merely a tip of an iceberg.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. is the only country that refuses to accede to the international conventions on prohibition of human trafficking such as the Convention for the Suppression of the Traffic in Persons and of the Exploitation of the Prostitution of Others and the Convention on the Rights of the Child, to which almost all countries of the world are state parties.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recently, two thematic special rapporteurs of the UN Human Rights Council raised questions about the process of the trial of a person with mental disabilities in the U.S. and called for the withdrawal of death sentence passed on the person. This is another expression of international criticism and indignation at the judicial system of the U.S. that fosters human rights violations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Nevertheless, the U.S. continues to fabricate what they call \"Trafficking in Persons Report\" every year to admonish other countries. This is the height of imprudence and shamelessness.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. Department of State recently published the \"2017 Trafficking in Persons Report\" in which it took issue with human rights situations of other countries. Many countries were so enraged that they unanimously rejected all the findings of the report, terming it a fraudulent document full of absurd fabrications, and condemned the U.S. as the main base of human trafficking.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In particular, Russia flatly rejected the U.S. \"report\" as a groundless lie which spelled out such nonsense that the Korean workers at \"labor camps\" in Russian territory were undergoing \"forced labor\". It proves once again that the U.S. is the kingpin of fabrications and falsehood.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. should stop being presumptuous and quit acting like a \"human rights judge\" at once. It had better try and find ways to clean its own filthy home, the world's worst wilderness, biggest abuser and the most vicious state criminal of human rights."

La realidad vuelve a demostrar que el pais norteamericano es caudillo de fraudes y mentiras.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAntes que todo, EE.UU debera aprender primero el modo de corregir primeramente los quehaceres asquerosos propios de su pais, violador y criminal de DDHH quitando de inmediato la mascara de \"juez de DDHH\"."
