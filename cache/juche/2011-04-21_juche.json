Puppet seamen clubbed him standing on the deck, forcing him to sit on his feet and savagely pressing his both arms, shoulders and head. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Choe Chun Yong, inhabitant in Sokmi-dong, Haeju City, said that the enemies detained them in three rooms of the barracks of the puppet army during their detention, all their windows thickly curtained to prevent them from looking out of them. They deployed 5-7 agents and soldiers to watch them by shift, not allowing them even to meet and speak to each other, she added.  She also noted that the enemies broke into the women's room and did not hesitate to threaten them with sexual abuse, blustering: \"We will make all of you naked and throw you into the sea unless you obey us.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Hyong Sun Bok, inhabitant in Sokmi-dong, Haeju City, referred to the operation conducted by the puppet group against the inhabitants to force them to \"defect\" to the south from the very day it abducted them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Ri Hyang Hwa, inhabitant in Sokmi-dong, Haeju City, recalled that the puppet group conducted \"a despicable operation to force herself and his husband \"to defect\" to the south, adding that it separately called the mother and her son and tried to create discord between kinsmen in a bid to force them to \"defect\" to the south at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Myong Ok, inhabitant in Sokmi-dong, Haeju City, blasted the desperate moves of the enemies to shake the faith of the inhabitants to go back to the care of the DPRK. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Kum Hyang, worker of the Haeju Chemical Factory, related the story about how persistently the enemies conducted the \"operation\" to force young inhabitants to \"defect\" to the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ok Song Hyok declared that the four inhabitants now in the south did not \"defect\" to the south but they are kept in custody by the group. He demanded the group stop using them for its anti-DPRK smear campaign, keeping them in custody, and send them back to the DPRK without delay. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ra Hye Yong, inhabitant in Sokmi-dong, Haeju City said what they keenly realized while they were kept in custody by the enemies is that they cannot live even a moment without the care of leader Kim Jong Il, the care of the benevolent socialist homeland. At dawn of February 16 they celebrated the holiday, singing songs of longing with deep emotion and having dances in the eyes of the enemies.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Un Gu, farmer at Singwang Cooperative Farm in Haeju City, stressed that they clearly realized in the enemy-controlled area that they could not live even a moment without the care of Kim Jong Il and the socialist homeland is the best.  \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Before the press interview was over, the inhabitants sang in an excited tone the song of the immortal famous masterpiece \"Where Are You, Dear General?\""

            "content": "KCNA Commentary on S. Korean Authorities' Poor Position\r\n Pyongyang, April 21 (KCNA) -- The south Korean military is mulling setting new post of the vice chief of the general staff of the Air Force as part of the \"defence reforms\", according to press reports.\n\t\t\t\t\t The vice chief of the general staff will reportedly undertake the duty to ensure the command of the U.S. Air Force over the south Korean Air Force in the wartime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that such post set up by the puppet military is designed to hide even a bit its poor position as stooges of the U.S. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already known, the south Korean puppet forces decided to keep the system for the U.S. wartime operational command over the puppet air force even if the right to command wartime operations is transferred to them by the U.S. in 2015.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What matters is that the chief of the general staff of the Air Force is to come under the commander of the U.S. 7th Air Force in a wartime who is lower than him in military rank. This has become a headache for the puppet military.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In order to settle this problem the south Korean military newly set up the above-said post and is making much fuss, it is investing him with the \"right\" to receive the command of the U.S. forces and the like. In a word, this is nothing but its last-ditch effort.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such move of the south Korean authorities is no more than a foolish intention to cover up their sinister colors as marionettes of the U.S. as they sold off the dignity and interests of the nation to outside forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is well known to the world that the present chief executive implored the U.S. to postpone the transfer of the right to command wartime operations while talking about the \"threat\" from someone and decided to cover even huge expenses for the transfer and construction of U.S. forces' bases in south Korea and their maintenance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The position of the lackeys will not improve even a bit even if they receive the right to command wartime operations from the U.S. in 2015 as their fate is to be decided by their master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t South Korea cannot be free from the U.S. military, political and economic subjugation as long as there is new \"headquarters for wartime and peacetime operational cooperation\" to be newly set up to replace the south Korea-U.S. \"combined forces command\" and there remains in force the treacherous south Korea-U.S. \"mutual defence treaty\" which legalizes the permanent presence of the U.S. forces in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The successive rulers of south Korea called for the U.S. domination and subjugation themselves as they were steeped in the idea of submitting to the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities, however, are behaving as hypocrites, talking about \"self-reliant defence\" and \"independent option\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Their purpose is to justify their disgraceful policy of submitting to the U.S. and, furthermore, justify all treacherous acts including the preparations for a war of aggression against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, the south Korean authorities are sadly mistaken.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t History will certainly bring down sledge hammers upon the heads of those who are selling off the interests of the nation, backed by outside forces."

después de ser secuestrados forzadamente por los títeres surcoreanos, concedieron el día 21 en el Palacio Cultural del Pueblo una rueda de prensa. \n\t\t\t\t\tAsistieron allí los reporteros de sectores de prensa e información, los periodistas de la Asociación General de Coreanos Residentes en Japón y periodistas de China, Rusia y Estados Unidos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl hacer uso de la palabra, el obrero de la Empresa de Construcción Industrial de Haeju, Ok Song Hyok, explicó el curso de secuestro por los títeres surcoreanos el 5 de febrero pasado cuando partieron a bordo de un barco de la comuna de Tongpho del distrito de Kangryong de la provincia de Hwanghae del Sur para recoger mariscos y se refirió a que durante más de 50 días los títeres surcoreanos les obligaron a \"quedarse en el suelo surcoreano\" cometiéndoles los maltratos de toda índole.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActo seguido, los pesqueros respondieron a las preguntas de los reporteros de la Agencia Telegráfica Central de Corea, el Comité de Radio y Televisión de Corea, el Periódico Minju Joson, el Thong-il Sinbo y el Pyongyang Times. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl agricultor de la Granja Cooperativa de Singwang de la ciudad de Haeju, Ri Un Gu, dijo que desde la comuna de Tongpho del distrito de Kangryong hasta la isla Yonphyong dura más de 4 horas, pero, el barco navegó sólo 2 horas y 30 minutos hasta cuando se encontró con las lanchas rápidas surcoreanas, y agregó que en estas horas el barco no puede llegar a la zona marítima de la isla Yonphyong ni a la \"línea de límite al Norte\" de que habla la banda títere surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl hecho evidencia que el barco norcoreano no se dirigió a la zona marítima de la parte Sur, sino un grupo de secuestradores surcoreanos, integrado por varias lanchas y unidades especiales, vigilaba el barco y lo secuestró forzadamente aprovechando la neblina densa, destacó.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto a la insistencia de los títeres surcoreanos en que en aquel entonces el barco estaba en un arenal, aseveró que antes de ser secuestrado el barco estaba a flote en el mar con más de 20 metros de profundidad y tenía el motor en funcionamiento normal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl obrero del Sindicato Pesquero Cooperativo de Sokchon de la ciudad de Haeju, Pak Mun Sik, testimonió que en el momento de secuestro los títeres cometieron violencias despiadadas a los pesqueros norcoreanos desarmados. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl graduado de la escuela secundaria de Puyong de la ciudad de Haeju, Pyon Kyong Il, quien había salido al mar con su madre para contemplar el mar durante el feriado del Año Nuevo Lunar, destacó que los enemigos le dieron una paliza para que se sentara a rodillas y le impidieron levantarse apretándole los brazos, los hombros y la cabeza.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tChoe Chun Yong, moradora del barrio de Sokmi de la ciudad de Haeju, reveló que los enemigos encarcelaron a los habitantes norcoreanos en tres cuadros de un cuartel militar títere y taparon las ventanas, y más de 5 o 7 agentes y soldados los vigilaron por turnos y les impidieron hasta la charla. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemás, al entrar en el cuadro de mujeres, les amenazaron diciendo que si no les obedecen, meterían en desnudas en el mar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHyong Sun Bok, habitante del mismo barrio mencionó que desde el primer día de secuestro, los enemigos se aferraron a la \"operación de renegación\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa moradora del barrio de Sokmi de la misma ciudad, Ri Hyang Hwa señaló que los títeres surcoreanos intentaron persuadir groseramente a sí misma y su esposo a \"quedarse en el Sur de Corea\", y sembraron la discordia entre una madre y su hijo para \"someterlos\" de todos modos. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRi Myong Ok, moradora del mismo barrio, criticó que los enemigos hicieron esfuerzos desesperados por debilitar la convicción de los norcoreanos de regresar a la patria. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa obrera de la Fábrica Química de Haeju, Kim Kum Hyang, denunció las maniobras persistentes de los enemigos por \"someter\" a los jóvenes. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOk Song Hyok apuntó que los 4 no regresados no son \"renegados\", sino fueron retenidos por los títeres surcoreanos y agregó que ellos no deben aprovecharlos a la intriga anti-RPDC sino devolverlos sin demora a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRa Hye Yong, quien vive en el barrio de Sokmi, apuntó que cuando estaba retenida en el Sur de Corea sintió fuertemente que no podía vivir ni un momento fuera del regazo del Dirigente Kim Jong Il, o sea, la patria socialista graciosa, y destacó que a la madrugada del 16 de febrero, cumpleaños del Dirigente, celebraron ese día cantando y bailando con añoranza. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRi Un Gu, agricultor de la granja cooperativa de Singwang de la ciudad de Haeju subrayó que en la zona enemiga sintió en lo profundo del corazón que no puede vivir ni un momento sin el regazo del Dirigente y que es mejor nuestra patria socialista. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl fin de la entrevista, los habitantes cantaron ardientemente la canción \"¿Donde está el querido General?\""
