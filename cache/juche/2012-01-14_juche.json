Paektu no matter what happens in the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Ri Ul Sol, anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter, lamented deeply, saying he could not raise his head, feeling guilty of failing to hold Kim Jong Il in high esteem as a member of the first generation of the revolution.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The service personnel of the Seoul Ryu Kyong Su 105 Guards Tank Division of the Korean People's Army expressed irrepressible longing for the leader who left so many legends about his loving care during his long journeys for Songun leadership.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t O Kil Sun, daughter of former anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter O Jung Hup, the bereaved family of Kim Ik Hyon, the bereaved family of Kang Yong Chang, former president of the State Academy of Sciences, and other bereaved sons and daughters and families of revolutionaries said they felt heart-rending at the thought that Kim Jong Il passed away on a running train after undergoing all sorts of hardships.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The employees of the Mokran Video Company missed very much Kim Jong Il who was so satisfied with the fact that the company came to distribute more cultural media to the people and soldiers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Employees of the Electronics Development Company and those of a unit under the August 28 Foreign Trade Administration Bureau and other working people of various circles courteously proposed the erection of the statue of Kim Jong Il, saying that it was pity they failed to erect his statue in his lifetime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Employees of the Korean Kimilsungia-Kimjongilia Committee stressed that Kim Jong Il would live forever along with the immortal flower, flower of the sun.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Service personnel of the KPA and the Korean People's Internal Security Forces vowed to faithfully uphold the Songun revolutionary leadership of the Party in the van with arms for devotedly defending the leader.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials of Kim Il Sung Higher Party School, the Supreme Prosecutors' Office, the Supreme Court, University of National Economics and the Hoeryong City Committee of North Hamgyong Province of the Workers' Party of Korea vowed to devote themselves to protecting the safety and authority, idea and cause of Kim Jong Un, following the work style displayed by officials in the period of laying down the Party's foundation to carry forward the cause of Juche in the 1970s.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials of the Secretariat of the Cabinet, the State Planning Commission, ministries and national institutions, workers of the Chollima Steel Complex, the Rakwon Machine Complex and the East Pyongyang Thermal-power Plant and builders of the youth shock brigade for railways on the northern tip of the country and the Huichon Power Station evinced their determination to bring about great innovations and leap forward on all fronts as required by the idea and intention of Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials and workers of the units in the field of light industry associated with the leadership exploits renewed their pledge to boost the production of quality consumer goods favored and recognized by people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Letters from the agricultural workers of the Wonhwa Co-operative Farm, Phyongwon County, South Phyongan Province, the Sinam Co-operative Farm, Ryongchon County, North Phyongan Province and the Pisan Co-operative Farm, Anbyon County, Kangwon Province reflected the high revolutionary enthusiasm to remain true to the leadership of Kim Jong Un by solving the food problem of the people without fail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials, scientists and creators of the State Academy of Sciences, the Mansudae Art Studio, the Paektusan Architectural Institute and the Korean Scriptwriting Company presented letters to Kim Jong Un with the firm determination to lead the industrial revolution in the new century with ultra-modern science and research achievements and give free rein to the mental strength of masses by producing masterpieces of the era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials of the Central Committees of the General Federation of Trade Unions, the Union of Agricultural Workers and the Democratic Women's Union of Korea pledged themselves to creditably discharge their missions as organizations for mass education and transmission belts of the Party by uniting people of various circles closer around Kim Jong Un.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Officials of the Central Committee of Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League resolved to devotedly defend the respected supreme commander just as hot-blooded fighters did to protect Hanbyol and many young people including the students of the 4th Class of 6th Grade of East Pyongyang Secondary School No. 1 ardently volunteered to join the People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Students and pupils of schools at various levels including Kim Il Sung University, Kim Jong Suk Secondary School No. 1 and Pyongyang Pulgungori Primary School also vowed to steadfastly carry forward the lifeblood of the Juche revolution and baton of the cause of Songun."

They testified to the fact that they saw a big structure on the seabed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The structure was believed to be a submarine capable of staffing about 38 crewmen as its inside had a mass of pipes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All these facts provide two reasons for the warship's sinking. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t First, the submarine and the warship \"Cheonan\" accidentally collided with each other that resulted in breaking the warship into two pieces and sending the submarine into the bottom of the sea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Second, two U.S. submarines sank because of mistaken cross-firing or an accident inside them. In that case a U.S. nuclear submarine might ram into \"Cheonan\" to break it into two pieces when it was rushing on a rescue mission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Pretending to salvage the warship, the U.S. divers might clear the dead bodies, dangerous missiles, etc. out of the U.S. sub. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The authorities claimed it was a trading vessel which sank 60 years ago, but the results of an analysis concluded that its shape was fully identical to a submarine, not a trading vessel.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The warship appears more likely to be sunk by a U.S. submarine with the passage of time."
