            "content": "S. Korean Authorities Accused of Faking up Story about \"North's Work\"\r\nPyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The situation on the Korean Peninsula is still close to the brink of a war due to the U.S. anti- DPRK vicious hostile policy and its escalating moves for a nuclear war.\n\t\t\t\t\tThe north-south relations have reached an uncontrollable phase owing to the south Korean puppet forces' persistent moves for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPursuant to a new scenario of Chongwadae, the south Korean \"Ministry of Science for Future Creation\" faked up the results of investigation into the \"March 20 hacking case\" on April 10 in which it claimed that this was \"the work done by the north\" and opened them to the public, kicking up a new racket for confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIn this regard a spokesman for the General Staff of the Korean People's Army gave the following answer to a question put by the newspaper Joson Inmingun on Friday:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to screams made by south Korean puppet media, broadcasting services such as KBS, MBC and YTN and large and small financial businesses were all paralyzed by successive cyber attacks from 2 p.m. on March 20, putting all parts of south Korea into the \"greatest chaos in its history\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe so-called \"March 20 hacking case\" touted by the puppet group destroyed tens of thousands of servers and computers and \"paralyzed\" relevant computer networks, causing \"great chaos of computer networks\" such as suspension of news service at broadcasting services and paralysis of banking  service at financial networks.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group styling itself \"IT power\" refrained from opening the case to the public as it felt ashamed of the shocking chaos caused by it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tFrom the outset of the case, it drew a conclusion that the case might be \"the work done by the north\" before starting an overall investigation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe results of the investigation confirmed that hacking into the computer networks of broadcasting services and financial businesses started from a third country quite contrary to the group's expectation, sparking a big furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen relevant countries protested against it, the puppet group officially announced that a reanalysis of the case made it clear that the internet address of an employee of the \"Agricultural Cooperative Association\", one of the financial businesses, was the origin of the hacking attack and it was a \"deliberate attack\" started by a staff member of a certain broadcasting service out of his grievance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAn international hacking team called \"Who Is\" claimed responsibility for the paralysis of all south Korean computer networks unexpectedly at a time when public was deriding the puppet group's results of investigation which changed day and night. The group thus became a laughing stock in the eyes of the world.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAs its spate of rhetoric could not help conceal its lack of ability and ignorance, the puppet group suddenly announced the \"results of investigation\" on Apr. 10, 2013 in which it claimed the cyber attack was the \"north's work\" though the curtain was hurriedly lowered on the \"March 20 hacking case.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExplaining the reason for such claim, the group asserted the north made 1 590 accesses to the south Korean computer networks from June 28 last year to the very day before the launch of attack, adding that the north made long-term preparations for attack and the group  found out its trace.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is a common method used by hackers to hide themselves to abuse other's IP address or fake it up on open internet for hacking. The group claims that a few records of IP addresses by which accesses were made to south Korean computer networks prove that the case was the \"north's work.\" This cannot be construed otherwise than evidence of ignorance of how cyber warfare is waged.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAnother reason the puppet group came out to support its claim is that places used for hacking attack which occurred in the past period are identical to those used for the recent case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGenerally, hackers are using weak targets in global websites as their places for hacking operations. The weaker targets are, the more frequently they are used by more hackers as places for hacking operations. It is as foolish an act as to term specified countries or groups as hackers because of their repeated use.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is out of common sense to claim that the north used the same places for hacking operations for several years as they call for precision and stealth. It is the far-fetched assertion to be made only by the group to judge that the case was \"the work done by the north\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe group said more than 30 malignant codes out of 76 kinds of those codes collected and analyzed in the course of the investigation were identical to the attacking codes used in the past and attacking method was also identical to that employed for major cases presumed to be the \"work done by the north\" in the last period, a proof of the \"work done by the north\". This assertion is utterly baseless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAll this goes to clearly prove that what the group claims is nothing but a sinister plot hatched by those hell-bent on the confrontation with fellow countrymen, bereft of even an elementary concept of the cyber warfare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe investigation results are peppered with absurd assertions and sophism. This is clear from the following string of derision and censure of the present south Korean authorities made by people of various circles: \"The present regime is a government accustomed to shifting the blame for every case onto the north\", \"it is very strange to find lots of No. 1s in the hacking codes\", \"the north might be also to blame for the snow which did damage to crops yesterday,\" \"was the apology made by the Broadcasting and News Agency Committee and the Agency for Promoting Internet for the 'March 20 case' a lie?\" and \"the government's announcement that the case was the 'work done by the north' was what we expected.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf any case or misfortune occur in south Korea, the puppet group is apt to groundlessly link them to the north, regarding them as a good opportunity of escalating confrontation with compatriots. Such behavior is an inveterate bad habit of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA scrutiny into the recent history of the inter-Korean relations clearly tells that the puppet group has linked every case to the DPRK from the Cheonan warship sinking case to the \"paralysis of computer network at the Agricultural Cooperative Association\", \"the case of GPS wave disorder\", etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is none other than the puppet group which has never missed an opportunity to talk about \"the north's work\" as evidenced by the fact that it wrote letters \"No. 1\" in the north-style on a sunk old fishing boat and claimed a bridge collapsed because of the \"north's bomb No. 1\" though it was caused by its wrong construction.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat should never be overlooked is that the puppet group is baselessly accusing the Korean People's Army whenever an abnormal case occurs in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group misled the public opinion, claiming that the KPA was to blame for all cases. For example, when the Cheonan warship sinking case took place in the West Sea, the group salvaged a torpedo propeller from the bottom of the East Sea of Korea where it had been laying for several years to assert that it is \"convincing evidence\" proving a torpedo attack of the KPA.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLurking behind this is a cunning ulterior design of the puppet group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe revolutionary armed forces of the DPRK all out to devotedly defend the sovereignty of the country and the dignity of the nation are demonstrating their might as a mouthpiece of justice and an invincible army which mercilessly punishes injustice.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTaken aback by the toughest reaction of the KPA which mercilessly foils any act of escalating confrontation with compatriots and maneuvers to ignite a war, the puppet group has hatched such base plot to tarnish the dignified image of the DPRK by labeling it \"a terrorist state\" and  its army a \"provocateur.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe story that \"the March 20 hacking case\" was \"the north's work\" spread by the puppet group once again proves that nothing has changed since the old chief of Chongwadae was replaced by the new one.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhen the present chief executive of south Korea called for \"keeping a distance\" from traitor Lee Myung Bak in her election commitments, people were skeptical about them from the outset.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey did so because of their worry that she might follow in the footsteps of Lee Myung Bak, top-class confrontation maniac, who pushed the north-south relations of reconciliation and cooperation to the phase of confrontation and war through vicious policy for confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTime has proved that their worry is not groundless.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee orchestrated the hideous conspiratorial farce, the first of its  kind in the history of division, such as the Cheonan warship sinking case and labeled it the \"north's work\", bringing the inter-Korean relations to a total collapse. The present chief executive of south Korea claimed the \"March 20 hacking case\" was the \"north's work\" in a desperate bid to ignite a war on this land where the situation was pushed to the brink of a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe reality goes to fully prove that the chief executive is just the same as Lee in the confrontation posture and outmatches him in base and venomous nature.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIf there be any difference between Lee and the present chief executive, Lee, backed by his American master, cooked up the story that the Cheonan case was \"the work done by the north\" but she let the new \"Ministry of Science for Future Creation\" perform its mission as a ministry hatching a plot to cook up the story about the \"work done by the north\", a charade for escalating the confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe recent case marked an occasion which proved that the south Korean puppet group is a hordes of traitors steeped in sycophancy and submission.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tShortly ago, a scientific and technological institute of south Korea objectively photographed the DPRK's satellite Kwangmyongsong 3-2 on its regular orbit and opened it to the public but the puppet group is still zealously joining the U.S. in its moves for a nuclear war, echoing its master's claim that it was a missile launch.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOne cannot tolerate such a profound confusing of right and wrong.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is clear that the puppet group is the one of worst traitors as it is working hard to invent a pretext for igniting a war, currying favor with its master despite the grave situation where the outbreak of a nuclear war on this land is becoming a fait accompli due to the U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo wonder, people paint the present puppet group as \"human parrot\" blindly echoing the brigandish outbursts of its master and \"American robot\" acting according to a program worked out by him.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean puppet group's claim that \"the March 20 hacking case\" was \"the work done by the north\" is a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the Korean Peninsula to an extreme phase by taking advantage of the U.S. nuclear war racket and another anti-DPRK confrontation hysteria as it is a replica of the Cheonan warship sinking case.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe army and people of the DPRK all out in the action to defend the sovereignty are dealing with everything by the wartime law as required by the wartime state of the inter-Korean relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAccordingly, those who faked up the story about the \"work done by the north\" this time will be sentenced to death without trial for their crimes.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThose who fabricate the groundless story about the \"work done by the north\" will be labeled as the second traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe new farce faked up by the south Korean puppet group, noisily sounding the confrontation with the DPRK, would only precipitate its final doom."

Korean Warmongers' New Strategy against DPRK\r\nPyongyang, April 12 (KCNA) -- The Secretariat of the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea (CPRK) issued information bulletin No. 1030 Friday as regards that the warmongers of the south Korean puppet military have laid out a \"strategy for annihilating the north's army\".\n\t\t\t\t\tAccording to the strategy, a computer test simulating an all-out war on the Korean Peninsula showed the annihilation of more than 100 000 troops of the south Korean army 10 days into the war. So the strategy was worked out envisaging destroying the north's armed forces with the massive missile strikes in advance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis strategy is said to be included in OPLAN 5015, a new war scenario against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTo this end, the puppet military warmongers are desperately moving to purchase cutting-edge war means from abroad, while crying out for possessing their own capabilities for striking all the parts of the north from the south along the Military Demarcation Line by introducing long-range air-to-ground missiles for the present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis is another serious war provocation plot aimed at a preemptive attack on the DPRK, the information bulletin said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe puppet group is fanning up a war fever with such strategy like a puppy unafraid of a tiger.

This reminds one of what happened on the eve of the past Korean War.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAfter World War II was over, Japan expressed its intention to join in the U.S. war against the DPRK, stepping up rearmament under the protection of the U.S. It was actually involved in the war. Everything of Japan was mobilized for this war. Its air and naval \"Self-Defense Forces\" took an active part in the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt offered its territory to the U.S. as bases for attack, logistics and repair and participated and rendered cooperation in its operations for razing various parts of the DPRK to the ground.
