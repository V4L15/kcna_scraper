Korea for Sticking to \"Cheonan\" Case\r\n Pyongyang, March 26 (KCNA) -- The Korean Peninsula is now in the worst situation in history in which the vicious cycle of confrontation and clash repeats itself.\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean authorities are directly to blame for this. It is because they have pursued the one-sided policy for escalating confrontation, while sticking to the \"Cheonan\" warship case and the Yonphyong Island shelling with their faces turned away from the DPRK's proposal for unconditional dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As already clarified, the \"Cheonan\" case was the first provocation cooked up by the south Korean authorities to put pressure on the DPRK in all fields in collusion with foreign forces whereas the Yonphyong Island shelling a premeditated provocation to ignite a war against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean warlike forces are regarding the \"Cheonan\" case as a golden opportunity for carrying into practice their policy for escalating the confrontation with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year they linked the case with the DPRK in a far-fetched way and brought the preliminary talks for opening the north-south high-level military talks to a rupture. They also staged big Key Resolve and Foal Eagle joint military exercises targeted against the DPRK in all areas of south Korea in league with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They use the case to justify their moves for war and confrontation and increase the capacity of war hardware.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey openly blustered that they would convert into the offensive one the \"defensive conception of checking landing\" that remained for mere form's sake in the past. They are now mulling bolstering the marines with more than 27,000-strong forces. It was also reported that almost all those reinforcements would be deployed in the areas along the extension of the Military Demarcation Line in the West Sea of Korea in which the military tensions run high between the two sides.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They also worked out a plan of fortifying the surroundings of five islands in the West Sea and are contemplating massively deploying K-9 self-propelled artillery pieces, MLRS, new-type anti-artillery radar, surface-to-air missiles, guided missiles for precision attack on coastal artillery pieces and other latest attack weapons and combat equipment in those areas by 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The south Korean Defense Ministry scheme to increase the combat capacity to the maximum allegedly to cope with the asymmetric combat power of the DPRK while citing the case as a pretext. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It recently drafted Plan 307 specifying tasks for defense reform. In the plan it did not hide that it would allocate a huge amount of fund to purchasing fighters with stealth function, high-altitude unmanned reconnaissance planes and other latest military hardware. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Who proposed multi-faceted dialogue between the north and the south and worked hard for concord between the two sides, not bound to the past? And who is staging big joint military exercises in collusion with foreign forces and introducing the latest war hardware, not content with mocking at the dialogue partner while talking about \"sincerity\"?\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the political and military phenomena taking place in the north and the south of Korea one year after the case prove in actuality who wrecks peace and harasses the improvement of the north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more loudly the U.S. and the south Korean group of traitors grow in blaming the DPRK for the case, the more glaringly they will reveal their ugly colors as the anti-DPRK confrontation maniacs who shamelessly make the profound confusion of right and wrong."
