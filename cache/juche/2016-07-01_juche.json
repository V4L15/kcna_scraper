            "content": "National Reunification Institute Reveals Park Geun Hye Group's Human Rights Abuses \r\n Pyongyang, July 1 (KCNA) -- The National Reunification Institute Friday made public the records of human rights abuses the Park Geun Hye group has committed by turning south Korea into the worst hell where all sorts of horrible crimes against the people and human ethics are perpetrated.\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the records, Park Geun Hye who inherited fascist nature of the \"yusin\" dictator has resorted to such politically-motivated terrorism as arresting, imprisoning and eliminating whoever stands in the way of her dictatorial rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In 2013 the Park group arrested aged core members of the South Headquarters of the Pan-national Alliance for Korea's Reunification including its Vice-Chairman Ro Su Hui on the charge of violation of the \"Security Law\" and brutally imposed upon them ideological conversion. In October 2013 her group outlawed the Teachers Union, a typical progressive organization in the educational circle of south Korea after labeling it \"organization following the north.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In December 2014, the Park group forcibly disbanded the Unified Progressive Party. This was the height of its politically-motivated terrorism.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Freedom of speech and expression is wantonly violated in south Korea under the brutal tyrannical rule of the Park group.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group of traitors deleted more than 23 790 articles from websites and forcibly shut down hundreds of websites on the charge of violation of the \"Security Law\" for eight months since its coming to power.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime has mercilessly suppressed the protest actions of the south Korean people for their vital rights against the unpopular rule.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It filed a suit with the court against at least 190 railway unionists after branding the general strike of railway workers of south Korea demanding the withdrawal of policy for de-nationalization of railways and stop to the suppression of the trade unions as \"illegal one\", and dismissed more than 8 500 workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It hurled about 5 000 police gangsters into storming the headquarters of the south Korean Confederation of Trade Unions, legitimate organization, and walked off more than 130.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the reckless \"stimulating economy policy\" of traitor Park, \"state debt\" of south Korea reached 1 170 billion U.S. dollars, an all-time high, and families' debt increased to 1 200 billion U.S. dollars or a jump of 30 percent over that three years ago.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In February this year the Park group shut down the Kaesong Industrial Zone, driving about 6 000 businesses of south Korea including 124 others ready to operate there into the mire of bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group has turned south Korea into a veritable hell and mayhem.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A typical example was the ferry Sewol disaster which stunned the world in April, 2014.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group's crimes found a vivid manifestation in the fact that MERS broke out in south Korea in May last year, plunging it into extreme uneasiness, horror and confusion. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Owing to the Park group's irresponsible and careless measure, epidemics persisted for more than 200 days, infecting 186 persons and leaving 38 dead,  over 16 000 isolated. Even now people are seized with uneasiness and fear due to the continued spread of diseases for unknown reasons.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of cases of violence that occurred in families last year reached over 40 000 cases or more than double that in the previous year.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group vociferated about the \"elimination of gender discrimination\", \"nursing and upbringing of children free of charge\" and \"improvement of welfare\" during the \"presidential\" election campaign and following its seizure of power, but this was no more than a mockery and hypocrisy against the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t At present, the rate of the south Korean women's participation in economic activities recorded the lowest among countries and regions under the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development and the gap between both sexes in wages is 39 percent, more deplorable than that in developing countries.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The number of cases of maltreatment of children is on the yearly increase. It rose 27 times in 2014 as compared with that in 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Discrimination against disabled persons and old persons has reached a serious phase.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Park group has been well aware that the U.S. deliberately introduced germ weapons including anthrax and pest germs into its military bases in south Korea and conducted biochemical tests aimed to exterminate Koreans but it made no scruple of committing treacherous acts of conniving and patronizing them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When it was disclosed last year that the U.S. forces in south Korea illegally introduced anthrax germs into south Korea, the Park group was busy evading responsibility for it, talking nonsense that it did not receive an advance notice from the U.S. forces side and behaved slavishly, imploring the U.S. forces side to take measures to prevent the recurrence of such accident.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet regime made no scruple of nullifying the sexual slavery for the Imperial Japanese Army in a bid to cover up the \"yusin\" dictator's pro-Japanese acts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It has committed countless human rights abuses and unethical crimes while escalating the confrontation with the compatriots in the north. This is clearly evidenced by the facts that the puppet group hurled the Intelligence Service, the Ministry of Unification, the Foreign Ministry, the \"center for protecting inhabitants who defected from the north\", \"foundation to support inhabitants who defected from the north\", \"team for overseas cooperation of the national community\" and other plot-breeding bodies under the mask of civilians into operations for luring and abducting inhabitants of the north and forcibly putting them in custody and imposing \"defection\" upon them. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The true colors of the Park Geun Hye group as hideous human rights abusers were fully revealed by the fact that it lured and abducted over 10 women employees of the DPRK who worked abroad in April this year and is keeping them in custody under the absurd pretext of \"free will.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits more serious attention in the unethical crimes of the Park group is that it has abused inviolable human rights for escalating the confrontation with the compatriots in the north and for moves to do harm to them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group has persistently resorted to anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign with the backing of foreign forces, groundlessly pulling up the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t No sooner had she come to power than invited riff-raffs including those from the U.S. and Japan to Chongwadae at which she trumpeted about \"human rights in the north\" and implored them for \"deep attention and positive cooperation\", behaving in a coquettish manner.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t She made desperate efforts to join other countries in the anti-DPRK \"human rights\" campaign.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In March last she railroaded the \"bill on human rights in the north\" through the \"National Assembly\" though this anti-reunification evil bill failed to pass through it under the rule of traitor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The desperate efforts of the Park group to hide the grim realities of south Korea and human rights abuses would only bring to light its true colors and precipitate its miserable doom, the records concluded."

In the meantime, it is staging such despicable farce as egging Japan, south Korea and other vassal forces on to visit various countries in a bid to pressurize and appease them to sever normal economic and trade ties and even  diplomatic relations with the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite natural that this mean and disgusting behavior only invites international sarcasm.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They are sadly mistaken if they calculate any sanctions and pressure will work on the DPRK making a leaping advance on the principle of giving priority to self-development.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ever-escalating U.S. nuclear threat and sanctions would prompt the DPRK to bolster up its nuclear deterrent both in quality and quantity."

            "content": "IRP revela crimenes anti-DDHH y antietico de Paek Geun-hye\r\nPyongyang, primero de julio (ACNC) -- El Instituto de la Reunificacion de la Patria (IRP) hizo publica el dia primero una nota de crimenes anti-DDHH que revela la faz verdadera de la banda de Park Geun-hye que cometiendo uno tras otro los crimenes antipopulares y antieticos, convirtio al Sur de Corea en un infierno mas cruel.\n\t\t\t\t\tSegun ella, Park Geun-hye quien heredo tal como es el caracter fascista del dictador de Yusin, se valio del terrorismo politico deteniendo, encarcelando y eliminando sin piedad a todas personas que obstaculizan su dominacion dictatorial.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn 2013, la banda de Park detuvo, en virtud de la \"ley de seguridad\", a Ro Su Hui, vicepresidente de la direccion surena de la Alianza Pannacional por la Reunificacion de la Patria y otros miembros importantes con edades avanzadas y les impuso la abjuracion ideologia. En octubre del mismo ano, arrebato a fuerza la posicion legal del Sindicato Nacional de Ensenantes, entidad progresista que representa el circulo de educacion  del Sur de Corea, calificandola de \"entidad pro-Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl terrorismo politico de Park llego a climax descomponiendo en diciembre de 2014 el Partido Progresista Unido.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la dominacion represiva de la banda de Park en el Sur de Corea es violada y pisoteada cruelmente la libertad de la publicacion y expresion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante 8 meses despues de toma del poder, la horda traidora borro en el sitio web de Internet en virtud de la \"ley de seguridad\" mas de 23 mil 790 articulos y cerro cientos de sitio web.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tReprimio sin piedad la lucha de los habitantes surcoreanos contra la maligna politica antipopular de las autoridades titeres y por la defensa del derecho a vivir.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTildando de \"ilegal\" la huelga general de los obreros del ferrocarril que exigian la cancelacion de la medida de privatizacion del ferrocarril, el cese de represion al sindicato y otros, la banda titere acuso a mas de 190 miembros del  sindicato ferroviario y despidio a mas de 8 mil 500 obreros.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMovilizo a 5 mil policias titeres para asaltar la sede de la legitima Confederacion de Sindicatos Surcoreanos y arrestaron a mas de 130.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido a la imprudente \"politica expansionista\" de la traidora Park, la actual \"deuda estatal\" del Sur de Corea llego a un billon 170 mil millones de dolares y la deuda familia, a un billon 200 mil millones, cifra 30% mas crecida al comparar con la de 2013.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPor el cierre de la Zona Industrial de Kaesong, tomado en febrero del ano presente por la banda de Park, mas de 6 mil empresas estan en visperas de la crisis de quiebra.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa horda de Park convirtio al Sur de Corea en un infierno humano y un pandemonium.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tBuen ejemplo de ello es el hundimiento del ferry \"Sewol\" que dejo consternado a todo el mundo en abril de 2014.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tOtro ejemplo es el incidente de transmision de MERS que en mayo del ano pasado, habia desatado inquietud, panico y desorden en la sociedad surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDebido al control irresponsable e inactivo de la camarilla de Park, el incidente duro mas de 200 dias dejando como saldo 186 personas contagiadas, 38 muertas y mas de 16 mil apartadas. Ahora tambien se difunden las enfermedades brotadas por causas desconocidas poniendo a la poblacion inquietada y atemorizada.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos casos de violencia hogarena se totalizan el ano pasado en mas de 40 mil, el doble en comparacion con el ano anterior.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDurante la campana de elecciones presidenciales, los compinches de Park prometieron la \"eliminacion de discriminacion de la mujer\", la \"crianza gratuita de ninos\" y la \"ampliacion de bienestar\". Pero esto fue una burla y engano a la opinion publica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tActualmente, el porcentaje de la participacion de las mujeres surcoreanas en las actividades economicas es mas bajo entre los paises y regiones pertenecientes a la Organizacion para la Cooperacion y Desarrollo Economicos (OCED), y ellas reciben salarios 39% menores que los hombres, peor situacion que los paises en vias de desarrollo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos casos de maltratos en la \"Casa de Ninos\" se incrementaron cada ano llegando en 2014 a 27 veces mas en comparacion con 2010.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs mas grave la discriminacion a los discapacitados y ancianos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa banda de Park tolera y ampara el hecho de que Estados Unidos introduce en sus bases en suelo surcoreano las armas biologicas como antracosis y peste y realiza las pruebas bioquimicas para exterminar a todos los coreanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ano pasado, cuando fue revelada la verdad de que las tropas norteamericanas ocupantes del Sur de Corea introdujeron por via ilegal los bacilos de antracosis, las autoridades surcoreanas trataron de eludir la responsabilidad diciendo que no han recibido ningun aviso previo desde la parte norteamericana. Se limito a pedir con bajeza a la parte del ejercito norteamericano que prestara atencion para evitar la repeticion del accidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPara disimular los actos projaponeses y vendepatrias cometidos por el dictador de \"Yusin\", no vacilo en hacer nulo hasta el caso de esclavitud sexual para el viejo ejercito japones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInsatisfecha de haber convertido el Sur de Corea en la tierra privada de derechos humanos, cometio incontables crimenes anti-DDHH y de lesa humanidad contra la parte connacional recurriendo a la campana de enfrentamiento fratricida.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tInstigo al Servicio de Inteligencia, el Ministerio de Unificacion, el Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores y a las entidades de conspiracion disfrazadas de civiles como el \"Centro de Norcoreanos Desertados\", el \"Fondo de Apoyo a Norcoreanos Desertados\" y el \"Equipo de Cooperacion en Ultramar de la Comunidad Nacional\" a seducir, secuestrar y retener por la fuerza a los norcoreanos y obligarles la \"sumision\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCometio en abril de este ano el rapto colectivo a mas de 10 norcoreanas, quienes trabajaban en el extranjero, y las retiene por la fuerza bajo el pretexto de \"voluntad libre\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLo que no se puede pasar por alto esta en que los compinches de Park abusan de los sagrados derechos humanos en sus fines de confrontacion fratricida y calumnia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAcusan absurdamente a la RPDC en contubernio con las fuerzas extranjeras en el tema de \"DDHH\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como llegara al poder, Park invito a Chongwadae a una gentuza, incluso los norteamericanos y japoneses, y les suplico la \"atencion y cooperacion activas\" en la campana de \"DDHH\" anti-RPDC. Por otra parte, realizo una gira por paises extranjeros tratando de dar dimension internacional a esa campana intrigante.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn marzo de este ano, aprobo por la fuerza en la Asamblea Nacional la \"ley de DDHH del Norte\" que no obtuvo luz verde ni durante el mandato del traidor Lee Myung Bak.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCada vez que se tornen mas desesperadas las tentativas de Park y sus compinches de ocultar la realidad tragica del Sur de Corea, convertido en peor infierno del mundo para derechos humanos, y disimular sus crimenes anti-DDHH, se vera con mas claridad la fachada asquerosa de ellos y se les llegara mas rapido el fin tragico."
