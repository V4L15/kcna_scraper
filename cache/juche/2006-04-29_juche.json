The barbaric human rights abuses perpetrated by GIs in the prison of the U.S. naval base in Guantanamo, the Abu Ghraib Prison in Iraq and other detention camps and prisons of the world are monstrous human rights violations that diametrically run counter to the humanitarian principles of modern international law and the international law on human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. forces have openly committed even sexual torture strictly banned by international law. It is again the U.S. that wantonly tramples down upon the freedom of worship. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n The U.S. is bound to be severely punished by history, should it continue abusing human rights despite unanimous protest and condemnation of the public at home and abroad, the article warns.    \n\n\n\n\n\n"
