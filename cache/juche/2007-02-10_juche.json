            "content": "KCNA Blasts Japan's Sinister Moves to Scuttle Six-party Talks \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- The six-party talks for the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula are now underway in Beijing as already reported.\r\n Many countries of the world have expressed sympathy with the principled stand of the DPRK to fundamentally settle the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. and hoped the talks would prove fruitful substantially conducive to the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, is swimming against such trend of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is well proved by the remarks made by its Chief Cabinet Secretary Shiozaki. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n When interviewed on Feb. 5 he said it goes without saying that the \"abduction issue\" is very important for Japan and there can be no normalization of the relations between the two countries unless the \"abduction issue\" is settled. As if it were not enough with this, he went the lengths of blustering that Japan can not but assert this issue at the six-party talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not hard to guess how Japan will approach the talks and what attitude it will take at the talks, judging from such reckless remarks made by a guy who professes to be a spokesman for the Japanese government. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, the six-party talks are aimed, in name and reality, at solving the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula and pending issues between the U.S. and the DPRK related to it, in view of their motive, origin, purport and purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Japan, however, used to vitiate the atmosphere of the talks by persistently raising the \"abduction issue\" completely irrelevant to the major agenda of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Commenting on this, China Youth News on Sept. 1, 2003 when the six-party talks have just kicked off published an article titled \"The key issue of the six-party talks is the nuclear issue but Japan proposed the 'abduction issue' as a main one\" in which it contended that \"The scrutiny into how the talks proceeded makes it clear that Japan raised the 'abduction issue' to the DPRK, considering it as the major task of the talks, thus creating greater difficulties in the way of the six-party talks.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is ridiculous and disgusting, indeed, for Japan to assert that the \"abduction issue\" should be a main issue to be discussed at the talks and the like though it is not qualified to participate in the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present reality goes to clearly prove that Japan is not only least interested in the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula but is deliberately working hard to hamstring the work of the talks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What matters is why the politicians of Japan are so persistently trying to induce the six-party talks to take up the \"abduction issue.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In a word, the Abe government is also keen to use the \"abduction issue\" as a pretext for evading Japan's responsibility for redressing its past crimes as the preceding regimes did and stir up national chauvinism and bitterness towards the DPRK among its people in a bid to consolidate its political foundation to stay in power unchallenged through the election to the House of Councillors slated to take place in July. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their behavior cannot be construed otherwise than a mean political mode of political dwarfs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK does not care whether the Abe Cabinet stirs up scrambles among different parties and factions to stay in power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But it can never overlook any act of inciting confrontation with the DPRK with a hue and cry over the \"abduction issue\" and trying to use it for staying in power though it had already found its solution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The international community will never tolerate the moves of the politicians of this insular country if the six-party talks remain complicated and fail to produce substantial results due to its wrong doings.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean CBS's False Report on DPRK Refuted  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 9 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland gave the following answer to a question put by KCNA Friday over the false report about the DPRK released by the south Korean CBS:\r\n The CBS reported recently that the authorities of the north are now all out to arrest \"prisoners\" whom it claimed succeeded in a group escape from a detention center in Hwasong County, North Hamgyong Province late last year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Explicitly speaking, it is a sheer lie and fabrication. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is not the first time that it released such false reports on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the right-wing conservative forces in south Korea are working with bloodshot eyes to tarnish the image of the DPRK which is wining victory after victory. Their anti-DPRK smear campaign has become all the more undisguised since its successful nuclear test, in particular. The south Korean conservative media are also joining in this campaign, spreading all kinds of misinformation. The recent false propaganda was part of the campaign. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As a matter of fact, the DPRK's prestige has risen to its zenith and the public inside and outside Korea has become more vocal in supporting and praising its Songun policy since its access to nukes. The anti-DPRK smear campaign more desperately intensified by the U.S. and the south Korean ultra-right conservative forces is, therefore, nothing but a foolish move to stem this trend and destabilize it, much upset by the above-said development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has increased outlay for anti-DPRK psychological warfare from a budget for this year and its State Department blustered that it would drastically increase budget for \"Voice of America\" and \"Voice of Free Asia\" in a bid to step up the \"democratization of the north through radio broadcasting.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities, too, are joining the U.S. and the \"Grand National Party\" in their anti-DPRK smear campaign by increasing the relevant budget and intensifying psychological offensive, talking about \"aid to north Korean defectors\" and \"improvement of human rights record in the north.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such dastardly farce will get them nowhere but only touch off bitterer indignation among all the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said south Korean media should stop such shameful act as working as a trumpeter in the anti-DPRK smear campaign launched by anti-reunification forces. The CBS should apologize for its false report on the DPRK and take a measure against the recurrence of any similar case. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. and the ultra-right conservatives in south Korea should stop such foolish and clumsy farce, bearing deep in mind that their evermore desperate anti-DPRK smear campaign would only bring their despicable colors into bolder relief and adversely affect the nation's efforts for the detente on the Korean Peninsula and the improvement of the inter-Korean relations. They will be held wholly accountable for all the ensuing consequences.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

He added that Kim Jong Il has trained the People's Army as armed forces defending the leader and an ideologically strong army and achieved the unity of the army and the people in idea and spirit and work style, thus realizing the great army-people unity in the DPRK something unprecedented in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prof. and Dr. Han Hung Song, vice-president of the Political University of the Ministry of People's Security, said that Supreme Commander Kim Jong Il has performed undying feats by building an invincible military power equipped with strong war deterrent. He proved these exploits lie in that Kim Jong Il has built the People's Army into the strongest army and enabled the DPRK to attain the status of a nuclear weapons state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prof. and Dr. Pak Son Ho, president of University of National Economics, pointed out that Kim Jong Il, with a profound insight into the requirement for accomplishing the cause of socialism and the specific conditions of the DPRK, laid it down as the strategic line of economic construction in the Songun era to give priority to the development of the national defence industry and, at the same time, develop the light industry and agriculture simultaneously and provided his dynamic on-the-spot guidance to various domains of the national economy, thereby bringing about a great leap forward and innovations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Prof. and Dr. Ri Jong Hyok, director of the National Reunification Institute, referred to the fact that Kim Jong Il clearly indicated the orientation and ways of accomplishing the cause of national reunification as early as possible, firmly united all the Koreans, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\" and powerfully aroused them to the reunification movement, thus opening an epochal phase for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Kwang Yon, chief secretary of the Party Committee of the Secretariat of the Cabinet, stressed that the struggle to build a great prosperous powerful nation is difficult and complicated but the army and people of the DPRK can pull through any difficulties and ordeals and certainly build a rich and powerful country on this land as long as there is the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Present at the seminar were Choe Thae Bok, secretary of the Central Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea, officials of party and administrative bodies and working people's organizations at the national institutions and in Pyongyang and officials of educational and scientific institutions, Party cadre training institutions and fields of literature and art, media and in the field of preserving revolutionary relics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The U.S. ambition of this nature finds intensive manifestation in its desperate obstruction to the reunification of the Korean nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. will be left with no pretext to stay in south Korea when the north and the south of Korea get reconciled and united and achieve national reunification. The U.S. does not want this. It is for this reason that whenever there crops up an atmosphere of reconciliation and unity between the north and the south the U.S. chills it either by faking up a shocking case or by inciting confrontation and war hysteria through war exercises and thus leading the situation to the extreme pitch of strain. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation is craving for peace and reunification of the country so earnestly and making painstaking efforts to achieve them only to suffer a failure, running up against an ordeal and snag in every step. The U.S. is to blame for this. The Korean nation will continue to come across stumbling blocks and impasse in its way to reunification as long as the U.S. occupation of south Korea and its moves to keep Korea divided continue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The pullback of the U.S. troops from south Korea is also what is strongly demanded by the south Koreans themselves, who have experienced all sorts of national disgrace and misfortune generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A prompt end must be put to the history of the U.S. occupation of south Korea and the policy of dominating Korea pursued by it which has persistently hindered Korea's reunification, seriously violated peace on this land and inflicted bitter pain and death upon the south Koreans after dividing the Korean Peninsula into the north and the south.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The south Korean people should launch into a vehement struggle to get all the humiliating \"agreements\" and \"treaties\" signed with the U.S. scrapped and drive the U.S. imperialist aggression forces, the root cause of misfortune and disasters, out of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n And they should bring the sledgehammer down on the heads of the traitors to the nation like the cohorts of the Grand National Party of south Korea who have left indelible disgrace on the nation, bringing unspeakable misfortunes and pains to the people, after reducing south Korea to a land where GIs boss it around by forging the treacherous SOFA.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
