            "content": "Kim Jong Un Sends Letter of Thanks to Officials, Working Youth and Students \r\n Pyongyang, February 28 (KCNA) -- Kim Jong Un, first secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, first chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and supreme commander of the Korean People's Army, on Saturday sent a letter of thanks to the officials, working youth and students who volunteered for national defence with ardent patriotism and loyalty and the will to annihilate the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The full text of the letter of thanks reads:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Within only two days after the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army published on February 23 a crucial statement on punishing without mercy the U.S. imperialists and their south Korean puppet clique who are hell-bent on extremely reckless war moves, officials, working youth and students of universities, colleges and senior middle schools numbering 1.5 million across the country volunteered to join or rejoin the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I highly appreciate these dependable people for having volunteered for the defence of the country and the revolution burning their hearts with infinite loyalty to the revolution, ardent patriotism and the will to annihilate the enemy, and extend heartfelt thanks and militant greetings to them in the name of the First Secretary of the Workers' Party of Korea, First Chairman of the National Defence Commission of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and Supreme Commander of the Korean People's Army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The courageous spirit of our people, including youth and students, who gave vent to their pent-up fury on the enemy, who are running amuck to provoke our prestigious state impudently, and rose up in the sacred struggle for inflicting merciless divine punishment on them, is a demonstration of the lofty spiritual world of the great Korean people who firmly trust the Party Central Committee only and absolutely follow it, a revolutionary people who are ready to defy a bloody war, and even death, and smash the enemy if it is for the defence of justice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As soon as they heard the crucial statement of the Supreme Headquarters of the Korean People's Army, our officials, working youth and students, laudable sons and daughters of heroic Korea, held meetings in various parts of the country and expressed their soaring hatred against the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet clique and their will to annihilate the enemy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Students of universities, colleges and senior middle schools turned out as one with a determination to take up arms in defence of the country and the revolution, and a large number of officials of the Party and the youth league as well as ex-soldiers now working at factories and farms presented earnest petitions for rejoining the army. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The 17-year-old girl students of senior middle schools chose to become today's brave beauty Yeppuni in defence of the Party Central Committee, rather than to enroll in institutions of higher learning. Workers wrote on the petitions for joining or rejoining the army about their determination to settle accounts at the cost of their blood with the enemy who are bringing the cloud of war in their foolish dream of achieving \"system destruction\" in our Republic. Their burning hearts clearly showed how pure and warm the love of our people, including young people, for the Party and the country is, and how fiercely their hatred against the enemy, who are attempting to deprive them of their living base, soars.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t While receiving reports on the explosive enthusiasm for enlisting in the army manifested among young people, working people and officials across the country and their determination to take revenge on the enemy, I felt great pride in having such excellent young people and revolutionary comrades, who burn their hearts with the revolutionary spirit and patriotism and never pardon injustice in the slightest, and once again gained infinite strength and courage.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t That all the service personnel and people live with their lots cast in with the Party Central Committee is the genuine feature of Korea that cannot be found in any other country and in any other era, and it is the physiology of our society which the enemy can never understand. The steel-strong, revolutionary unity of the Party, the army and the people is our greatest strength incomparable to the might of scores, nay, hundreds of A-bombs or H-bombs. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There is no people in the world other than ours who, cherishing a thoroughgoing anti-imperialist revolutionary spirit, have achieved one brilliant victory after another in the anti-U.S. showdown that has continued from generation to generation and from one century into the next. As long as it has such a great and heroic people, Songun Korea will always emerge victorious.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Now the imperialist enemy are making a last-ditch effort to check our onward advance by all means.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t But they are too ignorant of our people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Our heroic people, whom the great Comrades Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il trained throughout their lives, know full well what their motherland means, what a genuine life of a human being is and how they should defend the supreme dignity of the revolution and bring their happiness into reality, and are filled with a firm determination to support the leadership of the Party and the leader with their burning hearts and through an indomitable struggle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By leading all the service personnel and people including young people who are unfailingly faithful to its cause, our Party will completely frustrate all manner of provocative moves by the hostile forces and surely bring the final victory of the Juche revolution. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t With the same spirit and mettle as they displayed in turning out as one and volunteering for the sacred struggle for defending the country and the revolution, all the service personnel and people including young people should make redoubled efforts in the general offensive to celebrate the Seventh Party Congress as a glorious meeting of victors as it will constitute a historic landmark in carrying out the revolutionary cause of the Workers' Party of Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If the U.S. aggressors, the sworn enemy of the Korean people, and their south Korean puppets, a despicable group of traitors to the nation, eventually ignite a war, all the officers and men of the heroic Korean People's Army, our Party's revolutionary armed forces, will give vent to the indignation of the revolutionary army by firing salvoes to reduce the enemy's strongholds to rubble, and win victory in the war to make jubilant cheers for the prospering reunified Korea reverberate far and wide.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the people including our heroic working class of Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il and a steel-strong legion of young people with a rifle in one hand and a hammer, a sickle or a writing brush in the other should thoroughly arm themselves with our Party's revolutionary view on war, intensify their anti-U.S., anti-puppet clique class consciousness and turn their soaring indignation into most strenuous efforts.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The working youth and students should achieve greatest successes conducive to building a prospering country by waging an unprecedented labour struggle and intensive studying at their workplaces and schools with the feeling that they are in the same trench as the service personnel. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All the fronts and posts should raise the fierce flames of the general offensive to death-defyingly implement the militant tasks presented in the letter of the Party Central Committee to all its members and the joint slogans of the Central Committee and Central Military Commission of the Party, and thus greet the victorious May in a dignified way carrying the records of the 70-day campaign of loyalty inscribed with heroic devotion and shining miracles as well as proud labour results dedicated to the Seventh Party Congress. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Party and working people's organizations should conduct offensive-style political and ideological work in a concentrated way and rouse the entire Party and all society to display mass heroism as never before. By doing so, in the 70-day campaign that is proceeding forcefully day and night they can create a new spirit representative of the Mallima era of Juche Korea and a new heroic fighting mettle. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t I firmly believe that all the service personnel and people including young people, who always cherish a feeling of attachment to the garden of the offices of the Party Central Committee, will give free rein to the indomitable mental strength and the spirit of self-development they have cultivated under our Party's concern, and brave grave challenges of history so as to achieve the victory of the cause of Juche-oriented socialism and communism without fail and demonstrate the dignity and might of Kim Il Sung's nation and Kim Jong Il's Korea to the whole world."

Y en tan solo dos dias, mas de un millon quinientos mil funcionarios, jovenes trabajadores y estudiantes de centros de la ensenanza superior y de escuelas secundarias superiores de todo el pais solicitaron fervorosamente su enrolamiento o el reenganche en el ejercito. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tValoro altamente a nuestros fidedignos funcionarios, jovenes trabajadores y estudiantes por su resuelta decision de defender a la patria y la revolucion, con la ilimitada lealtad a la revolucion, el ardiente patriotismo y la voluntad de aniquilar al enemigo, y les extiendo mi cordial agradecimiento y saludos militantes en nombre del Primer Secretario del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, Primer Presidente del Comite de Defensa Nacional y Comandante Supremo del Ejercito Popular de Corea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl inflexible espiritu de los jovenes, estudiantes y otros sectores del pueblo que, con su incontenible indignacion ante el perverso y esquizofrenico antojo del enemigo de agredir a nuestro Estado, se han levantado en la sagrada lucha para escarmentarlo implacablemente, demuestra patentemente el elevado mundo espiritual del gran pueblo coreano que confia plenamente y sigue incondicionalmente al Comite Central del Partido, un pueblo revolucionario que para defender la justicia acaba con el enemigo sin temor a la guerra sangrienta ni a la muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTan pronto como fue emitida la declaracion de capital importancia de la Comandancia Suprema del Ejercito Popular de Corea, nuestros funcionarios, jovenes trabajadores y estudiantes, dignos hijos de la Corea heroica, convocaron reuniones a lo largo y ancho del pais para patentizar el odio visceral a los imperialistas yanquis y sus acolitos surcoreanos y la determinacion de aniquilarlos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos estudiantes de los centros de la ensenanza superior y de las escuelas secundarias superiores juraron a porfia empunar las armas para defender a la patria y la revolucion. Por otra parte, solicitaron vehementemente su reenganche tanto los desmovilizados que hoy son obreros o campesinos como numerosos cuadros del Partido y de la juventud. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTanto las alumnas del ultimo ano de la secundaria superior que han desechado la esperanza de estudiar en la universidad para convertirse en yeppuni de hoy que defiende el CC del Partido, como los apasionados obreros que han solicitado su alistamiento o reenganche en el ejercito con la determinacion de saldar las cuentas con el enemigo que pretende provocar una nueva guerra con el sueno de derrocar nuestro sistema, demuestran elocuentemente cuan puro y fervoroso es el amor de nuestro pueblo y juventud al Partido y a la patria y cuan intenso es su odio al enemigo empenado en quitarles su nido. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl informarme del explosivo deseo de los jovenes, trabajadores y funcionarios de todo el pais de enrolarse en el ejercito y de su juramento de venganza, senti el gran orgullo de tener a excelentes jovenes y companeros revolucionarios que arden de tan elevado fervor revolucionario y patriotico y que no perdonan jamas la injusticia, y una vez mas cobre fuerza inagotable y animo redoblado.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl inseparable enlazamiento de todo el pueblo con el CC del Partido es una realidad innegable de Corea que no se ha visto jamas en ninguna otra parte del planeta y la razon de ser de nuestra sociedad que el enemigo no puede comprender por mucho que trate de comprenderla. La ferrea unidad del Partido, ejercito y pueblo es precisamente nuestra mayor fuerza que no se puede comparar con decenas o cientos de bombas atomicas o de hidrogeno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNingun otro pueblo, con un espiritu revolucionario antimperialista tan indomable, ha obtenido sucesivamente resonantes triunfos en el enfrentamiento con el imperialismo norteamericano que persiste generacion tras generacion y siglo tras siglo. Con un pueblo tan grandioso y heroico, la Corea del Songun triunfa y triunfara eternamente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHoy nuestro enemigo, el imperialismo, hace desesperados esfuerzos para impedir a todo trance nuestro avance. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLamentablemente, no conoce a nuestro pueblo y, mejor dicho, no tiene la menor idea de lo que es. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro heroico pueblo, formado por los grandes Lideres, sabe bien lo que es la patria, lo que es la verdadera vida del hombre y la manera de defender la suprema dignidad de la revolucion y disfrutar plenamente de la felicidad. Tambien esta firmemente decidido a seguir fiel a la direccion del Partido y el lider con el alma ardiente y la lucha intransigente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro Partido, al conducir a los militares, los jovenes y a todo el pueblo ilimitadamente leales a su causa, frustrara todas las provocaciones de las fuerzas hostiles y obtendra sin falta la victoria final de la revolucion del Juche. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCon el mismo espiritu e impetu de los que se levantaron como un solo hombre en la sagrada lucha para defender a la patria y la revolucion y  solicitaron apasionadamente el ingreso en el ejercito, los oficiales y soldados del Ejercito Popular, los jovenes y el pueblo entero deben alzarse resueltamente en la ofensiva general dirigida a convertir en un evento glorioso de los triunfadores el VII Congreso del Partido del Trabajo de Corea, que sera un punto de viraje historico en el logro de la causa revolucionaria del PTC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi el imperialismo yanqui, enemigo jurado del pueblo coreano, y los titeres surcoreanos, banda de aviesos traidores a la nacion, encienden al fin y al cabo la mecha de la guerra, todos los oficiales y soldados del heroico Ejercito Popular de Corea, fuerzas armadas revolucionarias de nuestro Partido, destruiran por completo la madriguera del enemigo con el intenso fuego del indignado ejercito revolucionario y cosecharan la euforica victoria que hara estremecer la tierra con los vivas de la Corea unificada, poderosa y prospera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestra heroica clase obrera de Kim Il Sung y Kim Jong Il, el acerado destacamento de la juventud y el pueblo entero que empunan en una mano el fusil y en la otra el martillo, la hoz y el pincel, deben identificarse con el concepto de la guerra de nuestro Partido, tener una elevada conciencia de clase contra el imperialismo yanqui y sus lacayos surcoreanos y trocar la irrefrenable indignacion en el mayor conato.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tA los jovenes trabajadores y los estudiantes les compete laborar y estudiar con un fervor inusitado, como si estuvieran en la misma trinchera con los soldados, y lograr exitos que contribuiran sustancialmente a la construccion de la patria poderosa y prospera. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn todos los sectores y centros de trabajo libraran energicamente la ofensiva general para cumplir a todo trance las tareas presentadas en la carta dirigida por el CC del Partido a todos sus militantes y las consignas conjuntas del CC y la Comision Militar Central del Partido. De esta manera, acogeran el mayo de la victoria con la frente bien alta, con los regalos laborales al VII Congreso del Partido y la libreta de notas de la Batalla de 70 dias de fidelidad que registra la heroica abnegacion y los admirables exitos laborales.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl realizar la labor politica e ideologica como una ofensiva y de manera intensa,  las organizaciones del Partido y las agrupaciones de trabajadores  convocaran energicamente a todos sus miembros y demas integrantes de la sociedad a protagonizar un heroismo colectivo sin precedentes, para que los 70 dias y noches engendren un nuevo espiritu que represente a la epoca de Mallima de la Corea del Juche y un nuevo espiritu heroico de combate.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEstoy convencido de que los militares del Ejercito Popular, los jovenes y el pueblo entero, enlazados inseparablemente con el CC del Partido, manifestaran plenamente el espiritu indomable y la capacidad de fortalecerse a si mismos que les ha ensenado nuestro Partido, superaran con valentia los grandes desafios de la historia, conseguiran sin falta la victoria de la causa socialista y comunista del Juche y haran gala ante todo el mundo de la dignidad y poderio de la nacion de Kim Il Sung, la Corea de Kim Jong Il."
