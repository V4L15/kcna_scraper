Paektu.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSaying that the complex is playing an important role in building a great prosperous and powerful nation, he put forward the tasks to be carried out by the complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe workers of the complex represent the heroic working class who created the tradition of loyalty, supporting the Party with iron, bearing deep in mind the teachings of the President \"Iron and the machine are the king of industry!\", he said, calling upon them to live and struggle with the same spirit and stamina as they displayed in building socialism from scratch after the war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe stressed that the most important task facing the complex is to thoroughly establish the iron production system relying on locally available raw materials.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is necessary to give fullest play to the production capacity already created by the complex and, at the same time, steadily increase its production capacity by continuing to push forward technological updating in order to satisfactorily meet the ever-growing need for iron and steel, he said.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe expressed expectation and conviction that the workers of the complex would bring a new turn in the production of iron and steel through a devoted drive and thus creditably discharge their honorable mission and duty as a hardcore unit in building a great prosperous and powerful nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe next leg of his guidance was the Ranam Coal Mining Machine Complex.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tGoing round the machines newly manufactured on the basis of the latest technology and technologically-updated processes, he learned in detail about the progress made in the modernization of the complex and its production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe highly appreciated the successes made by its workers, expressing his great satisfaction over the fact that they are successfully carrying out the work to put the complex on a modern and scientific basis through a brisk mass technical innovation movement.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNoting that the complex is rapidly turning out machinery requiring high technology by closely combining science and technology with production and working out bold and big operations and carrying them out in a persevering manner to cement its material and technical foundations, he highly appreciated the mental power and tirelessly creative energies displayed by its officials, workers and technicians in steadily creating everything advanced in Korean style.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt deserves a high praise that the officials, workers and technicians of the complex jointly explored a new area for modernization and scientification by their own efforts and technology, he said, adding: This signal achievement goes to clearly prove the true advantages of our society where the rights of the working people are fully guaranteed and their wisdom and creative ability displayed to the full and the validity and tremendous vitality of the WPK's idea of giving importance to science.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe heroic workers of the DPRK are the fighters who devotedly carry out any difficult task in time with the faith that they can do anything unconditionally when the party is determined to do, he said, stressing that a great prosperous and powerful nation is sure to be built as there are large contingents of such faithful workers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe set forth important tasks to be carried out by the complex, expressing deep trust that its workers would realize its modernization and scientification at a higher level on the basis of the successes already made.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is an important task facing the complex to closely combine the work for keeping the production going at a high rate with modernization in reliance upon the advantageous socialist planned economy and push ahead with them and thus break the record in production and improve the quality of machinery, he noted, indicating the orientation and ways to do so.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHe was accompanied by Hong Sok Hyong, chief secretary of the North Hamgyong Provincial Committee of the WPK, Pak Nam Gi, department director of the WPK Central Committee, and Ju Kyu Chang and Ri Jae Il, first vice department directors of the WPK Central Committee."

            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Vituperation against DPRK's Dignity and System Rebuked\r\nPyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea issued a statement on Feb. 21 denouncing traitor Lee Myung Bak for malignantly slandering the dignity and system in the DPRK. He, when dining and wining at \"Chongwadae\" recently, jabbered that \"it would be better not to build socialism if people had to worry about three meals a day under it.\"\n\t\t\t\t\tBranding the remarks of the traitor as unpardonable outbursts fully disclosing his true colors as an anti-reunification element persistently standing against national concord and reunification and inciting hostility toward fellow countrymen and confrontation with them, the statement continued:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee has nothing but a temperament of a fraudulent dealer accustomed to hoodwinking others. It is an intolerable insult and a mockery of the people in the DPRK for such guy to say this or that about dignified socialism in the DPRK with the theory which can be spelled only by those physical and mental cripples leading a corrupt material life. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is south Korea that is beset with the issues of poverty and human rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe south Korean society is plagued with unprecedented unemployment and poverty due to economic bankruptcy and destitution of people's livelihood. And even women with baby carriages, middle school students and children took to the streets demanding the right to existence protesting against the Lee group which has sold off the economic market of south Korea to outsiders lock, stock and barrel though it is directly related not only to the livelihood of the people but to their lives. This is the true picture of south Korea at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere occurred recently a tragic incident in Ryongsan in which those people who were in the mire of poverty before being dishoused by the Lee group were burned to death by the fascist hooligans hurled by traitor Lee. This has sparked off a great public furor.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is quite preposterous for the worst traitor who turned south Korea into a veritable hell and graveyard of human rights to dare let loose sheer sophism to slander someone. This is ridiculous enough to make even a cat to laugh.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee's utterances will get him nowhere as they are no more than mean and shameless sophism aimed to justify the policy of confrontation with the DPRK, a policy censured and rejected at home and abroad, and incite the hostility toward fellow countrymen among south Koreans.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHis recent reckless remarks made it clearer that it is impossible to expect the peace and reunification of the country, to say nothing of the improvement of the inter-Korean relations as long as this anti-reunification element and traitor, steeped in the hysteria for confrontation with fellow countrymen to the marrow of his bones, is allowed to stay in power in south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNow that the traitor is coming out to blatantly challenge the DPRK, slandering even the mainstay of its servicepersons and people, far from drawing a lesson from his treacherous act of having pushed the north-south relations to the worst phase, the DPRK will certainly settle accounts with the group of traitors through the most merciless and resolute measure.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The days ahead will prove in practice what a miserable end the Lee group of traitors will meet."

            "content": "Lee Myung Bak's Criminal Theory of Confrontation with DPRK Assailed\r\nPyongyang, February 21 (KCNA) -- The theory of \"adherence to principle\" as regards the inter-Korean relations touted by traitor Lee Myung Bak recently whenever an opportunity presented itself is a version of the theory of maintaining confrontation with the DPRK, says Rodong Sinmun Saturday in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\tIt goes on: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo sooner had the traitor come to power than sought the criminal purpose of bringing the north-south relations to stalemate. Hence he has cried out for \"adhering\" to the treacherous and anti-reunification \"principle\" while denying the principle of independent reunification, a basis for the development of the inter-Korean relations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee Myung Bak is the worst traitor who stakes his fate on division and confrontation as he has thrown a stumbling block in the way of reunification and worked hard to provoke a war of aggression against the DPRK after pushing the north-south relations to the worst crisis in a bid to prolong his dirty remaining days.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tWhat merits a serious attention is that the traitor seeks to push the north-south relations to the brink of a war under the pretext of \"adherence to principle.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe traitor is escalating military tension, talking about \"emergency\" and the theory of \"preemptive attack\". It has become clearer that the group does not have even the slightest intention to drop the hostility toward the DPRK but seeks to stand in confrontation with the DPRK for an indefinite period and, furthermore, ignite a war under the signboard of \"adherence to principle\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLee is a wicked, ignorant and reckless traitor, a confrontational fanatic putting the successive dictators into the shade and a dangerous element bringing disaster to the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is the tragedy of history that such human scum of the times as Lee is allowed to stay in power to do harm to the destiny of the nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The traitor's theory of \"adherence to principle\" sounds as no more than a dirge."

So the DPRK advised him to study it with honesty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThis advice was made not because it was unaware of the fact that he is treated as a \"seasonal politician\" and \"human scum\" even in the south Korean political circle, but because it took into consideration the fact that he once involved himself to a certain extent in the reunification movement calling for democracy against dictatorship. Had he had an iota of reason, he should have behaved with discretion, feeling thankful for the advice. But he is now responding to our advice with outbursts calling for \"unification through absorption\" and \"itinerant lecture\" inciting confrontation with fellow countrymen.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThere is no knowing how such despicable act would please Lee Myung Bak but what is clear is that Ri will never be able to escape stern punishment by the nation for such behavior. The DPRK keeps strict tabs on all the crimes such riff-raffs as Ri committed by staging the anti-DPRK confrontational farce called \"itinerant lecture.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe philistines such as Ri Ki Thaek will face a stern judgment by the nation if they further bedevil the inter-Korean relations by letting loose outbursts falsifying truth through similar lectures. They would be well advised to behave themselves, though belatedly, as regret will not mend matters."
