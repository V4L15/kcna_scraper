This is based on the original idea and feasibility that different ideas and systems may exist in one country. The proposal reflects the interests of the north and south most equitably. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal defines it as the principle of organizing and constituting a federal state to establish a unified national government in which the north and the south are represented on an equal footing and as the function of the federal state to respect and defend the interests of the whole nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal also calls for applying the principle of impartiality to the operation of the federal state. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It also conforms with the interests of neighboring countries as well as all other countries of the world and with the desire of the world peace-loving peoples. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal is based on one nation, one state, two systems and two governments so that it may provide legal and institutional guarantee for the existence of the two systems. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The regional governments in the north and the south shall pursue their own policies under the guidance of the federal government so that neighboring countries may maintain the present relations with the north and the south in many aspects as they are. This is in full accordance with the interests of those countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The peace-loving federal state shall preserve the peace-loving traditions of the Korean nation, give no threat of aggression to any country and not be used by any country for aggression. It shall not build up any armed force aimed at aggression and mass destruction but take it as an immutable guideline of its activity to make the Korean peninsula a peace zone and denuclearized zone. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The proposal is a patriotic charter of reunification and a bright blueprint which will bring a reunified country to the Korean nation and guarantee its rosy future. In order to materialize the proposal it is imperative to maintain the principle of national sovereignty, achieve the great unity of the whole nation, remove the threat of war from the Korean peninsula and ensure a durable peace. \r\n\r\n"
