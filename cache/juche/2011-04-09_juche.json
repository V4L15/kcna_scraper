Korean Puppet Group's Abduction of Inhabitants of DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- The operations of the group of traitors in south Korea to abduct inhabitants of the DPRK have gone into extremes. \n\t\t\t\t\t The group persistently conducted an operation to force four fishermen of the DPRK to \"defect\" to the south though they had gone adrift to the south side owing to rough waves early in February and finally detained them there. On March 24, it abducted several citizens of the DPRK under the cloak of \"planned defection from the north\" by hiring ultra-right religious organizations. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group put up the card of \"defectors from the north\" in a bid to cover up its criminal acts but the operations of the above-said organizations were brought to light and there surfaced such problem as \"planned smuggling,\" throwing it into utter dismay. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What did the puppet group seek through the operations to abduct citizens of the DPRK while coming under fire by the public at home and abroad for turning down its every proposal for dialogue this year? \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its aim is to evade the responsibility for having driven the inter-Korean relations into an unprecedented collapse and tarnish the international image of the DPRK.
