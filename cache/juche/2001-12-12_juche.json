This is an unpardonable criminal act and a vicious challenge to the dignified DPRK which regards its sovereignty as its life and soul. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The letter urged the Japanese authorities to halt the political suppression of Chongryon at once, apologize for it and unconditionally and immediately release those unreasonably arrested.    \r\n\r\n"

This was a high-handed political suppression of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan and a wanton violation of the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese authorities should immediately stop their anachronistic anti-DPRK moves to mislead the world public opinion by craftily taking advantage of the recent complicated international situation and fish in the troubled waters in a bid to realize their ambition for overseas expansion and properly apologize to all the Korean people and the rest of the world for their tyrannical actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Availing ourselves of this opportunity, we bitterly denounce the U.S. for its anti-DPRK war moves, a big threat to peace on the Korean peninsula and the rest of the world, and strongly demand the U.S. and Japan immediately drop their hostile policies towards the DPRK and stop acting rashly.    \r\n\r\n"

Nevertheless, the Japanese authorities committed fascist political suppression of Chongryon by groundlessly linking it with the issue of the Korean bank. This is unpardonable. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The high-handed search made of the central headquarters of Chongryon, a dignified overseas citizens organization of the DPRK, by the Japanese reactionaries after leveling accusation against it without any legal ground was a political plot to undermine Chongryon. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The blatant political suppression of Chongryon and the Koreans in Japan is aimed to serve their sinister political purpose of infringing upon the sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any repressive action against Chongryon is a serious infringement upon the dignity and sovereignty of the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This will only add to the crimes Japan has already committed against the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan will have to own full responsibility for the grave consequences to be entailed by the anti-DPRK, anti-Chongryon moves escalated by its reactionaries.    \r\n\r\n"

Pongrin in Phyongsong city, South Phyongan Province, in 503. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The present temple was rebuilt in 1785.

Its front is more than 17 metres long and its side more than 13 metres long. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The interior of the hall was coloured golden, red and blue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The carvings of two dragons on each pillar and the carvings of dolls at each corner are very fanciful and vivid. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The hall is characterized by big exquisite decorations above the image of Buddha. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Thaephyong Pavilion and the Stone Pagoda (nine-storeys) are in front of the hall. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Stone Pagoda 3.2 metre high consists of a two storeyed base and nine-storeyed stones.\r\n Lower and upper sections of the platform are engraved with lotus flowers.\r\n The Anguk Temple is preserved as heritage of a national treasure by the correct policy of the Workers' Party of Korea on preservation of cultural relics.    \r\n\r\n"
