He went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The youth who represented the first generation of the Korean revolution achieved the historical cause of Korea's liberation by making long journeys for bloody battles against the Japanese imperialists, holding Kim Il Sung in high esteem as the sun of the nation, and set a shining example in safeguarding the leader at the cost of their lives.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The young people fought heroically in the Fatherland Liberation War, shouting \"Long Live General Kim Il Sung!\", thus bringing July 27, the day of victory. In the postwar period of socialist construction, too, they performed world-startling feats in difficult and labor-consuming fields, taking the lead in upholding the intentions of the party and the leader, and thus fully demonstrated the heroic stamina of Chollima Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the unprecedentedly grim period of the Arduous March, the forced march, they set their hearts ablaze with their fixed will to share destiny with Kim Jong Il to the end, strikingly demonstrating the invincible might of Songun Korea in defending socialism and in confrontation with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un stressed that the tradition of devotedly defending the leader, the tradition of heroic struggle that was created and has been successfully carried forward in the annals of the revolution, is precious revolutionary wealth and an eternal banner of victory which our youth should carry forward generation after generation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He added that the present era is the era of dynamic struggles, a new era of the Juche revolution, as an all-out charge is being made to achieve the final victory of the revolution under the uplifted banner of the great Kimilsungism-Kimjongilism under the leadership of the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He called on the youth to creditably perform their role as the young vanguard of the party by devoting their energies, wisdom and enthusiasm to the on-going historical advance.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He stressed that \"Let Youth Become Vanguard Fighters Intensely Loyal to the Songun Revolutionary Cause of the Party!\" is a militant slogan to be held up by the Korean youth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He continued: \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Young people should remain true to the leadership of the Workers' Party of Korea and become a fortress and shield devotedly safeguarding the party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become vanguard fighters implementing the party's ideology and defending the party's policies and become a death-defying corps in defending the socialist motherland.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should establish the traits of always prizing arms and attaching importance to military affairs and resolutely foil the imperialists' ideological and cultural poisoning.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t They should become vanguard fighters and shock-brigade members in building a thriving socialist nation and pace-setters in pushing back the frontiers of the latest science and technology and take the lead in ushering in the heyday of a highly civilized socialist nation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Kim Jong Un clarified the position and role the primary organizations of the youth league have in making sure that the young people successfully perform their honorable mission as the young vanguard of the party in the new era.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He expressed his conviction that all young people would fully display the heroic stamina as the young vanguard in the historical advance for accomplishing the revolutionary cause of Songun under the leadership of the party."

            "content": "KCNA Commentary Assails U.S. Strategy to Contain Other Big Powers\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- The U.S. and south Korea at a recent meeting in Washington discussed the issue of extending the transfer of the right to control wartime operations to south Korea well beyond 2020.\n\t\t\t\t\t Explaining the reason for this extension, they claimed that the period beyond 2020 is the time meeting the conditions for the transfer as by that time the south Korean army will be capable of coping with the threat from north Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What the U.S. seeks under the pretext of the non-existent \"threat from north Korea\" is a product of the U.S. strategy to contain China and Russia. Therefore, it comes under fire by the international community.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was quite natural that U.S. experts on foreign policy, security and military affairs during the meeting censured the unreasonable extension of the transfer and became vocal facilitating the process for the withdrawal of the U.S. forces from south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As well known to everybody, in July 1950, the U.S. deprived south Korea of prerogative of command over the operations of the three services of the south Korean puppet army through the letter of Syngman Rhee on transferring the right to the U.S. forces.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In August 1953, the U.S forced the south Korean regime to conclude the U.S.-south Korea \"mutual defense treaty\", which stipulates that U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is not a duty but a right and all parts of south Korea can be used as U.S. military bases. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In November 1954, it was stipulated in the \"agreement minutes\", the follow-up agreement of the \"mutual defense treaty\", that the south Korean army is under the operational control of \"UN Command\" while it is responsible for defending south Korea, and thus the U.S. provided a legal foundation for maintaining the prerogative of command over the south Korean army for an indefinite period.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the 2000s the above-said issue was brought into bolder relief and there was increasing likelihood of sparking off an anti-U.S. struggle. Consequently, the U.S. was compelled to agree on the matter of transferring the control to south Korea in April 2012.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Later the U.S. instigated the south Korean puppet regime to extend the transfer of the control by 2015. It has desperately worked to re-extend the transfer of the control by pushing the situation to the brink of a war and creating \"security uneasiness\" through various war drills targeted against the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The issue of extending the transfer of the control is not coordinated in a specific manner now that the timetable for the transfer has not been finally confirmed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This clearly reveals the invariable sinister scenario of the U.S. to put under its control the DPRK and its neighboring big powers and Northeast Asia and the rest of the world in the end by persistently taking control over the south Korean puppet army.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces' presence in south Korea is very harmful now that the Cold War was over and the relations among countries in Northeast Asia dramatically changed.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. forces present in south Korea are the root cause of creating constant instability of the situation not only on the Korean peninsula but in the rest of Northeast Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a wise attitude of the U.S. policy makers to make a bold decision to withdraw its forces from south Korea as early as possible."
