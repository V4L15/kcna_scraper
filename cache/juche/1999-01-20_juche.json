            "content": "U.S. will be to blame for kidnapping of DPRK diplomat \r\n\r\n   Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland issued a statement on Tuesday over the kidnapping of a secretary of the DPRK interest section in Berlin and his wife in broad daylight by the South Korean  Agency for National Security Planning (ANSP).\r\n   The statement brands the incident as a product of the premeditated plot of the \"ANSP\" which has long since intrigued against the DPRK mission in Germany systematically. \r\n   The \"ANSP\" infiltrated its agent Choe Chang Dong into the European headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification in the early period of the 1990s.&nbsp; \r\nChoe pretended to be a South Korean resident in Germany and had contact with the DPRK mission in Berlin to hurt DPRK diplomats and commit espionage.\r\n    Having systematically stolen computer files of secretary Kim Kyong Phil through Choe Chang Dong, the \"ANSP\" tenaciously tried to allure and kidnap the secretary with the files as threatening means.\r\n   As the true nature of Choe Chang Dong as an agent of the \"ANSP\" was revealed, the \"ANSP\" embarked upon an operation to kidnap the secretary by disguising Han Hyong Su linked with Choe as a \"businessman.\"&nbsp;\r\n   At 10:00 on January 13, Han Hyong Su, together with three other hooligans, appeared before the Hilton Hotel situated near the DPRK mission aboard a car with the number plate \"B-SS-5787\" and attempted to abduct the secretary in broad daylight.\r\n   As the secretary showed up together with officials of the mission, the Han Hyong Su group were dismayed. Unable to realise their purpose, they handed him an envelope with letters \"working plan\" allegedly for business dealing before fleeing.\r\n   Contained in the envelope were a slip reading \"0172-3123375. Han Hyong Su,\" a catalogue of computer files already stolen, a  letter of blackmail and 1,000 U.S. dollars.\r\n   In the afternoon, the Han Hyong Su group allured the secretary and his wife again before the Hilton Hotel by the same dastardly and wicked means and kidnapped them.\r\n   In the wake of the grave incident, we immediately sent, through Panmunjom liaison channel, to the South Korean authorities a letter carrying principled demand for probe into the truth behind the abduction and reinstatement of our secretary.&nbsp;\r\n   In their shameless and base reply the South Korean authorities said that they had nothing to do with the recent incident, in a bid to flee from the responsibility.\r\n   It is reported that the South Korean abductors interned our secretary for three days for the purpose of taking him to South Korea and that upset by our stern warning, they hurriedly delivered him to the U.S.\r\n   The Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of the Fatherland bitterly denounces the South Korean authorities for abducting our secretary with diplomatic privilege in broad daylight in Germany, a law-governed country, considering the terrorism to be a naked, hostile provocation against the DPRK and wanton violation of human rights and international laws.\r\n   We cannot remain a passive onlooker to the abduction, but will make those responsible for it pay dearly for it.\r\n   Just as a crime deserves punishment, provocation deserves retaliation.\r\n   Now that the U.S. still keeps our secretary abducted by the \"ANSP,\"  we cannot but consider the U.S. to be an accomplice of the abduction.&nbsp; The U.S. is to blame for abducting a secretary of its dialogue partner, in conspiracy with its stooge, behind peace talks with the DPRK. It also will be held responsible entirely for all the consequences arising therefrom.\r\n   If the South Korean authorities and the U.S. want the relaxation of tensions on the Korean peninsula and the improvement of inter-Korean relations, they should stop a heinous act of using our secretary as scapegoat for anti-North campaign and unconditionally reinstate the couple at once. \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "Foreign Ministry spokesman on Japan's hostile policy toward Korea\r\n    Pyongyang, January 20 (KCNA) -- The spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK answered a question put by KCNA on January 20 with the Japanese authorities' hostile acts toward the DPRK getting pronounced as days go by.\r\n   The spokesman said:   The top-level authority and other cabinet members of Japan have never let a chance pass by without describing the launch of artificial satellite in the DPRK as missile launch. They went so far as to threaten to take \"a resolute countermeasure\" in case there is such a launch again, to \"discontinue financial support for the Korean Peninsula Energy Development Organisation (KEDO)\" and send a \"strong warning\" envisaging a \"military option\". They also set up a committee for  measures against major incidents in defence within the government against the DPRK. They are now trying to railroad a bill related to the guidelines for Japan-U.S. defense cooperation through the diet. This proves that they are  busy adjusting their national system allegedly to cope with an emergency. \r\n   This campaign of the Japanese reactionaries is an overt expression of their policy of isolating and stifling the DPRK with the backing of the United States and in concert with the South Korean authorities.\r\n   This is a very dangerous move for their sinister purposes of turning Japan into a military giant and realising overseas expansion. It is a grave threat and challenge to peace and security in Korea and the rest of Asia.\r\n   The Japanese authorities must ponder over the consequences of their campaign and refrain from acting foolishly.\r\n   They regard the payment of their share of expenses for light-water reactors within the framework of the Korean peninsula energy development organisation as a \"gift\" to the DPRK and say their payment depends on whether the DPRK launches a missile or not. This only invites ridicule.\r\n   Japan must know that it is mistaken if it intends to use the payment of its share of expenses for light-water reactors as a bait for any deal in its relations with the DPRK.\r\n   As for satellite and missile, it is absolutely our independent right to develop, test, deploy and launch them. \r\nWhatever others may say, the DPRK has no intention of giving up its legitimate right.\r\n   If Japan continues its anti-DPRK campaign in cooperation with those who are hostile toward the DPRK, the Korean people's anti-Japanese sentiments and fighting spirit will grow stronger and Japan will get nothing but the most catastrophic result. \r\n\r\n"
