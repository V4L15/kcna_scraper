            "content": "\"Sunshine policy\" as hotbed of confrontation and war\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- The South Korean chief executive, upon return home from his foreign tour for \"solicitation diplomacy\", let loose a string of balderdash that the \"sunshine policy\" is \"supported\" not only by the neighboring countries but by the rest of the world and that South Korea is, \"taking the initiative as far as the Korean question is concerned, contrary to the past\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such remarks are nothing but a foolish word juggling to conceal the reactionary nature and falsity of the \"sunshine policy\" and their anti-reunification colors and a clumsy subterfuge to save this policy\" which has become a target of censure, ridicule and criticism from the international community .   The \"sunshine policy\" crafted by the South Korean chief executive  is, in essence, little different from the anti-north confrontation policy of his preceding dictators as his ulterior intention to extend the corrupt anti-social colonial system of South Korea to the North Korea is veiled with the phraseology \"sunshine\" and \"engagement\" used in the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not his own \"coinage\" but a scenario  placed by the United States in his hand.  This is a South Korean version of its \"strategy for peaceful transition\".\r\n   Once the South Korean chief executive said that \"the United States pursued the detente policy toward the Soviet Union which resulted in its collapse and that policy  was an engagement policy\".   He is  racking his brain to disguise his confrontation policy with such glossy words as \"sunshine policy\" and \"engagement policy\" but such a phraseology is a height of mockery and provocation intended to look down upon someone and undress him.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Whether to put on or put off our dress is what we should do and this pertains to our sovereignty. Hence,  such remarks  of the South Korean chief executive are a blatant encroachment upon our sovereignty.   There  will be only confrontation if the \"sunshine policy\" of the South Korean authorities  designed to degenerate the socialist system clashes with our unshakable will to defend socialism to the end. Aware of this, the United States and the South Korean authorities are closely combining the \"sunshine policy\" and war preparations called \"strengthening of security posture\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   All facts indicate that the South Korean authorities' loudmouthed \"sunshine policy\" is a hotbed of confrontation and war on the Korean peninsula.\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan, dangerous entity for aggression\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 12 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun today carries a signed article laying bare the aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries in the legislation for the implementation of the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recalling that with the bills related to these guidelines passed through both houses of representatives and councilors of Japan on April 27 and May 24, a \"bill on the incident in areas surrounding Japan\" called \"law on emergencies in surrounding areas,\" an \"amendment to the law on Japan's 'Self-Defence Forces'\" and an \"amendment to the Japan-U.S. acquisition and cross serving agreement,\"  have been formally legislated, the article says:   This restored Japan's right to belligerency  which had been deprived of when it was defeated in World War II and legalized military overseas aggression of the \"SDF\" which has grown to be the world, strong military forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThis was a principal aim sought by the Japanese reactionaries through this legislation.\r\n   Following this legislation the Japanese reactionaries came to have again the right to belligerency and the right to participate in war  and face no institutional hurdles in putting their ambition for reinvasion into practice.\r\n   The adoption of the legislation has made it possible for Japan to come out in real earnest to realize the  Japanese old dream of the \"Greater East Asia Coprosperity Sphere.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is not difficult to guess how the Japanese militarist forces will move for overseas expansion from now on, having regained the right to belligerency and the right to participate in war  under law.   The adoption of the legislation will give the Japanese reactionaries an opportunity to undertake military actions in any area of the Asia-pacific region, in pursuance of the U.S. aggressive Asia strategy.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is the objective of the United States and Japan to contain, bring under control and  block other big powers by force of arms and establish the sphere of unchallenged domination over the Asia-pacific region.\r\n   Through the legislation the Japanese reactionaries openly proclaimed  Japan's relations with the DPRK as those between the warring states.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   It is nobody's  secret that the  keynote of the conception about the \"emergencies in the areas surrounding Japan\" is the \"emergencies\" on the Korean peninsula and the  primary target of the Japanese reactionaries' military strikes under the \"Japan-U.S. Defence Cooperation Guidelines\" is none other than the DPRK.   What matters is that the Japanese reactionaries have  become so arrogant and reckless as to openly proclaim the relations with the DPRK as  those between the warring parties and overconfident of their militarist strength they have built up so far.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n    The Japanese reactionaries  could go scot-free after taking part in the U.S.'s war of aggression on Korea in the '50s.  But it  might be their last fortune.  This will not happen again.   All the servants who offer bases and supply war materiel as well as bases, to say nothing of the aggressors, will be the target of our strikes.   Our stand toward the aggressors is resolute and our strike is merciless.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   If the Japanese reactionaries keep to the road of reinvasion of Asia, going against the desire of the Asian people for peace and needs of the time,  they will meet a miserable and disastrous setback that cannot be compared with their defeat in the past. \r\n\r\n"

They represent a history of intense loyalty, filial piety and noble obligation  toward the preceding leader, they added.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Kim Jong Il has strengthened and developed the DPRK into a politically, ideologically and militarily powerful country that carries out revolution and construction its own way according to an independent political line and that is imbued with the idea of the red flag despite political and military pressure by big powers, they  stressed. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The  commentary goes on:   They are seriously mistaken.\r\n   As a crow cannot be a white heron, Japan can never become a peace-loving state.\r\n   It is a bad habit of the Japanese reactionaries to tell honeyed words before someone and do something wrong behind the scene.

It is their trite  practice to take issue with others before doing wrong,  the commentary says, and goes on:   The undisguised overseas expansion policy of Japan and its moves  to become a military power and arm itself with nuclear weapons are evoking precaution of the world public and  countries surrounding Japan in particular.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The Japanese  reactionaries are scheming to divert elsewhere the world's attention and caution and conceal their ambition for nukes at any cost.   That is why they are groundlessly raising a hue and cry over the \"suspected development of nuclear, biological and chemical weapons\" of the DPRK.   It is a serious miscalculation if they think they  can achieve their aim by slandering others.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   History will tell who is the chief criminal of the development of massive lethal weapons and bring him to justice.   The Japanese reactionaries are well advised to ponder over what catastrophic consequences their false propaganda against the DPRK will bring to them. \r\n  \r\n"

Minju Joson says this in a commentary today.   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe commentary goes on:   There is no reason for the South Korean authorities to detain unconverted long-term prisoners in South Korea, contrary to the will of the prisoners who demand their repatriation to the north, regardless of their hometowns and origin.\r\n   It condemns the South Korean authorities for insisting  in a far-fetched manner that the unconverted long-term prisoners who want to come to the north should be exchanged for defectors who  refuse to go back to South Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean ruling quarters should take a step to immediately send back all the unconverted long-term prisoners who demand their repatriation to the north, as urged by the north.   The South Korean authorities should know that if something deplorable happens to the unconverted long-term prisoners due to any delay in their repatriation, they will be wholly responsible for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
