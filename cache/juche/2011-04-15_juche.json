Esto fue el credo del Presidente.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Las ideas y teorías, presentadas por él compenetrándose siempre con las masas populares y apreciando la opinión de ellas, constituyeron siempre la bandera de victorias de la revolución coreana contando con apoyo absoluto de ellas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El Presidente se dedicó por entero al cumplimiento de la causa socialista del Juche.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Especialmente, condujo al partido y al Estado a practicar invariablemente la política de amor, confianza y beneficios populares y a los funcionarios a cumplir la línea revolucionaria de masas trabajando con el espíritu de servir abnegadamente al pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Hoy en día, el mejoramiento de las condiciones de la vida del pueblo resulta el punto de partida de las actividades del partido y el Estado y su máximo principio y lo todo se orienta a incrementar la felicidad del pueblo. He aquí el aspecto verdadero del socialismo al estilo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  El noble propósito y la causa del Presidente continúan firmemente y se cumplen hoy en esta tierra gracias al Dirigente Kim Jong Il.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  A su vez, el periódico Minju Joson exhortó a todos a luchar con dinamismo por llevar a feliz término la causa de construcción de la gran potencia próspera socialista y la revolucionaria del Juche, iniciadas por el Presidente, uniéndose con más firmeza en torno al Comité Central del Partido del Trabajo de Corea encabezado por el Dirigente."
