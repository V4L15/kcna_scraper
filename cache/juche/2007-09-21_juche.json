His fervent comradeship gave origin to the revolutionary comradeship along with the Korean revolution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Charmed by his rare love, the young revolutionaries of the new generation regarded the President as the centre of leadership and unity and remained loyal to him in the noble sense of the revolutionary obligation till the last moments of their lives. They thus made the history of unity and cohesion, the source of the inexhaustible strength of the Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the comradeship made in the Korean revolution under the President is creditably carried forward by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Numerous are anecdotes on comradeship created during his long journey for field guidance. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He visited Chol Pass, Mt. Osong, Panmunjom and other places where servicepersons live to help them to feel the pride and honor and had photo session with them in trenches. Looking up to him, they evinced their resolution to live and struggle as eternal Songun revolutionary comrades of the tender-hearted Supreme Commander. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the servicepersons and people successfully concluded the \"Arduous March' and forced march and are now making efforts to build a great prosperous and powerful nation. The credit for this goes to him who took care of and trusted them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today the high level of revolutionary comradeship seen in the DPRK constitutes the foundation of the ideological cohesion and unity prevailing in the whole society and source of the invincible strength of the revolutionary ranks.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

So the unity of the nation is the great premise and main content of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is unbearable national misfortune and tragedy that the Korean nation has been forced to suffer the pain of division for over 60 years, bisected into the north and the south by outside forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The main point in reunifying the country is not certain matters of procedure and method but the achievement of the unity of the whole nation. The main point will be resolved in achieving the   reunification of the country, if the north and the south realize harmony and all the fellow countrymen put their minds together and, on this basis, attain great unity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Achievement of the unity of the nation is the main propelling force and the decisive factor in reunifying the country. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reunification of the country can be successfully achieved only when the whole Korean nation strengthens the internal force of reunification in every way, closely united in one as the force responsible for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reality in the June 15 era of reunification in which the struggle for national reconciliation and unity is developing to a new higher plane under the banner of \"By our nation itself\" eloquently proves the might and vitality of great national unity as the propelling force of the cause of independent reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of the nation can be successfully realized if it advances in close unity, irrespective of idea and system, in conformity with the idea of \"By our nation itself\", the banner of the national unity.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
