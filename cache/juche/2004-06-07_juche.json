            "content": "Publication of June 15 Joint Declaration Termed as Landmark Event \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, June 6 (KCNA) -- The last four years since the publication of the North-South joint declaration are recorded with exciting events which proved that the Songun politics of leader Kim Jong Il has given a strong impetus to the march for reunification and made it yield rich fruits and served as a bright beacon indicating the road to be followed by the Koreans to build a reunified great prosperous powerful nation.\r\n Kim Yong Dae, chairman of the National Reconciliation Council, said this in an article dedicated to the 4th anniversary of the publication of the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the movement for national reunification has reached a higher stage to pave a wide avenue for independent reunification through national cooperation in the idea of \"By our nation itself,\" he continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The last 90s of the 20th century was a period of global turmoil beset with ups and downs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While standing in the confrontation without gunfire with the United States, the DPRK grieved over the sudden demise of President Kim Il Sung, the nation's biggest loss, and, to make things worse, it had to pull through rigorous trials and difficulties due to the consecutive years of natural disasters. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Taking this as the golden chance to stifle the DPRK, the U.S. and its allies further escalated their political pressure, military offensive and economic blockade against it than ever before. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was against this backdrop that Kim Jong Il set out a unique political mode called Songun, something unprecedented in the world history of politics, protecting socialism and the dignity of the nation and paving a wide avenue for national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has frustrated the U.S. frantic moves to stifle the DPRK with the might of Songun and its interference in Koreans' affairs, thus opening a turning phase of national reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With a scientific insight into the situation at home and abroad and the inter-Korean relations developing favorably thanks to his Songun politics, he climbed Mt. Paektu, the holy mountain of the revolution, early in Juche 89 (2000), the turning point in history which witnessed the start of a new millennium, brought his grandiose plan into maturity to open a turning phase in national reunification and thus provided the north-south summit meeting, the first of its kind in the history of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His noble idea of the Songun politics is embodied in the joint declaration the core of which is the idea of \"By our nation itself.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Since the historic Pyongyang meeting a great change has taken place on the Korean peninsula: The nation is heading for reconciliation and unity away from old antipathy and confrontation, he noted, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Jong Il has held aloft the banner of Songun in the efforts to implement the joint declaration, too, thereby barring any foreign forces from standing in the way of the process of implementing the joint declaration externally and leading the Korean nation to vigorously advance along the road of reconciliation, cooperation and reunification internally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has placed the traditional friendly ties with the neighboring countries on a new higher stage with his preeminent diplomacy and improved the DPRK's ties with the West including the European Union and its member countries, thus countering the U.S. siege to the DPRK and creating on his initiative an international environment favorable to the implementation of the joint declaration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Remaining true to his Songun politics alone would bring independence, unity and reunification. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All Koreans who truly love the country and wish the reunification, be they in the north, the south and overseas, should fully support and uphold his Songun politics.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Minju Joson says this in a signed commentary Saturday.\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He has been proud of having lived in Korea through four generations. A decade back he said he would permanently reside in south Korea, even bringing the remains of Underwood I to south Korea from the U.S. He, however, decided to leave south Korea this fall, becoming a topic of public talk. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n His family has carried out on the spot the U.S. policy of aggression towards Korea for nearly 120 years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean people have seen through the aggressive nature of the U.S. imperialists as they have trampled down upon the sovereignty and dignity of the nation while throwing a hurdle in the way of Korea's reunification after dividing the Korean nation against its will. So they are now valiantly turning out in the actions to fully settle accounts with the U.S. This is the reality of south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Very upset by this development, the U.S. is leaving no stone unturned to chill the ever-growing desire of the south Korean people for national independence. It is against this backdrop that Underwood is going to pack his bags, saying he has nothing more to do there. This means he can no longer instill the idea of worshipping and fearing the U.S into south Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Of course, the crimes committed by his family will never be erased even if he leaves south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will never pardon Underwood's family which has acted a guide in U.S. aggression of Korea generation after generation.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has staged war exercises in south Korea after deploying latest offensive weapons and other war means worth 13 billion U.S. dollars for an actual war. This has put the peace and security of the Korean peninsula in a great jeopardy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the U.S. imperialist aggression troops in south Korea that are executing the U.S. adventurous policy of aggression towards the DPRK on the spot. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The aim sought by Harvard in letting loose such a string of balderdash is to justify the U.S. permanent military presence in south Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fiction of the non-existent \"threat from the north\" can never work. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should clearly bear in mind that such outdated farce to serve its aggressive purpose is intolerable and withdraw its aggression troops from south Korea at once as demanded by the unbiased world public opinion.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
