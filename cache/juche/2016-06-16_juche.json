The factory should always remember the noble loving care they had shown for the people for improving the standard of their living all their lives, he added. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Recollecting the day when he visited the factory together with Kim Jong Il, he said that it arranged well the room for the education in the revolutionary history and the room dedicated to its history so that it might convey to posterity the profound loving care shown by the great leaders for the supply of confectionary to the people. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Visiting the room for the education in the revolutionary history alone one may know well about the exploits Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il performed by dedicating themselves to the people and the WPK's policy of developing the food industry, he noted that a lot of historical materials displayed in the room serve as a banner putting spurs to the development of the food industry in the new century and dynamically encouraging its workers in their drive to increase the production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Going round various places of the factory, he learned in detail about its modernization and production.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He said that the factory put all production processes including corn-processing process, millet jelly production process, Oktang sugar production process, cake production process and candy production process on an automated, streamlined, germ- and dust-free basis on a high level and established a strict system for test of quality, thus making it possible to rapidly boost productivity with less manpower and thoroughly ensure the hygienic safety of the products.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Saying that the biggest success registered by the factory in its modernization is that the proportion of locally produced equipment has reached more than 95 percent, he noted that cutting-edge equipment designed and manufactured by the DPRK are running in all production processes from the raw material feeding to packing of products and all of them look nice. The field of food industry has taken the lead in implementing the party's line of locally producing equipment in recent years, he added.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The factory has turned into the one to be proud of against the backdrop of a high-pitched drive for updating production facilities in our own way with local production of equipment as the core sweeping the whole country, he pointed out, pleased that this factory is the one holding high the banner of Juche-orientation, the one worthy of being a model in creating the spirit of self-reliance and self-development and the one teaching how to carry out modernization.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He had a photo session with the officials and employees of the factory.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Accompanying him were Department Director An Jong Su and vice department directors Jo Yong Won and Sin Man Gyun of the WPK Central Committee."

Korea\r\nPyongyang, June 16 (KCNA) -- On June 13 the U.S. nuclear submarine Mississippi entered Pusan Port, south Korea, its first appearance in Asia-Pacific.\n\t\t\t\t\t The sub which was put into commission in 2012 is an up-to-date attack nuclear submarine of the U.S. Navy with the mission of attack and special operations, being equipped with lots of torpedo and cruise missile launching devices.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t During the Key Resolve and Foal Eagle 16 joint military exercises which it staged in south Korea for over 50 days since March, the U.S. mobilized Stennis nuclear carrier, B-52 and B-2 nuclear strategic bombers, F-22A stealth fighters and other huge strategic nuclear attack means, creating a touch-and-go situation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t A spokesman for the Foreign Ministry of the DPRK in a statement on Thursday said:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Two U.S. nuclear subs are constantly cruising in waters in Asia-Pacific around the Korean peninsula and \"precision air raid operation\" against the nuclear facilities and nuclear force of the DPRK is in the process of open preparation in the U.S. The entry of Mississippi to south Korea against this backdrop is a direct threat to the security of the DPRK and peace of the region.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. ceaseless introduction of strategic assets of various kinds to and around the Korean peninsula is rendering the already unstable situation all the more uncontrollable.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The best way of averting a war and ensuring peace on the Korean peninsula, the world's biggest hotspot where there is constant danger of a nuclear war due to the U.S. ceaseless provocations for a new war, is to bolster the DPRK's nuclear deterrence for self-defence in every way.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The line of the Workers' Party of Korea on simultaneously pushing forward economic construction and the building of nuclear force is the most just line for fundamentally removing the danger of a nuclear war created by the U.S. and ensuring peace and security in the region and the rest of the world by dint of the powerful nuclear deterrence.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is sophism for the U.S. to trumpet about making denuclearization a priority while persistently resorting to nuclear blackmail and nuclear war exercises against the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. has to make a policy decision to roll back its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK and withdraw its aggression troops and war means from south Korea, clearly understanding the strategic position of the DPRK that has ranked itself among the nuclear powers and facing up to the trend of the times."

La entrada del portaaviones nuclear norteamericano en el Sur de Corea en tal circunstancia significa la amenaza directa a la seguridad de la RPDC y a la paz de la region. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSenalo asi el portavoz del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea en su declaracion fechada 16 y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe hace cada dia mas incontrolable la situacion inestable de la Peninsula Coreana, debido a la introduccion de los armamentos estrategicos de toda indole de EE.UU. en la Peninsula Coreana y su contorno. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl optimo remedio para prevenir la guerra y preservar la paz en la Peninsula Coreana, zona mas candente del mundo que se encuentra permanentemente en la crisis de guerra nuclear por las incesantes maniobras de provocacion de nueva guerra del imperio americano, es consolidar por todos los medios el disuasivo nuclear de autodefensa de la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa linea del Partido del Trabajo de Corea de desarrollar paralelamente la construccion economica y la de las fuerzas armadas nucleares es la mas justa para eliminar de raiz el peligro de guerra nuclear causado por EE.UU. y preservar la paz y la seguridad de la region y el resto del mundo mediante el fuerte disuasivo nuclear. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. recurre incesantemente al chantaje nuclear y a los ejercicios de guerra nuclear contra la RPDC persistiendo en que es primordial la desnuclearizacion, lo cual es una sofisteria cinica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe abandonar la anacronica politica de hostilidad a la RPDC y tomar la decision politica de retirar sus uniformados y pertrechos de guerra estacionados en el suelo surcoreano teniendo en consideracion la posicion estrategica de la RPDC como avanzada potencia nuclear y la corriente de la epoca."
