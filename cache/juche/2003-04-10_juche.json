            "content": "KCNA urges Japan to behave with discretion \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, April 9 (KCNA) -- Unusually noisy war outcries against the DPRK are heard from Japan after the outbreak of the U.S. Iraqi war.\r\n Naoto Kan, representative of the Japanese Democratic Party, was reported to have asserted, referring to the counter-action in case of emergency, at a seminar in Sapporo on April 5 that Japan should leave the nuclear deterrence to the U.S. and the main job of the self-defence forces is to counter other forms of attacks except nuclear one. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He also said that there is a call in the diet for destroying such a country as North Korea as early as possible. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What should not be overlooked is that his outcries are timed to coincide with the assertion made by Ishiba, director general of Japan  Defence Agency, calling for making a preemptive attack on the DPRK. \r\n An endless string of war outcries in Japan calling for containing the DPRK by force indicates what a dangerous phase the Japanese reactionaries' attempt to stage a comeback to Korea has reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n By counter-action in case of emergency they mean a contingency on the Korean Peninsula, i.e. the second Korean war. \r\n Japan put into orbit two spy satellites and decided to deploy more aegis warships of its maritime self-defence force in waters off the Korean Peninsula, saying that North Korea may take actions to focus the attention of the international community and may launch a missile while the U.S. Iraqi war is under way. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The chief cabinet secretary of Japan even blustered that the strengthened Japan-U.S. tie-up will prove effective in deterring the threat from North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such unprecedentedly reckless military moves of Japan can not but arouse the DPRK's high vigilance as they indicate that Japan is in the process of rounding off its moves to cope with the emergency on the Korean Peninsula at its final stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries have long worked hard to revive militarism through the world's second biggest military spending . They are now keen to make a good use of the Iraqi war and the situation in its surrounding countries for seizing an opportunity to reinvade Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan openly supported state-sponsored terrorism against Iraq perpetrated by the U.S., which is massacring Iraqi people in wanton violation of the UN Charter and defying the world people's opposition to the war. Japan's such loyalty to its master lays bare the sinister intention sought by the Japanese reactionaries to hold their unchallenged position in Asia with ease. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is turning to the right and is getting militarized at such a rapid tempo that the call for destroying the DPRK, a legitimate sovereign state, is heard in the diet. This is a clear indication of the gravity of the situation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries seem to have lost their reason under the impact of the Iraqi war launched by their master. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's attempt to contain the DPRK under the pretext of coping with the emergency, timed to coincide with the nuclear crisis sparked by the U.S. on the Korean Peninsula, will only precipitate its self-destruction. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan should behave with discretion, clearly mindful that it is also within the striking range of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n"

Osong and Mt. Taedok and all other areas of the country to steadily strengthen the army as an invincible one steadfast in ideology, faith and will and equipped with powerful offensive and defensive means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Giving importance to the military affairs definitely guarantees the development of the national economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n With the Songun leadership, he has not only put the country's military power on the highest level but also paved the way for the building of a powerful economy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the period from 1995 to 2001 he gave on-site guidance to 1,300 units, covering some 116,700 kilometres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Last year he spent 79 days in visiting 207 army units and industrial establishments to inspire the servicemen and people in the efforts for the defence of the country's sovereignty and the development and prosperity of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the Songon leadership of the brilliant commander, the first satellite was launched successfully by the Korean people themselves, great achievements have been made in land development and nature-remaking projects and modern factories and enterprises have appeared in different parts of the country. \r\n\r\n"

It is in line with the UN Charter and the humanitarian spirit for Syria to support Iraq whose people are being killed in cold blood by the military attacks perpetrated by the U.S. in violation of the UN and international law. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. military operation against Iraq is a serious state-sponsored terrorism and an infringement upon its sovereignty and human rights. The U.S. thinks it may destroy a sovereign state with its allies as it pleases so as to attain its aim of world domination but other countries should not be allowed to support the victim. What a gangster-like logic. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK extends solidarity to Syria, estimating its principled stand and measure as positive ones for justice and peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. unreasonable pressure, threat and blackmail against Syria will only invite world criticism and denunciation. The U.S. is well advised to stop its anti-Syria campaign.    \r\n\r\n"

They actively support the policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now all out in a struggle to create a new history of independent reunification under the Songun leadership of Kim Jong Il, the sun of the 21st century, blessed with the leader generation after generation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Recalling that the situation on the Korean Peninsula is very complicated and it is reaching a danger line, he said that if the U.S. opts for igniting a war considering North Korea as Iraq, it will not escape a miserable defeat as the north has strong military muscle it has built up under Kim Jong Il's Songun policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean nation will emerge victorious in the confrontation with the U.S. and the U.S. and its followers are bound to sustain setbacks so long as there are Kim Jong Il, the might of the Songun policy and the June 15 joint declaration.

It is better to let him lie on a bed of a mental hospital. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What we would like to say explicitly is that his reckless remarks are not a slip of the tongue but a revelation of the Japanese reactionaries' ambition for reinvasion of the DPRK and an undisguised agitation for a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ishihara's accusation against the DPRK is no more than barking at the moon. If Japanese reactionaries persist in the rash acts to hurt the sentiment and self-confidence of the DPRK, it will only harden the determination of its army and people to take revenge upon Japan and encourage them to wipe out the group of militarists including Ishihara to the last man. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is pity and disgrace for Japan that such lunatic as Ishihara is still on the political arena of Japan.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
