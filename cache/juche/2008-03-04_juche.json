They are, to all intents and purposes, maneuvers for a nuclear war to seize the DPRK by force of arms in light of their scale and nature. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. kicked off the nuclear war maneuvers against its dialogue partner though it has talked about a \"peaceful solution of the nuclear issue\" and the \"establishment of a peace-keeping mechanism on the Korean Peninsula.\" This is a clear indication that the U.S. is invariably sticking to its hostile policy to stifle the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such nuclear threat and blackmail do not work on the DPRK but will only put a brake on the process of the denuclearization of the peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK are following with the highest vigilance the military attempt of the U.S. to gravely threaten the sovereignty of the DPRK and take necessary countermeasures including those to further bolster up all its deterrent forces.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are, at the same time, a warning against the consequences to be entailed by the government's hostile policy towards the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese government would be well advised to come to its senses though belatedly, not lending a deaf ear to the criticism made by lawmakers from the DPJ, and drop its wrong viewpoint and policy towards the DPRK. It is a political and diplomatic mistake and harmful for the Japanese government to stick to the above-said diplomacy toward the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan persists in its hostile policy towards the DPRK, talking nonsense, there will be no thaw in the DPRK-Japan relations now remaining frozen and it will be derided and rejected by the public for being a \"political dwarf.\"    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

And under the guidance of Kim Jong Il, a peerless patriot, there emerged the political and military power dignified for its strong independence and with the might of Songun and our generation has had a privilege to open the gate to a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We should surely glorify the Songun era steered by Kim Jong Il as the heyday of prosperity to be specially recorded in the history of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rare in the world is such nation as the Korean people enjoying much benefit from the state. Just today when one is blessed as much as one dedicates one's strength and wisdom, to display patriotism is a shortcut to creating happiness for oneself. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A patriot in the present times is immediately a hot-blooded person who devotedly safeguards Kim Jong Il while remaining true to the Songun leadership of the Party, a person of self-reliance creating happiness in reliance on his strength, and a true and faithful person reliably keeping his post with high degree of working spirit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article calls upon all the people to lead a worthwhile life as patriots in the Songun era in the course of providing the everlasting red glow of prosperity to the country under the leadership of Kim Jong Il.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

But the Songun politics of the WPK is the only genuine political mode as it most fully reflects the popular masses' desire and aspiration and helps most successfully achieve the independence of the country and nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But for the invincible military power built up under the banner of Songun, the U.S. imperialists would have forced a nuclear war upon the Korean nation long ago and the territory of Korea would have suffered from the thermonuclear war ignited by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is thanks to Songun that the Korean nation is demonstrating its dignity as a strong nation with tremendous military deterrent whom no formidable enemy dares attack. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Songun serves as a motive force instilling true patriotism into the members of the nation and encouraging them to fully display it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Now that the U.S. imperialists are getting more undisguised in their moves to dominate the whole of Korea and its entire nation an attitude towards the Songun politics serves as a touchstone distinguishing patriotism from treachery, concludes the article.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Coincidiendo con estos disparates la capa militar norteamericana aumenta armamentos y libra con frenesi los ejercicios belicos, lo que deviene un abierto desafio a la desnuclearizacion y la paz de la Peninsula Coreana. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nTodos los hechos demuestran claramente que EE.UU. no tiene ni en lo minimo la idea de renunciar su politica hostil a Corea y que el \"dialogo\", el \"fin del armisticio\" y la \"desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana\", de que los yanquis hablan tanto, no pasan de ser una farsa astuta para encubrir su preparacion de guerra nuclear, desarmarnos y enganar la opinion publica del mundo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEl ejercito coreano no esperaba beneficios algunos que emanen del dialogo con EE.UU. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nSi EE.UU. y las fuerzas belicistas del Sur de Corea tratan de llevar a efecto su intento de aplastarnos militarmente, el EPC les respondera no con la defensa pasiva sino con el iniciativo golpe de disposicion movilizando todos los medios preparados costosamente durante largo tiempo. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nEE.UU. y sus perseguidores asumiran la entera responsabilidad de todas las consecuencias que emanen de ello.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

McCain\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Igualmente, se trasladaron a la base aerea de Osan y al aeropuerto de Kunsan del Sur de Corea los cazabombarderos \"F-15\" y \"F-16\", el avion de asalto \"F/A-18\", el avion de operacion especial \"MC-130\" y el avion nodriza \"KC-135\" procedentes de las bases en el territorio norteamericano y en ultramar. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Mientras tanto, estan dispuestas a sumarse a esos simulacros las fuerzas navales y aereas de EE.UU. desplegadas en las aguas maritimas y zonas aledanas a la Peninsula Coreana incluidos Japon y la isla Guam. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Aparte de esas colosales fuerzas armadas de EE.UU., entraron junto con la alarma de emergencia en la disposicion de combate las fuerzas terrestres, navales y aereas, el cuerpo de marines, el \"Ejercito de Reserva Local\", la policia, los organismos administrativos, los principales complejos belicos y civiles del Sur de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nA traves de los ejercicios militares \"Key Resolve\" y \"Aguilucho\", las tropas norteamericanas y el ejercito surcoreano pretenden ejercitar para la eventual guerra coreana el desplazamiento, el despliegue, la formacion de las unidades combinadas y las operaciones de tropas especiales en el Norte de Corea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  Debido a esas desenfrenadas maniobras belicas, en la Peninsula Coreana se da una situacion extremadamente peligrosa.     \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
