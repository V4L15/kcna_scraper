The much touted \"freedom\" in the capitalist society is, however, nothing but sheer hypocrisy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The toiling masses cannot enjoy genuine freedom in the capitalist society as they are completely excluded from independent political life and the management of state affairs. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The above-said advocates claim that state power organs are set up in the capitalist countries through election, but it is only rich capitalists and their henchmen that hold political power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"freedom\" of thought much publicized by the imperialists is only aimed at suppressing the progressive ideas and spreading reactionary bourgeois ideas in the capitalist society. The progressive thoughts are bound to become the target of merciless suppression in the capitalist countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature of the capitalist system itself clearly proves that genuine freedom can never be guaranteed in the capitalist society. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n People in the capitalist society regard it as their top goal to seek their own interests.
