            "content": "Kim Jong Il Goes round Programs Displayed at National Program Contest and Exhibition \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- General Secretary Kim Jong Il went round programs displayed at the 18th national program contest and exhibition. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was greeted on the spot by Paek Chon Ho, vice-president of the State Academy of Sciences, Ryu Sun Ryol, rector of the College of Information Science and Technology of Kim Chaek University of Technology, and officials concerned. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Displayed there were many programs developed by universities including Kim Il Sung University, Kim Chaek University of Technology and the University of Science, the Pyongyang Information Centre, the Central Scientific and Technological Information Agency and other institutes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Being briefed on the contest and exhibition, he looked round exhibits for a long while to acquaint himself in detail with the performance of programs and their development. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Watching the programs that have reached a world level, he expressed great satisfaction over the fact that scientists and technicians have developed a lot of new and efficient programs conducive to developing the nation�fs programming technology and carrying out its technical revolution. He highly appreciated their successes and extended warm greetings to all the participants. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Programming technology has made rapid progress in a brief span of time thanks to the great creative enthusiasm and ingenuity of our scientists and technicians intensely loyal to the party and the revolution, he said, adding that this signal success is a striking demonstration of the validity and great vitality of the party's line of attaching importance to science and technology and a shining fruition of the primary attention paid to the work for training computer talents in particular. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is of weighty importance to develop the programming technology as required by the age of science and technology and the age of computer, he noted, setting forth highly important tasks which would serve as guidelines for further developing the programming technology. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He said that computer, the basis of modern science and technology, has now developed to be an all-purpose information processing device capable of processing a huge volume of information, thus becoming an indispensable means for people�fs work and life. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Computer institutes and training centres have been built in different parts of the country and many able computer experts and technicians have been trained under the leadership of the party, he said, noting that the solid material and technological foundation that has been laid to develop computer technology by leaps and bounds constitutes a precious asset for accelerating the building of a great prosperous powerful nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Underscoring the need to continue directing big efforts to the development of computer technology as it plays an important role in developing and using ultra-modern science and technology, he stressed that the state should push ahead with this work in a coordinated manner under a long-term plan and more thoroughly establish the system for training reserves for the purpose of strengthening technological forces and reinforcing the material means. He also called on the educational institutions to conduct effective computer education among students from their early years. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  If programming technology is to pay off in making the national economy more Juche-oriented, modern and scientific, it is necessary to advance the computer industry of our style and develop many more programs urgently required by us, he said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koreans can go ahead of others in the computer field, too, as they are clever and intelligent, he noted, expressing great expectation and belief that all fields and units would bring about a new turn in developing the programming technology in order to put into practice the plan and intention of the party to put the nation�fs science and technology on a world level in the shortest span of time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He met with the scientists and technicians who have contributed to developing computer technology, highly appreciated their feats and had a photo session with them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n He was accompanied by Choe Thae Bok and Kim Ki Nam, secretaries of the Central Committee of the WPK, Ri Kwang Ho and Jang Song Thaek, its department directors, and Ju Kyu Chang, its first vice department director.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "Japan Assailed for Seeking \"Triangular Cooperation Mechanism for Pressure\" \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, January 21 (KCNA) -- The Japanese ruling quarters are now crying out for \"boosting the solidarity among Japan, the U.S. and south Korea\" as evidenced by the hectic junkets made by them to their \"allies\" in a bid to find a package solution to the abduction issue and the nuclear issue through a \"triangular cooperation mechanism for pressure.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This comes under fire by a signed commentary of Rodong Sinmun Monday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It observes: Japan seems to pin a great hope on the above-said mechanism in achieving its sinister political aim. This is, however, nothing but the way of thinking of a bat-blind person who has neither political sense nor judgment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said cooperation mechanism had been sought by its master the U.S. as early as in the 1980s only to meet bitter frustration. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a ridiculous and foolish daydream for Japan to try to build the above-mentioned mechanism, taking advantage of the changed political situation in south Korea, in a bid to pressurize someone and achieve its sinister political aim. This only betrays Japan�fs ignorance of the DPRK, diplomatic inability and anachronistic way of thinking. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is another point in Japan�fs policy and behavior that draws a serious attention. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is persistently seeking its Self-Defence Forces�f advance and operation overseas under the pretext of \"cooperation in the U.S. war on terror.\" This is eloquently proved by the enactment of the new special anti-terrorism law. The Japanese reactionaries have become so emboldened as to make no scruple of doing anything they like. As seen above, their frantic militaristic moves for reinvasion have reached an extremely dangerous stage. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Should these moves be connived at and overlooked, it would create a catastrophic situation and bring a horrible disaster to the world. Japan's moves to build such mechanism are closely related to its reactionaries' scenario for militaristic reinvasion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to drop its daydream and stop doing such foolish an act as dropping an axe on its own foot. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

National reunification precisely means independence and vice versa. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history of the movement for national reunification proves eloquently that national independence is the main stand that should be maintained by the Koreans. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The more persistently the foreign forces and their followers have resorted to intervention moves and treacherous dependence on outsiders, the more steadfastly and dynamically the Party and government of the DPRK have maintained the stand of independence and advanced the national reunification movement along the road of national independence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The vitality and might of national independence is being more strikingly displayed in the June 15 era of reunification in which the independent reunification movement of the Korean nation has been put on a new high stage of history. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Koreans have keenly realized through history and reality that national independence serves as the lifeline of the national reunification movement and the only way for reunification and survival of the nation is to firmly keep the independent stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Today it is the unshakable determination and will of the Korean nation to advance toward the independent reunification and peace and prosperity invariably holding the banner of \"By our nation itself\".    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
