Trust and morality and helping each other make the world beautiful. I couldn't remain a passive onlooker to what Lee Myung Bak has done quite contrary to them.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He deplored in the preface of the book that \"in the era of MB (Myung Bak) morality collapsed and the people are in serious despair.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The book having seven chapters branded Lee Myung Bak as a liar, former convict, real estate speculator, the worst \"president\" and retrogressive bodhisattva. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In the sub-title of the book \"It's like preaching to rat's ears,\" the author wrote: \"When I was keen to find out what was the worst trouble in my house, I learned it was exactly a rat. It was good for nothing as it stole rice. It was none other than Lee Myung Bak\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He continued: \"Lee is not a local rat but the rat from the U.S. as it is steeped in pro-Americanism to the marrow of its bones.\" \"Let water run into the rathole.\" \"MB is ill-famed for lack of face, shamelessness and impudence. What MB says is not worth even a penny. He had better sell mung bean pancake at South Gate after his dethronement and society in which the president tells lies is bound to go to ruin.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The book vividly reflects the mind-set of the angry south Koreans.  It warns Lee Myung Bak, the rat, is fated to drown in the rathole full of water."
