The \"Coordinated Diplomacy and Trade Committee\" and the \"Educational  Committee\" of the \"National\r\nAssembly\" urged the \"government\" to take measures to defend Tok Islet and, at the same time, strongly react to Japan's moves to distort the history textbooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Democratic Workers' Party demanded the \"government\" expel the Japanese ambassador from south Korea, suspend various forms of talks and exchanges with the Japanese authorities and institute a special law on defending the islet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"Uri Party\" held an emergency \"general meeting of national assemblymen\" on March 17 at which it made public a resolution denouncing the reckless moves of Japan.\r\n Meanwhile, north Kyongsang provincial authorities at a press conference on March 16 announced measures to defend Tok Islet and declared the severance of the sister ties with Shimane Prefecture.

This is one more open challenge and provocation to the sincere efforts of the DPRK for the six-party talks and a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue as it is a clear evidence of the U.S. accelerated preparations for a preemptive attack on the DPRK.\r\n This is what Rodong Sinmun says in its commentary Tuesday. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The news analyst goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is working to hasten the qualitative reinforcement of its forces present in south Korea and carry into practice its scheme to invade the DPRK by a preemptive attack with task forces involving new latest weapons and medium-and long-range offensive means. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having replaced the existing military strategy based on the ground force with a long-range strike strategy based on the task force, the United States is scheming to round off on its extension line the reorganization of the U.S. forces in south Korea two years earlier than schedule. This is patent proof that the Bush forces are afire with the wild ambition for a war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S has reached so grave stage in its aggressive strategy as it is working hard to hold unrivaled military predominance by boosting the strategic and mobile attack forces and long-range operation capability to an unprecedented level in and around south Korea and, on this  basis, stifle the DPRK by force of arms and seize military initiative in Northeast Asia. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nFor this reason south Korea finds itself in a dangerous phase where it may be embroiled into regional disputes in its surroundings and international armed conflicts at any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its reckless war gamble right away, clearly aware that the reorganization of forces and war moves against the DPRK which drive the situation to confrontation and brink of a war are acts of self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It goes on:\r\n The U.S. hostile policy toward the DPRK is a policy of state-sponsored terrorism. Lurking behind it is a sinister design to seize the whole Korean Peninsula and thus lay a firm springboard from which to realize its Asia strategy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is also a policy of aggression to stifle and dominate the latter by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is the real intention of the U.S. to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nThe U.S. aggressive plan to realize the intention has been already completed. It has huge aggressor armed forces with high mobility and great striking power in place and has made full preparations for a war through different forms of war drills. The only thing to be done by the U.S. is just to find a pretext for invading the DPRK. The nuclear issue may be used by it as a fuse to ignite the war. It was the U.S. that spurned the nuclear issue between the DPRK and the U.S. The former's deterrent is for self-defence to all intents and purposes. The U.S. imperialists have incessantly kicked up a row of nuclear threat, beefing up their aggressor forces after designating the DPRK as the target of their nuclear attack. In consequence, the situation in the Korean Peninsula is so tense that a nuclear war may break out there any moment. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Disclosing the policy pursued by the U.S. imperialists against the reunification of Korea, dead-set against the inter-Korean reconciliation and unity, cooperation and exchange, the article says that their hostile policy toward the DPRK that goes against the desire of the Korean nation and the trend of the times can never be tolerated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Any Korean should not remain a passive on-looker to the U.S. imperialists' moves against the DPRK and reunification at a time when the U.S. is going wild in its attempt to hurt the destiny of the Korean nation, the article concludes.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 22 (KCNA) -- The commander of the U.S. second division in south Korea when interviewed by the Stars and Stripes recently said that the majority of his division would be converted into a combat division with increased air and artillery power by this summer strong enough to execute a long-range operation single-handedly.\r\n He disclosed that one combat brigade equipped with heavy weapons has already been organized and there has begun the work to create a multi-mission air brigade, adding that a battalion-size special unit is expected to emerge within a few months to come. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This would drastically increase the strike and mobile capability of the division and turn it into a super division, the first of its kind in the world, as it would be equipped with preemptive nuclear strike means which earned an ill-fame as up-to-date lethal weapons in the Iraqi and Afghan wars. \r\n This clearly proves that the reorganization of the division is a very dangerous military step to convert it into one capable of mounting a more rapid and accurate preemptive attack on the DPRK, ensure its qualitative military edge and contain the DPRK by force. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. has reorganized its forces more than once. But this reorganization has neither led to drastically reducing its forces in south Korea nor resulted in easing tension and bringing peace to Korea. Every reorganization farce offered an opportunity of reinforcing its troops, raising their qualitative level and escalating the war moves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. intends to form independent infantry, air force, engineering and artillery brigades under the pretext of the renewed \"reorganization\". It also seeks to convert the division, nearly half of its forces in south Korea, into a super division with strong air and artillery power. This indicates fresh forward-deployment and beefing up of its troops to preempt an attack on the DPRK at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These moves of the U.S. are one more open challenge and a serious provocation against the Koreans who have exerted sincere efforts for the detente on the Korean Peninsula and a peaceful solution to the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Aggression and war are what keeps the U.S. alive. By stepping up the reorganization of the forces in south Korea the U.S. seeks a foolish aim to enhance their capability to expand the scope of operation to areas around the Korean Peninsula any moment, going beyond the boundary of the DPRK, and thus hold military supremacy in Northeast Asia.\r\n Northeast Asia is a key front and region for the U.S. in implementing its strategy to dominate the world in the 21st century. That's why the U.S. bellicose forces are desperately working to reorganize all their forces in south Korea including the division and convert them into modern forces for mobile and long-range operations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n These facts show how just the DPRK was when it had access to nuclear weapons. This proves that its nukes serve as strong deterrent for preventing the outbreak of a new war in the Korean Peninsula and the rest of Northeast Asia and preserving peace there. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is gravely mistaken. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should clearly understand that the reorganization of its troops and its moves to provoke a war against the DPRK will invite its self-destruction as they would push the situation to confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It should not reorganize its troops but withdraw them from south Korea to the last man at an early date and stop at once its reckless arms buildup and joint military exercises against the north.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

They are now taking all necessary steps including bolstering of its nuclear arsenal to cope with the extremely dangerous moves of the United States.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
