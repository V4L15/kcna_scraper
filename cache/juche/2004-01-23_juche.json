The time has come to settle a final account with the U.S. trying to bring disasters of nuclear war to the Korean peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The five-point task is to fully demonstrate the dignity of the Korean nation on the basis of its superiority, positively realize national cooperation, dynamically wage a sacred anti-U.S. patriotic struggle, thoroughly implement the June 15 North-South Joint Declaration and uphold the great Songun politics. It is the most key and essential issue to win victory in the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle for reunification this year. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Our nation-first spirit is the banner of victory in the drive to carry out the task. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson says that the 5-point task and the proposal for implementing it is a patriotic initiative to defend the peace of the country and pave a wide avenue for independent reunification.     \r\n  \r\n\r\n\r\n"

The danger of war is increasing in different regions and countries and peace is seriously threatened due to the moves of the U.S. imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Imperialists never give up aggression and war.\r\n Peace can be provided only when all the peace-loving people of the world who value independence turn out as one to wage a resolute and stubborn struggle against the aggression and war policy of the imperialists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is important for the popular masses of all the countries to allow no aggression and war of the imperialists, halt their arms race and arms build-up and wage a firm struggle to drive their military bases and aggression troops out of other countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The unity of the popular masses of all countries is a decisive guarantee for strengthening their position and enhancing their role as the main force of the peace movement. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the progressive forces and peace-loving people of the world should unite under the anti-imperialist and anti-war banner for peace to jointly counter the increasing moves of the U.S.-led imperialists for aggression and war and make a collective counterattack on the imperialists in all regions where their tentacles of aggression have reached. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n For the popular masses of all countries aspiring after independence and peace, to firmly maintain the anti-imperialist stand for independence is the basic demand for the unity of the peace-loving forces and the main guarantee for them to enhance their role as the driving force of the peace movement to more successfully wage the anti-war struggle for peace. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people will in the future, too, unite with the popular masses of all the countries under the anti-imperialist and anti-war banner for peace to stage an energetic struggle against the moves of the imperialists for aggression and war in defence of peace in Asia and the rest of the world.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

            "content": "KCNA Comments on Japan's Move for \"New Defence Program\"\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, January 22 (KCNA) -- The Japanese government decided to introduce the MD system and has planned to fundamentally examine the readjustment of defence power and the existence mode of the \"Self-Defence Forces\" and map out a \"new defence program\" this summer.\r\n The \"guidelines on re-examination of defence power\" decided at a recent security council meeting and a ministerial meeting of the Japanese government set forth the policy to counter the \"new threat\" of terrorism and missiles and further strengthen defence power for \"peace and security of the international community.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is said that the \"SDF\" will change into an organization for multi-purpose operations including the \"activities for international cooperation\" besides the defence of Japan. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Such movement clearly shows the political reality of Japan putting spur to the moves to become a military power and set out on overseas aggression. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan is now actively pushing ahead with the moves to become a military power, pursuant to the U.S. move to establish the MD system. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's Defence Agency is about to get a budget of 800 billion ~ 1 trillion yen for the maintenance of interceptor missiles Patriot-3 and Aegis missiles to establish the MD network. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan keeps dispatching the \"SDF\" overseas under the pretext of war against terrorism and, in particular, sending heavily armed troops of the \"SDF\" to the Iraqi war field under the signboard of assistance to post-war reconstruction of Iraq. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's move to work out the \"new defence program\" this year is intended to fix by law the present political reality, in which Japan is setting out on the road of overseas expansion with the backing of the U.S. indulged in hegemonic high-handed practices after the September 11 incident and lay a foundation to erase the article banning war in the \"peace constitution\" and change it into a war constitution. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Phrases \"coping with the new threat\" and \"activities for international cooperation\" are nothing but a camouflage to legalize the arms buildup of Japan and overseas aggression of the \"SDF.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is proved by the fact that Japan has escalated the position and mission of the \"SDF\" for \"international cooperation\" while intending to deploy a long-distance transport plane and large transport ship for overseas dispatch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n All the facts indicate that the final target of the \"new defence program\" is to convert the \"SDF\" equipped with latest military hardware into the elite aggression force capable of performing overseas mobile military operations worldwide. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Asian countries and the international community are standing guard over Japan's move to officially change its defence policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If Japan hastens the move to become a military power and the way of reinvasion, overheated by its ambition for militaristic overseas expansion in the new century instead of liquidating its blood-stained history of aggression on Korea and other Asian countries, it would precipitate its final destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
