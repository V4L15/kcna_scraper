Hurled into the war drills now under way across south Korea are huge aggression troops enough to fight a war according to the mode of an actual war to invade and seize the DPRK all of a sudden.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This large-scale saber-rattling kicked off by the U.S. in the wake of patronizing and instigating hideous hostile acts of the south Korean puppet regime to hurt the dignity of the supreme leadership of the DPRK is an undisguised military provocation.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t In recent years the U.S. staged big joint military drills more often and in more intensive manner, pursuant to its new defense strategy to contain the DPRK and countries around it by force. The core of the new defense strategy calls for shifting the strategic focus to the Asia-Pacific region and putting Asia under control through massive arms buildup and military blackmail.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Its primary target is to bring down the DPRK by force and use the whole Korean Peninsula as a springboard for realizing the strategy to dominate Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The prevailing situation requires the DPRK to bolster up the war deterrent physically and goes to prove that it was entirely just when it determined to fully reexamine the nuclear issue. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK's war deterrent serves as a just means for retaliation as it is capable of mercilessly punishing any aggressors no matter where they are on this earth.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an all-powerful treasured sword for protecting the sovereignty of the country and a powerful means for deterring the war on the Korean Peninsula. It also provides a firm guarantee for concentrating efforts on economic construction and the improvement of people's living standard.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is a stark reality on the peninsula that talking alone cannot prevent a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The arms of the country guarantee its peace and prosperity.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. would be well advised to face up to the situation and roll back at once its anachronistic hostile policy toward the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. persistent pursuance of its invariable hostile policy would only precipitate its miserable end.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is the firm will of the army and people of the DPRK to counter the aggressors' preemptive firing with deadly counter-actions and achieve the country's reunification through this decisive war."

En este entrenamiento que se desarrolla en toda la extension del Sur de Corea con denso olor a la polvora, se movilizan enormes fuerzas agresoras, capaces de cumplir una guerra entera, segun el plan de guerra trazado para tomar la RPDC mediante la invasion sorpresiva.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRechazamos categoricamente esa abierta provocacion militar cometida por EE.UU. poco despues de que defendiera y promoviera un tremendo acto hostil a nuestra maxima dignidad, ideado por la camarilla titere surcoreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn estos dias, EE.UU. realiza en la Peninsula Coreana con mas frecuencia y de modo mas intenso los ejercicios militares de gran dimension con el objetivo de controlar con las fuerzas a la RPDC y otros paises vecinos segun su nueva estrategia de defensa nacional. Trasladar su enfoque estrategico a la region de Asia-Pacifico y dominar a Asia a traves del aumento de fuerzas armadas y chantaje militar, he aqui la esencia de la nueva estrategia de defensa nacional de EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa primera meta de EE.UU. es aplastar con la fuerza a la RPDC y tomar toda la Peninsula Coreana como trampolin para el cumplimiento de su estrategia de dominar a Asia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de hoy nos demanda fortalecer fisicamente el disuasivo de guerra y demuestra que fue mil veces justa nuestra decision de revisar generalmente el problema nuclear.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro disuasivo de guerra es un justo medio de venganza capaz de castigar implacablemente a los agresores persiguiendolos a cualquier rincon del planeta.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAdemas, es el medio omnipotente para defender la soberania del pais y frenar la guerra en la Peninsula Coreana y la garantia que nos permite concentrar en la construccion economica y el mejoramiento de los niveles de la vida del pueblo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNo se puede impedir la guerra con palabras, esto es la realidad irrefutable de la Peninsula Coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNuestro fusil garantiza la paz y la prosperidad.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe ver correctamente la realidad y cancelar inmediatamente su anacronica politica hostil a la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSi EE.UU. sigue recurriendo a su caduca politica hostil, sufrira un fin tragico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResponder al primer fuego de los agresores con el contraataque demoledor y extenderlo a la sagrada guerra para la reunificacion de la patria, esto es la inconmovible voluntad de nuestro ejercito y pueblo."
