Korean Ministry of Unification under Fire\r\n Pyongyang, September 19 (KCNA) -- The exercise for \"stabilizing the north\" staged by the U.S. and the south Korean warmongers in August was reportedly spearheaded by the south Korean Ministry of Unification. This is a very serious action which can never go overlooked, observes Minju Joson Sunday in a signed commentary.\n\t\t\t\t\t By taking an active part in the large-scale war exercise for the invasion of the north and spearheading the \"stabilization\" exercise, far from putting an end to its moves for confrontation with compatriots, the Ministry of Unification brought to light its warlike nature, the commentary says, and goes on:.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The sincere and consistent efforts made by the DPRK side for reconciliation and unity of the nation and its independent reunification have failed to pay off. The ministry is mainly to blame for this as it has run amuck to harm the compatriots even though it claims to be in charge of the issues between the north and the south.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It was only recently that the ministry made delayed publication of initiative measures taken by the DPRK side for reconciliation and cooperation of the nation in a bid to prevent them from being known to the south Korean people. It, therefore, came under strong fire by the public opinion. But the coteries of the ministry tried hard to bar the inter-Korean relations from making improvement, talking about \"sincerity\" and \"precondition\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The ministry did only treacherous acts challenging the desire and wish of the nation as evidenced by its act of spearheading the above-said exercise and speaking ill of the DPRK-proposed measures supported by the people.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The clan of the ministry had better come to its senses though belatedly, apologize for the war exercise for \"stabilizing the north\" before the nation and immediately stop its moves for confrontation with compatriots."
