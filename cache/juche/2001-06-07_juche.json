He was concerned for the time to give the breast to her baby. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There were two breaks in the not so long meeting. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is also an anecdote about the taste of bean curd. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n While giving on-the-spot guidance to north hwanghae province one year, he told an official to buy bean curd at a grocer's shop. attentively examining bean curd bought by the official, the president was not pleased with it, saying that the quality was not good and that it was very bad to make it in a slipshod manner simply because people do not complain of its quality. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Tasting boiled bean curd at a supper time, he underscored the need to improve the quality of foodstuffs for the people.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

It is reckless, indeed, for the U.S. to contemplate the deployment of aegis ships in Korea at a time when the hostile relations between the DPRK and the U.S. have reached a point of explosion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist bellicose elements assert that their deployment of aegis ships in waters close to the DPRK, a \"dangerous state,\" is aimed to deter its \"missile attack.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is, however, nothing but sophism to justify their deployment on the East Sea of Korea under such an absurd pretext. Their true aim is to threaten the DPRK by force of arms and thus mobilize a lot of missiles any moment to take a preemptive strike at it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK's principled stand and mode of counteraction are very just. It is the revolutionary determination of our army and people to meet the challenge of the aggressors with a thousand-fold deadly strike. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n War provocateurs will have to pay a very high price. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialist bellicose elements are well advised to ponder over the grave consequences to be entailed by their adventurous behaviour.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
