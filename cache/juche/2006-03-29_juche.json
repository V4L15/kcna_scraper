They have kicked off a row after publishing and distributing even booklets on the \"abduction issue\". &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said racket kicked off by them against such backdrop goes to clearly prove that their hostile moves against the DPRK have gone to extremes.\r\n This is nothing but an escalation of the anti-DPRK reckless hostile moves stepped up by the Japanese ultra-right conservatives in collusion with the U.S., an indication of their frantic pursuance of its line. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has clarified more than once that it will regard any sanctions against it as a declaration of war and take a corresponding measure for self-defence. \r\n The Korean people regard the country's sovereignty as their life and soul and will never allow anyone to infringe upon it even a bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan would be well advised to bear in mind that the above-said behavior of Japan will only lead to its self-destruction.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

This is an unpardonable insult, sinister slander and provocation to the dignified DPRK.\r\n Minju Joson today observes this in a signed commentary. It says:\r\n As soon as it took office, the Bush administration newly adopted its nuclear strategy focused on the DPRK and started posing undisguised threat of nuclear attack against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under such situation where the U.S.-threatened preemptive nuclear attack was impending in actuality, the DPRK had no other option but to make a bold decision to build nuclear armed forces for self-defence. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The six-party talks, hailed by countries concerned and other countries as the most suitable way for settling the nuclear issue of the Korean Peninsula, could be provided thanks to the DPRK's initiative step. The adoption of the September 19, 2005, joint statement, too, was attributable to its principled and sincere pursuit and efforts.\r\n At the crucial moment when both sides were to move in actuality toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula, the United States took financial sanctions against the DPRK under such unreasonable pretexts as \"counterfeit notes\" and \"money laundry\". Meanwhile, it is playing cheap tricks to shift the blame for the deadlocked six-party talks on to the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. calculates that its aims will be attained if it throttles the DPRK, binding it hand and foot. \r\n But, it is the DPRK's traditional way of struggle to make head-on breakthrough. The U.S. must be well aware of what it means.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Authorities' Collusion with Foreign Forces \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, March 28 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Tuesday runs a signed article on the beginning of the large-scale RSOI and \"Foal Eagle\" joint military exercises under the simulated conditions to invade the north in south Korea on March 25. The Korean nation cannot pardon the south Korean warhawks to play with fire for a war of aggression in collusion with foreign forces, going against the trend of the June 15 era of reunification, the article says, and goes on: \r\n To stage joint military exercises with foreign forces is a treacherous act of hampering national reconciliation and unity and bedeviling the north-south relations. \r\n The south Korean authorities are staging the military drills with the United States despite our strong opposition and warning. This shows that they are seeking cooperation with outside forces, not national cooperation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If they persist in cooperation with outside forces for a war, ignoring the basic spirit of the June 15 joint declaration, reconciliation, unityï¿½Ccooperation and exchange between the north and the south cannot be smooth and the movement for national reunification cannot but undergo turns and twists. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The worsening of inter-Korean relations will not benefit the south Korean authorities themselves. If the inter-Korean relations are bedeviled, tourism to Mt. Kumgang is blocked and visit to Pyongyang stopped, they will be condemned by the south Korean people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Their staging of the joint military exercises with outside forces is a foolish act of exerting disasters of war upon themselves. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They have launched the war drills after agreeing upon the issue of \"strategic flexibility\" of the U.S. forces in south Korea as demanded by the U.S., which is pushing the U.S. imperialist warmaniacs buoyed up by their ambition for invasion of the north to confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. imperialists ignite a war against the north, south Korea will never avoid catastrophic disasters caused by it. The south Korean authorities' continuing to join the U.S. in the joint military exercises without the stand of national independence is an act of lifting an axe only to drop it on their own feet. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean warhawks will get nothing but disgrace and ruin in participating in the war exercises against the north in conspiracy with foreign forces. They should act with discretion, mindful of this.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"

In this connection Pyongyang suggested Washington to let the former open an account in an American bank with a view to fully settling the \"issue of counterfeit notes\" and set up a non-permanent consultative mechanism between the two countries to specialize in handling the problem that may surface in the future, too. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Bush administration, however, was reluctant to give a clear answer to it and made a negative approach. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK has so far approached all talks on its own initiative from an independent and positive stand. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It would be more convenient for the Bush administration to look into an account of the DPRK in a bank operating in the U.S. than probing the DPRK's alleged use of \"counterfeit notes\" by taking so much trouble of traveling as far as Macao and some countries. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK made the above-said offer to relieve the Bush administration of such trouble and settle the \"issue of counterfeit notes\" in a transparent manner.
