This is an intolerable challenge to the sovereignty and dignity of the DPRK.

It is presumed that Japan burned the dead bodies in order to cover up the causes of their death such as pneumonia, pulmonary tuberculosis, contusion and asphyxiation as they might bring to light the cruel working conditions at that time.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Korean victims underwent such bitter sufferings that no other nation of the world has ever experienced. The Japanese imperialists perpetrated such hideous crime against humanity to prevent the world people from knowing the truth about the death of Korean draftees.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt was only a few days ago when it was disclosed that Japan left the remains of Koreans, who met grievous deaths at the hands of the Japanese imperialists, inside the pit faces as they were and in other places uncared for, refusing to hand them over to their relatives and bereaved families in their hometowns. The recent disclosure of the truth about the cremation of Koreans has again lashed people into greater fury.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMost of those persons fell miserable victim to the Japanese imperialists that planned the war of aggression against the Asian continent and set up a fascist war mobilization system.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists conducted a wholesale operation to exploit and fleece manpower in Korea, considering all of Koreans as targets of the \"Law on Compulsory Labor.\" They forcibly took Koreans to sites of drudgery or hurled them to war shambles, driving them to death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMore than 8.4 million young and middle-aged Koreans were taken to the above-said sites and war shambles after being forcibly drafted by the Japanese imperialists in Korea. Even women, boys aged 8 and 60 years old men were forced to do slave labor under the name of \"Volunteers Corps\" and \"Patriotic Laborers' Corps\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese imperialists did not take even elementary labor protection measures for Korean laborers engaged in the most dangerous work, thus forcing many of them to meet tragic deaths in group. Those Koreans starved to death or were buried to death in the collapsed pits or beaten to death. No one knows how many Koreans met such grievous death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThey were even disgraced after their death.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan, however, has so far persistently evaded the responsibility to redeem its past crimes, far from making apology and reparation for those hideous crimes against humanity. What is more intolerable is that it has craftily worked to keep those crimes buried into oblivion.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe Japanese authorities have worked hard to evade the responsibility to make apology and reparation to Korea, the biggest victim of the crimes committed by the Japanese imperialists, even though more than six decades have passed since their defeat. They are painting Japan as \"a victim\" and kicking up an anti-DPRK racket, stoking bitterness toward it. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tThe political chicanery such as distortion of history to which the Japanese reactionaries are persistently resorting at present, while shunning the settlement of Japan's past is little different from what Imperial Japan did to cover up its crimes at any cost.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapan is a brazen-faced country as it has refused to make reparation though so many years have elapsed since it inflicted indescribably huge human, material and mental damage to Korea and its people throughout its history.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tIt is challenging the Korean people shaking with bitter grudge and resentment at it, persistently refusing to admit its past crimes. They will certainly force the Japanese reactionaries to pay a high price for the blood shed by their brothers and sisters."

Al mismo tiempo, da acicate al envio a ultramar de las \"Fuerzas de Autodefensa\", al aumento de gastos militares y al armamentismo nuclear sin comprometerse a la \"constitucion pacifista\" que vino existiendo nominalmente. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tNosotros ajustaremos la cuenta, cueste lo que cueste, de la agresion, el saqueo y otros crimenes antieticos de Estado cometidos por Japon en el siglo pasado contra la nacion coreana y no dejaremos de luchar hasta que ese pais isleno pida disculpas e indemnice. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDesplegaremos el movimiento pannacional contra la intencion de Japon de usurpar la isla Tok y sus maniobras de tergiversacion de la historia y rechazaremos tajantemente sus acciones dirigidas a retomar el camino de agresion y hostilizar a la nacion coreana.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tExhortamos a toda la nacion en el interior y el exterior del pais a levantarse, unida como un solo hombre bajo la bandera del patriotismo, en el movimiento patriotico por defender la soberania nacional y frustrar las maniobras de Japon tendentes a tergiversar la historia, usurpar la isla Tok y agredir de nuevo a la nacion coreana."

La enmienda del plan operacional de agresion al Norte de Corea suponiendo el suministro del \"disuasivo ampliado\" y su aplicacion en el presente ejercicio muestran que se consuma en hechos el imprudente intento de los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos de atacar sorpresiva y preventivamente a la RPDC con armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ejercito y el pueblo coreanos vuelven a reconocer una vez mas cuan justa opcion fue haber adquirido el disuasivo nuclear para la autodefensa bajo la situacion actual en que EE.UU. intenta estallar la guerra nuclear en la Peninsula Coreana recrudeciendo la presion militar a la RPDC segun su politica sobre esta del \"dialogo y la presion\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tResponder al arma nuclear de EE.UU. con el arma nuclear, al misil con el misil y al climax de la \"confrontacion\" con la justa guerra total a nuestro estilo, esto es la invariable posicion de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEE.UU. debe poner fin a su anacronica politica hostil y de chantaje nuclear a la RPDC."

De esta manera, murieron en masas incontables coreanos por el hambre, el derrumbe de galerias y a golpes, etc.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos siguen sufriendo afrentas aun despues de su muerte.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tHasta la fecha, Japon no pide disculpas ni indemniza todavia sus infames crimenes antieticos contra el pueblo coreano.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl contrario, elude obstinadamente su responsabilidad de liquidar sus crimenes del pasado y maniobra vilmente para dejarlos a toda costa en el olvido de la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAunque transcurrieron mas de 60 anos desde su derrota en la Segunda Guerra Mundial, las autoridades japonesas se resisten a pedir disculpas y recompensar a la RPDC, victima mas grande de dichos crimenes, y dan el clima extremadamente hostil a esta mediante la feroz campana anticoreana haciendose descaradamente las \"victimas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSon las mismas las conductas del viejo Japon, que maniobro para encubrir a toda costa sus crimenes del pasado, y de los reaccionarios japoneses de hoy que recurren con teson a los actos fraudulentos politicos como eludir la liquidacion del pasado y tergiversar la historia.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAsi son tan grandes las perdidas humanas, materiales y espirituales que causa historicamente a la nacion coreana ese pais tan cinico.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl pueblo coreano, que guarda el gran rencor y odio a Japon, cobrara sin falta el precio de su sangre derramada por culpa de los reaccionarios japoneses que actuan de manera desafiante haciendo vista gorda de sus crimenes del pasado."
