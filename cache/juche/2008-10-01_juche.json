That day a total of seven spy planes were busy with aerial photographing and electronic reconnaissance against all areas of the north. \n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t On Sept. 12 an overseas-based U-2 and a U-2 stationed in an air force base of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces present in south Korea  flew in the air above areas along the front almost every day and night to spy on the major targets in the depth of areas of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t E-3 took off a base of Japan on Sept. 10, 11, 16 and 17 to command the aerial war exercises of flying corps of the U.S. imperialists and the south Korean puppet armed forces and commit madcap aerial espionage against the north.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, more than two or three RC-800s and RF-4Cs of the south Korean puppet armed forces were busy everyday with aerial observation and photographing of areas of the north side.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t Such aerial espionage timed to coincide with the frantic war exercises perpetrated by the U.S. imperialists after deploying aggressor forces in south Korea goes to prove that the aggression moves of their warmongers and the south Korean puppet troops against the north have reached an extremely reckless phase."
