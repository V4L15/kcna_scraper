This is an outright declaration of confrontation with the army and people of the DPRK and a declaration of a war. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  It goes on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK has not so far criticized the poor human rights record in south Korea, prompted by its desire to bring earlier independent reunification through the improved inter-Korean relations and the promotion of national reconciliation and unity. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The conservative group in south Korea, the worst human rights abusers, have neither qualification nor justification to talk about someone's \"human rights.\"  The noisy anti-DPRK \"human rights\" row kicked up by them, though they have failed to settle their own problems, is nothing but a product of their sinister scenario to get rid of their serious domestic political crisis, prolong their dirty remaining days and do harm to fellow countrymen in collusion with their American master.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is as foolish an act as pricking one's own eyes with one's own finger. The conservative group had better stop the above-said ruckus, bearing this in mind. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confrontation maniacs can never go safe while recklessly hurting and defiling the inviolable system in the DPRK and the high dignity and rights of its people but will have to pay dearly for this.
