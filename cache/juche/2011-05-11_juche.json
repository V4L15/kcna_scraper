            "content": "CPRK Denounces Lee Myung Bak's Provocative Remarks against DPRK\r\n Pyongyang, May 11 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea gave an answer to a question put by KCNA Wednesday as regards the provocative remarks made by traitor Lee Myung Bak against the DPRK during his recent visit to Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t On May 8 Lee at the round-table talks with compatriots and a press conference held during his junket to Germany, the first leg of his European tour, blustered that the north's nukes are obstructive to unification, urging it to \"dismantle\" them, and asserted that it should \"apologize\" for the warship sinking case and the Yonphyong Island shelling case. He went the lengths of crying out for \"the punishment of what he called \"provocation\" as regards even the anti-DPRK conspiratorial case orchestrated by him in the past.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He groundlessly pointed an accusing finger at the DPRK, finding fault with its system. He also let loose a string of foolish invectives inciting despicable confrontation of systems, talking about the pull-down of the Berlin Wall. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The spokesman branded this as a blatant provocation against the system and dignity of the DPRK and an intolerable mockery of the public opinion at home and abroad and the DPRK's positive efforts for dialogue.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  He went on: Lee, not content with kicking off the anti-reunification confrontation racket in south Korea, made such reckless remarks overseas. This was nothing but the last-ditch effort to chill the ever-growing atmosphere of dialogue, ward off the criticism of him for the collapse of the inter-Korean relations and the failure of his policy toward the north and justify his anti-DPRK nuclear racket and the moves to escalate the confrontation with it.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group was so preposterous as to describe the DPRK's \"apology\" for the above-said two cases as an option for crossing the threshold of inter-Korean dialogue. This revealed its ulterior intention to challenge the DPRK to the end, without having any dialogue with it. The group's outbursts raising someone's \"dismantlement of nukes\" as a precondition for dialogue are no more than a ridiculous attempt to disarm the DPRK and realize the ambition for invading it in collusion with the U.S.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group is seeking to import the mode of reunification applied by a foreign country, bewildered by it. This is as foolish an act as expecting the sky to fall.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Korean Peninsula is not Germany.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group is dreaming of such a contingency as what happened in Germany but it was south Korea where regimes collapsed several times due to such contingencies as the April 19 Popular Uprising that broke out on the peninsula.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony is that Lee, a stooge serving the U.S. in its moves for a nuclear war, is going busy with hectic diplomacy over the issue of opening what he called a nuclear summit in south Korea, the world's biggest advanced base for a nuclear war and largest nuclear arsenal. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The world people still remember well that he declared the policy of toeing the U.S. and the policy of confrontation with fellow countrymen when he was coming to power and blustered that it was all right not to have inter-Korean dialogue during the tenure of his office. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK cannot but seriously consider its stance maintained so far as it has become clear now that the mean declaration made by Lee was put into practice and he is set to stand in confrontation to the last.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is quite self-evident that nothing can be expected from a dialogue with such a man keen on confrontation with fellow countrymen, blinded by a foolish dream.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The DPRK will never pardon those hurting its dignity and system and making a mockery of them but take merciless and strong counter-actions against them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The confrontation of the systems will only lead to a war.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t If a war breaks out on this land, it will be the Korean nation's just and sacred patriotic war for national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Lee would be well advised to behave himself, properly understanding the disposition of the DPRK and the reality."

Concern Repeatedly Expressed about DPJ-led Government\":\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When the government led by the Democratic Party of Japan in March last year declassified the contents of the U.S.-Japan secret pacts on nuclear arms signed during the revision of the Japan-U.S. Security Treaty in 1960, the U.S. side repeatedly expressed strong concern that it might affect the U.S. world strategy. This fact was known in the course of analyzing the diplomatic cable on Japan disclosed by WikiLeaks. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The secret pacts which allowed the port calls of the U.S. warships carrying nukes had been considered invalid as the U.S. forces suspended the transport of nuclear weapons by their vessels in 1991 after the demise of the Cold War era. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, this diplomatic cable vividly reveals the ulterior intention of the U.S. side to steadily inherit \"a tacit agreement\" as it raised the possibility that there would be a policy change in the future. It is inevitable that it is bound to contradict the three non-nuclear principles of Japan banning the introduction of nuclear weapons into Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to the diplomatic cable to the U.S. State Department from the U.S. embassy in Tokyo on November 27, 2009, the issue of handling the secret pacts was discussed between the U.S. senior minister and Umemoto, director of the North American Affairs Department of the Foreign Ministry of Japan, at the U.S. embassy that day. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The senior minister said that it was an important element of the deterrence strategy to make nuke shipping ambiguous and Ambassador Roos is concerned about the direction of the investigation, he said, adding that this was not a simple internal matter but it is likely to affect the U.S. strategy in the light of its impact on a broader global scale.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Umemoto expressed understanding of the concern expressed by the U.S. side, saying that it is a troublesome problem and it would be more difficult than the Futenma issue. The present Hatoyama government seems not to understand the consequences to be entailed by the investigation into the secret pacts, he noted, underscoring the need to further the unofficial consultation between Japan and the U.S. over the issue of how to respond to the voices demanding a more explicit clarification of nuclear weapons. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t According to a diplomatic message from Tokyo on February 4, 2010, two months later, the secret pacts became the topic of discussion during the talks held between Campbell, assistant secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, and others and Umemoto and others. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Campbell cited \"extended deterrence\" and \"historical problems surrounding nukes\" as the tasks facing Japan and the U.S., stressing the need to make it possible for the U.S. aircraft and warships to enter Japan irrespective of whether they carry nuclear weapons or not. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t All facts go to prove that the U.S.-Japan secret pacts on nuclear arms were not a document valid only in the past but has remained in force for a long period."

Con respecto a esto, la parte norteamericana expresó reiteradamente la preocupación de que esto podría ejercer una influencia negativa a la estrategia de EE.UU. sobre el mundo. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe consideraba que ese compromiso secreto, que permitió la entrada de buques norteamericanos cargados de armas nucleares en los puertos de Japón, perdió su vigencia en 1991, después del fin de la guerra fría, cuando las tropas norteamericanas dejaron de cargar armas nucleares en sus buques fluviales. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, ese telegrama oficial aludió la intención de la parte norteamericana que se detenía en la continuación del \"acuerdo silencioso\" tomando en cuenta que habría un cambio en la política.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSe cuestionarían inevitablemente las relaciones con los tres principios de desnuclearización de Japón que prohíbe la entrada de armas nucleares.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tSegún el telegrama oficial remitido el 27 de noviembre de 2009 por la embajada estadounidense en Tokio al Departamento de Estado, ese día el ministro jefe y el jefe del departamento de América del Norte de la cancillería japonesa, Umemoto, discutieron en esta sede diplomática el problema de ese compromiso secreto. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl ministro jefe dijo que \"la posición ambigua sobre la carga de armas nucleares en los buques es un elemento importante de la estrategia de disuasivo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl embajador Roos se preocupa por el rumbo de la investigación, que no es un simple problema nacional sino puede ejercer influencia negativa a la estrategia de EE.UU. en escala mundial\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tUmemoto expresó consentimiento a esa preocupación de la parte norteamericana y respondió que \"esto es un problema más difícil que el problema de la base militar de Futenma\" y que \"el poder actual de Hatoyama no se da cuenta de las consecuencias que emanará de la investigación del ´compromiso secreto´\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tY agregó que \"se necesita continuar las discusiones no oficiales entre Japón y EE.UU. sobre cómo responder a las voces que demandan explicaciones más claras sobre las armas nucleares\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDos meses después desde entonces, o sea, el 4 de febrero de 2010, un telegrama oficial procedente de Tokio reportó que ese tema se discutió también en las conversaciones entre el asistente del secretario de Estado para asuntos de Asia Oriental y el Pacífico, Campbell, y otros funcionarios norteamericanos y Umemoto y otros japoneses, sostenidas el mismo día. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCampbell presentó como la tarea de ambos países el \"disuasivo de ampliación\" y el \"problema histórico sobre armas nucleares\" y abogó por la necesidad de la \"entrada de los aviones y buques de EE.UU. en Japón sin hacer caso de la carga de armas nucleares\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos hechos muestran que el compromiso secreto entre EE.UU. y Japón en el tema nuclear no es un asunto surgido en estos momentos, sino es un problema de larga historia."
