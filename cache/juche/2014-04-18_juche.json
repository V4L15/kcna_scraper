            "content": "Spokesman for DPRK Foreign Ministry Blasts Anti-DPRK Human Rights Racket of U.S. and Its Allies\r\nPyongyang, April 18 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the DPRK Ministry of Foreign Affairs gave the following answer to the question raised by KCNA on Friday in connection with the fact that the anti-DPRK human rights racket of the U.S. and its allied forces has reached an extremely reckless phase:\n\t\t\t\t\t These days the U.S. is hurling its allied forces into kicking up a reckless anti-DPRK human rights racket, holding an informal meeting on the \"human rights\" issue in the DPRK and holding an open dialogue at the UN Security Council.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Meanwhile, the U.S. instigated the European Parliament to adopt a \"resolution\" supporting the recommendation made by the \"Commission of Inquiry\" on the human rights situations in the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such frantic racket is aimed at tarnishing the image of the dignified DPRK at any cost and bringing down the ideology and social system chosen by the Korean people in the long run.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Prompted by this aim the U.S. is working hard to discuss the \"human rights\" issue of the DPRK as an official agenda item at the UN Security Council quite contrary to the mandate stipulated in the UN Charter. Finding it difficult to do so, it is talking such nonsense that it is advisable to discuss it by adding the agenda item on the nuclear issue and there is also a way of discussing it at the UN General Assembly.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The European Parliament perpetrated such imprudent and base hostile action against the DPRK as adopting what it called \"resolution\", pursuant to the U.S. anti-DPRK hostile policy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Great irony was that they let such riff-ruffs as so-called \"defectors to the south\" appear at UN Security Council and European Parliament in a bid to stir up an atmosphere of accusing the DPRK.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As far as those riff-ruffs the U.S. considered as \"witnesses\" are concerned, they are the criminals who fled after committing thrice cursed crimes against the country and its people. They are terrorists who stood up against the social system in the DPRK where the popular masses are leading a happy life as masters of the state and society.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t When time comes, their despicable true colors will be fully laid bare.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Then the U.S. and the West will not be able to escape shame and disgrace they will suffer for bringing those terrorists to the sacred human rights arena. At the same time they will not be able to evade the blame for having hatched a plot to slander and bring down a sovereign state together with them.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The U.S. and the West had better put under control the worst human rights abuses in their own countries and mind their own business.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The more vociferous the U.S. and its allied forces become in their human rights racket intended to hurt the prestige of our dignified Republic and its social system, the stronger our single-minded unity will grow and the faster the speed of our advance towards the final victory will become."

            "content": "Minju Joson revela siniestro objetivo de la orientacion diplomatica de Japon\r\nPyongyang, 18 de abril (ACNC) -- Hace poco, Japon publico la \"nota azul diplomatica\" de 2014 que expuso la orientacion de sus actividades diplomaticas de este ano.\n\t\t\t\t\tEn ese documento, Japon acuso el \"problema de armas nucleares y de misiles\" de la Republica Popular Democratica de Corea diciendo que eso es el \"mayor factor de peligro para la seguridad\" de Japon y Asia oriental y crece mas que nunca la importancia de la alianza Japon-EE.UU.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl periodico Minju Joson, en un comentario individual divulgado este viernes, senala que Japon repitio el \"rumor de la amenaza proveniente del Norte de Corea\" partiendo de su anejada hostilidad a la RPDC y de su intencion de alcanzar sus malsanos objetivos politicos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLos reaccionarios japoneses, colmados de la hostilidad a la RPDC, no quieren ver objetiva y serenamente la realidad e interpretan intencionalmente al reves los problemas, critico el comentarista y continuo:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEllos quieren cazar dos pajaros de un tiro utilizando esta carta politica: \"rumor de la amenaza del Norte de Corea\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn primer lugar, intentan salir del serio aislamiento diplomatico, causado por su politica de derechizacion militarista.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAmplificando ese rumor, tratan de resaltar la necesidad del fortalecimiento de la alianza Japon-EE.UU. y mejorar asi las ahora embarazosas relaciones con EE.UU. y a la larga, esquivar la flecha de criticas internacionales dirigida a Japon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl otro proposito descansa en preparar las condiciones favorables a su ambicion militarista de expansion a ultramar.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn su reciente encuentro con el secretario de Defensa norteamericano, el gobernador japones dijo abiertamente que su pais acelera el \"ordenamiento de la base legal\" para el ejercicio del derecho a la autodefensa colectiva en vista del \"problema nuclear y de misiles\" de la RPDC.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tJapon debe portarse bien si no quiere sufrir desgracias por meter su nariz en el problema de la Peninsula Coreana."
