            "content": "Truth behind \"Northern Limit Line\" Disclosed  \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, June 25 (KCNA) -- Rodong Sinmun Monday carries an article contributed by a military commentator disclosing the truth behind the \"northern limit line\" and clarifying once again the principled stand of the DPRK on it in connection with the fact that the warlike forces of south Korea are perpetrating the intrusion into the waters of the north side in the West Sea of Korea not just as a mere provocation but are pursuing the brigandish purpose of bringing under control those waters invaded by them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Pointing out that the \"northern limit line\" is an illegal ghost line, the article observes that the U.S. imperialist aggressor troops unilaterally drew the line inside the inviolable territorial waters of the DPRK after occupying south Korea under the helmets of the \"UN forces\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean Armistice Agreement (KAA) signed in July 1953 stipulated the Military Demarcation Line (MDL) on the ground and its extension in the East Sea of Korea but to everybody's regret it fell short of fixing the extension of the MDL in the West Sea of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists, utterly exhausted after sustaining an unprecedented defeat in the Korean war, ordered Clark, the then commander of the \"UN forces\", to fix the so-called \"northern limit line\" also known as \"Clark line\" in the West Sea of Korea in a bid to prevent south Korean fishermen from coming over to the north while checking traitor Syngman Rhee's reckless attempt at an \"independent expedition to the north\" and averting a war that may break out again accordingly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The \"northern limit line\" was, therefore, a \"final line for stopping the defectors to the north\" and a boundary line banning the trespassing of ships unilaterally drawn by the commander of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces to meet Washington's self-justified interests. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It was precisely for this reason that the U.S. imperialists could not announce the existence of the \"northern limit line\" for such a long time, much less informing the DPRK side, one of the belligerent parties, of it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reason why the \"northern limit line\" is called an illegal ghost line can be explained by the fact that it was unilaterally drawn without any agreement reached between the two sides and is in breach of the KAA as well as the universally recognized law of the sea, the article notes, citing specific facts to prove it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Saying that the assertion about the \"northern limit line\" is sheer sophism, the article goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities, steeped in flunkeyism and submission to the marrow of their bones, seek to attain their political and strategic aims to put an end to the June 15 era of reunification and aggravate the north-south relations in a bid to please their American master at any cost. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are, at the same time, working hard to achieve their sinister aim to maintain the \"northern limit line\" come what may in utter disregard of the north-south agreement on fixing a boundary line of non-aggression in the West Sea, though the issue of establishing peace mechanism on the Korean Peninsula is high on the agenda. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  It is the fixed will of the Korean nation to certainly force them to stop claiming the \"northern limit line\". The south Korean authorities should clearly understand that their moves of straining situation in the West Sea of Korea under the pretext of the \"northern limit line\" would be as foolish an act as that of a robber claiming that other's yard belongs to him after drawing a demarcation with rotten straw rope without the owner's knowledge. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and the people of the DPRK will never remain an on-looker to south Korean naval warships' reckless intrusion and movement in the inviolable waters of the north side and the south Korean military authorities' backstage manipulation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities had better think twice over their behavior so that the patience and the repeated warnings of the Navy of the Korean People's Army may not touch off their resentment and just resolute actions. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They would be well advised to pay heed to the warning of the KPA Navy that it is fully ready to go into actions to mercilessly punish the intruders by sending them into the bottom of the sea any moment as all the targets, big or small, are accurately sighted by all its strike means whose hit probabilities are fully guaranteed in any event.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Peace is an ardent aspiration of the Korean nation and a vital issue decisive of the reunification of the country and the future destiny of the nation. Rodong Sinmun Monday urges this in a signed article.

Striping stark naked the ugly color of the U.S. imperialists as the provokers of the Korean war, the author of the article says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. imperialists long ago designated Korea as a bridgehead   for Asian and world supremacy. From the very day of their illegal occupation of south Korea, they projected a Korean war and picked up the DPRK as the first target of attack for realizing their ambition of world supremacy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They made meticulous preparations for invading the DPRK, making the provocation of a Korean war as a fait accompli, vociferating that Korea is \"a battlefield on which depends the success of the United States in Asia\" and \"a test ground of a showdown with communism\".&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The war plan finalized by the U.S. imperialists set the summer of 1950 as the time to start the war and envisaged that the battle posture of the U.S. imperialist aggressor forces and the south Korean army would be further completed and the \"security measures of the rear\" be fully taken by that time. And it was expected that the south Korean army and the U.S. forces would be hurled into the Korean war in full scale from the very start and Japan be inveigled into the war when it would break out. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n U.S. President Truman hastily dispatched Advisor to the State Department Dulles as a special envoy to south Korea in mid-June 1950 and sent Defense Secretary Johnson and Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff Bradley to Tokyo to make them finally decide with Commander of the U.S. Forces in Far East MacArthur the date of the start of the war and its procedure. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n To start the war by surprise and create a favorable atmosphere for shifting the responsibility for the outbreak of the war onto the DPRK, the U.S. imperialists staged an unheard-of farce of deception and camouflage on the eve of the war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Having made full preparations the U.S. imperialists and the Syngman Rhee clique launched an all-out armed invasion of the northern half of the Republic at dawn on June 25, 1950 without declaring a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Thus the Korean war was a war of aggression meticulously prepared by the U.S. imperialists.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It deals with important events and famous generals of Koguryo on the basis of historical data. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nIt has an appendix on historical tradition of the Korean nation seen through the custom of the Koguryo people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book was written by Prof. and Dr. Jo Hui Sung, director of the History Institute under the Academy of Social Science. He told KCNA: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Koguryo once demonstrated its might in East Asia for nearly 1,000 years. But records of its history and its many material and cultural creations were severely destroyed by foreign invaders after its ruin. Therefore, the history of Koguryo had an eclipse like those of Paekje and Kaya which existed in the same time. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book \"Samguksagi\" (the history of the Three Kingdoms--Koguryo, Paekje and Silla) refers a little to the history of Koguryo and the tomb murals belonging to Koguryo show part of its cultural development. Even the historical materials were deprived of and severely destroyed by the Japanese imperialist aggressors during their occupation of Korea in the beginning of the 20th century. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japanese government-patronized historians extremely dwarfed the history of Koguryo, by writing that the Paleolithic era did not exist in Korea and Kojoson (Ancient Korea) was also established by a foreign exile. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\nBut no one can erase the history of Koguryo which turned a brilliant page in the Korean history with a time-honored history, efflorescing culture and strong national power. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The book helps the readers get the history of Koguryo.    .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

And they, full of firm confidence in and optimism for victory, sang and danced with the instruments, thus striking terror into the minds of the enemies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The defenders of Pakdal Pass in the eastern sector of the front were the first in making the instruments in October Juche 40 (1951). Their example was instantly followed by other units on the front. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The fighters made knives, plane irons and chisels with splinters of shells and wonderfully manufactured such musical instruments as kayagum (Korean harp), tanso (Korean bamboo flute), haegum (Korean four-string fiddle), violin, cello and guitar with the scotched trees and electric wire on heights by their own efforts and wisdom. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They played the musical instruments with firm confidence in future victory between battles, giving the enemies fear. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The programs which used the front-line musical instruments were highly appreciated at the art performance of all the combined units of the KPA in February 1952 and at the 6th general art performance contest of servicepersons in May 1953. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The musical instruments showed vividly the indomitable revolutionary fighting spirit, revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and mental and moral traits of the officers and men of the KPA who were faithful to President Kim Il Sung and constituted a powerful weapon in arousing the KPA servicepersons in the heroic exploits of wiping out the aggressors.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
