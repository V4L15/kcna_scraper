            "content": "Repatriation of unconverted long-term prisoners\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, February 23 (KCNA) -- Jang Jae On, chairman of the central committee of the Red Cross Society of the DPRK, sent a letter today to Jong Won Sik, president of the South Korean Red Cross, as regards the remarks of the South Korean authorities about the release of unconverted long-term prisoners.&nbsp;&nbsp;   The letter says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;   On January 30, the Ministry of Justice of Your Side announced that it would include unconverted long-term prisoners in the list of the \"March 1st special amnesty\" although it obtains no \"law-abiding oaths\" from them and that, accordingly, all of 17 unconverted prisoners who have been kept behind bars for more than 29 years would be released.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Though belated, we think the announcement is  fortunate.&nbsp;&nbsp;   For man to espouse a certain ideology according to his faith is a matter belonging to an elementary human right.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nevertheless, the unconverted long-term prisoners have been kept behind bars for scores of years for the mere reason that they refused to make \"ideological conversion.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;   They have become cripples as result of long prison life and all sorts of persecution inflicted upon them.&nbsp;&nbsp; Worse still, all of them are at the advanced age of 70.&nbsp;&nbsp;   Even if they are released, their piteous plight will not improve at all as they have no relatives to take care of and look after them in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp; On top of it, they will be placed under constant surveillance, control and persecution owing to the \"Law on Supervision for Public Peace,\" a second \"National Security Law.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;   This is fully proved by the miserable life of old Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan, unconverted long-term prisoners of the DPRK origin:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Although they were released from prison, the release is nothing but their move from a small cell to a big prison called society.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \r\n In the final analysis, though unconverted long-term prisoners are set free with no \"law-abiding oaths\"  taken pains they suffered during their imprisonment for scores of years will not be healed, nor will they be exposed to less suppression, I think. &nbsp;&nbsp;   A best solution to the unconverted long-term prisoners issue is an unconditional reunion of them with their families as demanded by unconverted long-term prisoners themselves, their families and people at home and abroad. &nbsp;&nbsp;   If the unconverted long-term prisoners are kept in South Korea as ever and their safety is endangered, your authority and Red Cross will be held responsible entirely for failing to fully discharge its humanitarian mission.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We, considering that if your side acquits and releases all of the unconverted long-term prisoners and, at the same time, sends them back to their families, it will be a landmark event in bringing in a thaw in the frozen inter-Korean relations and clearing the way for  wide-ranging dialogue and contact, expect that your Red Cross will take a step for an early repatriation of old Kim In So, Kim Yong Thae and Ham Se Hwan to the north in accordance with relevant provisions of international law on the repatriation of POWs and the Korean Armistice Agreement and, at the same time, send all of the unconverted long-term prisoners, who are to be released, back to where their wives and children live. \r\n    \r\n"
