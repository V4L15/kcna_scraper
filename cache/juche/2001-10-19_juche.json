Korea \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, October 19 (KCNA) -- The withdrawal of the U.S. forces from South Korea is a prerequisite for national reunification because Korea was divided by their occupation of South Korea and they are still present there, says Minju Joson today in a signed article.\r\n It urges the united states to opt for an early withdrawal of its forces from South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. forces had not occupied South Korea, Korea would not have been divided into the north and the south and the issue of reunification would not have cropped up. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Hard historical facts prove that the U.S. forces' occupation of South Korea was the root cause of the Korea's division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the U.S. forces pull out of South Korea and stop obstructing Korea's reunification, the Korean nation is fully capable of achieving the country's reunification by its own efforts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Those who love the country and the nation are turning out in a vigorous struggle to force the U.S. forces to pull out of South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n There is neither ground nor pretext for the U.S. to keep its forces in South Korea.    \r\n\r\n"

After the adoption of the law related to the \"U.S.-Japan defence cooperation guideline\" the SDF has regained the right to participate in war and the right of belligerency. Japan, a military power, is getting all the more arrogant. The only stumbling block lying in its way is the present constitution which bans the use of armed forces. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The proposal made by the chief executive of Japan is aimed to legally allow Japan to keep huge regular modern combat forces and use them as it wishes under the pretext of the \"state security and interests \" and demonstrate their might before the world.    It is now trying to display its \"skill\" with the surprise attacks on the U.S. and its retaliation operation as a momentum. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But Japan's reckless moves for overseas aggression are little short of digging its own grave.    \r\n\r\n"
