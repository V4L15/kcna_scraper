This is part of Washington's moves to increase the international pressure on the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The DPRK government has consistently been opposed to the misuse and smuggling of drug and has nothing to do with the recent case. We have informed the Australian side that the ship \"Pongsu\" is a civilian trading ship and the ship owner's side has no idea of this at all. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but express surprise and regret at the fact that Australia is linking the case with the DPRK government by playing on the U.S. assertion. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The origin of the case and the attempt to deliberately link the case with the DPRK from its very beginning compel us strongly suspect that the case is not a mere drug smuggling case but a premeditated case orchestrated to do harm to the DPRK and stifle it to the end under the pretext of its nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We cannot but take a serious note of the fact that they are pulling up the party and government of the DPRK without any evidence even before the truth about the case is probed. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n We will closely watch how the case is dealt with and never tolerate any attempt to use the case for impairing the authority and dignity of the DPRK.    \r\n\r\n\r\n"
