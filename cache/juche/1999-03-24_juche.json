They said they were pleased with the fact that an agreement was recently reached between the DPRK and the United States and hailed it.   They criticized the wrong attitude taken by Japan toward the issue of improving relations with the DPRK and said they would strive to make the Korea policy of the government rectified. \r\n    \r\n"

In a statement, the rallies expressed indignation at the misbehaviour of the authorities in ruining South Korea's stockbreeding industry by adopting a \"decision on the merger.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"government\" hurriedly worked out a rough-and-ready restructuring program against the farmers and published it in a burglarious way, they said, adding:&nbsp;This is intended to shift the responsibility for its failure in agricultural policy onto the association and bring the organisation under its control.   They demanded an immediate resignation of the \"Minister of Agriculture and Forestry.\"   Then came a street march.   Upset by this, the South Korean authorities called out some 5,000 policemen of 55 companies to crack down upon their protest. \r\n\r\n"

Korean authority's diatribe inciting confrontation\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- An endless string of jargons getting on the nerves of the north and fostering inter-Korean confrontation are heard from among South Korean authorities.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Typical of them were remarks made by the present chief executive and the \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" at a \"meeting on reforms of state policies\" on March 22. At the meeting, they said that the  \"policy of engagement with the north\" would produce a \"success\", the north made \"serious provocation\" and that it is \"necessary to put diplomatic pressure upon the north through international cooperation.\"   Earlier, the \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" had made anti-reunification remarks that it was \"worthless to place reunification above liberal democracy.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   We have solemnly warned the self-proclaimed \"government for the people\" of South Korea of the anti-national, anti-reunification remarks being made openly by its authorities under the name of \"the policy of engagement.\" This is because we cannot overlook the serious fact that the chief executive's north policy allegedly to improve inter-Korean relations through \"reconciliation and cooperation\" is based on the doctrine of confrontation under the veil of \"engagement.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Such seriousness is being fully proved by feverish bravado being more frequently made by South Korean authorities as hours pass by. What they seek is not to achieve the historic task of national reunification but to attain their flunkeyist and traitorous aim for \"unification through absorption\" by fostering confrontation with the north in a more vicious way.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   This time, the \"Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade\" unhesitatingly uttered very provocative remarks that the issue of repatriating \"those abducted by the north\" and \"ROK army prisoners of war\" must be internationalized and South Korea would join the international community in the efforts to \"improve human rights situation in the north\" and that it would \"cooperate\" with someone in solving the issue of \"those abducted by the north.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   His utterances cannot be construed otherwise than provocative remarks originating from the theory of confrontation with the north.   The South Korean authorities had better act with prudence,  mindful that they cannot conceal their ulterior intention and flunkeyist and traitorous nature no matter how feverishly they may try to cover their anti-national, anti-reunification doctrine of confrontation with the mask of \"engagement.\" \r\n\r\n"

Korea\r\n &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- A few days ago, the South Korean authorities set up the \"fellowship society of defectors from the north,\" according to a report.   The organization is nothing but a waiting maid and a puppet of the government authorities composed of traitors to the nation and criminals.   In forming the organization, the South Korean authorities seek to use them for their ulterior purpose of intensifying anti-north, anti-reunification confrontation moves and placate complaint, discontent and resistance which are daily mounting among defectors from the north.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   As soon as they set their foot on the land of South Korea, the defectors are taken to the central joint investigation station, the \"Intelligence Service\" and other places, where they are treated like animals and put to all sorts of torture including the beating by clubs, becoming mental and physical cripples. In addition, they are placed under constant shadowing and watch. Moreover, unable to eke out their existence with meager money for settlement, they attempt to flee to other countries only to be thrown behind bars or commit suicide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Worse still, they are reduced to robbers, thieves and murderers while living a degenerate life branded by South Korean people as \"traitors to the country\" and \"scum who ran away, leaving their family members behind.\"   Unable to endure inhuman treatment and contempt they had to undergo in South Korea after being allured or kidnapped by agents of the \"Intelligence Service,\" an increasing number of defectors from the north lodge lawsuits or protests with the authorities against them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The South Korean authorities formed the organisation as the last-ditch measure to control such movements of defectors, a new troublesome matter, and make them meekly obey their orders.   With such an organization, however, the South Korean authorities can neither dampen the anti-\"government\" feelings of defectors from the north nor conceal the fact that South Korea is a veritable hell. \r\n  \r\n"

Though several decades have passed since then, the present South Korean rulers are getting more zealous in their moves to fling the door open for the Japanese militarist's reinvasion of Korea.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   They sold off Tok Island, part of the territory of Korea, to Japan with outcries for \"friendly relations\" with Japan.   By holding \"summit talks\" with the Japanese Prime Minister in Seoul some time ago, they committed unpardonable crimes of transferring all rights and interests of South Korea to Japan and obstructing the reunification of Korea.   The incumbent chief executive of South Korea must draw a lesson from his predecessors who went to ruin while depending on outsiders, stop the sycophantic treacherous acts and step down at once as unanimously demanded by the people. \r\n\r\n"

Underlying the \"viewpoint of unification\" and \"modality of unification\" on the lips of the South Korean authorities is a theory of extreme confrontation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Recently the South Korean authorities, including the chief executive, the \"prime minister\" and \"defense minister,\" called the people in the North Korea \"principal enemy.\"  they persist in \"cooperation\" with outsiders to stifle the compatriots by force of arms.

The news analyst says:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The South Korean bellicose elements have staged an aerial surprise attack exercise, a joint drill and other maneuvers. It cannot be overlooked that the U.S. troops occupying South Korea decided to stage a drill of evacuating Americans in South Korea to Japan under the simulated conditions of \"emergency\" on the Korean peninsula from March 25 through 27. This is a dangerous development which can be seen only on the eve of war.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The U.S. and South Korean war hawks are these days busy with frequent war exercises under different names aimed at making an outbreak of war against the north a fait accompli, bringing  war exercises closer to a real war and rounding off its preparations at the final stage.   When the north has proposed wide-ranging dialogue to the south side out of the intention to open a new phase of peace and reunification, the South Korean warmongers are getting more frantic in war exercises against the north in collusion with outside forces.   These war maneuvers will only result in precipitating their final ruin. \r\n \r\n"

A leading faction of the \"NCNP\" composed of \"veterans\" who had attended the same school and come from the same factions, called for \"merging\" with the \"ULD\" and said that the merger must be oriented toward \"political restructuring.\"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   The \"ULD\" rejected the \"NCNP's\" offer for \"the merger of parties,\" saying that it is a plot to evade the constitutional revision aimed at building a parliamentary system of government, and launched into \"publicity activities for the parliamentary cabinet format\".   The \"NCNP\" raised the issue of the party merger after deciding to postpone \"its national convention\" slated for May. However, the \"ULD\" defiantly rejected this offer. This heated argument between the two ruling parties fully reflects the ulterior intention of political charlatans who have their own axes to grind in the scramble for power.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n   Now, the \"NCNP\" is trying to merge its party with the \"ULD\" in an attempt to extricate itself from the awkward position where it has to read the face of the \"ULD,\" the other party of the ruling camp, although it took office and to make the \"ULD\" dissolved, build up its ranks and thus maintain its exclusive power.
