But that only reveals more glaringly its mental poverty and vulnerability. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Its psychological warfare only helped the army and the people of the DPRK renew their will and faith to consolidate the single-hearted unity in every way, the precious gain of our revolution and the eternal foundation of our system, touched off stronger hatred against the u.s. and hardened their determination to annihilate enemies.    \r\n\r\n"

He extended congratulations to Kim Jong Il who is brilliantly carrying forward the cause of the president.

            "content": "U.S. President's statement on human rights refuted \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pyongyang, July 4 (KCNA) -- U.S. President Bush in a recent statement accused a number of countries including the DPRK of \"violating\" human rights, asserting that the U.S. is committed to build a world in which human rights are respected and protected by laws.\r\n In this regard Rodong Sinmun today in a signed commentary says: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No people in the world fully enjoy true human rights as the Korean people do under the man-centered socialist system of Korean style, where the popular masses have become genuine masters of the country and everything in the society is made to serve them. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. in its recent \"report on 2002-2003 human rights and democracy\" referred to \"humanitarian crisis in North Korea\" and \"concerns,\" urging other countries to raise improvement of the human rights record as a condition for establishing any relations with North Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This is just part of the U.S. anti-DPRK psychological warfare to tarnish the image of the DPRK and lay an \"international siege\" to it and the U.S. policy to stifle it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n As far as the human rights issue is concerned, the U.S. tops the world list of human rights abuses. \r\n People's right to existence and inviolability are always threatened and infringed upon in the American society where gun-related murders are hourly occurrences and all sorts of crimes are rampant. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The number of prisoners in the U.S. is equivalent to a quarter of the total number of prisoners of the world. More than 2 million toiling people are exposed to threats of violence in their workplaces and over 1.8 million labourers are injured in their workshops on a yearly average. The U.S. has also the worst record of racial discrimination in the world. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. is citing the DPRK's \"human rights issue\" to woo those countries, which wish to normalize relations and develop good-neighborly and friendly relations with the dignified DPRK, to put up such unreasonable demand as \"demand for better human rights record\" in a bid to plug them into the moves to execute its policy to isolate and stifle the DPRK.

Such foolish act was intended to serve its political purpose of playing down the historic significance of the north-south summit meeting and the June 15 Joint Declaration and bedevilling the north-south relations. \r\n If South Korea truly needs any special investigation, it should not look into the issue of \"remittance to the north\" but probe and punish the crimes committed by the group of the \"Grand National  Party\" against the country and the nation by spending a stupendous amount of money collected from the South Korean workers and other people for the U.S. imperialists' overseas invasion and the upkeep of the U.S. troops in South Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The history will certainly mete out a stern judgment to those who are seeking to try as criminals the persons who contributed to the summit meeting, the first of its kind in the history of national division. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The statement called on the South Korean workers and people of all other strata to turn out as one in the struggle to decisively frustrate the moves of the splittist forces to bar the reunification of the country under the uplifted banner of the joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n"
