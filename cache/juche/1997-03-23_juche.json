The News Analyst Says:\r\n   By \"keeper of public peace\", the traitor meant that \"peace\" of his fascist rule, the politics of corruptness and wrongdoings, should be maintained at the point of the bayonet. By \"devotion to uprooting of irregularities\" he meant showing much tact in suppression of the democratic forces standing against him, the kingpin of theft.\r\n   He also remarked that the police should take the lead in \"enforcement of laws and justice\". It reveals his intention to more tightly tie the people to the fascist order and achieve \"security\" of the power.\r\n   As a hunter pats his dogs before hunting, the traitor Kim Young Sam is training policemen to be fiercer hunting dogs to mobilize them in crackdown upon the people for \"stability\" In his rule.\r\n   The more the puppets intensify the suppression of people, the stronger the latter's resistance and the earlier the former's downfall.\r\n   There is no way out for the traitor. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

Since its formation, the anti-Japanese movement for national liberation had been advanced by the Korean people themselves.\r\n   The great leader President Kim Il Sung devoted his whole life to the liberationa and prosperity of the country, regarding Kim Hyong Jik's idea of \"Aim High\" and legacies as his lifelong motto.\r\n   The country could be liberated and could turn into a powerful socialist country, independent, self-reliant and self-supporting in national defence, under the wise leadership of President Kim Il Sung, who triumphantly led the Korean revolution, true to patriotic intentions of Kim Hyong Jik.\r\n   It is the unshakable will of the Korean people to bring to completion the revolution through generations with the idea of \"Aim High\".\r\n   With the idea, the revolutionary Korean people live and fight. They are dynamically advancing in high spirits, convinced of the justness of their cause, no matter how rigorous their trials may be and no matter how long the revolution may be Protracted. This is their revolutionary spirit.\r\n   They are also an indomitable people who are carrying on the revolution in a do-or-die spirit as instructed by Kim hyong Jik.\r\n   They, willing to share the destiny with socialism, are displaying the spirit of defending their leader, the respected General Kim Jong Il, at the cost of their lives, the spirit of becoming human bombs and the spirit of making suicide attacks.\r\n   The Korean people are also a great people who live and fight in accordance with Kim Hyong Jik's comrade-obtaining idea.\r\n   Revolutionary comradeship has made them greater and glorious in the revolution led by General Kim Jong Il.\r\n   The two pistols left by Kim Hyong Jik are a priceless legacy for the dignified Korean people.\r\n   The servicemen and people will reliably defend Korean socialism with arms, regarding the arms handed down by the revolutionary forerunners as valuable as Their lives.\r\n   The Korean revolution, which started in Mangyongdae, is being successfully carried forward under the guidance of Secretary Kim Jong Il.\r\n   All the Party members and other working people should push ahead with the general socialist onward movement, closely united around General Kim Jong Il, with firm faith in the victory of Korean socialism. \r\n\r\n"

Korea urged to be formed \r\n   Pyongyang, March 23 (KCNA) -- Minju Joson today, commenting on the insolvency of the Sam Mi Special Steel Works called \"another Hanbo incident\" in south Korea, urges.  The traitor Kim Young Sam to thoroughly probe the latest incident and step down.  The daily says:\r\n   The steel works' insolvency has put the Sam mi business group on the verge of a total bankcruptcy, saddled with debt amounting to 1.5 trillion won.\r\n   The incident was caused not by financial crisis but by the politics-business collusion, the bribery-preferential treatment relationship between the Kim Young Sam group and comprador conglomerates.\r\n   As soon as the Sam Mi Special Steel Works was declared insolvent, opposition parties raised suspicion of Kim Hyon Chol's dabbling in the transfer of the steel works. It is not a groundless arguement.\r\n   Kim Hyon Chol, with no official position, has exercised great influence with the backing of his father, Kim Young Sam. This is why he is called young \"vice-president\" and \"strong man\" in south Korea.\r\n   The Hanbo incident was caused by preferential loans for the hanbo steelworks ordered by KimYoung Sam and manipulated behind the scene by his son. The Sam Mi incident, too, was caused by the same reason.\r\n   The \"New Korea Party\" has failed to make a comment or a statement concerning the incident, indicating that the suspected dabbling in the business by Kim Hyon Chol is true. \r\n\r\n"
