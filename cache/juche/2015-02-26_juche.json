This makes one cast doubt about whether he has elementary thinking faculty as a human being, to say nothing of qualifications as a politician.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He claims to have graduated from the law faculty of Kyoto University and held the post of foreign minister during the Democratic Party rule. But he found fault with the hall though it poses no problem from the legal point of view. This only proves that he is a political illiterate devoid of elementary international common sense and concept of law.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The advance sale of the hall and its lease are a universal transaction pursuant to procedures recognized by law and, therefore, everything is done in a legitimate manner free from any \"violation and evasion of law\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Not only the legal circle but the political and media circles of Japan admit this.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t It is free for anyone to sell or lend a real estate which one purchased through auction. On the contrary, it is illegal to interfere in it without any justifiable reason.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t There were precedents in which purchaser of a real estate lent it to the debtor, its original owner, and such a precedent still exists at present.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t What merits a serious attention is that Maehara groundlessly attributed the bankruptcy of the Credit Association of the Korean Bank to the \"remittance of funds to North Korea\" and \"the organized use by Chongryon of the DPRK\", while crying out for tightening watch and investigation into it and demanding relevant data.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This is an absolutely intolerable malignant accusation against the DPRK and Chongryon.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As known, the bankruptcy of the Bank was caused because it failed to set up proper management strategy to cope with the bubble economy just as was the case with lots of banks and credit associations that went bankrupt in Japan. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The then Prime Minister Koizumi on Dec. 2001 made it clear in a \"reply to questions regarding the issue of Korean Bank operation fund\" that \"the government has not admitted the flow of fund to the North Korean authorities from the Credit Association of the Korean Bank and that there has not been information about a grant of fund.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Even a \"report by a person in charge of financial management\" at the time of bankruptcy of the Bank mentioned insufficient counteraction and heavy loans but not the admittance of \"organized use\" when referring to the major causes of the bankruptcy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t However, Maehara claimed that the \"Resolution and Collection Corporation and the reserve insurance organization could seize lease fee by exercising all mandates and Chongryon should not be allowed to continue to use the Central Hall\", a hysteric frenzy of a man steeped in bad blood towards the DPRK and Chongryon to the marrow of his bones.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a despicable aim to physically deprive Chongryon, an organization defending the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan, of the base for its activities and to stamp out the legitimate activities of Chongryon and Koreans in Japan can never be achieved.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Maehara's reckless remarks reflect his foolish attempt to fuel atmosphere of bitterness towards the DPRK and Chongryon in the Japanese society, chill the climate of the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental talks and improve his clout as a politician from an opposition party.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t By nature, he is an imbecile political philistine bereft of any political idea and ability and is like a political migratory bird who stoops to any infamy to gain his popularity in the political camp.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As for the issue of improving the relations between the DPRK and Japan, he blustered that \"no chance should be given to the former.\"\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He is a henchman and war servant for the U.S. steeped in sycophancy toward the U.S. While extolling the U.S. as a \"guardian of peace\" and \"stability\" in the Asia-Pacific, he said the U.S. sub-critical nuclear test was not in contravention of the \"Prague address\" made by the U.S. chief executive and voiced \"understanding of it\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He was also forced to step down as foreign minister as he violated the laws and regulations on political funds which ban the acceptance of political fund from foreigners.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Such a human reject questioned the DPRK-Japan inter-governmental talks while raising the Central Hall issue and made remarks chilling the atmosphere of the talks, a vivid manifestation of his sinister political purpose to check the advance of the DPRK-Japan relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Explicitly speaking, Chongryon is a genuine overseas Koreans' organization active for defending and realizing the democratic national rights of Koreans in Japan, and the Central Hall of Chongryon is an inviolable base for its activities as it plays the role of foreign mission in the absence of diplomatic relations between the DPRK and Japan.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Maehara had better face up to the trend of the times and stop such folly as hurting his image."

Y la intervencion injusta en ellas resulta una violacion de la ley.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl comprador de bienes inmuebles puede alquilarlos al deudor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tDiciendo que la bancarrota de la Asociacion de Credito del Banco Coreano se debe al \"envio de dinero al Norte de Corea\" y es \"desvio organizado de fondos por la Chongryon\", Maehara demando intensificar la supervision e investigacion sobre el respecto y presentar los datos relacionados. Es intolerable este disparate anti-RPDC y anti-Chongryon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tComo es conocido por todos, la bancarrota de la Asociacion de Credito del Banco Coreano se debe a la erronea estrategia empresarial para hacer frente a la economia vulnerable, al igual que muchos bancos y asociaciones de credito fracasados en Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaehara difundio el rumor erroneo de que fueron invertidos enormes fondos publicos en el renacimiento de la Asociacion de Credito de Banco Coreano, pero, los fondos publicos se pagan en virtud de la ley y en el principio de proteger a los depositadores de todos los organos bancarios que pagan la prima observando la ley de proteccion de deposito. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn diciembre de 2001, el entonces premier japones Koizumi aclaro en la \"respuesta sobre fondos publicos del Banco Coreano\" que \"el gobierno no reconocio nunca el flujo de los fondos desde la Asociacion de Credito de Banco Coreano al Norte de Corea ni la falta de sus fondos\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl \"informe del arreglador financiero\" publicado en el momento de la bancarrota de la Asociacion de Credito de Banco Coreano tampoco reconocio el \"empleo organizado de fondos para otros fines\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEs irrealizable la ilusion de eliminar en lo fisico la base de actividades de la Chongryon, defensora de derechos democraticos nacionales de los coreanos residentes en Japon, y exterminar las actividades legitimas de la Chongryon y los coreanos en Japon. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEl disparate de Maehara refleja su absurdo intento de aumentar el ambiente anti-RPDC y anti-Chongryon, congelar las conversaciones intergubernamentales RPDC-Japon y elevar su prestigio como politico opositor. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste comerciante politico carente de ideal politico y capacidad se vale de todos los metodos y medios para ganar la popularidad politica. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEn cuanto al tema de la mejora de las relaciones RPDC-Japon, disparateo que \"no deben dar una oportunidad a la RPDC\". \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste sirviente pronorteamericano alabo a EE.UU. como \"defensor de paz\" y \"preservador de estabilidad\" de la region de Asia-Pacifico. Cuando el imperio norteamericano realizo la prueba nuclear subcritica, \"expreso el entendimiento\" diciendo que \"no contraviene al discurso de Praga del mandatario norteamericano\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEste tipejo fue destituido del cargo de canciller por haber violado el reglamento sobre los fonos politicos que prohibe recibir la donacion extranjera.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa Chongryon, siendo organizacion de compatriotas en ultramar de la RPDC, actua para defender y lograr los derechos democraticos nacionales de los coreanos residentes en Japon. Y la Casa Central de la Chongryon es la base de actividades que cumple el papel de representacion diplomatica en Japon que no tiene las relaciones diplomaticas con la RPDC. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tMaehara no debe buscarse la caida de su popularidad viendo correctamente la tendencia de la epoca."

De esta manera, llevaron a la fase irreparable las relaciones intercoreanas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLas autoridades surcoreanas preconizan la doctrina de \"Thong-il Taebak\" (cajon de tesoros para la reunificacion) y la \"Declaracion de Dresden\" despreciando la Declaracion Conjunta del 15 de Junio y la Declaracion del 4 de Octubre para enganar la opinion publica interna y externa. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tCalumnian brutalmente la dignidad y el sistema de la RPDC con el malsano intento de hacer el enfrentamiento de sistemas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tRecurren con frenesi a la campana intrigante de \"DDHH\", el lanzamiento de volantes y otras intrigas psicologicas anti-RPDC, y al mismo tiempo, se entregan a fundar el \"comite preparatorio de unificacion\" y elaborar la \"carta de unificacion\" a fin de apoyar en lo juridico e institucional el enfrentamiento de sistemas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tPero, con ningun pretexto pueden ocultar sus crimenes de haber llevado a la ruptura las relaciones intercoreanas cometiendo durante dos anos de su mandato el servilismo a las fuerzas extranjeras, las maniobras de provocacion de guerra anti-RPDC y el enfrentamiento de sistemas. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa realidad de dos anos pasados nos da la seria leccion de que ambas partes coreanas no pueden lograr ni el dialogo ni la mejora de las relaciones bilaterales mientras las autoridades surcoreanas no retiren su politica de enfrentamiento anti-reunificacion."
