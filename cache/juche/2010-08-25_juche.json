            "content": "Rodong Sinmun condena \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\"\r\nPyongyang, 25 de agosto (ATCC) -- Ahora los belicistas norteamericanos y surcoreanos insisten en que el simulacro militar conjunto \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" es para \"revisar la disposicion de defensa y reaccion\" de las \"fuerzas aliadas\" EE.UU.-Sur de Corea y no se trata de ejercicio movil sino un \"entrenamiento de los puestos de mando\".\n\t\t\t\t\t En un comentario individual del dia 25, el periodico Rodong Sinmun afirmo que distan mucho de ser \"defensivos\" los ejercicios \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" porque se movilizan en ellos demasiados medios y fuerzas de ataque.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Si se toma en cuenta la dimension, el contenido y el caracter de \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\", esta maniobra es de punta a cabo el ensayo de guerra total y nuclear de mayor dimension en la historia para agredir a la RPDC, senala asi el comentarista y continua:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Despues de su aparicion, la administracion Obama hablo mucho del \"mundo sin armas nucleares\" y fingio como si estuviera \"interesado\" en la desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, la situacion actual demuestra fehacientemente que no pasan de ser una hipocresia el proyecto de construccion del \"mundo sin armas nucleares\" y la \"desnuclearizacion de la Peninsula Coreana\", de que hablan tanto los gobernantes norteamericanos.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los imperialistas yanquis tratan de presionar y amedrentar militarmente a la RPDC librando \"Ulji Freedom Guardian\" a modo de \"manifestacion de las fuerzas armadas\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Pero, el ejercito y el pueblo de Corea no quedaran sorprendidos jamas ante tal fanfarroneria de los belicistas.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Un Estado soberano tiene el derecho independiente a la autodefensa.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t  Los belicistas internos y externos deben suspender de inmediato sus inutiles ejercicios belicos sin equivocar el poderio espiritual y fisico del ejercito y el pueblo de Corea."
