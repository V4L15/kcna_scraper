            "content": "U.S. and S. Korean Warmongers' DPRK-Targeted War Exercises Assailed \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 25 (KCNA) -- A spokesman for the Korean National Peace Committee released a statement on Sunday to denounce the U.S. and south Korean warmongers for staging the DPRK-targeted RSOI and field mobile exercise in south Korea defying strong protest. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The launch of the above-said war maneuvers is a product of deliberately planned and systematic moves of the U.S. and south Korean bellicose forces to prevent the desire for peace and reconciliation from growing stronger and escalate tension on the Korean Peninsula in a bid to frustrate the process of dialogue and peace and, furthermore, ignite a war, the statement said, and continued: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said RSOI and field mobile exercise is an extension of the moves to provoke a war against the DPRK and an extremely dangerous preliminary war, a test nuclear war before going over to an actual war. This saber-rattling just launched behind the curtain of \"dialogue\" and \"peace\" is a very rude act proving their utter lack of good faith and courtesy and an unpardonable perfidy to the dialogue partner. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This clearly indicates that the U.S. and south Korean authorities' talk about \"dialogue\" and \"improved relations\" is nothing but hypocrisy and they are still persisting in their hostile policy toward the DPRK and confrontation with it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The army and people of the DPRK will bolster the self-defensive deterrence for defending the dignity and sovereignty of the Korean nation to cope with the provocative moves of the U.S. and south Korean warmongers for a war of aggression against it. If the aggressors ignite a war on this land, the army and people of the DPRK will resolutely retaliate against them with merciless deadly blows. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. would be well advised to stop at once its reckless war exercises against the DPRK, which are harmful to the settlement of the nuclear issue and peace of the Korean Peninsula and driving the situation to a phase of confrontation and war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The south Korean authorities should immediately halt their criminal acts of participating in the war moves of the outside forces against the Korean nation and peace, well aware that their involvement in the outside forces-led saber-rattling against the fellow countrymen is a treacherous act of driving the inter-Korean relations to a collapse in violation of the June 15 joint declaration.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

This suggests that they have no interest in dialogue, peace and detente and are still pursuing their ambition to stifle the DPRK by force of arms. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is necessary to create the atmosphere of peace and trust for dialogue in order to give smooth continuity to the process for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n However, the U.S. and the south Korean authorities are staging adventurous exercises for a war of aggression, seriously threatening the DPRK by force, beclouding the atmosphere of the talks and driving the situation in the Korean Peninsula and the Asia-Pacific region to the brink of a war. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n This may entail such serious consequences as escalating the tension between the DPRK and the U.S. and scuttling the six-party talks for the settlement of the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula arranged with so much effort. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Noting that the DPRK is ready for both war and dialogue, the commentary stresses that it is the spirit and independent mode of counter-action of the Songun Korea to react to force with force and counter any provocation with merciless deadly blows.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

The questionnaire asked, and continued: An attitude towards the joint declaration is a touchstone discerning the fundamental stand on the inter-Korean ties and reunification. The GNP should, first of all, clarify whether it stands for the declaration or against it. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n  The document assailed the GNP for blustering recently that it would not rule out a war and openly advocated even a \"local war\", zealously supporting outside forces' racket against the DPRK over the nuclear issue. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP should apologize to the nation for making such war cry before trumpeting about \"peace\" and assure it that it would not repeat such reckless remarks, it stressed. The GNP talked about \"contact\" and \"cooperation\" with the DPRK, while opposing the repeal of the \"National Security Law\" which labels compatriots an \"enemy,\" the questionnaire noted, demanding it clarify its stand on whether it is in a position to deal with the DPRK.

The GNP would be well advised to properly know what an \"internal affair\" is and say what it should do to the outside forces which have actually meddled in the internal affairs of south Korea, keeping it under their occupation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Dismissing the GNP touted \"switchover in its policy towards the north\" as an artifice to tide over its crisis and escape isolation, the questionnaire noted: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The nature of the GNP can never change in view of its origin, its membership and its inherent nature. With nothing can the GNP cover up its true colors as a pro-U.S. traitorous party and a party advocating confrontation with the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The GNP had better stop working hard to mislead the people's mind-set and public opinion with such poor charade which can convince no one.

In doing so they seek a sinister political purpose to quell the struggle of their countries for freedom and human rights on one hand and destabilize the progressive countries on the other. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Rodong Sinmun today says this in a signed article. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists' loudmouthed theory on \"protection of human rights\" is nothing but sophism intended to beautify the reactionary and unpopular capitalist society, a move to slander and destroy socialism and a political lever for wantonly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and trifling the destiny of other nations. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It is a very important issue at present to roundly expose and frustrate the imperialists' moves to justify their theory on \"protection of human rights\" in a bid to achieve a sinister purpose. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The issue of human rights can be properly settled only when one has a viewpoint of putting human beings, the popular masses who are the most precious beings in the world at the centre of everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n What the people like precisely represents the fair and absolute standards of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Human rights, in essence, mean the independent rights of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The imperialists have preached that abstract rights for super-class rights are \"human rights\", while advocating the \"right to freedom\", \"right to equality\" and \"right to property\" of individuals only. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n If the issue of human rights is to be properly settled, it is necessary to firmly protect the sovereignty of a country and nation and enforce benevolent politics. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is of special importance in properly settling the human rights issue at present. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Songun politics is efficient politics for averting the imperialists' war and aggression and defending human rights. This powerful weapon can be built only when tremendous military muscle is secured. Songun is a prerequisite to and reliable guarantee for the protection of human rights. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In order to fully solve the human rights issue, it is important not to allow the reactionary moves to infringe upon the interests of the popular masses. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n No matter how persistently the imperialists slander socialism, they can never distort and defame the progressive nature and advantage of socialism nor can they chill the people's ardent aspiration and longing for socialism.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

Korean Joint Landing Exercise Disclosed at Local Court \r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pyongyang, March 24 (KCNA) -- Ri Kyu Jae, chairman of the South Headquarters of the National Alliance for the Country's Reunification (Pomminryon), and others reportedly disclosed the aggressive nature of the south Korea-U.S. joint landing exercise, which was staged in Manripho last year, at the Taejon District Court on March 16. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n That day the court held a trial of members of civic and public organizations such as the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and the People for Achieving Peace and Reunification after persecuting them on charge that the press conference held by them in protest against the joint landing exercise at that time was \"interference in officials' performance of special duty.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The speakers at the court held that the exercise was aimed to round off the preparations for landing operations on the West coast to secure strong points from which to attack the north, pursuant to \"OPLAN 5027-04.\"  It is none other than the commander of the south Korea-U.S. \"combined forces\" and the minister of \"National Defense\" who should stand trial as they commanded the illegal joint landing exercise for aggression, they charged. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Meanwhile, members of the Pomminryon South Head quarters and the People for Achieving Peace and Reunification held a press conference in front of the Taejon District Court and denounced the projected south Korea-U.S. RSOI and Foal Eagle joint military exercises.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
