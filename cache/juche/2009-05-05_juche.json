This fully disclosed the Lee group's treacherous design to destroy all the organizations for the reunification movement in south Korea. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As the reality indicates, if the group of traitors is allowed to go scot-free while resorting to the fascist suppression of those organizations it is quite impossible to implement the north-south joint declarations nor is it possible to settle the deteriorated north-south relations.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The Lee Myung Bak group would be well advised to halt at once the fascist crackdown upon the above-said organizations and the patriotic personages, bearing in mind that its moves to strengthen the fascist rule under the signboard of \"pragmatism,\" going against the trend of the times, are little short of adding to its crimes committed against the nation."
