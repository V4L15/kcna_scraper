This outlook on future is clarified in the work \"Let us live today not for the present but for the future\" published by leader Kim Jong Il.\r\n Rodong Sinmun yesterday devoted an article to the fifth anniversary of its publication (January 14, 1996).&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Expounded in the work is the idea that everyone should devote himself to the future of the homeland and the happiness of the generations to come though he fails to enjoy a happy life, and should live and work always optimistically full of firm confidence in the victory of the revolution, the article said, and went on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A revolutionary should live today not for the present but for the future as taught by Kim Jong Il. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The revolutionary people should have a noble outlook on future. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Revolution is a struggle for the future. Only when the people have outlook on future can they advance along the road of revolution to the last and defend and glorify socialism in any adversity. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Korean people experienced unprecedented ordeals and difficulties in the past years. The imperialists' moves to stifle Korean-style socialism reached the extremes and  natural disasters continued. The Korean people had to overcome food shortage and untold hardships beyond imagination. And they had to proceed to production and construction under the condition in which they were hard pressed for everything. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n But they did not hesitate nor waver in the \"arduous march.\" &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n as they had outlook on future, they cast in their lot with the country in hard trials and displayed devotedness and self-sacrificing spirit to defend and glorify socialism. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They are now working hard under the uplifted banner of faith \"let's always be cheerful although our path is thorny \"    \r\n\r\n"
