We can not but brand them as a group of traitors who are utterly indifferent to the nation's destiny. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The obtaining situation urges the Korean nation to hold higher the banner of army-based policy so as to defend the dignity, security and the interests of the nation. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Only by upholding the army-based policy can the country and the nation carve out their destiny, defend them and ensure the co-existence, common prosperity and the common interests of the north and south of Korea. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n How to approach the army-based policy is a touchstone which distinguishes patriotism from treachery. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Under the present situation where the north and south of Korea are exposed to a serious threat from the U.S. all the Koreans who are truly concerned about the destiny of the nation are called upon to support the patriotic army-based policy as it guarantees peace and security on the Korean Peninsula.    \r\n\r\n"

It also serves as an immortal militant banner encouraging the young soldiers to glorify their youth together with rifles, deeply conscious of the mission they have assumed before the times as a main force in the era of the army-based policy. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n O Song Il, first secretary of the KPA Committee of the Kim Il Sung Socialist Youth League, made a report at the meeting, which was followed by speeches. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The reporter and speakers referred to the tasks facing the youth league organizations and officials in charge of the youth work in the KPA to more thoroughly carry out the idea and policies of the party on the youth movement as required by the era of the army-based policy, deeply conscious of the noble mission they have assumed for the party and the revolution.    \r\n\r\n"

Not content with this, it is escalating its pressure upon the DPRK, impertinently claiming that dialogue will be possible only after the latter's scrapping of its nuclear weapons program, the statement noted, and said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The United States is hellbent on the nuclear racket against the north of Korea, misleading public opinion. Such moves are intended to shift the blame for the breach of the DPRK-U.S. agreed framework on to the DPRK. Through this the U.S. seeks to hold in check the favourably developing inter-Korean relations and DPRK-Japan relations, break the framework of stability, friendship and cooperation in the Korean Peninsula and Northeast Asia and, furthermore, find a pretext to justify its possible nuclear war against the DPRK. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n A solution to the nuclear issue on the Korean Peninsula at present is to conclude a non-aggression treaty between the DPRK and the U.S., as proposed by the former. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The conclusion of the treaty, not such argument about \"dialogue after the scrapping of the nuclear program\", is the best choice and way for improving the DPRK-U.S. relations and solving the problem of the Korean Peninsula. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The U.S. should stop its reckless nuclear racket against the DPRK at once and accept the latter's proposal for the conclusion of the treaty immediately and unconditionally. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Ri Hoe Chang, a pro-U.S. flunkeyist traitor chiming in with Bush's brigandish anti-DPRK nuclear smear campaign, should not act rashly but quit the political arena. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The NDFSK and patriotic people in South Korea will wage a more vigorous and nationwide anti-U.S. struggle to smash the U.S. moves for stifling the DPRK and establish sovereignty throughout Korea. If the U.S. unleashes a war against the north at last, they, together with the brothers and sisters in the north, will drive out the aggressors and achieve the historic cause of national liberation.    \r\n\r\n"
