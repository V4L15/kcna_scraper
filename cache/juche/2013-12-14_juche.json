Having short and uncomfortable sleep and eating rice balls, he ceaselessly made long and difficult journeys to inspect the front, forefront posts including Panmunjom and Mt. Osong. He thus consolidated the defence line of the country as firm as a rock and decisively foiled confrontation hysteria of the warmongers.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t He provided the north-south summit and the June 15 joint declaration for the first time in the more than half a century-long history of national division just before the beginning of the new century and ushered in the era of independent reunification in which the Korean nation advanced, guided by the idea of \"By our nation itself\". This is the great feat of national historic significance performed by him for the cause of national reunification.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The dynamic advance of the era of independent reunification and the adoption of the October 4 declaration, a programme for implementing the June 15 joint declaration, under the reliable protection of the Songun politics helped lay a foundation for putting the cause of national reunification on a high stage."

Against this backdrop even the religious circle rose up in a protest action.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Religionists belonging to religious orders including Catholic, Christian, Buddhism, Chondoism and Round Buddhism staged a large- scale rally for issuing a declaration on the situation in protest against the present conservative \"government\" which seized power through a fraudulent election. Their action was followed by a mass on the situation, a prayer meeting and a candlelight struggle.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Religionists' actions took place in different parts of south Korea including Seoul and Kwangju more than 40 times with 50 000 people attending. They sent shivers down the spine of the puppet regime.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Voices denouncing the ruling forces for seizing power and calling for probing the truth behind the election rigging were heard from the \"funeral for the IS\" and the demonstration staged by members of the Solidarity for Progress and the Bar Association for Democratic Society, a mammoth rally of youth and students and the venues of the signature campaigns conducted by the Council of Professors for Democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The waves of dynamic actions against the Park regime's moves to revive \"yusin\" fascist rule swept across south Korea.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t This year witnessed ceaseless huge meetings, demonstrations and strikes to win back freedom and rights.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Scholars of the Society for History Studies and the Institute for Study of Historical Affairs and members of the Committee of the Students under the Democratic Party and the Committee of the Youth and Students under the Justice Party of south Korea condemned the Compilation Committee for the State History for screening and passing the history textbook written by neo-conservative-lining scholars who embellished dictators including Syngman Rhee and Park Chung-Hee and distorted and downplayed the movement for democracy.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Civic and public organizations including the Solidarity for Progress, the Association for Supporting Prisoners of Conscience of the Family Movement for Realizing Democracy and the People's Solidarity for the Repeal of the \"Security Law\" formed the All-People Measure Committee for coping with the puppet regime's moves to close newspaper Jaju Minbo and waged a dynamic struggle for protecting progressive media.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t As seen above, south Korea this year witnessed the manifestation of the unanimous desire and actions of the south Korean people to put an end to the fascist dictatorial rule and lead a free and worthy life that shook the puppet conservative regime to its very foundation."
