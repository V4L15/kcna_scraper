He strongly protested against the court's penalty.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The North Headquarters of Pomminryon in a statement on Thursday branded the action taken by the Lee Myung Bak group as a hideous act of inciting the confrontation with compatriots and a crime against reunification as it is intended to arrest the national movement for reunification and mercilessly violates even the elementary rights of human beings.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The puppet group's harsh suppression of leading members of the South Headquarters on charges of \"enemy-benefiting activities\" is nothing but its last-ditch efforts to completely stamp out the headquarters standing in the van of the actions for social democracy and the movement for reunification and thus weaken the forces of the reunification movement and prolong its remaining days, the statement said, and went on:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The group took this action at a time when it was kicking up a frantic reactionary burlesque such as campaign for \"eliminating the forces following the north\" in which the north is regarded not as compatriots but as \"an enemy\" and not as a partner for reunification but as a target of rejection. This more clearly shows what the group is seeking through this racket. \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t Lurking behind this is a sinister aim to direct the spearhead of fascist crackdown to the organizations and personages of the reunification movement including the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and create a terror-ridden atmosphere throughout society in a bid to realize its ambition to stay in power through the up-coming \"presidential election.\" \n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t The statement urged the Lee group to abolish the \"Security Law\", an evil law against human rights and reunification, immediately release the pro-reunification figures including the unreasonably detained members of the South Headquarters of Pomminryon and guarantee the freedom of activities for reunification."

            "content": "Direccion Nortena de APRP denuncia represion a entidad homologa del Sur\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\r\nPyongyang, 14 de junio (ACNC) -- Hace poco, la banda del traidor surcoreano Lee Myung Bak sentencio a duras penas a los integrantes principales de la Direccion Surena de la Alianza Pannacional por la Reunificacion de la Patria (APRP) por los absurdos cargos de la \"infiltracion y fuga\" y la \"posesion de materiales proenemigos\", aunque ella no hizo otra cosa que debatir con frecuencia el tema de reunificacion con la entidad homologa del Norte (RPDC).\n\t\t\t\t\tPor otra parte, detuvo y encarcelo al jefe de la Redaccion del organo de esa entidad \"Ruta de la nacion\", quien habia participado como observador en ese juicio y protestado fuertemente tal fallo cruel, por los cargos de \"insulto al tribunal\" y \"elogio y estimulo al Norte\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl respecto, el portavoz de la Direccion Nortena de la APRP publico el dia 14 una declaracion que sigue:\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tTal proceder de la banda de Lee es un crimen anti-reunificacion que busca el enfrentamiento fratricida entre ambas partes coreanas, sofoca el movimiento nacional por la reunificacion y viola hasta los derechos elementales del hombre.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tAl reprimir brutalmente a los miembros principales de la Direccion Surena de la APRP, los traidores surcoreanos quisieron desintegrar esa entidad al frente del movimiento por la democratizacion de sociedad y la reunificacion, debilitar a las fuerzas partidarias de reunificacion y alargar los dias contados de su vida politica.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tEspecificamente, esa embestida coincide con la reaccionaria campana de \"purga de las fuerzas pro-Norte\" que se lanza en el Sur de Corea definiendo al Norte de Corea no como connacional y contraparte de reunificacion sino como \"enemigo\" y blanco de rechazo.\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa siniestra intencion de la banda de Lee consiste en desatar panico en toda la sociedad surcoreana al dirigir la flecha de represion fascista a la Direccion Surena de la APRP y otras entidades y personalidades luchadoras por la reunificacion y favorecer asi su retoma del poder en las proximas \"elecciones presidenciales\".\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\tLa camarilla de Lee tiene que abolir la infame \"ley de seguridad\" anti-DDHH y anti-reunificacion, liberar de inmediato a los integrantes de la Direccion Surena injustamente encarcelados y otras personalidades pro-reunificacion y garantizar la libertad de las actividades de reunificacion."
