It is styling itself as the \"only superpower\". And it is almost monopolizing nuclear weapons. Its military strength is said to be the strongest in the world. The DPRK and the United States are several thousand miles away from each other with the Pacific Ocean in between. Those with reasonable thinking faculty would not say the DPRK poses threat to the United States.\r\n   The United States has continued intelligence activities against the DPRK. Recently, it was disclosed that a U.S. agent bugged a telephone of a member of a DPRK mission abroad. Worse still, the U.S. is raising the DPRK's abandonment of \"terrorism\" as a prerequisite to the total lifting of sanctions.\r\n   We have nothing to do with terrorism and have long been opposed to any terrorist act.\r\n   The U.S. demand for the DPRK's abandonment of \"terrorism\" means that it would not totally lift the sanctions.\r\n   To mistrust and antagonize the partner while crying for the improvement of relations with it is not the stand to improve the relations.\r\n   If the United States truly wants to improve the relations with the DPRK, it should discontinue mistrusting and antagonizing the DPRK and take a step for confidence building first of all.    \r\n \r\n"
