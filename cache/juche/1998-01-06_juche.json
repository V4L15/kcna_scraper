It is styling itself as the \"only superpower\". And it is almost monopolizing nuclear weapons. Its military strength is said to be the strongest in the world. The DPRK and the United States are several thousand miles away from each other with the Pacific Ocean in between. Those with reasonable thinking faculty would not say the DPRK poses threat to the United States.\r\n   The United States has continued intelligence activities against the DPRK. Recently, it was disclosed that a U.S. agent bugged a telephone of a member of a DPRK mission abroad. Worse still, the U.S. is raising the DPRK's abandonment of \"terrorism\" as a prerequisite to the total lifting of sanctions.\r\n   We have nothing to do with terrorism and have long been opposed to any terrorist act.\r\n   The U.S. demand for the DPRK's abandonment of \"terrorism\" means that it would not totally lift the sanctions.\r\n   To mistrust and antagonize the partner while crying for the improvement of relations with it is not the stand to improve the relations.\r\n   If the United States truly wants to improve the relations with the DPRK, it should discontinue mistrusting and antagonizing the DPRK and take a step for confidence building first of all.    \r\n \r\n"

            "content": "U.S.-Japan military collusion goes over danger line \r\nPyongyang, January 6 (KCNA) -- In 1997 the U.S.-Japan military collusion was strengthened and rendered more dangerous, stresses Rodong Sinmun in an article today.\r\n   The article says:\r\n   In the year 1996, the United States and Japan set up a cornerstone of new military tieups which they call the \"joint declaration on security\" and openly cried for an expansion of the tieups, coincident with the end of the Cold War. And, in the year 1997, they built up a pillar of war, that is new \"U.S.-Japan defense cooperation guidelines\", and pressed ahead in full scale with the preparations to that effect.\r\n   The new \"guidelines\" is, needless to say, a doctrine of war that has legalized and deepened the U.S.-Japan military tieups.\r\n   It suggests that the United States and Japan may launch a joint military operation abroad \"in case of emergency surrounding Japan\". Underlying it is a scheme to enlarge the scope of overseas aggression unrestrictedly by defining, at any moment, any place outside Japan as a \"region surrounding Japan\".\r\n   Noting the moves for materializing the new \"guidelines\" were carried on at a dangerous stage last year, the article continues:\r\n   The new \"guidelines\" has already stepped into a practical stage, with the northern half of korea as its first target.\r\n   The U.S.-Japan military alliance is not \"imballanced\", but has been developing into a perfect alliance, a ballanced one.\r\n   The world's peace-loving people and the Asian people should heighten vigilance against their military collusion.    \r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
