But it has never dampened the zeal of housewives to delight the members of their families with Kimchi as tasty as ever. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Kim Myong Ae, a researcher at the Foodstuff Research Institute under the State Academy of Sciences who had invented a new functional Kimchi told KCNA that the Korean women were showing greater zeal in preserving the peculiar taste of Kimchi, a national food. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n She said: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n They regard making Kimchi as a matter of developing the national food and keeping alive national character.  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n In the pickling season every year housewives visit elders to learn the knack and experience they have attained through decades and apply new pickling methods to make Kimchi more delicious by folk ways. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Most families generally make not only whole cabbage Kimchi but also various other kinds such as red leaf mustard Kimchi, Kimchi wrapped in large cabbage leaves, hot pickling of chopped radish and radish pickled in salt water. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Nowadays mass media are extensively introducing to housewives lactic acid bacilli powder, culture fluid of lactic acid bacilli, etc for retaining the peculiar taste of Kimchi and extending its preserving period.        \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

It has already invited survivors of the sexual servitude for the Imperial Japanese Army to hear their testimonies. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Minju Joson today observes in a signed commentary carried in this regard: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The above-said issue is now under serious discussion at the European Parliament in the wake of the passage of a resolution on the issue through the U.S. House of Representatives in July last. This development goes to prove that the issue of Japan's settlement of its war crimes is raised as a task of the times the fulfillment of which brooks no further delay and has become a unanimous desire of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan, however, has worked hard to evade its responsibility for its war crimes at any cost, denying them though more than half a century has passed since its defeat in the war, the commentary notes, and goes on: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n It has become a worldwide trend in the new century for humankind to liquidate inglorious past and turn over a new leaf. It is only the Japanese reactionaries that make desperate efforts to keep Japan's past crimes buried into oblivion for good. This behavior clearly proves that they are a group of barbarians as they are bereft of even an iota of human conscience and quality. That is why Japan is isolated diplomatically, after becoming a target of derision and contempt of the international community. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n The Japanese reactionaries are, however, going so foolish as to talk about someone's \"human rights abuse\" in a bid to paint Japan as a victim. This behavior only provokes a sense of aversion among all people. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\r\n Japan's persistent efforts to evade the settlement of its past crimes would touch off stronger hatred and protest among the international community. And for this it will not escape a stern judgement of justice and human conscience.    \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
